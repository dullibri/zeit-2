HEADLINE: Washington and Tokyo Reducing Trade Tensions

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 24

 BODY:
The United States and Japan have begun to defuse the trade tensions threatening to destroy their global partnership.
Recent moves by the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to make it easier to sell American products, including supercomputers, in Japan are easing tensions and reducing the likelihood of trade retaliation this summer. American officials have reacted cautiously, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said on Friday, ''It won't ever be enough, but I think we're showing that we can make some progress.''
Mr. Brady made the comment after six hours of trade and economic talks with Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan. 
His meeting followed by a week a visit to Japan by Commerce Secretary Robert C. Mosbacher, and by three weeks the meeting in Palm Springs between Mr. Kaifu and President Bush.
 
Critic Relents a Bit
Even such a stern critic of Japan as Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Senate's trade subcommittee, found after a recent trip to Tokyo ''a recognition that the time had come to redress the grievances we had.''
The progress comes as the Japanese financial markets are going through one of the most severe shakeouts of the postwar era.
Since the start of this year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has lost a quarter of its value, and the yen is trading at its lowest levels in more than three years.
Fearful that the market weakness might spread to other financial centers, Mr. Brady yesterday went along with a request by Mr. Hashimoto to reaffirm earlier pledges to stabilize exchange rates.
Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto had scheduled their meeting as part of the preparations for the meeting in April of the finance ministers of the Group of Seven - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
 
Maintaining Confidence
Mr. Brady, a former investment banker who led a United States Government study of the October 1987 stock market collapse, said Friday, ''It is very important that these big moves go through the world financial system in a way that people can continue to have confidence and conduct business.''
A two-paragraph communique issued after the meeting signaled no policy initiatives. But it reaffirmed a working relationship between the Governments that Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto apparently hope will deter speculators.
Mr. Hashimoto sought Mr. Brady's participation in a statement of reassurance largely for domestic political consumption in Japan.
It left several questions unanswered, including whether there would be increased intervention by the Governments to bolster the value of the yen against the dollar and whether the United States would cut its interest rates to try to curb the dollar's strength.
 
Policy on the Dollar
The Treasury has expressed concern that a strong dollar will weaken American competitiveness by making United States exports too expensive. But the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have maintained that high interest rates are needed to prevent inflation, and Mr. Brady has deferred.
The Federal Reserve likes a strong dollar because it means lower priced imports and it resists lower interest rates because of fears the economy would be overstimulated and inflation aggravated.
Japanese officials made it clear that they regarded the reaffirmation of monetary cooperation with the United States as essential to continued progress on the trade front.
And Mr. Hashimoto fears his political prospects would be irreparably damaged by continued market disruptions in Tokyo, Japanese officials said.
The link between the monetary talks and the trade disputes was demonstrated when American and Japanese negotiators announced a preliminary agreement on Friday to open the Japanese Government's market to American supercomputers.
Although the accord is subject to final approval, it is likely to remove an American threat to retaliate against Japan if procurement practices were not revamped by June.
Under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, the United States has identified as priorities for investigation the Japanese market for supercomputers, satellites and wood products.
Under the statute, the President could order retaliation if the two Governments do not reach agreement by June 16 on elimination of the barriers.
American trade officials have reported some progress on forest products. The satellite sector is proving the most difficult.
 
Upholding the Law
Asked Thursday whether the United States would retaliate against Japan if the trade deadlines were not met, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, responded, ''I was sworn to uphold the law and I cannot fail to do so.''
But she said she was ''very hopeful that we will have sufficient progress,'' adding: ''It's in everyone's least interest if we close markets. It's in everyone's best interest if we make progress.''
In addition to the June deadlines, Japan and the United States are engaged in broader talks on making changes in the structure of Japanese and American society.
Known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, Tokyo and Washington are facing a mid-April deadline for an interim report on what progress is being made toward changing laws and practices that hinder efforts to reduce the United States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan last year.

HEADLINE: Eyes to Left, Democrats Edge Toward the Center

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 24

 BODY:
Two very different political visions collided here today: A group of centrist Democrats asserted that the national party must change to reclaim the support of middle-class voters, while the Rev. Jesse Jackson asserted that the American mainstream was moving toward him.
The Democratic Leadership Council, a group of elected officials who are trying to nudge the party toward the center, spent two days arguing that the party must reject the orthodoxies of the past and move toward a philosophy that emphasizes economic growth, ''expanding opportunity, not government,'' getting tough on criminals, and helping America compete in the world marketplace.
Then Mr. Jackson, the once and potential future candidate for the party's Presidential nomination, gave a liberal credo as the party's proper direction. He said his longstanding support for deep cuts in military spending, higher taxes on the rich and major new domestic spending programs were now the positions of the mainstream. 
''In 1990 the world has changed, the people are moving our way, and we are more united than ever,'' he said.
Mr. Jackson, who has clashed often with the group, and who is considered by many members to be far too liberal, asserted that he and the group now stand on common ground on many of these issues.
Officials with the council begged to differ. ''We trust that a few people in the press have a brain in their heads,'' said Al From, executive director of the group.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the new chairman of the council, said, ''While we favor tax fairness and think the middle class is overtaxed, we don't think the Democratic Party should lead with class warfare.''
The debate reflects a party groping toward the 1992 Presidential election, trying to rebuild a Presidential majority in the electoral college and a national image after losing five of the past six Presidential elections.
 
Innovation Is Emphasized
The leadership council, along with its offshoot, the Progressive Policy Institute, is trying to position itself as the innovative wing of the party that can free Democrats from the New Deal orientation and outmoded approaches of its past.
''Instead of fighting rear-guard actions to preserve programs created in the 30's and 60's, we need to recapture the bold vision and experimental spirit that is the true legacy of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson,'' Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia told the group.
The council, founded in reaction to the party's landslide Presidential defeat in 1984, is pushing a party philosophy intended to recapture the middle-class voters who deserted the Democrats in droves in the past three Presidential elections.
A ''New Orleans Declaration'' embraced here this weekend emphasizes civic obligation rather than entitlement, getting tough on criminals rather than ''explaining away their behavior,'' and implementing social welfare programs that ''bring the poor into the nation's economic mainstream, not maintain them in dependence.''
The declaration is a broad statement of philosophy and contained few specifics.
On the domestic front, the council pushes programs like national service, modeled on the G.I. Bill of Rights, in which college students would receive aid in exchange for a period of work like teaching or community service.
On the international front, the council has long taken a more hawkish approach to national security issues than has much of the party.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a leader in this group, repeated here this weekend, ''We must recognize that the collapse of Communism does not mean the end of danger in the world.''
Still, despite the group's efforts to redefine and redirect the party, it faces a ''fourth-year problem,'' as Elaine Kamarck, one of its analysts, put it. ''We start out to rethink and then the fourth year comes along and what do we do? We nominate a New Deal liberal,'' she said.
After the 1984 election, some of the council's members were prime movers in the creation of Super Tuesday, the round of early primaries, heavily concentrated in the South, which many Democrats hoped would produce a more centrist, electable nominee. The effort was widely seen as a classic example of the law of unintended consequences, providing a major boost to two of the more liberal candidates in the field, Mr. Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
 
Ways to Promote Philosophy
Now, the Leadership Council is talking about a grass-roots effort to promote its philosophy and ideas in advance of 1992, beginning with a newspaper ad campaign. ''Eastern Europe isn't the only place that needs new democratic ideas,'' as one ad declares.
Governor Clinton told the group today that it should focus more on ideas than on the mechanics of winning the White House, asserting, ''Any political resurgence depends on the intellectual resurgence of our party.''
Some of its analysts say they long for the kind of basic debate over issues and philosophy that the Republicans went through in the late 1970's when Reaganism triumphed over the more traditional wing of the party.
This sense, that the party needs that kind of debate, accounts, in part, for the group's preoccupation with Mr. Jackson, widely seen as the leader of the party's liberal wing. It invited him to speak at today's event.
Mr. Jackson demurred when pressed on any Presidential plans for 1992.
''That is not my focus,'' he said, noting that he was active in a variety of causes.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: M.I.T.;
A Lofty Experiment In Curriculum Fizzles

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Three years ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Committee on Curricula approved a 12-subject experimental program titled ''Human Contexts of Science and Technology.'' It was an attempt to make undergraduates more aware of the impact of science and engineering on society.
Now, M.I.T. administrators concede that they offered a curriculum and virtually no one came.
With two exceptions, attendance has been sparse at the 12 interdisciplinary classes offered at various times during the last five semesters on subjects dealing with ethics and social responsibility. 
Only ''AIDS: Scientific Challenge and Human Challenge'' and ''Engineers, Scientists and Public Controversies'' proved popular enough to continue, with an average of about 25 enrollees, school officials said. But two other courses - ''Automation, Robotics and Unemployment'' and ''Life and Institutions of Science'' -were canceled, said Margaret S. Richardson, assistant dean for curriculum support. After the present semester there will be no Human Contexts courses, she said.
Ms. Richardson heads the newly formed Context Support Office, which is to replace the formal courses in ethics and social issues with less formal workshops and colloquiums, research projects and lectures.
 
'Nobody's Shedding Tears'
Context is now being co-directed by Lawrence M. Lidsky, a professor in the nuclear engineering department, and Merritt Roe Smith, a professor of the history of technology. ''Nobody's shedding tears over the loss of Context subjects,'' Mr. Lidsky said.
The reason for the anemic enrollments is straightforward: Students will not voluntarily devote time to courses that do not satisfy requirements for graduation.
''What it comes down to is 'Can you offer credit that counts towards a student's degree?' '' said Lacinda R. Hummel, a junior biology major from Bloomington, Ill., who sat as a student representative on the review group.
The idea for a formal program on the scientist's social responsibility came to life through the investigations of two working groups, one from the School of Humanities and Social Science, the other from the School of Engineering. The groups devised 12 courses, both seminars and lectures.
In its July 1989 report, the Context Review Group gave several reasons for the Context Initiative, as it has become known. These included making students and instructors aware of the contexts - cultural, political, economic, environmental and ethical -within which the practice of science and engineering takes place.
''We are likely to be more effective in our professional work when we are aware of the way in which social values influence the work we usually think of as purely disciplinary,'' the report said. It added that scientists and engineers have the responsibility ''to be aware of the potential social effects of their work, so that they will be able to inform the society they serve of the likely consequences of new technologies.''
 
Redesigned Biology Course
Despite the initiative's failure as formal curriculum, it did prompt several professors to include ethical and social considerations in their otherwise technical classroom discussions. For example, Paul T. Matsudaira and Brent H. Cochran, biology professors, have redesigned the introductory course, moving its emphasis away from molecular biology to a more general view that includes population genetics, physiology and ecology.
One approach is to assign students weekly readings from publications like Science magazine and The Economist. These are discussed at recitations, whose function has traditionally been limited to expounding on material covered in lectures.
'' 'Context' is another name for real life,'' said Edward F. Crawley, an aeronautics and astronautics professor who teaches a departmental course called unified engineering. Nowadays, he begins class a few minutes early with discussions of the social and political aspects of engineering: how changes in the Soviet Union will influence the careers of students in the class; the politics of the space program; the ethical implications of compromises in design.
''Students are very interested,'' he said. ''They find it unusual that professors are willing to talk about things other than solid mechanics.''

Students Repair Storm Damage At Health Center

DATELINE: JAYUYA, P.R.

 BODY:
Thirty-six students from Columbia University and Barnard College spent spring break helping to repair a Methodist health center and camp that was severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo.
Damage at the mountaintop complex, the Bishop Fred P. Corson Health Center and Camp, was estimated at $150,000.
''The roof was blown off the chapel and all the furniture ruined,'' said the Rev. Miguel Arroyo, the pastor of the local Methodist church and the director of the camp. The hurricane, which lashed the island on Sept. 18, also destroyed the camp pool, four cabins and the roof on a large room used for meetings and dining. 
The center is in the rural barrio Mameyes de Jayuya, about 50 miles southwest of San Juan. ''It serves as a community center for the people from the barrio,'' Mr. Arroyo said.
 
Camp for the Poor
It was founded 35 years ago with grants from the Methodist Church of Philadelphia, he said. Throughout the years many groups have come from the United States to help maintain the center. The names of people from Iowa, Washington, Florida and Indiana are scratched into concrete steps and sidewalks around the complex.
A dispensary staffed by a doctor four days a week opened at the center two years ago. A nurse and a social worker also work out of the complex.
''The camp is used every summer by the Police Athletic League to bring in four groups of 100 poor city youths who stay a week,'' Mr. Arroyo said. ''At other times we use the camp for retreats by people of all denominations.''
The students arrived from New York City two weeks ago. The group, acting under the auspices of the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico, was assembled by the Rev. H. Scott Matheney, Columbia's Presbyterian chaplain, and the Rev. James Karpen, its Methodist chaplain.
 
Surprising Response
Group members raised $6,000 from campus organizations and churches in New York to buy materials and make a donation to the center. The students paid for their own transportation and did their own cooking and laundry when not wielding hammers and paintbrushes.
''I did a lot of the cooking,'' said Renee Pearl, a junior from New York City who is majoring in architecture. ''But I also painted that mural,'' she said, pointing to a painting of twigs and vines crawling up the sides and over the top of a concrete arch over the kitchen.
Matthew Kohl, from Fredonia, N.Y., who completed his undergraduate program in economics and philosophy in February, said he helped paint the health center. ''I also helped repair a roof, before I fell through it,'' he said. ''Then I had to help fix the roof again.''
Since coming to Columbia eight years ago, Mr. Matheney said, he has seen ''a growing number of students getting involved'' in charity projects like repairing the center.
''But last year I don't think we would have gotten as big a group as this,'' he said. ''This response really blew us away. We expected 15 and got more than 100 inquiries.''
Before the group from Columbia and Barnard arrived, four other groups from the United States had helped with the rebuilding. The Columbia group left on Thursday morning.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Purdue;
The Race Is On To Ready Students For Globalization

DATELINE: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.

 BODY:
As more free markets open in Eastern Europe, progress continues on the Pacific rim and Europe moves toward economic unification in 1992, Purdue is striving to keep pace by adopting curriculum changes that will internationalize the outlook and training of its students.
The program may also help faculty members, its architects say, through research with foreign colleagues.
Administrators, including President Steven C. Beering, predict that it will also benefit the companies who depend on the university for help in research, in monitoring new technology and in analyzing the economic policies of foreign countries. ''We're now teaching Japanese and Chinese at Purdue,'' Mr. Beering said. ''We have new affiliations in China and are expanding our affiliations in Europe.'' Many of the new proposals involve study abroad. 
The initial phase began when a small group of faculty members and deans from each of the university's 12 schools appointed a committee to examine the changes the school should make to meet the challenges of globalization. The first steps - planning new programs in each of the university's 12 schools - took almost two years, said D. Woods Thomas, the director of international education and research and one of the chief architects of the program.
The next step was a four-day workshop in January that brought in consultants from industry, government and education to evaluate the recommendations.
Mr. Thomas said administrators and faculty members are now reviewing the revised plans, and some proposals are already under way.
The Schools of Engineering and Liberal Arts are proposing a program under which a student can earn both engineering and liberal arts degrees. Susan Schell, Mr. Thomas's assistant, said engineering majors will add courses in foreign languages and general culture to help make them more marketable. Engineering students now have room for only 12 elective credits of the 120 required.
The School of Agriculture has suggested developing an international minor that would incorporate foreign-language training and some form of international experience.
The School of Consumer and Family Services proposes developing programs in English as a second language for foreign exchange students.
 
Exporting Education
The School of Education plans master's and doctoral programs in international studies and a network for exporting education technology to Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The School of Management will offer a new executive master's program featuring executives on both sides of the Atlantic in anticipation of European unity.
The Schools of Pharmacy, Nursing and Health Sciences are developing a graduate program in radioactive waste management in concert with the French atomic energy agency.
The School of Technology is preparing study-abroad options in Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain and extended cooperative-education programs with American multinationals and foreign companies overseas.
The School of Veterinary Medicine is creating a program in international medical studies that will include summer jobs and coordination with the Peace Corps or a similar agency.
Ms. Shell said the university would seek financing from the state for the ideas, some of which will begin this fall.

HEADLINE: Lifestyle: Sunday Dinner;
Middle Eastern, Spanish And (of Course) French

 BODY:
This is a summary of reviews of Manhattan restaurants by Bryan Miller that have appeared in The New York Times. Ratings are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have ratings. Prices are current.
 
Al Amir
Diner's Journal (Jan. 26, 1990), 1431 Second Avenue, at 74th Street (212-737-1800) - The economical menu at Al Amir, a new Middle Eastern restaurant with white marble floors and well-spaced tables, has many enticing choices. Besides the exceptional baba gannouj, hummus and lemony tabbouleh, there are specialties like marinated turnip and a fabulous Lebanese moussaka, a cold eggplant with garlic and minced onions. Arayess, another appealing appetizer, combines ground lamb, onion and cinnamon in pita bread, baked until the bread is dark and crisp. Among the entrees are charcoal-grilled baby lamb chops and grilled lemon-marinated chicken. Appetizers are $3.50 and $4; entrees, $15 to $20. Sunday dinner 5 P.M. to midnight. 
 
Alcala
**(March 18, 1988), 349 Amsterdam Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets (212-769-9600) - At Alcala, it's fun to start off at the tapas bar where the hot and cold tidbits are fresh and savory. Among the more intriguing tapas are the fried calamari, marinated anchovies and shellfish salad in an herb vinaigrette. To accompany the tapas, Alcala offers perhaps the best selection of Spanish wines in New York. Good entrees include grouper with vegetables, roasted suckling pig and crisply sauteed salmon steak with two sauces. For dessert the rich almond tart, orange flan and Catalonian cream are recommended. Appetizers are $4 to $9, entrees $14 to $19. Sunday hours are 2 to 10 P.M.
 
Gerard's Place
Diner's Journal (Feb. 2, 1990), 201 East 65th Street (212-935-8888) -Gerard Pangaud, formerly of Aurora, has opened his own restaurant where he serves French peasant cooking. The setting is spacious, with Provencal touches. As an appetizer, seared tuna encrusted with black pepper comes alongside a crepe filled with ratatouille. Another starter is stuffed pig's foot; the meat and gelatin are mixed with truffles and served with a woodsy Perigourdine sauce. Entrees include the terrific braised oxtail and the roasted cod with crispy garlic, accompanied by Brussels sprouts, cubed potatoes and beetroots. The chef also prepares ''seven-hour lamb,'' the leg slowly cooked and served with assorted beans. Appetizers are $6 to $9.50, entrees $17 to $19. Sunday hours, 4 to 9 P.M.
 
La Cite
*(Feb. 2, 1990) 120 West 51st Street (212-956-7100) - La Cite is a rococo extravaganza. It has a main dining area resembling a festively garish brasserie and a cozier grill room withessentially the same food at slightly lower prices. One of the best entrees is the golden-skinned, spit-roasted chicken with raisins, mushrooms and pearl onions. Other main course options are grilled salmon with dill vinaigrette, lamb steak with white beans, and a deftly grilled swordfish steak with homemade potato chips. There are shellfish of all sorts for starters, including excellent oysters and sea urchins. The grill features a sizzling skillet of small, sweet mussels as an appetizer. Main dining room: appetizers are $5 to $12; main courses $18 to $28. Grill: appetizers are $4.75 to $13, entrees $9.50 to $19. Sunday hours in the grill are 11:30 A.M. to 2 A.M., and 5 P.M. to midnight in the main room.
 
La Tulipe
**(Dec. 23, 1988) 104 West 13th Street (212-691-8860) - La Tulipe's appealing setting is the ground floor of a Village brownstone. There is a little Parisian-style bar up front. The chef, Sally Darr, who owns La Tulipe with her husband, John, presents some alluring and homey fare. Among the recommended dishes are the regal Parmesan souffle and fried zucchini fritters. New to the appetizer list is a Provencal pistou soup. Roast chicken with a snowdrift of buttery mashed potatoes, squab with braised cabbage and bacon, and sauteed bay scallops drizzled with brown butter are entrees worth noting. For dessert, diners won't go wrong with apple tart, or the l'ile flottante with praline sauce. Dinner is prix fixe at $62, served from 6 to 10 P.M.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Tokyo's Bubble Bursts With A Vengeance

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
''This has the feel,'' said the man from Nikko Securities, ''of a bubble being burst.''
And so it did, as what had been the world's largest and highest-flying stock market came tumbling down.
It was Japanese individual investors who had provided the last buying for the Tokyo market, urged on by the Government's decision earlier this year to let them finance a larger proportion of share purchases with borrowed money. From the end of 1989 to early this month, margin debt outstanding soared 22 percent, to $67 billion. 
And why not buy? Many Japanese citizens, dreaming of owning a decent house close to Tokyo, concluded that the only way to get the money was to speculate in stocks. ''They felt the authorities would not allow the market to fall,'' said Peter Tasker, the head of Japanese research for Kleinwort Benson.
That retail surge helped to keep the more speculative stocks rising in the first two months of 1990, even as the larger stocks were starting to weaken under the pressure of rapidly rising interest rates. But last week, the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the home of many smaller stocks, plunged 9.3 percent.
The Nikkei 225, an index of larger stocks, ended the week off 6.9 percent, at 30,372.16. The rise in Japan's discount rate on Tuesday did not help the yen, and hurt stocks. The low point was reached around midday Thursday, when the Nikkei was below 29,000 for the first time in 14 months. But with concerted central bank intervention to support the yen, share prices then began to firm. On Friday, some American institutions were said to be buying cautiously.
For the first time since early 1987, the Japanese equity market is worth less than the American one, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. Even with the gains at the end of the week, the Nikkei is down 22 percent this year in yen terms, and 27 percent in dollars. That is further than the Nikkei fell in the worldwide crash of 1987, but this crash has had little impact outside Japan, where many think it is simply a correction of Japanese overvaluation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.94 points to 2,704.28 last week, but is still up 77.03 points in March.
The good news for Japan is that despite rising interest rates, the economy and corporate profits are still growing, although at a slower rate than before.
''The economic fundamentals are still in place,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, the chief fundamental analyst and strategist at Nikko. ''You just have to get valuations back in line.'' The Nikkei still trades at 45 times forecasted profits.
There is hope that Japanese institutions, which have been heavy sellers, will buy this week, when trades count in the new fiscal year, beginning April 1. There is talk that the Government may authorize purchases by some pension funds that had been barred from the market.
One rumor smacked of desperation. Mr. Tasker of Kleinwort said there was talk of changing the accounting rules, so that an institution that loses money in stocks can keep that fact confidential.

The Tokyo stock market has caught New York on the way down. An investor who bought Japanese stocks on Sept. 4, 1987 would now be no better off than one who bought American stocks the same day. A 6.9 percent drop in the Nikkei average last week, to 30,372.16, left the total value of Tokyo's stocks slightly lower than New York's. Linkage? The Dow, while jittery, fell just 1.3 percent to 2,704.28. Donald M. Krueger, director of research at Sanyo Securities America Inc., expects the Tokyo market to regain its composure after the Japanese fiscal year ends March 31. But then, he admits, the end of the year, when financial institutions are eager to shine, was the last time he would have expected a market plunge. ''If it seems I'm looking for glimmers of hope,'' he said, ''you're right.'' 
 
 
 
7-Eleven Seeks a Friend
 
It might become the 1990's answer to the leverage binge of the 1980's: An American concern drowning in debt reaches out to a wealthy Japanese corporation for rescue. On Thursday, the Southland Corporation, whose 7-Eleven stores form the nation's largest convenience chain, agreed to sell 75 percent of its stock to the Ito-Yokado Group of Tokyo. Ito-Yokado already controls 7-Eleven Japan, with stores on many an urban sidestreet dispensing sushi, Slurpees and sugary pastries. The deal, worth about $1 billion, faces two major obstacles: Holders of the ''junk bonds'' that financed Southland's 1987 leveraged buyout are unlikely to swallow an agreement giving them maybe 22 cents on the dollar. And the Japanese fear a backlash against their acquisition of another major American company.
 
 
 
Uproar In Brazil
 
In the first full week of Brazil's radical new fight against inflation, layoffs spread, grocers accused of violating a price freeze were arrested, concerts and flights were canceled - and some prices actually fell. Brazil's new President, Fernando Color de Mello, and his Economy Minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, are also planning to trim the bloated Government bureaucracy and sell state enterprises. The wealthy are practically in revolt, but the majority of Brazilians seem to support the tough measures.
 
 
 
Banks Smile on Venezuela
 
Venezuela hopes its debt deal with United States banks works out better than Mexico's. Venezuela and its bankers reached a basic agreement Tuesday covering about $20 million in loans. An earlier deal with Mexico failed to provide new loans or reduce debt payments enough to fuel adequate growth, some economists say. With Venezuela, the banks have several options, so the impact won't be clear for months. But bankers appear more confident about Venezuela's ecomomy than Mexico's, and more likely to grant new loans. ''By the looks of things, they'll get some debt relief and may be able to patch together some sort of recovery,'' said Lance Taylor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
 
 
Supercomputer Accord
 
The United States and Japan said on Friday that they had reached an agreement to give American supercomputer makers much better access to the Japanese market. Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met on Friday to pursue further negotiations.
 
 
 
The Unified Mark
 
Just eight months after the fall of the Berlin wall, East and West Germany plan to unify their currencies. Last week, West German officials set a July 1 goal for making their mark common to both countries. Ekkehard Seigert, an economist at Deutsche Bank A.G., said that speculators are buying East German marks in anticipation of a favorable exchange rate. The West Germans have already offered to exchange East German savings at a ratio of 1 to 1. They hope that a unified currency and the end to many special benefits will slow the flow of East German resettlers. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative allies, strong proponents of reunification, won East German elections a week ago.
 
 
 
Europe's Labor in '92
 
Labor tensions loom as the European Community approaches 1992. Will competition from low-paid workers in Spain, Greece and Portugal force French and West German workers to lower their sights? Or will the European Community's social charter, as it's called, require the low-wage nations to improve their labor conditions? ''It's a north-south issue, like the difference between the United States and Mexico,'' said Gregory Schoepfle, director of foreign economic research at the United States Department of Labor. The Department co-sponsored a conference last week on these debates and the consequences for American workers. Representatives from West Germany said their workers would be as well-treated as ever. West German unions, deeply involved in corporate management and national politics, have grown and thrived even as American unions have shrunk.
 
 
 
COMPANIES
 
Deal in the Wings for UAL
 
Finally, a deal for the UAL Corporation might be ready for takeoff. The three United Airlines unions and an investor group affiliated with Coniston Partners offered $150 a share in cash, plus other paper of less certain value, on Monday. Analysts say the unions and the investors stand a good chance of ousting the chief executive, Stephen M. Wolf. Investors took a beating when a $300-a-share offer from Mr. Wolf and the pilots fell through last Octo ber. The UAL board agreed to negotiate while it searches for a better offer.
 
 
 
Adland's Sneaker Stomp
 
Want a business more perilous than bungee-cord jumping? Try advertising. Chiat/Day/Mojo created a television commercial for Reebok International Ltd. that featured two men diving from a bridge with elastic bungee cords tied to their sneakers. The one wearing Reeboks springs back into sight; all that's left of his companion is a pair of Nikes, empty and dangling. Parents complained. What if the kids attempt the same stunt? So Reebok decided to throw the commercial over the bridge and will not run it again as is. Chiat/Day/Mojo had already leaped, resigning the $40 million Reebok account in January.
 
 
 
Fixed-Price Matzohs?
 
The Justice Department thinks it has discovered one more Passover plague: overpriced matzoh. On Tuesday, a Federal grand jury indicted B. Manischewitz & Company on a criminal charge of price-collusion with competitors for at least six years. Manischewitz was founded more than a century ago by a Cincinnati rabbi of that name. The company, now based in Jersey City, dominates the market for matzoh and kosher wine. Manischewitz has denied any wrongdoing.
 
 
 
In Brief
 
President Bush nominated T. Timothy Ryan Jr. on Thursday to direct the Office of Thrift Supervision, a day after a judge ruled that the agency lacked authority to seize failing institutions.

A Federal judge dismissed almost entirely a $150 million Xerox Corporation lawsuit on Friday that accused Apple Computer Inc. of using copyrighted screen display technology.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Inflation's Still With Us
 
Inflation stays stubborn. February's rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, released last week, was higher than expected. David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said that annual inflation has stabilized at about 4.5 percent. ''That's the good news,'' he said. ''The bad news is, we are probably not going to see any break in that level until next year, at the earliest.''
 
 
 
Oil Hurts the Trade Figures
 
Record oil imports keep the nation from narrowing its trade deficit. January's deficit widened to $9.3 billion from $7.7 billion the month before.
 
 
 
Bamboo Blossoms
 
Bamboo blossoms, Asia benefits. Scientists in India said last week that they had brought forth bamboo blossoms in the laboratory for the first time. Their achievement will allow bamboo cultivation and the breeding of improved strains, to the advantage of several Asian economies. Many Asian nations depend on bamboo for building materials, household goods and high-protein livestock fodder. Bamboo has strange reproductive habits: It normally flowers and produces seeds only once, after growing between 12 and 120 years. The scientists got some bamboo cuttings to flower much more quickly in a mixture including sugar, plant growth hormones and coconut milk. Might not work in an Indian restaurant, but the bamboo evidently loved it.

HEADLINE: The Art of Luring Japanese Executives to American Firms

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
American and European corporations are hunting a rare and elusive quarry: the high-level Japanese executive willing to abandon lifetime employment with a Japanese company for speedier advancement and more money at a Western concern.
For Western companies, these executives provide perhaps the best means of establishing links to the sometimes insular Japanese business community. And the managers' understanding of the Japanese culture and economy is invaluable to foreigners trying to pry their way into the expansive market in Japan. ''We have a very good idea of what Japanese clients want,'' said one Japanese executive in Tokyo who recently joined an American investment bank. ''That is not always the same thing that American clients want,'' added the executive, who asked no to be named.
But in targeting the Japanese, these recruiters face daunting social and tactical obstacles. While Japanese executives who join Western companies can earn four times more money than they can working for Japanese concerns - not to mention getting spectacular perquisites - most are unwilling to give up the stability and job security they receive in Japan. Most large Japanese companies, after all, offer cradle-to-grave employment. They recruit graduates of the most prestigious Japanese universities and place them on carefully structured, lifelong career paths. 
''The manager every multinational corporation would like right now is a strong Japanese executive doing a responsible job for a Japanese company who has some international experience,'' said Dayton Ogden, chief executive of Spencer Stuart, a New York executive search firm. ''But given the tradition of lifetime employment, that is still a tough sell.''
Even so, multinational companies have unleashed a swarm of recruiters into Tokyo to woo these executives. In the last five years, their activities have increased ''almost exponentially,'' said Robert G. Cox, managing director of A.T. Kearney Inc., a consulting firm based in New York with an office in Tokyo since 1970. And Spencer Stuart says that revenues of its Tokyo office have tripled since it opened in 1985.
Indeed, these Western recruiters are beginning to enjoy success in Japan. Traditional attitudes about lifetime employment seem to be cracking a bit, particularly among Japanese executives who have been exposed to different employment standards and life styles in America and Europe, while working at subsidiaries of Japanese companies.
What is more, the idea of changing employers is gaining acceptance in Japan. Smaller Japanese companies with international aspirations have become more aggressive in their recruitment tactics, introducing the notion of job hopping into the culture. ''Between Japanese companies, recruiting is becoming more common,'' said one Japanese executive. ''These small but strong domestic companies need managers from larger companies, which already have global operations.'' (See box.) To guard against defections, a few big Japanese companies have acted defensively. Some are hiring American and European executives to develop Western-style human resources departments and enhanced benefits packages. For example, the Mitsubishi Corporation recently introduced incentive raises for employees in its financial services division, presumably to stem departures.
In a few cases, Japanese employers are even circumventing the strict rules that have governed advancement in the workplace. Western recruiters speak in hushed tones of an ambitious junior manager at one of the largest Japanese investment banks who was promoted over his superiors when the company learned he was getting impatient with his pre-arranged advancement schedule.
American financial service companies have been more successful than manufacturing and industrial companies in recruiting Japanese executives. That is because Western banks offer Japanese executives training, not available in Japan, that is useful back home. ''Investment banking is one area where the United States has been very strong, particularly in mergers and acquisitions,'' said Christine R. Houston, a partner at Korn/Ferry International, whose office in Japan works chiefly for Western investment and commercial banks. ''The Japanese have been a little behind in banking, so they look at jobs with American banks as valuable learning experience.''
Recruiters say recently repatriated managers are most likely to join a Western company. The best time to approach Japanese executives is about three months after they return home from an American or European assignment.
''It's very difficult for them to integrate again after being overseas, so you find many of them more willing to listen to your offers,'' said George C. Fifield, a partner with Egon Zehnder International Inc., a Swiss executive search firm with an office in Tokyo since 1973. ''They're still trying to adjust to a much smaller house and commuting longer distances. Their children are having difficulty adapting to new schools and their wife resents the renewed social and familial obligations she has in Japanese society.''
The Japanese executives most sought after by both Western and Japanese companies are 35 to 45 years old, fluent in English and experienced in international business, said T. Lee Pomeroy, a consultant with Egon Zehnder. Managers with postgraduate degrees from American universities - Japanese employers often reward their most promising employees with education abroad - are in especially high demand.
Consider Akio Katsuragi, who left his Japanese employer to join the Bankers Trust Company in New York in 1987. Mr. Katsuragi had been recruited out of prestigious Tokyo University by the Industrial Bank of Japan, which then sent him to law school at the University of Pennsylvania. When the Industrial Bank of Japan acquired the IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust Company four years ago, Mr. Katsuragi was sent to New York, its base, to learn about the subsidiary. After a year and a half, with the urging of a former colleague, he joined Bankers Trust.
''I could see 15 years ahead of me before I ever reached a truly senior level of the company, and that's very discouraging,'' he said. ''A friend of mine in a similar position to mine once compared himself to a Porsche, equipped with all the latest technology - but he's stopped dead in Tokyo traffic.'' Nevertheless, recruiters say that even executives like Mr. Katsuragi, who have considerable experience with Western employment practices, regard changing jobs as a big risk. The fear is that the move will radically and permanently change their lives.
Going back to a big Japanese company after leaving is virtually impossible. After all, Japanese tradition has been betrayed. ''You don't go from Sumitomo to Morgan Stanley to Shearson and then back to Sumitomo,'' said Mr. Ogden of Spencer Stuart. ''You're not a pariah but you're definitely regarded as in a different category.''
There are other reasons why a healthy majority of Japanese executives are unwilling to break with tradition. Takeo Kani, a vice chairman of IBJ Schroder, told of a young man who recently joined the Industrial Bank of Japan. A baseball star in college, he was offered far more money to play professional baseball in Japan than he receives as an entry- level bank employee. But Mr. Kani said the young man's primary concern was assuring himself long-term employment, which a career in professional baseball could not offer.
''Like baseball, Western companies pay far better compensation,'' Mr. Kani said. ''But they may not move you up the company hierarchy in a systematic way. If you want to move up, you have to make it happen yourself. But Japanese companies prepare a progression that will last through your life. That's security.''
That makes recruiting these managers difficult. To start with, a recruiter would be lucky to have one call returned from 10 Japanese candidates, Mr. Fifield of Egon Zehnder said. By comparsion, he said, he would expect 7 of 10 Americans to return his calls.
Moreover, Japanese employees do not take time off work to meet with recruiters or their clients, so interviews and negotiations take place late at night or on weekends. As a result, Mr. Fifield said, searches for Japanese executives take two to three times longer than searches for comparable Western executives.
''Even though it's getting easier to recruit there, in Japan the process just takes a lot longer,'' said Mr. Cox of A.T. Kearney. ''You have to drink a lot of green tea before you pop the question.''
 
 
 
HEADHUNTING FOR THE JAPANESE
Until recently, it was unheard of for Japanese companies to hire outside headhunters. Japanese conglomerates like Mitsubishi and Daiwa regularly use American recruiters to find Western managers for their offices abroad. But they have preferred handling local recruiting themselves, usually fishing candidates directly out of Japan's most prestigious universities and providing them with lifetime jobs.
There hasn't been any change of heart, but the rules of recruitment are starting to shift. Five years ago, the Tokyo Executive Search Company, a Japanese recruiting firm, conducted 80 percent of its searches for Western companies looking for Japanese executives. But the firm, which has a joint venture partnership with Ward Howell Group International, a New York-based management consulting firm, says those accounts have shrunk to 60 percent as recruitment for local companies has climbed.
Its Japanese clients tend to be smaller, expansion-minded companies. ''They can't grow their own executives to manage the new divisions and subsidiaries they want to get into, so they raid the bigger companies,'' said Max M. Ulrich, former chairman and currently an adviser to Ward Howell. Dayton Ogden, chief executive of Spencer Stuart, said that a small but growing portion of his New York-based search firm's business in Japan comes from recruiting Japanese executives for closely held or family-owned Japanese businesses. Many of these companies were formed after World War II, and their founders are now at retirement age.
Not surprisingly, the professionals most willing to consider changing companies, recruiters say, are in their 20's and 30's, younger people who have grown impatient with the rigid Japanese career track. They are drawn by the competitive salaries and the more important titles and positions offered by these small companies.
George C. Fifield, a partner at Egon Zehnder International Inc., a Swiss firm with an office in Tokyo, compares the Japanese career ladder to a python that hasn't yet fully digested its latest meal. ''You've got this bulge in there, and young people looking ahead and seeing that bulge are frustrated,'' he said. ''As long as the python has this slug moving through it, you're going to see ambitious younger employees looking for a way around it.''
American recruiters, of course, hope that the recruitment activities of smaller companies will make the practice more acceptable in Japan, particularly among the big conglomerates. ''That's where the gravy is,'' said Mr. Ogden. ''The key to becoming really successful is to break into the indigenous Japanese market and start moving these executives between Japanese companies.''

HEADLINE: California Bankers No Longer Fear Outsiders

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
For years, California bankers have been bracing for the second California gold rush. Come next January, banks from other states can expand into the state's huge and lucrative market. And bankers in the state have feared that New York giants like Citicorp, Chase and Chemical would swoop in and buy large California banks, creating continent-spanning empires.
But as the magic date draws near, it is shaping up to be a less earthshaking event than was thought when the California legislature approved the interstate banking bill in 1986. Most New York banks, weakened by problems with third world debt, can no longer afford to buy a huge California bank. And the California banks, having had five years to prepare, have armed themselves for the conflict. Like Japanese banks, they have bought up attractive independents in the state, leaving little for the New Yorkers.
''Most bankers have forgotten whatever fears they might have had at the time,'' said Howard Gould, the former California banking superintendent who is now managing director of the Secura Group, a consulting firm in Pasadena, Calif. 
Indeed, the major banks in the state, with the exception of First Interstate Bankcorp, are entering the new era in a stronger position than ever. And they are likely to have the fast-growing economy of the nation's largest state and its ringside seat on the Pacific Rim to themselves, maintaining what some consumer groups see as an oligopoly.
In fact, the California banks could end up becoming the nation's premier banks, eclipsing their rivals in New York. It is not surprising, then, that rather than 1991, attention here is focused on the new leaders of three of the state's four largest banks, who were recently appointed to replace executives who shaped those institutions for more than a decade.
At BankAmerica, the state's leading bank, Richard Rosenberg, a marketing whiz, is replacing A.W. Clausen. At Security Pacific, the state's second-largest bank, Robert H. Smith has just replaced Richard J. Flamson. At First Interstate in Los Angeles, down-to-earth Edward M. Carson is expected to reverse some policies of the expansion-minded Joseph J. Pinola. Only at Wells Fargo & Company, ruled by penny-pinching Carl Reichardt, is no change in the works.
Not everyone is convinced that 1991 will be a ho-hum affair. ''It's a sort of once-in-a-lifetime event,'' said Mr. Smith.
While New York banks may not be able to afford to buy into California, there could be mergers of equals between big banks in both states. In addition, California banks will be able to expand into other states after 1991. While they may shun the crowded New York retail market, other areas like the Southeast, might be attractive.
Some analysts believe the Japanese-owned California banks may take most advantage of that new opportunity. Never prohibited from buying California banks, Japanese banks have purchased almost all of the state's medium-sized banks and control 25 percent of its banking assets.
Despite a recent softening in the real estate market and the threat of defense spending cutbacks, California remains almost too attractive for outsiders to ignore. Citicorp, the largest New York bank, is still expected to increase its presence here. And First Interstate, reeling from loan losses, might prove to be a tempting acquisition. ''Everybody figures it will be somebody's Christmas present,'' said one investment banker.
Some super-regional banks, like NCNB of North Carolina, might also move into California. Comerica Inc. of Detroit staked its claim last September, agreeing to buy Plaza Commerce Bancorp of San Jose next year.
The 1986 California interstate banking law was the fruit of persistent lobbying for several years by the New York banks. Some consumer groups also favored the move to stimulate competition. There are more than 400 banks in California, but the four giants control about 65 percent of all deposits. Consumer groups say that California consumers receive less interest on deposits and pay higher interest on loans than in more competitive areas like New York. Yet California bankers claim they compete furiously - on service rather than rates.
But consumer advocates do not expect much change in 1991. The New York banks are not the powerhouses they once were. Although Wells Fargo has only half the assets of Chase Manhattan, its market capitalization is 20 percent higher. The strongest New York banks, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust, are not much interested in retail banking, California's main attraction.
Besides, small banks, with assets below $1 billion, are almost the only thing left to buy. And as David A. Brooks, Citicorp's executive in charge of consumer banking in the West, puts it, Citicorp would have to buy as many as 35 to 40 small banks to become as big a player as it would like in California.
Another possibility is to buy a savings and loan. Some of the state's thrifts have as much as $20 billion or more in assets - a substantial market position. But some bankers worry that a thrift's customers would leave after a takeover since they typically look for the best interest rates rather than the long-term relations that banks offer.
That leaves First Interstate, which is considered the most likely takeover candidate in the state. Established before interstate banking restrictions took effect, First Interstate operates in 13 Western states, making it easy for an acquirer to sell off pieces to help finance a purchase. Its banks in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada are performing well. But the company's results have been dragged down by loan problems in Arizona and, particularly, Texas, which it entered in 1987. The problems caused a net loss of $124.5 million in 1989.
First Interstate would be the most logical acquisition in the state for Citicorp. But both Wells Fargo and Security Pacific say they would be interested. BankAmerica is also thought to be intrigued. ''It's really a question of who is going to pull the trigger,'' said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, based here.
But analysts say everyone is afraid of pulling the trigger for fear of driving First Interstate into the arms of another bank. That could buy First Interstate time. Mr. Carson, 60, who will take over from Mr. Pinola in June, said First Interstate is ''not looking for a buyer,'' although it is not intent on staying independent ''at all costs.'' He added, however, ''if we perform the way we think we will, then it's in our shareholders' best interest to stay independent.''
Mr. Carson says that unlike his predecessor, his goal is not expansion, but to ''maximize what we've got.'' He has already cut the holding company's headcount to 200, from 500, and says he would sell off some smaller banks in states like Colorado and Wyoming to raise cash, while keeping its major banks, including those in Arizona and Texas.
The bank's recent stock offering, through which Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought a 10 percent stake in First Interstate, alleviated its capital crunch. Although the buyout firm says it will be a passive investor, analysts say it might eventually buy First Interstate itself or force its sale.
Bankamerica has undergone a similar transformation. A few years ago, suffering from huge losses from bad loans, BankAmerica was a carcass from which competitors were biting off chunks of market share. Having slimmed down, revved up marketing and put its loan portfolio in order, the bank is a feared giant again. And Mr. Rosenberg, who has headed the bank's California retailing operations since 1987 and will take over from Mr. Clausen in May, is expected to strengthen its retail banking operations in California and elsewhere in the West.
Mr. Rosenberg and most of the other top brass at BankAmerica are veterans of Wells Fargo, as is Jerry A. Grundhofer, head of Security Pacific's California bank. They have spread a style of banking throughout California that turned Wells Fargo into the state's premier bank in terms of profit growth and stock appreciation, although some analysts are now concerned by its large number of loans in troubled areas like real estate and leveraged buyouts.
The philosophy, pioneered by Wells's chairman Mr. Reichardt, is simple: Cut costs to the bone and expand by acquiring banks in one's own state, eliminating redundancies and achieving more efficiencies than buying in another state. Wells is now digesting three small banks to further bolster its market share in Southern California. ''San Diego County is bigger than the entire economy of Oregon,'' said Robert L. Joss, a vice chairman. ''Would you buy a bank in Oregon or would you try to expand in San Diego?''
If any California bank takes advantage of 1991 to move outside the state or merge with a New York bank, it is likely to be Security Pacific. Security, which has expanded into other businesses like investment banking and consumer finance, believes size is necessary for American banks to compete with giants from Japan and Europe. ''If that means being a $200 billion or $150 billion organization by merging with someone, so be it,'' said Mr. Smith, who has long been the heir apparent and had a role in shaping the bank's policies.
 
 
 
CITICORP ON THE PROWL IN CALIFORNIA
John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, has defined three strategic new markets for his bank: Western Europe, Japan and California. That leaves little doubt that the nation's largest bank plans to take advantage of the opening of the California market.
Citicorp already has more than 5,000 employees in the state, engaged in everything from corporate lending to designing automated teller machines. It boasts more credit card holders in California than any bank except Bank of America. And Citicorp, which has long emphasized retail banking, established a foothold in California in 1982 by purchasing a troubled Oakland thrift and renaming it Citicorp Savings.
But trying to turn an ailing thrift into a healthy bank was tougher than Citicorp envisioned. Citicorp Savings has assets of only $7 billion and very low profits. Many consumers and businesses in California are still not aware of Citicorp's presence. ''We're not arrogant enough to believe we're here until customers believe we're here,'' said David A. Brooks, who is in charge of consumer banking for Citicorp in the West.
But 1991 and new thrift regulations could change that. To start, Citicorp Savings will get a new name next month, Citibank Federal Savings Bank, to identify it more as a bank. Citicorp will also be able to combine back office operations of its banks and its thrifts, which could lower Citicorp Savings's costs.
And Citicorp will begin marketing banking services to its credit-card holders in the state. ''If we could just get our card base to bank with us, we'd be the largest bank in California,'' Mr. Brooks said.
But Mr. Brooks, a former vice chairman of Crocker National Bank, said the marketing campaigns won't be effective unless Citicorp has more branches. Right now, Citicorp Savings has 95 branches in the San Francisco Bay area, putting it among the top five banks and thrifts. But in Southern California, the 35 branches are woefully inadequate. ''You can't compete without bricks and mortar,'' he said. That probably means acquisitions, starting in 1991. Mr. Brooks would not comment on whether Citicorp would want to buy First Interstate Bancorp. But he did say that to become a major player in the state's largest metropolitan areas, Citicorp would prefer one or two large acquisitions to numerous small ones.
Some analysts say Citicorp, with its capital base weak and its stock depressed, is not in a great position to make such a move right now. But Mr. Brooks said if the right deal came along at the right price, it could raise the money. ''By the end of the 1990's we will be a big player in this marketplace,'' he said.

HEADLINE: All About/Composite Materials;
Light and Tough, New Materials Head for the Mass Marketing Stage

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
From the outside, today's automobiles still appear to be nearly all steel. But about 8 percent of their weight consists of composites -strong, light combinations of complementary substances. Bumpers, doors, body panels and station wagon tailgates are all commonly made from these materials. Ten years ago, the composite content was less than 2 percent; by the year 2000, some producers of composites contend, their materials will predominate.
Long used for elite tennis rackets, golf clubs and fiberglass pleasure boats, composites are poised to enter the mass market. In the last decade, uses have been found for them in areas ranging from aircraft and missile construction to artificial limbs. Next might come bridges and houses. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that composite sales will grow from $2 billion a year now to $20 billion by the year 2000.
Composites can be more stronger and more corrosion-resistant than steel and lighter than aluminum, cutting an airplane's weight by 25 percent to 40 percent. They consist of layers of fibers woven or bonded into sheets of plastic, metal or ceramics to make lightweight materials far stronger than any one of the materials alone. 
Fiberglass is one of the common composites, in which a fiber, like glass, is combined with a base material of polyester, vinyl or epoxy. Advanced composites were developed for to meet needs for higher performance, especially in the aerospace industry. They use more exotic and far more expensive materials - carbon, boron, ceramics and graphite.
Chemical companies are especially enthusiastic about the potential growth. Hercules Inc. of Wilmington, Del., has become a leader in graphite fiber composites, used primarily in aircraft. The company's annual composite sales have doubled in five years, to $150 million, and are expected to double again by 1995. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, which developed the Kevlar composite fiber for bulletproof clothing, has increased sales of composites by about 25 percent a year for the last five years.
The growth in demand for composites faces two obstacles: expense and reduced military spending. High labor expenses make advanced composites far more costly than steel or aluminum. The materials often have to be bonded and shaped by hand. Aluminum costs about $3 a pound, but an advanced composite used in aircraft costs $40 to $70 a pound, approaching the price of silver.
Military contracts account for about 45 percent of the composite market. Some manufacturers are already seeing their military business drop. Now the Pentagon's demand for composites depends on the fate of two projects: the Stealth bomber, which probably contains the most sophisticated use of composites so far, and the Navy's proposed all-composite submarine.
 
THE COMPETITION
 
Again, the U.S. May Lose an Early Lead
 Composites, like consumer electronics, could become another case of the failure of American companies to exploit their initial advantages, according to industry analysts. American companies have led in developing composite materials, but foreign chemical companies are catching up. Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. of Britain and BASF A.G. and Hoechst A.G. of West Germany are among the leading composite producers in Europe. Japanese companies including Toray Industries and the Mitsubishi Rayon Company spend at least 10 percent of their revenues from composites on research and development, more than twice the rate of their American competitors. Among the Japanese innovations are composite engine parts. American auto makers have responded with a joint venture to study composites.
Jack R. Vinson, a professor at the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials, says the Japanese Government and industry have once again coordinated their research efforts more closely than their United States counterparts. ''There is a serious threat that we will fall behind in the development of the next generation of composite materials,'' he said.
Foreign steel companies are also developing composites. In Japan, the Nippon Steel Corporation is seeing how composites could replace steel in automobiles and appliances. ''The Japanese steel companies realize that the demand for steel will gradually be replaced by the demand for composites,'' said Jonathan Aylen, a professor of economics at the University of Salford in England. ''And they are preparing for it.'' And American steel companies? Little or no research on composites, he said.
 
COST CONSIDERATIONS
 
High-Priced Materials And Lots of Labor
As long as composites remain reltively low volume and labor intensive, costs will stay high. An aircraft wing that one worker can shape from aluminum usually requires a crew of 20 for composites.
But new manufacturing processes are being developed. Composite-making machinery is ''probably the fastest-growing industry in the country,'' said W. Brandt Goldsworthy, president of Alcoa/Goldsworthy Engineering, which has developed machinery to assemble composite plies and shape them automatically. The company can build a composite airplane wing with a single equipment operator. Mr. Goldsworthy urges composite makers to adopt the sort of automation common with other materials. ''Then labor costs will shift,'' he said.
 
FUTURE USES
 
From Bridges to the Roof Over Your Head
 For some researchers delving into the uses of composite materials, all-composite autos are only the beginnings of their ambitions. Why not have composite-car commuters drive over composite bridges to reach their composite homes? First, the bridges. Some experts predict that composites will be used to string cables and lay decks across bridges, perhaps even by the year 2000. Joseph M. Plecnik, a professor at California State University at Long Beach, is already studying the idea of using composites in bridges on a grant from the Federal Highway Administration. ''A composite bridge would not have the corrosion problem you find with other materials,'' he said.
Professor Vinson of the University of Delaware said that the housing industry is likely to use composites for walls and roofs. He foresees plants that could turn out such pieces of homes, complete with insulation and wiring, for assembly on the site. No carpenters, no high labor costs. ''I think we're on the verge of a revolution in the use of composite materials,'' the professor said.
 
FIRST CHOICE IN ARTIFICIAL LIMBS
Again and again, amputees had the same complaint, John A. Sabolich said. Their artificial limbs, aluminum or plastic, were stiff and inflexible, giving them jolts with every motion or step. Mr. Sabolich, president of the Sabolich Prosthetics Research Center of Oklahoma City, decided to develop limbs made from composites - strong, lightweight, durable and springy. ''So in, say, an articial foot, it returns all the energy that the patient puts into the step,'' Mr. Sabolich said. ''It produces a step that our patients say feels more natural.'' The advantages of composites are so great that they have quickly become the first choice for artificial limbs. ''Five years ago we were not making any prosthetic devices using composites,'' Mr. Sabolich said. ''Today, 6 of every 10 patients have artificial limbs that use composite materials.'' The skin-like shells on the limbs are nearly all composites, he said.
Mr. Sabolich has used carbon-based composites for artificial fingers, legs, shoulders, hips and arms. He was not satisfied to make legs that would merely let amputees comfortably walk. ''My main objective,'' he said, ''was to produce a material that would enable disabled people to run.''
Mr. Sabolich said that the nation's 2 million amputees represent a huge potential market. His company and its major competitor, Flex Foot Inc., are both private and do not disclose sales figures.

The Complete Return on Investment

BYLINE: By GELVIN STEVENSON; Gelvin Stevenson, an economist, is a consultant to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York.

 BODY:
Behind every tract of rain forest that is cleared, every factory that is shuttered and locked and every oil-clogged beach lies an investment decision. These decisions may have paid big dividends to shareholders and other investors - they may have made certain individuals wealthier - but they also have harmed the economy, society and environment.
Traditionally, individuals and corporations have evaluated their investments only according to the financial return to the investor. But if we are to create a decent and sustainable world, we must develop a way to evaluate investments and measure their complete return. The complete return on an investment includes not only the immediate financial reward, but also the financial and physical consequences to other people, the environment and society. 
For some investments, ones that pollute the environment or destroy neighborhoods, the complete return can be very low or even negative. Such investments attack the economic and moral foundations of society, even though they may pay handsome dividends to individual investors. The greater their number, the wider their effect.
With environmental and social crises worsening, it is imperative that society shift more of its investments toward activities with high complete returns. This is not to argue for inefficiency or corporate suicide, but for a higher level of social consciousness. Indeed, such a shift is a major goal of the burgeoning movement for socially responsible investing - in the securities of public and private companies, and in the projects of nonprofit organizations.
The movement is growing. Already, $450 billion in pension funds, endowments and foundations is subjected to screening that limits investments to socially responsible companies. In addition, many investors are taking more direct routes to influencing corporate behavior, including persuasion, proxy fights and product boycotts.
A growing number of religious investors, funds, foundations and individuals are also investing in nonprofit, community-based organizations that provide high complete returns but low financial returns. These organizations are doing good, but are not enriching their investors very fast. The Creative Investment Program of the Presbyterian Church Foundation, for example, is the largest of the 50 or so religious investment programs and has more than $8 million to invest. Together, these religious foundations have committed more than $30 million to nonprofit institutions that serve human needs. These foundations make safe loans, at below-market interest rates, to organizations that attempt to achieve positive social goals.
When I was working at the Presbyterian Church Foundation, helping them invest their money, one of my favorite projects was the purchase of the loans of five neighborhood housing service partnerships around the country. These purchases allowed the housing organizations to make new loans to residents who were otherwise considered ''nonbankable.''
A typical home improvement loan from the neighborhood partnership went to a disabled man and his 87-year-old mother who lived on Social Security in Richland Center, Wis. They borrowed from the partnership to replace their water heater, repair their leaky roof and insulate their home. The total return to the Presbyterian Foundation for supporting this organization was only 4.5 percent - about the rate of inflation. But the complete return was much higher. Another aspect of socially responsible investing is to inject capital directly into emerging companies that have a social purpose. While risky, such investments may even provide a high financial return. One company I am working with is developing pollution control products while another is developing alternatives to cooling systems that deplete the ozone layer. The return to society that these companies offer - if they are successful - makes investing in them worth the risk.
Even though social investing is growing, the allure of quick profits and a high rate of return - no matter what the social cost - remains. But we have a choice. We can we reject investments that damage the environment and the social fabric of our country voluntarily, or we can have these investments limited by legal means. Either way, we have no choice but to limit investments that pay poor social returns. Nothing less is at stake than the decency of our society, the vitality of our economy and the ability of our planet to sustain life.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Good Day for Bottom Fishing

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Skittish investors should stay out of today's ''junk bond'' market. But conditions are ideal for ''bottom fishers,'' the hardy souls with a strong tolerance for risk who scout for bargains in the ruins. And, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser, closed-end funds are the best bargains in today's junk market.
Prices of closed-end funds, which trade on major exchanges like common stock, are set by supply and demand, with fund shares trading at a premium or discount to the value of the bonds in their portfolios. Because of the battering taken by the junk bond market, many closed-end junk funds are trading at prices lower than the value of the bonds in their portfolios. And because many of the bonds held by the funds have been discounted, too, some funds are selling for what Mr. Herzfeld calls a ''double discount.'' 
Many of the closed-end junk bond funds came to market in the last two years and prices have fallen on each wave of bad news: the RJR Nabisco downgrade, the fall of Campeau, the Drexel bankruptcy. Some prices now are down more than 50 percent. ''When sellers panic, the odds are tipped in favor of the buyers,'' said Mr. Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end fund investment and analysis.
Of course, not everyone thinks closed-end junk funds are such good deals. Some analysts, worried that prices on publicly traded junk bond funds will fall even more, still warn investors to stay away. They say that even if the economic picture is brighter than it was late last year, when the junk market collapsed, many junk bond issuers may still have trouble repaying debt because of industry or company-specific problems.
But there are bargains in closed-end funds for investors who like risk, analysts say. Mr. Herzfeld said the best deals are funds that hold about 30 to 40 percent of junk bonds. That is because some investors who usually buy investment-grade funds got sloppy and bought funds that had some junk; when they realized that, they dumped their shares. That depressed the prices of funds with only moderate amounts of junk.
As a result, paradoxically, prices are now lower for funds that hold higher-quality issues than for those loaded with junk. Right now, Mr. Herzfeld likes Prudential Strategic Income Fund Inc. Managers of the fund, which sells near a 6 percent discount, have announced a meeting this summer to consider converting to an open-end mutual fund. Management supports that, Mr. Herzfeld said, so it's likely to pass. If it does, investors who bought the fund at a discount pick up a bonus: the difference between the discount and the full net asset value of their shares.
Because of their big discounts, he also likes Putnam's Master Income Trust and Master Intermediate Income Trust.
Andrew A. Davis, an associate analyst with Paine Webber, favors the Oppenheimer Multi-Sector Income Trust, which holds about one-third of its portfolio in junk bond issues. The fund came to market at a premium in January 1989 but pulled back from the junk market soon afterward, a move that Mr. Davis calls ''tremendous foresight.'' But because it halved its junk bond holdings, the fund had to cut its dividend and the price of its shares fell to a discount.
For investors who believe that the junk bond market will rebound strongly, Mr. Davis recommends Van Campen Merritt's Limited Term High Income Trust. The fund is fully invested in junk bonds and management says the bonds in the portfolio were culled from the higher-quality issues in the junk bond market. And because the fund's dividend was cut late last year, another dividend cut is not likely soon, Mr. Davis says.
But do-it-yourselfers looking for bargains in closed-end junk bond funds should be careful. ''You've got to get in there and get your hands dirty to evaluate the investment,'' Mr. Davis warned. Analysts say investors should investigate the quality of the issues held by a fund. But that's easier said than done, especially in the wake of Drexel's demise and the market's upheaval. And the declining market makes it even harder: The junk bond group as a whole is now prone to overvaluation by fund managers, Mr. Herzfeld said. Investors interested in closed-end junk bond funds should find out how the fund's manager values the portfolio.
Today's queasy market makes the quality of the issues in a portfolio all the more important. Funds that buy top-grade junk bonds, of course, usually perform better than those holding more distressed ones. You can get this information by speaking to the stockbroker who sold you the fund or by calling the fund's management, Mr. Davis said.
Over all, analysts say, if you feel a closed-end junk bond fund is a bargain when it sells at a 10 percent discount, wait until the discount hits 15 percent to compensate for the possibility that the manager overvalued the bonds in the portfolio.
For his part, Mr. Herzfeld buys bond funds when they trade at a discount that is at least 3 percentage points wider than their average discounts - as long as similar funds are trading at a smaller discount.
 
 
 
CHOOSING YOUR MIX
In today's tumultuous markets, not everything works out as planned. Investors who hoped to capture fat gains from ''junk bond'' funds, for example, were sorely disappointed.
But, investors seeking safety may want to look at middle-of-the-road mutual fund offerings, which are delivering just what they promise. There are two types. A ''balanced'' fund mixes stocks and bonds in a ratio that depends on the manager's reading of the investment climate. The manager of a ''convertible security'' fund chooses corporate securities, usually preferred stock or bonds, that can be converted to common stock at a set price. Neither type gives investors the sometimes-sizzling returns of a stock fund, but they perform better than bond funds.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
More on Mexico's Debt

BYLINE: By ENRIQUE VILATELA; Enrique Vilatela, an economist, is assistant secretary for external financing at the Mexican Ministry of Finance.

 BODY:
The complex nature of the debt agreement negotiated between Mexico and its creditor banks last month has led to some confusion regarding its implications for Mexico's economy.
Debt relief that results from the agreement derives from reductions in the principal amount of close to $7 billion. The interest reduction option gives Mexico additional savings of approximately $800 million a year for the next 30 years, which is equivalent to a principal reduction of around $8 billion. Thus the total debt relief package negotiated this year is equivalent to approximately $15 billion. If these numbers are added to the $5 billion in debt reductions negotiated in 1989, Mexico's total foreign debt drops to approximately $80 billion from $100 billion at the beginning of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's term in December 1988. 
The objective of the Mexican debt relief package was to reduce Mexico's debt. It has now been successfully implemented. As a result, some of the same banks that chose the principal or the interest reduction options are now also willing to consider giving new money to Mexico in the form of trade lines of credit and project financing.
Clear political leadership, fiscal discipline and sound and consistent economic policies make Mexico a much more promising and safer place in which to invest. No valid economic analysis of Mexico can be made by mixing up the financial and tax motivations of the bankers who chose not to give new loans in the package, with the motivations of the business executives who seek, and find, political stability, controlled inflation rates, competitive labor costs, adequate infrastructure, promotional legislation and an advantageous geographic location in an open and export-oriented country. Banks do not lend money to developing countries because of the unstable economic conditions derived from unrealistic economic policies.
Investors are now finding excellent conditions to develop new industries. For example, one might look at the impressive growth in the maquiladora programs. Investment in these assembly and manufacturing plants along the border with the United States has been growing 20 percent a year.
Mexico is facing the last years of the century with great expectations and optimism. For the first time in years, Mexico has the chance to develop and to play a major role in the world economy and, gradually, to improve the quality of life of its population. Mexico will not pass up this opportunity.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: THRESHOLD OF PAIN;
Will All This Tax Talk Lead to New Taxes? (Hint: It Usually Does)

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, prominent Congressmen are proposing higher taxes and President Bush is reading their lips. Almost overnight, a Federal tax increase seems possible.
Does that mean people should brace for a reversal of the Reagan years? One answer is that there is nothing to reverse. Taxes rose all through those years, notwithstanding Mr. Reagan's enshrinement as a tax cutter.
What was eliminated in Federal taxes crept back in many local ways - higher property taxes, sales taxes, bridge tolls, garbage disposal fees, state income taxes - and in not-so-local ways, like a big increase in Social Security taxes. And the decade ended as it began, with Americans still paying out in taxes 22.3 percent of their total income, according to the Commerce Department. 
The question, then, is not whether a tax increase is in the wings. One always is. The questions are who will levy new taxes - the Federal Government or the hard-pressed states and cities or all of the above - and what new inequities, real or imagined, will be created among classes of taxpayers.
The issue is a hot one now, in large part because the economy has slowed and is thus generating less tax revenue. Since Americans usually resist efforts to wean themselves from many public services, much of the talk lately is of higher taxes rather than cuts in spending.
Even economists who favor spending cuts as a means of eliminating the Federal budget deficit argue that tax increases are also needed to do the job.
''We are an extremely rich country,'' said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an advocate of a balanced budget. ''The question is whether we are raising enough to cover the public expenditures that bipartisan majorities insist the nation requires. And we aren't.''
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a big voice in this debate, and like many others, he abhors the budget deficit, which is still more than $100 billion a year. What he proposes reflects the mix of taxes and spending cuts now becoming popular. He would freeze most domestic spending for a year, to save $105 billion. He would cut military spending by $150 billion over five years. He would increase taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline, to raise $100 billion a year, and increase the tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, whose incomes have grown faster than their taxes, to bring in $44 billion. Finally, he would put off increases in Social Security payments for a year.
Governors and mayors have their own plans for higher taxes as they seek to offset the losses resulting from a weak economy - without having to cut back sharply on programs undertaken during the boom years of the 1980's.
The squeeze is especially painful in the Northeast. Mayor David N. Dinkins is drawing fire for suggesting an increase in New York City's real estate taxes. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would cancel a planned New York State income tax cut for the wealthy and raise taxes on telephone calls and gasoline - proposals that aren't helping his popularity. And Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut announced last week that he will not run for a third term, in part because he traded popularity among voters for $1 billion in additional taxes, including a big sales tax increase.
''It has been very difficult for states that believe they should raise taxes to do so, when their constituents are being told by President Bush that higher taxes aren't necessary and the solution is to cut spending,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting service.
President Bush had kept the Federal Government out of the crossfire with his declarations against new taxes. But now his opposition might be giving way, although the evidence of that is still rather meager. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has endorsed Mr. Rostenkowski's tax proposals and President Bush has responded politely, saying he is willing to negotiate.
Some people dismiss the President's politeness as political maneuvering. But others say that Mr. Bush, inadvertently or intentionally, has now blessed the tax-raising process and will in time be drawn inexorably into it.
He might not have any choice, given the reluctance to make big spending cuts. The Federal Government, the states, the counties and the cities - all of them together - are not raising enough revenue to contain the Federal budget deficit and the new ones that are developing in many states and cities.
For years, state and municipal governments found ways to pay for services when the Reagan Administration found ways to cut Federal aid. In the process, property taxes, sales taxes and state income taxes have risen to absorb more than 7 percent of the national income, up from 6.5 percent in 1980. Federal income taxes, on the other hand, have fallen to 9.5 percent from 11.2 percent of total income.
Most of the lost money came back to the Federal Government in the form of higher revenues from higher Social Security payroll taxes. But that money went into a special trust fund.
As Federal income tax collections fell, so did the subsidies to the states and cities. Between 1980 and 1989, Federal money for such major items as low-income housing, clean water, job training, public transit, sewage treatment plants and garbage disposal shrank by more than $50 billion a year. New York City today gets only 9.6 percent of its total revenue from the Federal Government, compared with nearly 16 percent in 1981.
But if Federal funds dried up, Federal requirements did not. Washington issued new regulations for waste disposal and other environmental concerns, for example.
And who got the bill? ''Solid waste disposal is probably the hottest topic today among our members,'' said Douglas Peterson, senior policy analyst at the National League of Cities. ''They are being forced to close landfill sites and replace them with costly incinerators and recycling programs.''
Most costly of all was the Government's broadening of Medicaid coverage, requiring huge new outlays for a health insurance program that is largely financed by the states.
''Mostly it has been the Federal Government saying, 'Do this, do that, and you pay for it,' '' said Marsha Howard, research director for the National Association of State Budget Offices.
The money to carry out these Federal marching orders has been easier to raise in some states than in others. The prosperous northwestern states, for example, currently raise more than enough in taxes for all their needs. Wyoming and Wisconsin are well enough off to consider tax reductions without cutbacks in services. Arkansas, Idaho and Iowa are getting by.
But in other places, especially in the Northeast, shortfalls are reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars. More than 25 states face either tax increases or spending cuts or both if they are to balance their budgets, a legal requirement that nearly every state and municipality in the nation has imposed on itself.
The scramble to cut costs and raise taxes might not have been necessary in a stronger economy. On the whole, the states and cities might have continued to get by on their own resources. From 1983 until 1988, most of them did, finishing each year with surplus funds.
But in recent months, growth in the Gross National Product has slid below an annual rate of 2 percent. The budget surpluses have disappeared in all but a handful of states, and the total shortfall in the fiscal year 1990 is expected to come to more than $35 billion, according to Commerce Department estimates.
The problem is that, no matter what, tax revenues invariably rise strongly in boom times and not so much when the economy is weak. The taxes that are most sensitive to swings in the economy include corporate income taxes and sales taxes, a main source of income for states and cities.
Revenue from sales taxes rose from 1983 to 1988 at a healthy 8 percent to 14 percent a year across the nation, but last year the rise was only 6.4 percent. The reasons for that are not completely clear. Despite the economic slowdown, Americans still have plenty of income. But surveys of consumer confidence show many Americans to be nervous about spending big chunks of their salaries on cars and big appliances, which in turn produce most sales tax revenue.
The money goes instead into untaxed essentials, like medical care and food, and into untaxed nonessentials, like catalogue purchases and video rentals.
Governor O'Neill has tried to remedy this problem in Connecticut by broadening the sales tax base -the state does not have an income tax - to cover things like consultants' fees, window cleaning, exterminators' services and appliance repairs. And the Governor persuaded the Connecticut Legislature to raise the sales tax to 8 percent from 7.5 percent.
The Northeast in particular has brought down the total national revenue from sales taxes. Four big industries in the region have fallen on hard times: military contracting, computer manufacturing, financial services, and home and office construction. The upshot is that revenue from sales taxes has shrunk in Massachusetts and is growing elsewhere at a rate of less than 5 percent a year.
Property taxes, on the other hand, are less sensitive to downturns, and local governments rely heavily on them. Through the 1980's, property tax revenue rose at an annual rate of more than 10 percent, reaching $127 billion in 1988, the last year for which figures are available.
And perhaps inevitably, property owners are beginning to revolt. This month, officials in two counties in the suburbs of Washington rolled back property tax increases. Resistance movements are also springing up in Vermont, Maine, Nebraska and Wisconsin.
For Ronald Snell, an official of the National Conference of State Legislatures, the message is clear. ''For those states that want to raise taxes,'' he said, ''the options are being narrowed to higher sales taxes and high income taxes.''
At the Federal level, assuming that resistance to significant cuts in spending will continue, there are two other options. One is to raise income taxes and the other is to live with a budget deficit. The deficit is in violation of the Gramm-Rudman law, which requires an ever-lower amount, and an income tax increase is not very popular, despite Mr. Rostenkowski's efforts, although many economists think higher taxes make sense.
Mr. Aaron of Brookings, for example, notes that taxes as a percentage of national wealth are lower in the United States than in most other industrial countries, and the share of national income going into taxes has remained essentially unchanged in this country for two decades.

HEADLINE: CAPITALISM'S CHANCES: A U.S. Expert's View;
Prognosis for Soviet Economy Is Grave, but Improving

BYLINE: By ED A. HEWETT; Ed A. Hewett is a specialist on the Soviet economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LAST week Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed a tantalizing peek at how he intends to use his new powers as President to push through radical economic changes. Nikolai Petrakov, Mr. Gorbachev's new personal adviser on economics, broke the news in a rather matter-of-fact interview with a Soviet press agency in which he likened the new reform to Poland's cold-turkey plunge into a market economy.
Clearly the economic crisis has scared Soviet leaders out of the paralysis they had been in for years. The Soviet Government now has two good economists in positions of authority, where a year ago there were none. There's Mr. Petrakov, a kind of Russian Milton Friedman, and Leonid I. Abalkin, who is less radical and but nevertheless free of the old orthodoxy. 
If the two men have their way, Soviet consumers will be in for some shocks - for example, unemployment. But if all goes well, as early as this summer the transformation of the system into a market economy could be well under way. By 1991, the economy could begin to take off. That turn of events would come none too soon.
In 1989 the Soviet economy showed unmistakable signs of falling into a tailspin. Even inflated official statistics show no industrial growth as of late 1989 and falling output in the first two months of this year. The only thing growing rapidly is the supply of cash. Consumers are buying everything in sight, then either stashing products like soap and canned foods at home or bartering. Big cities like Leningrad and Moscow are responding with bans on sales of scarce items like refrigerators and some foods to ''foreigners'' - defined as anyone from outside the city - in only one sign that the Soviet economy is disintegrating into many autarkic entities.
To be sure, the roots of the crisis precede Mr. Gorbachev, but his policies have made matters worse. The last five years have seen a succession of sometimes incoherent partial changes, carried out under duress by a recalcitrant bureaucracy. In 1988, for example, Soviet enterprises were ordered to link wages and bonuses to sales, in an effort to force them to satisfy consumers. But no effort was made to hold down money-supply growth or to increase competition. Enterprises simply used their near-monopoly powers to raise revenues by shifting from lower-priced items to ''improved'' products like new models of refrigerators or new brands of sausages for which price went up more than quality.
The alarming deterioration was evident to the naked eye in Moscow early this month. Because of the hemorrhaging money supply, taxi drivers who six months ago accepted rubles from tourists now demand Marlboros or dollars. Black marketeers who would pay six to seven rubles for a dollar a year ago will now pay up to 30.
Soviet leaders are desperately searching for a way out. The result has been a seesaw of radical, then cautious, then radical proposals. Last summer Mr. Gorbachev made the first of several moves intended to set things right when he appointed Mr. Abalkin as Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the new State Commission on Economic Reform. Mr. Abalkin designed a strategy to create a market economy. After several meetings with Soviet leaders and economists, his plan was submitted for discussion last November in a meeting of Communist Party, Government and business leaders in Moscow.
Mr. Abalkin's approach calls for an open system integrated into the world economy. Changes would include the denationalization of three-quarters of state assets. Most manufacturing plants would be leased to workers or converted into public corporations, whose stock could be traded on a new stock market. Most goods would trade at market prices and capital would circulate through a two-tiered banking system divided into a central bank similar to the Federal Reserve and commercial banks of the United States.
At the time, Mr. Abalkin proposed to start the overhaul immediately, but to go about it slowly, over five or six years. The reaction to the Abalkin program was mixed, but in general the mood was cautious and Mr. Gorbachev was silent. That opened the way in December for Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to push a different program through the Congress of People's Deputies. His approach pulled back from Mr. Abalkin's fairly slow reform, choosing instead three years of so-called stabilization, supposedly achieved through rapid growth by administrative fiat. Economic reform would then follow. It was wishful thinking worthy of Leonid I. Brezhnev and a severe blow to those who thought that economic perestroika had finally come of age.
But it was also in December that Mr. Gorbachev appointed Mr. Petrakov, a passionate pro-marketeer, as his personal adviser on economics. Since December Mr. Petrakov has spent hours, sometimes entire days, with Mr. Gorbachev, devising comprehensive changes, with the intention of introducing them quickly soon after the Soviet leader acquired his expanded presidential powers. Those powers are now his, and the real Mikhail Gorbachev is about to stand up.
Over the next few months one can hope to expect a flurry of decrees and draft laws that taken as a whole will resemble the plans that Mr. Abalkin had rejected as too risky -in other words, the Polish approach.
The ministries controlling individual enterprises, like the automobile industry, are set to be abolished. The enterprises would be released from their bureaucratic shackles and converted into joint-stock companies.
 
Rubles for Dollars
Under Mr. Petrakov's plan, possibly beginning as early as this summer, prices would be freed and would surely rise quickly. But then they should stabilize if, as is likely, wages are frozen (as in Poland), and the money supply is under tight central control. The ruble would be devalued, and quite possibly some form of partial convertibility of rubles into dollars would be introduced.
If this program takes effect as quickly as it did in Poland, the result is almost certain to be inflation and unemployment, and therefore considerable social tension. But after that, as early as 1991, the Soviet economy could begin a substantial recovery. The prospect of strikes and possibly unrest will surely lead some leaders to argue against this cold bath. But for Mr. Gorbachev and his supporters, it is increasingly clear that if they do not move decisively, the tensions will be far greater in the long run.
It is too soon to tell if Mr. Petrakov's reforms will be introduced and if they will then be carried out. A great deal can go wrong along the way, including a paralyzing conflict over the Baltic states.
But if Mr. Gorbachev does not move this year to set his economy on a totally new course, he will put at risk everything he - and the rest of the world - have gained over the last five years.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Governor Urges Great Leap and Volunteers to Go First

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
THE Governor of New Jersey has come came up with an alternative to tiptoeing around tax increases: jump in with both feet, to the tune of $2 billion; and while you're at it, overhaul the tax system, wipe out a $580 million deficit and redistribute wealth all at the same time.
''I have just been struck by how hungry people are for leadership,'' said the Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, who has been in office less than two months. There were many critics, however, and some politicians said that the leader he most resembled was Robin Hood.
For better or worse, Mr. Florio's determination to link a specific tax policy to specific social goals stood in sharp contrast to stopgap strategies like that of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in New York, who last week offered a menu of tax increases a la carte and invited the Legislature to choose. 
Whether the Florio plan might become a model for other states whose coffers have been caught short by economic downturn depends in large part on whether the new Governor can soon convince New Jersey taxpayers, possibly in the next 18 months, that short-term pain is in the state's long-term interest. Mr. Florio proposed more than $2 billion in tax increases, including $1 billion in new sales taxes and a doubling of the income taxes on the most affluent residents. He called for cuts in programs from drug treatment to support for the arts, programs that are adored by dozens of well-organized interest groups. His overhaul of the tax system would entail, among other things, shifting money from the affluent taxpayers to poor school districts and to others in need.
Although he was following a dangerous path, Mr. Florio said, he was also sending a message to some Democrats in Congress and fellow Democratic governors: if the party is too timid to lead, he argued, it is following the most dangerous strategy of all.
''The easiest way to not have anybody against you,'' he said, ''is to go into hibernation for a two-year period in Congress or a four-year period in a statehouse.''
His plan's success was by no means certain. The Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Joseph V. Doria, said he was deeply troubled by parts of it, including the elimination of a popular tax rebate for homeowners. Republicans said the income tax increase - raising the rate from 3.5 percent to 7 percent for those making more than $100,000 a year - would end New Jersey's ''pro-business environment.''
If the plan backfires, either from a revolt in the Democratic Legislature or among the taxpayers, or from a deepening downturn in the economy, some politicians predicted that Mr. Florio may have set himself up for a one-term governorship.
''The issue isn't about simply keeping your job,'' said Douglas C. Berman, the state treasurer and the budget's chief architect. ''It's about doing what you were elected to do.''
 
Setting the Table
While Mr. Florio was announcing his budget, his neighbor Mario Cuomo, who is considered a favorite among potential candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1992, was taking a step-by-step approach to New York's worsening budget picture. One day, he announced support for higher gasoline tax. The next, he suggested a smorgasbord of tax increases, including a personal property tax on automobiles and a higher tax rate on corporations, from which the Legislature could choose.
Reflecting the political dangers of raising taxes, Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut announced last week he would not run for re-election, citing as one reason the political costs of last year's tax increases.
George Sternlieb, a professor of urban studies at Rutgers University, contended that an income tax increase will hurt economic growth.
But, he added, he believed that Mr. Florio was testing the appeal of a revitalized liberalism that might just work politically in an era when Reagan Republicanism may have run its course. ''Florio is saying the party can't win with me-too Republicanism,'' Mr. Sternlieb said. ''There is a significant chunk of the electorate that is looking for new leadership. And Mr. Cuomo is increasingly looking like Hamlet, with so much difficulty making up his mind.''
In fact, Mr. Florio's decision to do so much so soon was based on a good deal of calculation, politicians here say. The pain and protests will strike most severely in his first year and a half in office. With luck, things will improve by next year, and by 1993, when Mr. Florio is up for re-election, the hope is that New Jersey may have a surplus and the complaints of voters will have become a distant memory. His aides note that they left corporate taxes alone, in part not to discourage businesses.
If all goes according to plan, Mr. Florio says, by the end of his first term New Jersey will be protected from future budget crises as the economy heats and cools, the tax system will be fairer, and other leaders might conclude that risky policies can be good politics.

HEADLINE: Serious Times, Trivial Politics

 BODY:
News flash: The Kennedy Library at Harvard University, to encourage better leadership, will bestow its first Profile in Courage Award this year on a public official who follows his conscience instead of the opinion polls.
Think about that. Has conscience become so rare in Washington that the exercise thereof merits a reward for courage? The library seems to think so, and it's not alone. According to a series in The Times last week, even politicians agree that government in America has reached a state of paralysis, crippled by a shallow and hugely expensive political system that inhibits serious debate and exalts evanescent opinion polls over leadership. 
The result, says former Vice President Walter Mondale, is a politics of irrelevance and avoidance. What 200 years of democracy have come to is a tawdry system where poll takers wield more influence than economists and scientists, where negative advertising makes legislators afraid to debate (much less act on) controversial issues, where the costs of running for office render the effective exercise of office impossible.
The idea that the paraphernalia of American politics - the media gurus, the 30-second attack spots, the costs of campaigning - cheapens politics isn't new. What's new is the virtual unanimity among politicians that the system has spun out of control and that something has to be done about its worst excesses - among them these:
The Slash-and-Burn Campaign. American politics has never been confused with a parlor game. But modern technology has escalated the stakes -and the savagery. As Robert Caro's latest book on Lyndon Johnson points out, if a politician in the l940's wanted to tar an opponent, he'd leak a few unsavory charges to his friends in the press and wait for the fuse to burn down. Nowadays, personal attacks can be delivered, and reputations destroyed, in 30-second television blasts beamed into millions of living rooms.
That explains why politicians put less faith in serious discussion than in unenlightening, savage commercials. And why highly paid political strategists search not for an overriding policy issue but an image or code word that can grab and hold the attention of distracted voters. Whether these take-no-prisoners tactics work is less important than the firm belief that they do. ''It would be great to run a campaign on a high level,'' said Al LaPierre, executive director of Alabama's Democratic Party. ''But that's a utopia we're not going to see.''
The Power of Money. Television campaigns cost money and more money. Senators elected in 1988 spent an average of $3.7 million - up 22 percent from only two years before.
The relentless pursuit of money has exacted its own toll on the quality of American politics. The search for money takes up as much as half an officeholder's time. The need for money encourages sleazy efforts to bypass existing spending laws, and favors incumbents by inhibiting all but the wealthiest challengers. The presence of money ties politicians to special interests.
Television, everyone's favorite culprit, is also everyone's favorite savior. The chairmen of the Democratic and Republican Parties, who agree on little else, have both taken up the call for free television time. Ron Brown, the Democrat, says free time would curb campaign costs, break the link between money and political success, and invite new leadership into the political arena.
Lee Atwater, the Republican who happily accepts responsibility for George Bush's negative campaign, says five minutes of free time would force campaigns out of the 30-second swamp. ''To fill five minutes, you'd have to put on substance and you'd have to be very thoughtful.''
These proposals, like others on Capitol Hill, reflect a commendable concern over the emptiness of political discourse. But such proposals may well raise First Amendment concerns, especially if the television stations are asked to foot the bill. Lowering campaign television costs is worth considering. But no single institution, television included, should be asked to pay for clean politics.
The process by which Americans choose their leaders needs reform. It cheats voters, inhibits candidates and discourages leadership. Reducing the costs of campaigning and tightening laws on campaign financing will do much to free politicians from the tyranny of the present system. But to focus exclusively on process, as many analysts do, will not answer public cynicism or usher in a new world of robust debate.
At the end of the day, a few brave people will have to confront their nervous advisers and, even at the risk of defeat, embrace unpopular positions. The issues are out there. On some of them, like the environment, the schools and the nation's dwindling competitiveness, the public seems well ahead of its leaders.
Process is important; but process alone cannot supply political courage.

HEADLINE: Black Hopes in the U.S. and South Africa

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Roger Wilkins is correct in outlining the parallels between the struggles of blacks in the United States and in South Africa (Op-Ed, Feb. 22); however, the divergences may be more telling and revealing.
In 1948 apartheid was imposed, and Pretoria suggested that a major reason was that the African National Congress and its allies were no more than the domestic hands of Moscow, and stern measures were required. In 1954 Brown v. Board of Education signalled the beginning of the end for American-style apartheid. That Washington was having difficulty pointing to human rights violations in Eastern Europe when blacks in the Deep South could not vote had a major influence on the process. 
In 1990, as the cold war recedes and Pretoria finds it more difficult to pose as the lonely bastion against Communism in Africa, Nelson Mandela is released, and in his first public words, he gives thanks not only to the A.N.C. but also to the South African Communist Party and its leader, Joe Slovo. In the United States, however, the leading black organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, fired W.E.B. Du Bois in 1948 in a capitulation to cold war pressures, shunned Paul Robeson and other domestic equivalents of Mr. Mandela, precisely because they were perceived as too far to the left.
Only recently, because of wariness about ties to the left of groups like the A.N.C., have the N.A.A.C.P. and other civil rights organizations taken up the anti-apartheid cause. The cold war has come and the cold war has gone while many civil rights organizations still act as if global developments have no impact in this country, while interest rates and economic growth are increasingly influenced by developments in Bonn, Tokyo and elsewhere.
Mr. Mandela, on the other hand, pointed to international solidarity as a major reason for his release. Our left allergy has hampered our movement, has provided fertile ground for the anti-Semitic allusions of Louis Farrakhan, Public Enemy and others, and so in 1990 it is possible to be more optimistic about the situation of blacks in South Africa than their American counterparts.
This helps account for the emotional outpouring among African-Americans at Mr. Mandela's release. We were subliminally mourning our own lost opportunities.

HEADLINE: As Highways Crumble, Bush Stumbles

BYLINE: By Neil Goldschmidt; Neil Goldschmidt, Governor of Oregon, was Secretary of Transportation in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore.

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has once again spoken out of both sides of its mouth: first, amid much fanfare, it declares that fixing the country's transportation system is in the national interest; then it turns around and sticks the states and localities with the bill.
It is beyond debate that the national interest is well-served by a healthy transportation system. It is the key to the nation's productivity, to keeping us internationally competitive, to using energy efficiently, and to maintaining air quality. It is also beyond debate that our transportation system is urgently in need of repair. This is not a job to be taken up piecemeal; it is a job for the nation. 
The Bush transportation policy, as recently articulated by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, is partly based on the premise that the states and localities are not doing their part to maintain this vital system. But the facts say otherwise. In 1988, states provided 50 percent of the funds invested in highways; localities paid about 28 percent; the Federal Government paid the remaining 22 percent.
In Oregon, we spoke the dreaded ''T'' word: taxes. Our gas tax has risen nearly 200 percent in a decade; last year, 18 other states increased motor-fuel taxes, and New York may do the same. States are clearly willing to take a greater role in addressing highway and transit needs. But any transportation policy maker who understands the size of the problem would not reduce Federal funding.
Let's look at the interstate highways, a truly national system linking all the states. While it makes up only 1 percent of the nation's highway mileage, the 43,000-mile system handles more than 21 percent of all vehicle miles traveled in the U.S.
Under existing ''match'' formulas, maintaining conditions and services at roughly current levels would require about $6.4 billion from the Federal Government each year. Currently, Federal funding is less than half that amount.
As maintenance and repair costs mount, there is no national plan to prevent further damage to the highways by keeping railroad branch lines open, thereby lessening heavy truck movements across our roads. To further improve the interstate system to meet deficiencies and respond to growth in travel would require about $15 billion in Federal funds at the current match formulas. Presently, the Federal authorization for all highway programs combined is about $14 billion.
The Federal Government has paid 92 percent of the cost of building this system - more than $100 billion. The Federal Government paid for it, and it ought to behave as if it owns it. That means paying 92 percent of the cost of maintaining, repairing and expanding it.
The Bush Administration says it can't afford that. Yet billions for infrastructure are bottled up in Federal trust funds. Why? Because each dollar spent from the trust fund would increase the deficit by $1 - a political taboo in the Reagan-Bush era.
And what about public transit? If the President was serious about improving air quality, energy conservation and improving quality of life, he would not continue to reduce the Federal investment in public transit.
Between 1981 and 1988, the Federal share of spending on transit decreased by 50 percent. In 1981, state and local spending made up 64 percent of all transit dollars. By 1988, that share grew to more than 80 percent. How much more does the President expect the states to bear?
Across the nation, we have potholes and broken bridges that reduce driving speed; bottled-up barge traffic; endless circling in crowded skies; and higher prices for products as they move from harvest to harbor, from factory worker to foreign buyer.
Gridlock and dirty air is not a policy; dependence on oil imports is not a policy; a scheme to shift the tax burden for fixing all this to the states is not a policy. Our country was built by those who knew that the efficient flow of people and products between states was critical to our nation. It is why they explicity protected the Federal interest in interstate commerce in the Constitution.
President Bush's transportation plan is not a policy. It is surrender of the Federal Government's role as the states' partner in insuring the economic viability of our nation.

HEADLINE: SHOPPER'S WORLD;
Colorful Needlepoint That Reflects Brazil

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE; ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, often writes for The Times about the arts in Brazil.

 BODY:
LIKE much of Brazil's heritage, the tradition of Brazilian needlepoint comes from its Portuguese past. The stitches found in intricate needlepoint tapestries or rugs have been developed from the Portuguese Arraiolos stitch, named after a small town in Portugal.
These stitches, in rugs and tapestries, convey very Brazilian scenes, the exotic animal and floral life of the Amazon, the pastures and produce of Goias, folk motifs from the island of Marajo in the Amazon River.
The Arraiolos stitch has influenced needlepoint across Europe. Both the needlework of Mary Queen of Scots and the peasant embroidery of Eastern Europe contain this ancient and well-traveled stitch. 
Madeleine Colaco, creator of the Brazilian stitch, derived from the Arraiolos stitch, is considered the doyenne of Brazilian needlepoint. At 81, Mrs. Colaco is still painting her colorful designs and overseeing her needlepoint workshop and studio in Marica, about one hour out of Rio de Janeiro. Born in Tangier, Mrs. Colaco first studied needlework and wools at the palace of Mulai Hafid in Tangier. Later, while living in Portugal, she saw the possibilities of the Arraiolos stitch (a simple cross stitch, crossed by a long half-cross stitch, which is then crossed by a short half-cross, then again by a long half-cross stitch). Escaping the intellectual repression of the Salazar regime, in 1940 Mrs. Colaco and her family moved to Brazil, and there she developed the Brazilian stitch.
Toucans, flamingos, butterflies and banana palms serve as vibrant inspiration for Mrs. Colaco's tapestries, as do the diverse people and places she has come to know in Brazil. She has designed a flora- and fauna-filled tribute to the Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx and is currently working on a tribute to Francisco (Chico) Mendes, the rubber worker killed in December 1988 for his efforts to protect the Amazon rain forest.
All her tapestries are executed in the Brazilian stitch, which is practically impossible to unravel. She also uses the Bayeux stitch for artistic outlining. Most of the wool in Mrs. Colaco's tapestries comes from Brazil, but metallic threads, cotton, raffia and acrylics are among the other materials found in a Colaco tapestry.
Fruits and little parakeets in shades of blue and green are the subject for a vertical tapestry with a red background. Approximately 4 feet 3 inches by 2 feet 4 inches, the piece sells for $4,000 (at 72 new cruzados to the dollar).
The needlepoint artistry of Madeleine Colaco, and of her daughter Concessa Colaco, can be found on the walls of European and American museums, galleries and corporate headquarters. In Brazil, the primary showcases for the increasingly popular needlepoint rugs are small showrooms in whitewashed houses in the northeastern town of Recife. Casa Caiada rugs are now sold in the United States and Britain, as well as throughout Brazil.
In 1966, two relatives, Edith and Maria Digna Cavalcanti Pessoa de Queiroz, decided that they would organize some of the local embroiderers to make a few needlepoint rugs. Today, a thousand women throughout the state of Pernambuco annually hand-stitch about 100,000 square feet of Casa Caiada needlepoint.
A look at Casa Caiada's tile-roofed showroom quickly explains the origin of its name. In Portuguese, caiada means whitewashed, and like the picturesque historic district in nearby Olinda, the neighborhood of Iputinga features small whitewashed houses strung along dirt or cobblestone roads.
One dusty signpost is the sole indication that a driver is on the right track to Casa Caiada's showroom. But it seems that all Recife taxi drivers know the 30-minute route, and even if you are traveling elsewhere, many drivers gratuitously recommend a visit to see Recife's well-known rugs.
There is no sign to greet visitors to the Casa Caiada showroom or to reassure first-timers that they have found it. But inside, a smiling receptionist and invigorating air-conditioning provide a welcome climate for viewing Casa Caiada's designs. Rugs in a variety of patterns, sizes and colors hang from the walls of the single gallery.
An average of 30 designs of rugs is available to buy directly from the showroom.
The original Casa Caiada designs were inspired by the 18th-century Portuguese tile facades of the churches and colonial houses in Recife and Sao Luis. But, as Casa Caiada's reputation grew, Maria Digna Cavalcanti Pessoa de Queiroz, today the principal owner and designer, expanded her repertory of patterns.
On the walls and in a handful of color photograph albums, a visitor will find tile-patterned rugs in greens, rusts, mustards and shades of beige, popular colors with Brazilian decorators and home owners. As you sip a refreshing glass of coconut juice, offered by the sales assistant, Guiamar Cavalcanti Cabral, you will also see geometric designs, motifs based on the tribal art of the Amazon island of Marajo, patterns featuring Brazilian birds and vegetation and floral designs in the pastels favored by Americans and Europeans.
While the sales assistant does not speak English, Mrs. de Queiroz and her daughters Patricia and Lucila do.
All of the rugs are hand stitched in pure wool in a needlepoint stitch developed by Casa Caiada to have ''more flexibility,'' according to Mrs. de Queiroz. As Sara Carter describes it in her ''Handbook of Brazilian Stitches for Wall Hangings and Rugs,'' the Casa Caiada stitch ''consists of four squares which together form a larger square. Each of the four squares contains a cross stitch with the top half-cross pointing toward the center of the larger square.'' A Casa Caiada rug has approximately 500 stitches to each square foot for an average of about one pound of embroidery wool in each square foot.
Casa Caiada rugs can be as small as 11 square feet or as large as 375 square feet. Color and size can be modified to accommodate the buyer. A rug of 43 square feet takes a minimum of four months to be custom made. Wool and dyes used in Casa Caiada rugs are made to order, and the rugs are guaranteed color fast.
Flipping through an album of Casa Caiada designs, you will see a rich assortment of patterns. Borda de Flores, or border of flowers, highlights yellow-and-salmon-colored flowers in beige hexagons and squares. Copacabana has a celadon border with red, rose, orange and purple flowers on a black background. Victorian Garden, with roses on a black background, recently won a New York design award.
RUGS are priced by the square meter, and prices vary depending on the design and where you purchase your Casa Caiada rug. Flowers on a trellis pattern, approximately 5 feet 3 inches by 3 feet, features small flowers and leaves in pink, salmon, berry and green tones on a white background. At the Recife showroom, the price is $207. An authentic Casa Caiada rug always has a trademark CC stitched along a border. Casa Caiada's Recife showroom offers the most economical price per meter, $137 per square meter in mid- March. Casa Caiada rugs are also for sale at the D e D shop in the Recife Shopping Center in Boa Viagem and the tourist shop in Recife's Mar Hotel, as well as in shops in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, New York and through representatives in Houston and London. A Casa Caiada rug bought in the United States or England has been specially treated for cooler climates, and will thus have an additional markup for this modification as well as for shipping charges.
For 11 years Maria Izabel Goberto e Silva worked as a designer for Casa Caiada and, 12 years ago, she launched her own gallery in a pretty white house with gray trim on an unmarked dirt road in the Recife neighborhood of Catanga. Taxi drivers have also learned the path to Dona Izabel's blue-shuttered showroom, knowing to turn at the statue of Padre Cicero and navigate the unmarked dirt roads.
Visiting Dona Izabel's showroom is like stopping by the home of a friend of a friend. A houseboy answers the door, as a backyard rooster seems to announce your arrival. As you survey the two big galleries, draped with Dona Izabel's needlework, she enters to greet and assist you.
An average of 100 rugs are available to buy on any given visit.
IN general, Dona Izabel's patterns are more intricate than those of Casa Caiada. While she uses the same needlepoint stitch as her competitor and has approximately the same number of stitches to the square foot, she incorporates three different sizes of the Casa Caiada stitch. All her rugs are made of pure wool and feature anywhere from 20 to 180 colors. As many as 3,000 embroiderers are in Dona Izabel's employ. Motifs are individually named and feature birds, butterflies, tropical fruits, mosaics, medallions, geometric and floral patterns. In pinks, roses and various tones of blue, Relicario is reminiscent of the rich and elaborately colored rugs of the Middle East.
While it is possible to order a design in different colors, a custom-order for a small rug takes anywhere from six months to a year to complete.
All Dona Izabel rugs have her signature embroidered on a border and all must be purchased through her in Recife. Her needlework has been on display in galleries in Porto Alegre and Curitiba and in Paris, but she does not sell in any stores. Her prices depend on the amount of work and quantity of colors featured in an individual rug. For instance, a rug measuring about 16 feet 3 inches by 7 feet 9 inches with multicolored grapes and flowers on a white background was $1,389.
She does not export rugs to the United States but is creating designs in colors and patterns, pastels and florals, specifically aimed at American buyers.

Death Overseas: After Cairo Fire

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
WHAT happens when a family member dies abroad? Events after the deaths of Marver and Sheva Bernstein, two of the four Americans who were among the 17 people who died in the Heliopolis Sheraton fire in Cairo March 1, offer a case study of how the State Department responds to such incidents overseas and provide insights that people hope they will never need.
When fire struck the hotel that Thursday, the American Consul in Cairo was immediately involved, as was the Citizens Emergency Center of the State Department in Washington. Americans were staying in the hotel, and their safety, and identification of any dead, were primary considerations. After that came the sad and tedious tasks that death begets.
In cases of death overseas, the Government must take on the role of temporary executor, delegate for the family and intermediary between grieving people in the United States and a foreign officialdom that has its own way of doing things, not always easy for foreigners to accept. 
The Bernsteins were notable people; he had been president of Brandeis University for 11 years, and she was an economist and officer in social service organizations, including the League of Women Voters. But, as it turned out, the course of events would not have been substantially different if they had been unknown American tourists.
The American consul helps make a positive identification of any American dead, assumes custody of belongings, responds to police requests and relays information on what disposition is to be made of the bodies. Sometimes, when there are few clues to the identities, as in a fire or plane crash, relatives' inquiries to Washington about those who might have been in the area provide needed data.
The Bernsteins were found in the hallway outside their room at the hotel; their passports and Dr. Bernstein's wallet were with the bodies. While this was not enough identification to base a death certificate on, it was adequate for the consul to assume that the Bernsteins were dead and to call the next of kin.
Midge Decter, the writer, who is Mrs. Bernstein's sister, said that she learned from the consul's call on Thursday that her sister and brother-in-law were almost certainly dead. ''My name was on the passport as the person to notify, and I guess the tour operator had my name too,'' Miss Decter said. She, as well as the Bernsteins' best friends, the Maurice Atkins, had copies of the itinerary, but the call came even before they had time to study it and worry.
 
Identified by Dental Records
From the first call on, Miss Decter said, the office of the Consul General in Cairo, Vincent M. Battle, and Sandra Shipshock of the Citizens Emergency Center were in regular touch - ''they were wonderful'' - and told her they were available around the clock. When the bodies could not be positively identified by any other means, the consul's office asked Miss Decter to send dental records for her sister and brother-in-law, which she did.
These arrived in Cairo on Monday, then problems arose. The Egyptian police did not have a forensic expert to make identification. ''We were told that ministerial permission was given for an F.B.I. expert to come in to do it,'' Miss Decter said, ''but that does not mean that at the street level, a foreign expert could get access.'' What Miss Decter meant was that while civilians in difficulty might bribe someone to get things done, consuls do not. Eventually, she said, the British authorities, who also wanted to identify victims, found a private dentist in Cairo qualified to identify the remains, and he also gave a positive identification for the Americans. ''Mr. Battle called, and he sent a telegram with the details, saying he would be sure to provide a rabbi when the coffin was closed,'' Miss Decter said.
The State Department has a system for families in the United States to relay money for expenses and shipping coffins home, but in the Cairo fire the Sheraton Corporation told all of the families that it would pay such expenses. Money for all related expenses is the responsibility of the family, and the State Department does not advance money for this.
Often, frustration develops over religious or political requirements. Unavailability of cremation or embalming may be another difficulty. ''Air shipment is a big problem,'' Frances Jones, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the State Department, said. ''It is the biggest cost and requires a lot of paper work. It may take up to a week.''
Ms. Jones said that the State Department becomes involved in the death overseas of 6,000 Americans a year, and that often, even after positive identification, there is a delay in issuing a death certificate. Once it is complete, the consul can issue to the next of kin what is called a consular certificate of death, which is used for all legal purposes. This is issued in four copies, but she said additional copies were available for $4 each.
''The consul also becomes the provisional executor,'' Ms. Jones said, ''making an inventory of luggage, jewelry, documents and sending a final statement of account to the family.''
 
First Fatal Fire in 53 Years
Officers at the Sheraton Corporation, which managed the hotel for its Middle Eastern owner, Gulf Egypt for Hotels and Tourism, said the fire was the first fatal blaze in 53 years as a corporation. Robert B. Collier, vice president for marketing, said that the staff had safely evacuated more than 800 people from the six-story hotel.
Sheraton had decided some time ago that all hotels worldwide that bore its name - 454 now - would be brought up to certain standards of fire safety beyond local ordinances. Their standards required sprinklers in guest rooms, alarms, smoke and heat detectors and certain types of construction.
The target date is June 30. Some hotels have left the chain since the standards were set.
According to Mr. Collier the owner of the six-story Heliopolis Sheraton had ''agreed to our standards'' and had made a design study of the installation of sprinklers for all guest rooms.
The fire has created a higher visibility for the chain's program, Mr. Collier said. ''We are pressing to meet the June 30 deadline,'' he said. Two other hotels in Cairo bear the Sheraton name, both high-rises, El Gezirah Sheraton, with 520 rooms, and the Cairo Sheraton, with 670 rooms. The Cairo Sheraton, Mr. Collier said, is the only fully sprinklered hotel in the city.
''We need governments to take these things seriously,'' Mr. Collier said, adding that if everyone had to meet safety standards, it would not financially penalize those companies that bring older hotels up to the standards that new ones must meet.
The Bernsteins had arrived at the Heliopolis Sheraton, along with seven other participants, who survived the fire, to join a Smithsonian tour, ''Red Sea Passage,'' the next day. The 90-odd other participants, who arrived after the fire, were placed in the Ramses Hilton for the Cairo stay, according to Pru Clendenning of Smithsonian Tours.
''We have all been made more aware'' of hotel fire safety, Ms. Clendenning said. ''We see that it is appropriate to ask questions. Whoever is making the site inspection should ask about sprinklers.'' Raymond & Whitcomb, a New York travel company, was conducting the Smithsonian's tour.
Emmy Loboda at this company said, ''I don't think that we were aware'' that the hotel did not have sprinklers. ''We will surely take another look at the question.'' Mr. Collier concurred: ''People don't really ask these questions.''

HEADLINE: SURVIVING HISTORY

BYLINE: By Mary Gordon: Mary Gordon is the author, most recently, of ''The Other Side,'' a novel. A collection of her essays, ''Good Boys and Dead Girls,'' will be published next year.

 BODY:
I DISCOVERED NATALIA Ginzburg in 1971. I was in Florence; my friend and I, having just graduated from college, were doing the contemporary version of the grand tour: a trip around Europe carrying backpacks, hitchhiking, staying in cheap pensiones. I decided that I should buy an Italian book; I went into a bookstore and my eye fell on Natalia Ginzburg's Le piccole virtu. I don't know why that was the book I decided to buy; there were other Italian writers I knew and had read. Perhaps it was her name - suggesting ethnic complications. Perhaps it was the title - ''The Little Virtues'' - which appealed to me as a new way of looking at the moral life. Perhaps it was the fact that it was by a woman - Ginzburg may have been the only woman writer whose books were in the bookstore - and in 1971, a fledgling writer myself and a feminist enthusiastic at the birth of the new movement, I was eager for connections with writers of my own sex. 
I came to her, then, by chance, but since then I have avidly pursued her work - an impressive body of it, in several genres. She is the author of six works of fiction, several collections of essays, a play (''I Married You for the Fun of It'') that has been produced in Italy, France and England, and a critical biography of the family of the 19th-century novelist Allesandro Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an ''original and engrossing work.'' She has also translated Flaubert and Proust into Italian.
Her most recent book, published in Italy last month, is a departure from literary themes. ''Serena Cruz, or True Justice'' recounts the story of a Filipino girl, now 4 years old, who was taken away from her adoptive Italian parents on the grounds that the adoption was illegal. The case focused attention on the habit, widespread throughout Europe and America, of taking children from the third world for adoption in the first. Ginzburg was on the side of the adoptive parents, unequivocally in favor of their rights, which she believed they had earned by nurturing Serena for 14 months. Ginzburg's opponents accused her of heartlessly exposing the child and her family to yet more painful publicity. But Ginzburg was unsympathetic to this argument. ''I think it's important that she know, and not live in darkness,'' she told Clyde Haberman of The New York Times. ''I thought about this when I wrote the book, that when this girl becomes an adult she can lay her eyes not only on the newspapers that talked about her but perhaps also on a work that looks at the incident in a more orderly manner.''
To anyone familiar with Ginzburg's work and history, this latest turn in her career is not surprising. ''Serena Cruz'' is entirely in keeping with her continued interest in the family, in her habit of taking independent positions, in her insistence that the personal and political be merged. It also underscores the liveliness of her talent; to take on a new genre at the age of 73 indicates a robust flexibility enviable in any writer.
Because of her insistence upon what are traditionally called small subjects - the inner lives of women and children, the workings of the family - she has often been classified as a minor writer. But history may be on her side. The recent deaths of Primo Levi, Italo Calvino and Elsa Morante, the disappointing recent work of Alberto Moravia, and the failure of younger Italian writers to engage an audience outside Italy have left a gap. By general consensus, Natalia Ginzburg, Umberto Eco and Leonardo Sciascia are the most important writers of fiction in Italy today, certainly among those who are translated abroad. Of these three, only Ginzburg is female, which isn't surprising. Twentieth-century Italian literature is notably short on women. To understand its overwhelmingly male landscape, one would have to imagine American literature without Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter or Eudora Welty. Natalia Ginzburg and Elsa Morante are rarities, and even they may have been allowed into the club initially through the accidents of their marriages.
Morante was the wife of Moravia, and Natalia Ginzburg's first marriage placed her at the center of an extraordinary circle of actively anti-Fascist, intellectually curious young people centered in her home city of Turin. In that city during the 1930's, an unusual group gathered, with the Russian-born Leone Ginzburg their acknowledged leader. The group was largely Jewish, but those who weren't actually Jewish, like the novelist Cesare Pavese, were given the title ''honorary Jews.''
Marriage to Leone Ginzburg made Natalia Levi's place in Turin more central, but as the daughter of Giuseppe Levi, she already had a prominent family name. Levi was a noted histologist, and a Jew; he and his non-Jewish wife were committed socialists. The men of the Levi family were all arrested by the Fascists. Natalia's brother Gino was imprisoned along with her father in 1934; another brother, Alberto, was imprisoned the following year; yet another brother, Mario, made a daring escape from Fascist police by swimming across the icy waters of the River Tresa to Switzerland. In literature as well as politics, Natalia Ginzburg is well-connected by blood; her aunt was the wife of the poet Eugenio Montale.
In 1940, Leone and Natalia Ginzburg and their two children were confined by the Fascists to a small town in the Abruzzi; during their time there a third child was born. In the summer of 1943, inspired by the fall of Mussolini and the liberation of captive anti-Fascists, Leone returned to his political activity in Rome. At first Natalia and the three children remained in the Abruzzi, but when the Germans began to overrun the countryside, she felt herself in danger and made a frightening and arduous journey through occupied Italy to Rome, where she joined her husband. The family was together for less than three weeks. In November, Leone was put in Regina Coeli prison. In midwinter, he died there, of beatings or a heart attack; no one was able to determine the exact cause of death.
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINEJU this terrible episode in Italian history as I walk along the Campo Marzio in the section of Rome known as Roma Vecchia, near the Pantheon, where Natalia Ginzburg now lives. I walk by shops devoted to desirable foods. In one window there is pasta in the shape of hats and wheels; in another there are artichokes, olives in baskets, mandarin oranges with their fresh leaves still attached. Hardship and privation seem far away.
Piazza Campo Marzio 3 is a dark, massive building. I enter and see ahead of me a trompe l'oeil mural: columns, a waterfall in blue and green. I climb five flights of stone steps to the top floor and knock on the door that has a bronze plate inscribed with the name Baldini. Remembering that Natalia Ginzburg's second husband, a professor of English literature who died in 1969, was named Gabriele Baldini, I know I'm in the right place.
But what place is it? I am on a sort of pilgrimage - an enterprise that must almost by definition include, in our age, a touch of embarrassment. I am about to come face to face with a woman who has been an important figure in my imaginative life for twenty years. As I stand in front of the heavy door on the top floor of Campo Marzio 3 waiting for Natalia Ginzburg to answer my knock, I am once again the 22-year-old carrying her backpack into the Florentine bookstore. The words of Albany at the end of ''King Lear'' come back to me: ''We that are young / Shall never see so much nor live so long.''
Natalia Ginzburg smiles as she answers the door. I remember that smile from Pasolini's film ''The Gospel According to Saint Matthew'': she smiled in this way, shy, but radiant, unforgettable, as she served Jesus and his disciples in the tiny role as Mary the sister of Lazarus, a role she played as a result of her friendship with Pasolini. I've seen photographs of her, but there's a slight shock in seeing her face close up. She isn't European-looking, but Indian: Inca. There's something almost essentialist about her face; no prettifying touch has been applied to it. Her hair is short; she wears no makeup. She is dressed in a navy blue pleated skirt, a navy and white striped blouse, a navy cardigan, low-heeled navy shoes. She could be a secretary in the main office of a paint factory, the director of a small-town library, a physician in a clinic devoted to the health of the rural poor.
The ambiance of her apartment is less formal and imposing than that of many Italian homes. The chairs in the living room are comfortably covered in soft chintz. Over the mantel there is a dark Victorian portrait of what appears to be Lear on the heath. ''I bought it on the Portobello Road,'' she says. I remember that she lived in England for a time, accompanying Baldini while he worked on English literature, and I realize that the apartment is much more like an English country house than an urban Italian dwelling. She says her English is terrible, though, and so two people have come to help my faltering Italian. One is an American friend of mine, the other an old friend of Ginzburg's whom I know through my English editor. Every available surface in the living room is covered with books.
Mrs. Ginzburg shows me to the couch. On it is a collection of Chekhov's letters in Italian; she is selecting from among them for an edition to be published by Einaudi. The four of us look at photographs of Chekhov. Seeing one of him lying in his bed, weakened by illness, beneficent, looking almost as if he is about to bless us before he dies, I say, perhaps too brightly, ''I think of Chekhov as a kind of saint of literature.'' Mrs. Ginzburg sits up straighter, like a schoolmistress whose standards are just but strict. ''I don't know about saints of literature,'' she says, not looking at me. ''But if there is one, he is the saint of openness.''
I suggest to Mrs. Ginzburg that a complicated kind of openness characterizes her own work. No virtuoso turns occlude the lens through which she sees the world; nothing of the merely literary clogs the narrative. And yet the ''I'' is impalpable, disappearing from sight as soon as the reader has gotten a glimpse. ''Natalia Ginzburg's is the voice of understatement,'' William Weaver, the distinguished translator, has said of her. When I ask her what has caused her to make such stylistic choices, to create a surface of such deliberate simplicity (a hostile critic remarked: ''Natalia Ginzburg writes with a lisp''), she mentions not a particular writer, but her position in the family birth order. ''I was the little sister,'' she says. ''When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do.''
Many of the narrators or central characters of her fiction are younger sisters; she seems at home with the vision of the rapt girl, if not outside the family web, certainly not at its center. In her ''Family Sayings'' (an autobiography that she says should be read like a novel), she portrays herself as the child positioned to the side of the family action, less interesting to her parents and siblings than anyone else in the family. Nearly forgotten among the three brothers, with their political activities, their romances, their stark, masculine fights, and eclipsed by a beautiful older sister who is more entertaining to the mother than the studious, shy Natalia, she sees the family almost as one apart from it. I cannot think of a writer's autobiography in which the writer herself is so little seen.
I ask Mrs. Ginzburg if she can imagine what kind of writer she would have become if the war hadn't disrupted her life. She is sitting on her comfortable couch smoking, almost ceaselessly, nonfiltered cigarettes. Soon after I arrived, a friend of hers brought her six packs of her favorite cigarettes: Cigarette Stop, which I assumed were some sort of halfway measure for the smoker trying to quit. I was wrong; they are the strongest cigarettes available. Their package, a white background with a hexagonal stop sign printed on it, reminds me of the old Lucky Strikes. ''Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses, you reflect what is there.'' I ask her if literature ever seemed a futile occupation during the hardest times of World War II. She regards me sternly. ''That would have been a futile thought, especially during the war. Literature is always of the greatest importance. It is the blood of life.''
It is this combination of her devotion to literature and the harshness of her own historical experience that keeps Natalia Ginzburg's work safe from any danger of sentimentality. Her aspirations for the family don't have to do with family happiness: simply, for her, the family is the place that is. ''I write about families because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow,'' she says. If she were a younger writer, starting now, would she still focus on the family? ''Yes,'' she says. ''It doesn't matter, parents are separated, children spend time here with the father, there with the mother, but it's still the same. It's still the place where everything begins, where everything is learned.''
Is that why she focused her biography of Manzoni not on the man but on his family? ''I was interested in a family fallen into disgrace,'' she says. By focusing on Manzoni's life as a father, Mrs. Ginzburg deftly turns the ''great man'' school of biography on its head. She gives Manzoni high marks for his contribution to world literature; we see him vividly in the context of the tumultuous political events of the early 19th century, but we see as well his shocking failures in relation to his children. We read the pathetic letters of a daughter, dying of consumption, begging her father for a little money so that she can be cupped and order the proper food. He refuses her. We see the son ending his life in the most abject poverty, and another caught in brushes with the law.
Does she think her concentration on subjects that have been thought of as traditionally female has caused critics to undervalue her work? The question doesn't seem to interest her. ''Perhaps. Yes, of course,'' she says. ''But you have a few friends, you have to hope they'll understand you.''
In her essay ''My Vocation,'' she speaks with characteristic modesty and clearness of vision about her place as a writer: ''When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer. But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer. . . .''
A small writer. Small virtues. Ginzburg uses size in a way that is self-consciously ironic. The small virtues of which she speaks are not in fact virtues at all, but bourgeois habits of mind - thrift, prudence - which stand in the way of genuine virtue, habits one must work, she says in her essay, not to pass on to one's children. One must demand of them, she says, not moderation, caution, self-protection, but idealism, generosity, greatness of vision, self-sacrifice. To read Natalia Ginzburg on parenthood is to widen the angle of vision so that the world - the best and the worst of it - makes its way into the nursery, around the family table where the foods that suit the child's palate are dished up and shared. ''We should not demand anything; we should not ask or hope that he is a genius or an artist or a hero or a saint; and yet we must be ready for everything,'' she writes in ''The Little Virtues.'' ''What we must remember above all in the education of our children is that their love of life should never weaken.''
NATALIA GINZBURG SITSJU on her couch, surrounded by her books, her pictures of her children. The Roman sun streams through the large windows, clarifying, giving hope. And yet she says she is not hopeful, about modern literature or the modern world. ''It has never been worse,'' she says. ''Even when I lived through the terrible time of the Fascists, it was not so bad as this. You could believe then that there would be a time when Fascists would no longer be in power, that something better would come along. But now, you cannot believe there will be anything better. Except that sometimes you see someone, a man like Gorbachev, for example, and it seems like a little light in the darkness.''
In 1983, she became a member of Italian Parliament, a candidate of the Sinistra Indipendenza Party, a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. I ask why, if she has so little hope for the world, she decided to run for Parliament at the age of 70. She responds in her characteristic laconic tone. ''I did it because I like to learn about things,'' she says. ''I like to learn about them so that I can write about them.''
Despite her own creative vitality, she doesn't find much contemporary writing of interest. She mourns deeply, acutely, the deaths of her writer friends: Primo Levi, Elsa Morante. Was her friendship with Morante different from her friendship with the other writers because they were both women? She looks impatient. ''Of course not. A writer is a writer. You care about writing. It isn't men or women. I find these feminists very annoying, putting together these anthologies of women writers. As if there were a difference. You sit down, you write, you are not a woman, or an Italian. You are a writer.'' Does she think of herself as a Jew, I ask her. ''You never lose your sense of connection with those who died in the camps,'' she says.
If a writer is a writer, male or female, parents are not, for Natalia Ginzburg, sexually interchangeable. ''It's ridiculous to imagine that a father feels the same thing for his child that a mother does. When a child is sick, the mother feels it in her own body, she carried the child. My husband was very helpful, but he didn't feel what I felt.'' I ask her how she accomplished all she did - half a dozen works of essays, memoirs, a literary biography, a play, while working in publishing and bringing up her children. (Her son Carlo is a professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles; her son Andrea is a professor of political economy at the University of Modena, in Italy; her daughter, Alessandra, is a psychoanalyst.) ''I had to write,'' she says. ''Even when we were in confinement, in the Abruzzi, a girl from the town would come and watch the children for a few hours. But my mother helped me all the time,'' she says. ''I couldn't have done it without my mother.''
''My mother knew how to enjoy life,'' she says. ''It was her great gift. My father was difficult, but my parents had a happy marriage. When my mother died, my father was lost. She was only 67 when she died - not much older than I.''
She puts out another Cigarette Stop. I want to tell her to stop smoking.
I leave Campo Marzio 3 with my American friend and the Italian woman who accompanied me. On the street, I change out of the uncomfortable chic shoes I bought the night before. My American friend and I travel to Lucca, where he has a house; I work and rest there for a few days. The Italian woman said that I must have dinner with her when I return to Rome: I am to call her the morning of my return. But that day, my friend and I leave Lucca very early for Florence, where we are given lunch by an eminent art historian, a staunch Catholic who claims to believe literally in every miracle depicted in any beautiful painting of the Renaissance he's seen. I'm uneasy about asking him if I can telephone Rome to confirm my dinner appointment, so I miss the woman in Rome when I try to telephone her from the railway station in Florence. There is no seat for me in the train going back to Rome. I've bought a first-class ticket, but I have to sit on my bag in the corridor. This leaves me feeling ill-used by the Italians, and self-pitying. The poplars of Tuscany seem to me a landscape that will not include me; their melancholy beauty at twilight - they are more desirable since they aren't mine - makes me feel pleasurably unplaced. I am sad at the thought of leaving Italy; at the same time, I look forward to goingJU (Continued on Page 62) home, to being among trees that don't make me feel underbred.
BACK IN ROME, I PHONE THEJU Roman woman from my hotel. ''It's a pity you didn't telephone earlier,'' she says. ''Natalia said she might join us for dinner; she phoned from Parliament, but she's aleady gone home now and she doesn't like the idea of climbing all those stairs twice in one night. But perhaps if you call her yourself, she might change her mind.'' I phone her and tell her what time my friend and I are meeting, and ask her to come along. She says either ''vediamo,'' which means ''we'll see'' in the figurative sense, or ''vediamoci,'' which means, literally, ''we'll see each other.'' But in one of those linguistic slippages that occurs when one is speaking a foreign language - particularly over the phone, I can't remember which phrase she used after I hang up. So as the time comes near, I lean out the window of my hotel room in suspense. I'm elated when I see her walking up the street.
We go to a restaurant near Natalia Ginzburg's house. The proprietor knows her well; she comes here often. It is much less fancy than the restaurants I have dined at during my stay in Rome; on the wall is a mural of an Italian scene familiar to me from the pizzerias of my childhood. She urges me to have the ravioli as a first course, and we begin talking about ourselves as girls, 14 years old, reading the Russians, thinking someday we'd write like Dostoevsky, secretly writing poetry we alternately found brilliant and worthless. Something rises up in the air, an exciting memory: the image of avid girls in love with literature, writing and reading all day until, at supper time, sickish and almost ashamed, we go downstairs to our mothers, who would like to understand, but don't.
I keep thinking of her mother, and of her saying her mother wasn't much older than Ginzburg when she died. I know that we'll be separating soon and there is much more I want to say to her. Almost compulsively, I begin asking her questions. I quote an observation attributed to Flannery O'Connor - that a writer has learned all the important things she needs before the age of 6. ''Flannery O'Connor,'' she says, smiling radiantly, ''a wonderful writer. But she got it wrong. It isn't 6,'' she says, deadpan. ''It's 10.'' And then she laughs.
I tell her that for many writers in America, particularly women, the fullness of her life and work has been a model. She seems pleased. We are walking down the Via Santa Chiara, near the Pantheon. ''Do you think it's ridiculous for human beings to want happiness,'' I ask her, recklessly, not knowing if she'll think the question itself foolish, but feeling I must ask her before we part. ''It's not ridiculous for people to strive for happiness,'' she says, ''but they'll probably not get it. You only live for one thing, after all: life itself.''
She admires my gloves, burgundy-colored suede gloves, lined with fleece. I try to explain to her that I bought them at a discount store. It is a chilly January night; I am standing in the dry Roman moonlight trying to tell Natalia Ginzburg that in America there are stores that sell at a lower price goods that are slightly - but not obviously - damaged, and this is where I bought the gloves. I'd like to give them to her, but they're not appropriate for Roman life - I can't imagine her wearing them. I take off my gloves to shake her hand; she kisses me goodbye on both cheeks, and says we will see each other again, sometime. In my hotel room, I hang out the window once again and, after I'm sure that she can't see me, watch her go off down the street.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S CABINET: WHO'S UP, WHO'S DOWN

BYLINE: By William Safire: William Safire is a columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
At the first informal meeting of the Bush Cabinet, in Blair House a week before the Inauguration, George Bush pulled a handwritten list out of his pocket and read what he called ''The Marching Orders.''
''Think big. * Challenge the system. * Adhere to the highest ethical standards. * Be on the record as much as possible. * Be frank. * Fight hard for your position. * When I make a call, we move as a team. * Work with Congress. * Represent the United States with dignity.''
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher obtained a copy of that unassailably virtuous list of nine commandments and had it printed, framed and distributed to his 15 colleagues in the Cabinet. Some thought that smacked of apple polishing, but boosterism has never been a vice at Commerce. 
Bush's marching orders, written to be revealed, indicate how the President wants his Administration to be seen: bold, ethical, open, decorous. As his towering popularity shows, much of Mr. Bush's message is coming across. But at least one of those commandments, as we shall see, rings false.
What kind of Cabinet did he want and what has he been getting? In the second quarter of his term, the time is ripe for preliminary judgments - not only about the individuals trusted with what Mr. Bush likes to call his stewardship, but about how they interact with the White House and each other in managing the country.
In recent years, when Presidents enter office, they begin by declaring for ''Cabinet government.'' No yes-men for them; no palace guard centralizing power and isolating the President; on the contrary, we are all assured, the department heads will be given real responsibility to run their own shows.
This assertion is made because every President is determined to avoid the mistakes in style as well as operation made by recent predecessors. Johnson and Carter are adjudged too much the detail men, micromanaging every facet of government from the Oval Office, undermining Cabinet responsibility; Nixon, after duly announcing an Eisenhower-style Cabinet government, saw the need to ''challenge the system'' and pulled the power inside, to the point of making sure his Cabinet members could not get through the staff guardians. Reagan started a revolution and turned it over to his Cabinet generals, refusing to intervene in titanic Cabinet struggles between State and Defense.
The Bush management style is a reaction to the detached, decentralized Reagan style. Mr. Bush likes the expression ''hands-on,'' which in politics signifies involvement of the President in details of issues; he demonstrates his hands-onedness by exposing himself frequently to the media's pop quizzes (leaving the press corps gasping for fresh questions), but he has not drawn most Cabinet power inside the White House, as Johnson, Nixon and Carter did. Mr. Bush, the longtime insider, the close observer of past mistakes, is striving for that happy medium - neither too involved nor too remote. To achieve that light hands-on touch, he tries to avoid both dominating his ''team'' and letting it manipulate or define him.
To exercise central policy control, the Bush Cabinet system relies on a White House chief of staff, John Sununu, who has strong policy views, and is no mere coordinator; he is backed up by an encyclopedic budget director, who adds a pinch of deviousness to his crunching of the numbers. To diffuse administrative responsibility, Mr. Bush permits a too-harmonious Cabinet to exercise more operational independence than is customary. In this way, an accessible President hopes to maintain hands-on policy and hands-off details.
Is it working? In most cases, the Bush approach, Marching Orders and all, has produced one big happy family in power: rarely does a Cabinet exude such unanimity and eschew back-stabbing. ''You can have two basic problems with a Cabinet member,'' says a White House staff member. ''His Own Agenda is bad, because then you get an ideological split and the team comes apart. Even worse is Clientitis, when the Cabinet member forgets he works for the President and becomes a captive of his agency. So far, we haven't had a bad case of either.''
At the same time, the absence of creative tension has generated little excitement or innovation: no stewing, all stewarding. ''All the action is in Moscow and Berlin, not here,'' says Lyn Nofziger, the appeal-freed Reagan aide I ran into on a street near the White House. ''What happened to all those fun ideological wars we used to have?'' Some skirmishing goes on, as we shall see, but as a result of the Bush emphasis on calm seas, internal order and at least the appearance of unanimity (Order Seven: ''When I make a call, we move as a team''), we miss the Rooseveltian turbulence that often leads to original thinking.
Some Bush appointees are making it; a couple are dominant; others are falling sadly behind; a few are happy surprises. Here is one pundit's assessment of the standing - the internal and external perception of clout - of the 16 department heads who sit at the table with the President when the Bush Cabinet meets every third week.
The standards I use to judge who's up and who's down do not include ideological purity or pristine moderation; to determine who is and is not a ''player,'' I have tried to suppress the urge to anoint as successes those who agree with me or answer my calls. It's George Bush's Cabinet, not mine.
The criteria used here are: management skill, intelligence or savvy, ability to make the President look good, force of personality, originality and, most important, heft - the mysterious political weight derived from intellect, experience and character that causes colleagues and outsiders to take a public official seriously.
Take them clockwise from the President, as they sit around the long oval Cabinet table:
 
Dick Cheney
Secretary of Defense.
Cheney sits to the President's left, the traditional spot for the Secretary of Defense. Universally liked, respected for his intelligence and civility, the former House Republican whip is a Secretary of Defense truly on the defensive.
Trying to hold the line on budget-cutting by calling attention to the continuing Soviet arms threat, he was ''Bakerized'' - cut off at the knees by someone other than the Secretary of State, but with James Baker's connivance. The instrument used to reduce Dick Cheney's influence was the Director of Central Intelligence, William Webster, who told Congress that even the overthrow of Gorbachev would be unlikely to restore the Soviet threat. Mr. Baker had seen and approved the C.I.A. testimony; the Secretary of Defense was blindsided by it and could only mumble that the rosy C.I.A. assessment was ''unhelpful.'' Mr. Bush later told a news conference that C.I.A. and Defense views were not drastically different - which all the more dramatized the split.
Cheney is the foot-dragger in the stampede to disarm. Immersed in judicious budget-cutting, he is in a constant hard-line fallback position: he never seems to catch up with the latest bidding on reductions. As a result, the soft-spoken Cheney is slighted by doves, who think his department is an anachronism standing in the way of their peace dividend, and put down by hawks, who complain that he has been lukewarm on the Strategic Defense Initiative, too deferential to the dovish Joint Chiefs, and that he has not come up with a more mobile military strategy to cope with medium-sized threats worldwide.
Although not a member of Bush's inner circle, Cheney has a small strike force within the bureaucracy that prevents total dominance by Baker's State Department. His Under Secretary for Policy, Paul Wolfowitz, is a foreign service officer who knows the international ropes and was chosen by the President to be part of the small group negotiating at the Malta summit. With Henry Rowen, an economist, among the first to predict intolerable strains on the Soviet arms budget, Defense now has an imposing internal think tank. It draws up ''guidance'' to combat Soviet troublemaking in the third world while striving mightily not to sound bellicose, which is like trying to design a quiet noisemaker.
Cheney is fighting a rear-guard action, which rarely makes for a heroic posture statement, and in the final few weeks' infighting over the defense budget, he was abroad. When a disconcerting story broke about a ''blockade'' of Colombia by an aircraft carrier, the national security inner circle - Baker, Sununu and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser - jumped all over Cheney in a private meeting as if the derisive media play had been his fault; this indicated to status-watchers that Cheney's nose was pressed against the pane of power.
Even when being snubbed in the Philippines by President Aquino, however, Chaney has the undoubted respect of George Bush. His seat at the left hand of the President automatically makes him a player, but in today's Puzzle Palace, he offers solidity when nimbleness is required.
 
Robert A. Mosbacher
Secretary of Commerce.
Washington's social daggers were out for Georgette Mosbacher, the glamourous, global cosmetics executive. However, the hard-driving businesswoman proved neither Reagan-era glitzy nor Bush-era gray: she decorated her spacious new home in record time to be able to handle dinner parties reaching beyond the usual fuddy-duddies and enlivened by the presence of other successful women. If any members of the Bush Cabinet have a salon, it is the Mosbachers, who provide a needed bridge to the news media and the Congress.
Mrs. Mosbacher was accompanied to Washington by her likable husband, Robert, Mr. Bush's Texas friend since 1958 and former chief fund-raiser. Hard-liners feared he would be swallowed up by the let's-do-business-with-the-Soviets crowd at the 15th Street Statistics Mausoleum, also known as the Commerce Department. Sure enough, Mosbacher has been touting fiber-optic sales to the Soviet Union over the objections of the Pentagon. But within the Cabinet, he disagreed with the budget director Richard Darman on a way to help American firms become more competitive and came out on top; as a result, the President has called for legislation loosening antitrust restrictions on joint production by United States firms. He has been losing points to Carla Hills, the United States Trade Representative, on confronting Japan on its trade barriers, and he lost a key turf battle to her about handling trade negotiations with Moscow. But Mosbacher is a loyalist with deep roots in the Bush campaigns; though a player only on occasion, he's a power kibbitzer.
 
Samuel K. Skinner
Secretary of Transportation.
Only Veterans Affairs is more junior at the Cabinet table; Transportation is considered far out in the wings of the Washington power scene. Along comes this obscure Illinois prosecutor, the only Cabinet choice to have no entry in ''Who's Who in America.'' Fast on his feet and ready to jump into any sort of crisis, Sam Skinner turns out to be the first Transportation Secretary to be a player. He stepped gingerly into the Eastern Airlines strike, but descended on Alaska with enthusiasm to show the Bush flag in overseeing the Valdez oil spill. He discombobulated Wall Street takeover types by wagging a finger about leveraged buyouts of air carriers, and - taking on free-traders Nicholas Brady at Treasury and Michael Boskin of the Council of Economic Advisers - jawboned away at substantial foreign investments in United States airlines.
Spirited activism counts. With hardly any bureaucratic or political or personal base, with little money to back up forceful statements of goals, and despite suspicion that he is a liberal at heart, Skinner is viewed as a Cabinet comer who might be chosen to rescue the Justice Department.
 
Richard G. Darman
Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
This man suffers from the Dr. Fell Syndrome: few public servants of such extensive experience and wide-ranging interests and keen mind generate such mistrust. (''I do not love thee, Dr. Fell, the reason why I cannot tell. . . .'') Right-wingers remember him as Elliot Richardson's protege, a closet moderate, and later as Jim Baker's protege, a closet pragmatist; Dick Darman's political breeding was suspiciously centrist. Liberals see him as a man whose sensitivity, brains and suffer-no-fools temperament should have inclined him their way; they thus create an apostate who understands their motivations too well, and who sugarcoats parsimony with efficiency.
He's nobody's protege now. Darman has made himself indispensible to the Bush mode of Cabinet operation, and delights in taking on the Cabinet members (except Baker and Brady) one by one, like a champ inviting all challengers at a county fair. He batters them into his overall policy-budget shape; when seriously challenged, as he was on funding by the drug czar William Bennett (a player, but not a Cabinet member), Darman goes one-on-one before Referee John Sununu, who adjudicates and cuts a deal. Rarely if ever is a Cabinet member humiliated and forced to appeal to the President.
Known as a hardball player, Darman can lob in a soft pitch (Darman likes metaphors): to curry favor with Senator John Glenn, whose committee oversees O.M.B., Darman adopted Glenn's proposal to expand the Cabinet to accommodate the Environmental Protection Agency. ''What did it cost?'' asks a Darman fan. ''Three limousines and a plaque on the back of a chair. And someday, with a Democrat in the White House, they'll lump together Energy, Interior and Environment again.''
Smart; ambitious; political inner circle; of the three Richards in the Cabinet, he is the only one not to insist on being called Dick. Richard Darman is a man to keep your eye on, in more ways than one.
THE SEAT AT THE END OF THE TABLE TO THEJU President's left belongs to John H. Sununu, chief of staff, not a Cabinet member. Though he and Darman are the President's main conduit to the department heads, the reader will have to learn of his activities through his impact on the others, or elsewhere; 16 subjects is all I can handle here.
 
Edward J. Derwinski
Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
This agency was elevated to the Cabinet by Ronald Reagan, professed foe of bureaucracy, in an exercise in patriotic window dressing - the new Secretary's presence in the Cabinet was a sop to the veterans' lobby.
Derwinski refused to change the signs at the Veterans Administration, whose bureaucrats wanted new signs as befits their higher status; that was satisfying, if ostentatious, frugality. As veterans age, needs will shift from acute to extended care; Derwinski is considered a refreshing heretic in seeking to rationalize the future benefit structure.
Accordingly, Ed Derwinski has proven to be more of an asset than a table-crowder. A veteran Congressman with good Polish connections, he brings political common sense to Cabinet discussions. Though not a player, Derwinski unexpectedly speaks up and is good to have on your side.
 
Jack F. Kemp
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
He calls himself a ''bleeding-heart conservative,'' and that oxymoron sums up the unique Kemp role in the Bush Administration: the apostle of free enterprise who is the ambassador to the poor. As Senator Robert Taft showed generations ago, only a politician of tax-cut purity with conservative credentials could put across a program like Kemp's openhanded ''Project Hope'' - Federal support for low-income home ownership.
Another anomaly: this man of the legislature was given what suddenly became the biggest administrative challenge of any of the Bush Cabinet - cleaning up the mess left when the Reagan White House (J. Baker, chief of staff, lest we forget) permitted ''Silent Sam'' Pierce's shrinking agency to be used as a political play-(Continued on Page 63) ground and influence-peddler's candy store. Kemp, steering between the Scylla of a cover-up and the Charybdis of a witch hunt, tightened controls, guided passage of corrective legislation and restored the agency's integrity without prejudging the hapless Pierce. Kemp said the mismanaged agency had been ''drifting for decades,'' which may have caused Carla Hills, a former H.U.D. Secretary, to blink.
Kemp, who was the popular Republican choice to be Bush's running mate, was given an obscure post and found himself in the limelight. Though his primary interest has always been foreign affairs and economics, he plunged into the world of affordable housing with characteristic enthusiasm, pushing H.U.D.'s envelope, making himself a kind of Secretary of Family without treading on toes. ''It's amazing how he wraps Bush into everything he does and says,'' an aide to Governor Sununu notes admiringly. Kemp takes on Brady about interest rates with good humor, and seems to have an alliance with Darman, who needs some lines to the right.
Unlike most Cabinet members, the former professional quarterback is an unabashed intellectual. Kemp has made a determined effort to reach out to black Americans, and his sincerity is not discounted as political. Though not an insider, Kemp's enthusiasm and savvy have made him a player.
 
Clayton K. Yeutter
Agriculture
Yeutter (the first syllable is pronounced as in ''Yipes!'') is likely to preside over a reduction in farm supports, especially to wealthy farmers, which should earn him high marks with most of the media and big-city members of Congress, but the former boss of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange comes on too strong.
Senators Dole, Leahy and Lugar are meeting in the Cabinet Room with the President and his Agriculture Secretary. With his stentorian voice, Yeutter goes on and on in what seems to some participants his usual condescending way. Noting this, Mr. Bush makes a circling motion with his hand, which Yeutter ignores. Finally, the President says gently, ''I think that probably covers it, Clayton.'' ''Oh no, Mr. President,'' says his Agriculture Secretary, ''I have more.'' And he booms on.
His Commodity Credit Corporation's loan guarantees are coming under Congressional scrutiny and his two-minute encomia to the President at Cabinet meetings strike some Cabinet officials as unnecessary apple-polishing. To become a player, Yeutter would have to go up against Bob Dole's Kansas agriculture protectionism, and the President is not likely to let him do that.
 
Nicholas F. Brady
Treasury
In an office energized by activists like Alexander Hamilton and John Connally, Nick Brady seems passive. A nice and profoundly unexciting man, he has been clumsy at Congressional hearings and a guaranteed ratings loser on interview shows. In Cabinet meetings, he says little (in contrast to the hyperarticulate Dick Darman, who is said to want his job). Handicapped by a reading disability, recently recovered from an operation on an arthritic hip and not temperamentally suited to the take-charge role that Treasury activists admire in their leaders, Brady has raised diffidence to an art form.
However, he is to George Bush what Harry Hopkins was to F.D.R. - a modest friend who wants only to serve, and a trustworthy repository of confidences. The more Brady tells his colleagues he was never really as close as reputed to the Bushes, the more they recall that this Yalie was the only one authorized to speak for the candidate on his Presidential plans from 1984 to 1988.
He is a white-shoe old shoe, able to walk across the street to the President's office whenever so inclined, and likely to be in the room in a domestic crisis after all but a few have been dismissed. Does he use this influence to advance his ideas? On lowering the capital gains tax, on reducing third-world debt and on paying for the savings-and-loan debacle, yes; on Wall Street reform and double taxation of dividends, no.
He is like a counselor to the inner circle, not driving policy; in the crunch, Brady is to Darman what Scowcroft is to Baker. In the economic Quadriad, he shows little imagination and swings little weight. His power comes from his personal closeness to the President, who digs his diffidence and relies on his judgment, and from strong appointees in the Treasury subcabinet.
Like the economy, Brady is in a mature phase of prosperity but not in a period of strong growth; in a downturn that would call for a dynamic economic spokesman, he would be a candidate for a major ambassadorship.
WE ARE NOW HALFWAY AROUNDJU the cabinet table, at the Vice Presidential chair, opposite the President. The Vice President sits with the Cabinet, but as an elected official is not of it. Dan Quayle is far more internally effective than he is perceived outside; he saved important elements of our space program from Darman's budget knife, and received an unprecedented early choice by the President as the 1992 running mate. His cool crisis management of an attempted coup in the Philippines earned him respect inside the National Security Council. Still, he must find a way to gain gravitas: the unfair charge is still ''his face does not look lived in.'' Time and campaigning will put lines on his face, and welts on his back. He's not in the Bush loop as tightly as Baker, Darman or Sununu, but Quayle must be ranked as a player.
 
Dick Thornburgh
Atty Gen
Nobody's press is worse than Dick Thornburgh's. He ranks somewhere down around former Attorneys General John Mitchell, William Saxbe and Ed Meese in the estimation of those who cover him because he is obsessed with leaks and has isolated himself behind a palace guard of Pennsylvania cronies; worse, his blunders on several nominations for assistants made him gun-shy to political fire from the right.
That was not how it was supposed to be. On paper, Thornburgh was a fine appointment, coming in after Meese and held over by Bush. A former Criminal Division chief and a popular Governor of Pennsylvania, this man had all the credentials; nobody in the Cabinet has fallen farther faster.
Too much political sensitivity is bad politics. A few months ago, I tried to get an answer out of Justice on a drug policy matter and gave up when nobody would call back - but weeks later, when I called the Austrian Embassy to ask if the Attorney General had toasted Kurt Waldheim at a dinner there, a Thornburgh press aide was on the phone within a half-hour. (The A. G. had toasted only ''Austria's leaders,'' according to a nervous Embassy source.) The emphasis within Justice now is on fixing the A.G.'s flaking image, hardly a sign of strength. When both Oregon senators asked for his help in getting a judgeship for a jurist under unfair fire from antipornographers, Thornburgh was fearful of antagonizing the far right; it was the tough-minded Sununu, not worried about flak from the right, who delivered.
To counter the widespread wonderment at the failure of the holdover Attorney General to get on top of his job, Sununu, the chief of staff, insists Thornburgh is getting bad press because he is doing the dirty work to get good results.
True, Thornburgh invited fire by circumventing his publicity-hungry Office of Professional Responsibility in one leak-plugging case. Sununu's defense, however, does not stand up: the criticism comes from all sides. As one loyal Republican puts it in wonderment, ''He's not that good to have such a bad press.''
Losers are shunned. Thornburgh confidently announced he would accompany the President to the Cartagena drug summit, but when the list was put out by the White House, the Attorney General's name was not included. The significance of the President's rebuff was not lost on Thornburgh's Cabinet colleagues.
 
Elizabeth H. Dole
Labor
For the first year, she went into a kind of hibernation. ''That office was like a bunker during Ray Donovan's time'' recalls a labor skate about the Reagan Labor Secretary; ''then it was opened up by Bill Brock and Ann McLaughlin, and the doors were closed again with Liddy Dole.'' She brought in her political team and the department bureaucracy brooded; the word was out that her appointment was to cool off Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader defeated for the presidential nomination. The derogation increased when, in the Eastern Airlines strike, Mr. Bush designated Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner to be Administration spokesman.
Mrs. Dole showed little interest in women in the workforce and did not take the lead in child care; occupational safety became her cause, and she quadrupled the fines levied against employers. That pleased the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which wanted her to intervene in the Pittston coal strike. When she finally did, by appointing as mediator William Usery, a great old pro, she broke a Reagan precedent of nonintervention and received good press. However, the settlement has drawn the Labor Department into the thicket of the financing of health care, the implications of which even the alert Darman has not yet grasped.
Her talent is also her drawback: she is a fungible appointee, liked by Congress, available to serve in whatever field whenever a woman with political savvy who makes a good speech is needed. In the past, some Republican Labor Secretaries, from James Mitchell to George Shultz, have used intellect and presence to make themselves powers in the Cabinet, but Mrs. Dole has no such pretensions. She is a soldier, not a player.
 
Adm. James Watkins
Sec Energy
He may be the least known of the surprisingly strong Cabinet members because he is (a) colorless, as befits a nuclear engineer who came up under Hyman Rickover's thumb, and (b)involved in the details of his department. One senator explained it this way: ''Half the Energy Department is devoted to secret atomic stuff, and he's the first I can remember to understand the national security end of that job.'' Other senators agree that Watkins is a helpful witness, particularly since some previous Secretaries didn't know why our nuclear facilities were falling apart.
He worried many conservatives at first by saying he was ''aghast'' at the deterioration of the nuclear weapons stock; ''aghast'' is almost as liberal a codeword as ''appalled.'' But Watkins turned out to be crisp and confident, announcing recently he would make public studies of the environmental impact of modernizing our nuclear weapons plants.
Although he is presiding over a slide into an unprecedented reliance on overseas oil, Watkins gets high marks from his colleagues for ''taking his duty seriously.'' Rank him with Kemp, Skinner and Hills as members of the Unexpectedly Influential Quartet.
 
Carla A. Hills
Trade Rep
''Bob Mosbacher and I do not disagree on anything,'' she has insisted publicly, a reading of reality that will come as a surprise to the Japanese, who see her as having a far tougher approach to trade than the Commerce Secretary.
Washington expected the old Carla Hills: a quiet Secretary of H.U.D. in the Ford Administration, a respectably serious woman lawyer. It got the new Carla Hills, a more confident, energetic Cabinet member and a negotiator ready to assert strongly the United States' interest into removing trade barriers. She is not well known nationally because the very mention of GATT causes eyes to glaze over -''Uruguay Round'' beats warm milk as a terrific soporific - but Mrs. Hills gave Mr. Bush a card to play at his Malta summit by supporting observer status for the Soviet Union at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. ''How are they ever going to learn if they can't watch?'' she asked, later attributing that sensible quote to the President.
One of the rare power struggles then took place within the Bush Cabinet. Commerce, a cumbersome 35,000 person agency, fully expected to handle the new trade treaty with the Soviet Union, as it did during the Nixon detente. Mr. Mosbacher claimed special expertise in working with the Russians on removing nonstrategic trade sanctions. But the President ruled against his Texas chum and turned to the tougher-minded Mrs. Hills. The T.R. group - only 135 people - was jubilant, but Mrs. Hills took pains to deny a turf victory; Mosbacher gulped and took defeat graciously. That was typical; a person who sits in the Cabinet room says, ''Look - you either win the argument or you're shamed into shutting up.''
How does Hills manage to expand her job? Merit evidently counts
 
Lauro F. Cavazos
Sec of Ed
If the Cabinet were a solar system, Cavazos would be Pluto. The holdover from the waning Reagan years is considered, even by many educators, to be the captive of the National Education Association, and White House aides see him as the classic case of clientitis. At the ''education summit'' of the nation's governors, the former anatomy professor showed no muscle; Roger Porter, the President's domestic-policy man, kept the national role exhortative rather than financially supportive. The Education Secretary, with little personality or known philosophy and grumpy about the press, was paid no attention.
As Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. gains from comparison with a predecessor, Cavazos suffers from succeeding Bill Bennett, now the drug czar: as Bennett was, and is, involved, confrontational and colorful, Cavazos is aloof, ameliorating and dull. White House aides are now working on a plan to resuscitate the Education Secretary; if this fails, an early departure can be expected.
 
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan
Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Here is a man whose life is being saved by smoking. For over a year, he was a minor embarrassment to the Administration - from stumbling at his confirmation hearings over the abortion issue, to displaying a naivete about the politics of catastrophic insurance that saw his position publicly contradicted by the decisive Darman.
But Sullivan was a longtime friend of Barbara Bush; he came across as a man of intelligence, dignity and political loyalty in a job that chews up stronger executives; and he was the only black in the Cabinet at a time when the previous Cabinet black, Samuel Pierce of H.U.D., was coming under heavy investigation. In these circumstances, few wanted to criticize the former medical school president as being overwhelmed by the scope of the department and not being a ''player.''
Along came R. J. Reynolds with a cigarette aimed at sales to blacks. Dr. Sullivan was the natural one to object, and his pop at this sitting duck was magnified on national television; overnight, he was the hero to the lionizers of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. When the tobacco company backed off, the nonplayer won a pot at last; in a further stroke of fortune, another media plan for ''targeting,'' or selling to, young women was leaked, and Sullivan was able to squeeze the same grapes again. The position did not cost the Government a nickel and Dr. Sullivan has been rehabilitated. He is still not a player but he is no longer an embarrassment.
Will he ever be able to manage the monster of Medicare cost and quality, or put his own stamp on a staff that was chosen for him? ''You have to be careful when you ask somebody to clean out the cobwebs here at H.H.S.,'' says a longtime bureaucrat, ''it's the cobwebs that hold the place together.''
 
Manuel Lujan Jr.
Sec Interior.
If Cavazos were Pluto in this solar system, Manny Lujan would be Uranus, one planet closer in, seldom seen and trying to make it into the Outer Circle.
Lujan is a twofer: both a Western politician (New Mexico) and an Hispanic-American. The compliment usually left-handed him is: ''He's not Jim Watt.'' As expected, he plumps for offshore oil development but tries hard to avoid offending environmentalists. Mr. Bush has decided that the restraint on William Reilly, E.P.A. director and the in-house conservationist, will be in the more capable hands of John Sununu.
President Bush seeks to avoid the customary bloodletting between conservationists and developers by taking the combativeness out of Interior (which supports offshore oil development) and giving Cabinet status to Reilly's E.P.A. (which is all-out for conservation). In this way, each constituency will have its advocate at the table, but with teamwork-minded Lujan and Reilly, the jousting will be gentlemanly.
When the President was to give a speech at a conference concerned with global warming, Reilly submitted a draft speech that was eviscerated by Sununu, who decried ''a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucrats on the environmental side to try and create a policy in this country that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas.'' That's the sort of rhetoric we would expect from the Interior Secretary. Not in the Bush Cabinet; the voice occasionally heard is the voice of Lujan, but the hand is the hand of Sununu.
 
James A. Baker 3d
Sec State.
Baker, the most enigmatic member of the Cabinet, occupies the traditional seat of honor to the President's right.
Highly regarded as President Reagan's chief of staff, he was considered only an average Treasury Secretary. Originally called Joe Cool and Mr. Smoothie, he recently stepped out of character to tell a prayer breakfast how deeply religious he has become, which charitable souls took at face value and which cynics - asking, ''How many k's in this Jim Baker?'' - saw as an effort to win religious-right support. With a reputation for icy competence, he stunned Washington by lying unnecessarily on national television to conceal the first trip of Presidential envoys to Beijing after the Tienanmen Square massacre; he admitted later he should have ''no-commented.''
In Moscow, he won points by adroitly parrying hostile questioning by Soviet legislators, but lost points by ineptly ad-libbing about Germany's ''continued membership in or association with NATO'' -as if to open the way out of NATO and toward neutrality. He soon disavowed the errant phrase, but foreign ministers are not supposed to make such mistakes.
Baker operates within a closed circle at State, dealing with his portable cartridge of loyal campaign-to-government aides, to the consternation of foreign-service officers who mistakenly thought the appointment of their own Lawrence Eagleburger as deputy would provide a bridge of access.
However, Eagleburger's route to the President's ear is not through his boss, Baker, but through his longtime fellow-toiler in the Kissinger vineyards, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser. Jim Baker has succeeded in dominating the team called ''Scowgleburger.'' At Cabinet meetings, Scowcroft, who like all aides except Sununu sits against the wall, is more a trusted counselor than a central operator, more genuine adviser than player at the power table. That suits the President and delights the Secretary of State. Baker likes to exercise his power through others. To put the chill of a possible loss of aid into the Israelis, the Secretary of State induced Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, to suggest taking aid from Israel and Egypt and giving it to Eastern Europe; Baker then publicly agreed with Dole's trial balloon. In the same way, Baker watched as the C.I.A. chief, Webster, took the wind out of the Defense Secretary's sails (as described in the section on Cheney so long ago) in the halls of Congress, supposedly Cheney's turf. Baker used the occasion of reviewing a speech by Robert Gates, Scowcroft's deputy at the National Security Council, to slap down the hard-liners within the Administration who are not convinced that the Soviet threat has ended; by forcing Gates to cancel his speech, Baker signaled what the policy was and who was in total command.
Longtime closeness to Mr. Bush also gives him the high-level bureaucratic security that comes only when nobody doubts you have the Presidential ear. Baker is to Bush as Darman is to Baker: the aide and protege is now almost on his own, but is driven to deference by age and habit and position in the pecking order. Baker, who ranged the whole political world as Reagan chief of staff, now works in a circumscribed foreign-affairs domain, but his dominance of the N.S.C. staff is tempered by the President's abiding interest in his area.
A President with Bush's foreign experience is always ''his own'' Secretary of State; according to journalistic confidants of Mr. Baker, of whom I am not one, the President's decision to send emissaries to Beijing after the massacre went against the Secretary's advice. (This leak of a Baker background manipulation will be denied now, but confirmed in memoirs in a few years.) Perhaps that's why Baker enjoys traveling. Overseas, spin-doctoring a planeload of reporters, the man identified obliquely as ''a senior official traveling on the Secretary's plane'' is the boss.
HOW DOES THIS CABINET WORKJU as a group? Certain strains are built in, as in State and Defense, but the age of clashes between Shultz and Weinberger is gone; Baker has established his dominance over Cheney. Some ideology is discussed - Kemp and Brady will disagree about tax cuts and growth - but this is generally a pack of moderates.
Where's a potential President among these Bush appointees? Richard Nixon used to say that every Cabinet needed one future president in it, pointing disconcertingly to Coolidge's cabinet with Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover (Nixon thought John Connally was to be his 1976 successor). Jim Baker probably harbors Oval Office hopes, but he cannot become Bush's V.P. (both men are from the same state, and the Constitution requires a ticket from different states); Baker lost his only bid for elective office in Texas; in 1994, a Democratic Senate seat opens up, but Lloyd Bentsen will be no pushover. Dick Thornburgh, a successful Governor, seemed possible a year ago but no longer; Jack Kemp is finding constituencies hitherto unknown to Republicans, is seasoning as an administrator and may emerge in 1996 at age 60.
Is this a ''strong'' Cabinet? If you take that to mean a Ministry of All the Talents, as in Lord Grenville's era almost two centuries ago, no; says one of the Bush loyalists candidly, ''Surprising we're doing so well, given the lineup.''
If you mean, ''Is this a Cabinet that carries out the President's philosophy?'' the answer is that its members, with a few exceptions, carry out his pragmatism, embody his prudence, and follow all the marching orders save the first: to ''Think big.''

HEADLINE: SCHUYLERVILLE STANDS STILL;

BYLINE: By James Howard Kunstler: James Howard Kunstler is writing a book about man's impact on the American landscape.

 BODY:
A FEW YEARS AGO I BOUGHT AN OLD house in a village named Schuylerville, 30 miles north of Albany, on the Hudson River. I'd gotten priced out of the rental market in nearby Saratoga Springs, which was awash with prosperity and tourists, and Schuylerville was full of real estate ''bargains.'' Nestled beneath steep hills running down to the riverbank, it was a sad-looking town, clearly fallen on hard times. Many of the storefronts were vacant, with dusty ''for sale'' signs taped in the windows. The surviving business establishments included a tattoo parlor, a liquor store and a shop that sold dented cans of food at cut-rate prices.
After living there awhile, I began to suspect that something drastic was happening in the lives of the people who called it home, something only hinted at by the vacant storefronts, the broken sidewalks, or the general air of rot and disrepair that hung over the village.
I had a teen-age neighbor who dressed up in all-black heavy-metal garb. At hours when boys his age are normally in school, he'd stalk past my house with a 20-pound boom box blaring out the catastrophic anthems of bands like Megadeath, Poison and Anthrax. An hour later, he'd reappear pushing a baby stroller in the opposite direction. He was the baby's father, I learned. Sometimes he would turn up on winter evenings along the old Champlain Canal, a solitary figure watching kids ice skate. 
This young man - still a boy, really - came to personify for me the essence of the town's troubles. For most of Schuylerville's inhabitants, the decade-long fiesta of capital gains known as the Reagan Years might have taken place on another planet - the World of Make-Believe. A remarkable feature of the Reagan boom, the economist Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told me a year ago, was that whole regions of America were left out of it - big pockets that were chronically depressed while a few hot spots, such as Boston, Long Island, Florida, the New Jersey and Virginia suburbs, Southern California and the Silicon Valley, hummed. Here in Schuylerville, and in many other old industrial towns up the Hudson River - Mechanicville, Fort Edward, Hudson Falls - and west along the Mohawk River - Amsterdam, Johnstown, Canajoharie - it wasn't morning in America at all. It was more like 4 P.M. on the first day of winter.
THE ECHOES OF MUSKETRY STILL RING UP AND DOWN this part of the Hudson Valley, and you can't walk a hundred feet around the village without running into a blue-and-yellow state historical marker. ''Nov. 28, 1745,'' proclaims one sign, ''on these grounds the French and Indians killed Capt. Philip Schuyler and 30 others.'' The Battle of Saratoga, hallowed as the turning point of the Revolutionary War, was fought eight miles south, at Bemis Heights. The British Army massed at Schuylerville before the conflict and then skulked back here in defeat. ''At this place, General Burgoyne built his bridge of boats across the Hudson River,'' declares a marker just north of the village. ''Site of the Continental barracks where General Stark tried and condemned the Tory Lovelass as a spy,'' says another. The Redcoats parked their artillery where the elementary school stands. Burgoyne negotiated his surrender to Gen. Horatio Gates in the empty lot beside the present grocery store. Yet with all these tablets standing, history was lost on the local teen-age schoolchildren I interviewed, who weren't able to tell me in which war the great battle took place.
The Champlain Canal, built in the 1820's to create a link between Montreal and New York City, was a boon to the town's development. At mid-19th century, much of the city's stock of potatoes was grown here and shipped down by barge, as was the seemingly inexhaustible supply of lumber from the North Country. Pig iron also came down from the Adirondacks, and burnt lime from the foothills of the Green Mountains across the river in Washington County. In support of this activity were the insurers, freight forwarders, barge factories, merchants, bankers and lawyers who had their places of business in the buildings behind the canal basin, not to mention the boatmen, teamsters and common laborers who found a living from the canal. This was the first wave of prosperity, before the heyday of the great mills.
Between the two world wars a dozen factories operated in and around Schuylerville, along the Hudson proper and up the two roaring tributaries that empty into each side of the river within a mile of the village: Fish Creek and the Battenkill. One factory made window sashes and blinds. Others made paper products out of pulpwood from the nearby Adirondacks - cardboard boxes, toilet tissue, wallpaper, electric-wire insulation. There was also a cotton mill.
By 1979, all but two factories had shut down, and one of the remaining two operated at minimal capacity. Their red-brick hulks still stand ghostly along the river, but the machinery has been sold off, the roofs are caving in, and the rail spurs are rank with burdock and knapweed. Farming was equally vital to the local economy, and an even more potent stabilizing force in the community's social order. The town's historian, Tom Wood, who grew up on a dairy farm near the village, estimated that of the 100 or so farms operating in the area when he was a boy in 1950, fewer than half remain today, only 20 of any consequence - including his family's place, now run by his brother.
''When the mills shut down it was almost like doomsday around here,'' Tom Wood said. ''Then the oil crunch hit at the same time. Gas prices went way up. People couldn't commute further to work. They had to get help from Social Services. Maybe that was the beginning of some of our problems.''
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, SCHUYLERVILLE, and towns like it, have become colonial outposts of another America. The idea of the self-sustaining small-town economy, still so potent in our national mythology, is grimly contradicted by the vacant shopfronts and decomposing facades along Broadway, as the main street is called.
Two of the three largest commercial contributors to the tax base are the town's convenience stores, Cumberland Farms and Stewart's, both big chain operations. They exist partly because Schuylerville lies along the main road between Saratoga and Manchester, Vt., and a lot of cars pass through town, but they gobble up plenty of local dollars too. Besides taxes, the convenience stores contribute a handful of near-minimum-wage jobs to the town. What they take out is far more significant: the chance for a local merchant to make a profit, to keep that money in town, where it might be put to work, for instance, in the upkeep of a 100-year-old shopfront building downtown or a Greek Revival house on Pearl Street. But those dollars do not stay in town. The profit generated by the two convenience stores is funneled directly into distant corporate coffers. The officers of those corporations, who do not live here, have no vested interest in the upkeep of 100-year-old buildings or Greek Revival houses. So the old buildings fall into disrepair.
The Grand Union and Oneida supermarkets closed 15 years ago. The three-man police department was disbanded in the mid-1980's, following a bizarre dispute in which the Police Chief arrested the Mayor on an assault charge for grabbing his shoulder during an argument that took place beside the Cumberland Farms gas pumps. About the same time, the town movie theater had evolved into a biker bar, the kind of place where a customer once rode his Harley hog right through the front door. Not long after a patron was shot in the head and killed by a bartender playing with a gun, the establishment(Continued on Page 56) burned down, and ever since has been a charred, vacant hulk surrounded by a chicken-wire fence.
The current Mayor, 35-year-old Kim Gamache, presides over a three-member Village Board of Trustees that operates out of a room in the firehouse. He inherited a financial mess. Back in the 70's, the state ordered Schuylerville to upgrade its sewage-treatment plant. The village ignored the mandate. As a result, the state fined it $35,000. On top of that, Schuylerville was thrown out of state and Federal grant programs that would have paid for half the work. In the mid-80's, another Mayor got the fine reduced and restored some of the grants, but $800,000 in funds had slipped away. The order to build the sewage plant still stood. Now the work has finally gone forward. To pay for it, the village's sewage taxes tripled.
The post of mayor pays $1,500 a year. Gamache works as a groundskeeper at the high school. ''You can probably count the number of people involved in these things on two hands,'' he says ruefully. ''I worry about whether we're eventually going to be so wrapped up in our own lives that no one helps out. And if that happens, small towns are going to be in real trouble.''
One local entrepreneur has been wildly successful. Larry Dwyer, 38 years old, started selling used furniture in 1982, and has since taken over six downtown shopfronts, selling everything from lounge chairs to 12-person hot tubs. His customers come from all over Saratoga, Washington and Warren Counties. ''People will shop hard for big-ticket items,'' he said. Now he employs 18 people. But he has a high turnover among the unskilled men who move his furniture, he says, because they do a lot of drugs, steal merchandise and smash up his delivery trucks.
In 1988, a young violin maker named Martin Macica opened a shop in another vacant storefront. Macica, 28, is the grandson of Czechoslovak immigrants who farmed in Bacon Hill, a mile north of the village. He was a poor student who'd been in trouble as a teen-ager, he told me, but he loved music, met a fiddle maker in nearby Eagleville, and eventually spent four years apprenticing to several master instrument makers in New York City. His violins are bought mainly by professional musicians who play at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center during the summer, and he makes a decent living; his reputation in the craft is spreading. ''People really do want to be cultured,'' he said, speaking of the town. ''They're interested. They like what I'm doing here. Isn't it time we said something good about America?''
THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES that made it possible for me to buy an old house cheaply here also turned the village into something of a county dump for welfare families. Landlords bought up decayed buildings, fixed up apartments in them with Federal Housing and Urban Development grants and, under the terms of the grants, were obliged to rent to low-income families, most of whom were on public assistance. The occupants, I was told by one social worker, frequently damaged the apartments, and the cycle was repeated.
Schuylerville's population has remained stable for decades at approximately 1,250. The New York State Department of Labor does not tally unemployment statistics for towns of under 25,000, and Saratoga County's Department of Social Services does not break down their welfare caseloads by town, so the hard figures are unavailable. But the signs of poverty are visible and insistent - in the boys who play ''ice hockey'' on the canal without skates, using tree limbs for hockey sticks and a rock for the puck; in the young mothers angrily towing grimy, sullen children; in the blackened eyes and chipped front tooth of the 12-year-old girl I saw one evening at a high school function.
''We're talking a large number of single-parent families, which has contributed not only to the poverty, but to the worsening of dysfunction, the neglect, the sexual abuse,'' said Berny Rasowsky, a Saratoga County psychiatric social worker. Rasowsky's program, Intensive Case Management, takes him into the homes of troubled families in Schuylerville. ''I also go into the school, into the workplace,'' he said, ''wherever I can stir up some change in their lives.''
One night around Halloween, I interviewed 11 children between the ages of 8 and 15 at the village youth center, a prefab aluminum structure beside the town baseball field that had been put up in 1986 with a state grant and money from private charities. Filled with Ping-Pong and pool tables, video games, a computer, a stereo, it was clearly a refuge for these kids, and more than once they expressed their gratitude for its existence. It was better than being home.
Ten of the 11 kids came from families where the natural father was not present. A few had stepfathers. Four had never met their real fathers. Most had half-brothers and half-sisters. Only 4 out of 11 ate breakfast on a regular basis, and all 4 - including an 8-year-old - said they made their own breakfasts because there was no parent in the house when they got up in the morning.
If you go by statistics, the number of cases of child abuse and sexual abuse are up countywide, from a total of 681 reports in 1983, when county officials began to keep the record, to 1,340 in 1989. These figures represent only the cases that were reported to the authorities.
''It's not that they hate their children,'' said Sandy Hunt, a supervisor with the county's Child Protective Services. ''The parents' own needs aren't being met, because they're so busy trying to deal with the basics.''
A psychologist, Frank Arcangelo, who directs the Youth Services Program at the county's mental-health clinic, suggested rather the opposite: that parents in particular were meeting too many of their own needs, while ignoring their children's basic needs, especially the need for personal attention, and he blamed television for it. ''The message it's sending is, 'You can have it all, and you can have it now.' '' The result was a loss of impulse control among adults at every level of daily life. People drank too much, smoked too much, ate too much, spent too much, gambled too much and, when impeded from incessant self-gratification, whacked their spouses and children too much.
Berny Rasowsky, the county social worker, was continually amazed at his clients' inability to manage their incomes, and at the crazy choices they made: ''I see people who have enough income, on paper, to have a manageable existence. Yet they don't.''
He told me about a young woman who worked as a dishwasher, with a partial welfare subsidy. She rented a whole living room full of furniture, including a television and a VCR, for about $3,000 a year. ''To explain to her that she could save her money and buy the stuff for so much less, that it was a matter of being patient, was impossible,'' he said.
The reasons advanced for the rise in sexual abuse were recondite and surprising.
''What I see is boundaries getting crossed in household roles,'' said Sandy Hunt. ''Children performing parental responsibilities, preparing meals, doing household chores - the parentified-child syndrome.''
''Lots of older daughters take on this caretaker role,'' said Berny Rasowsky, ''and somehow they perceive that the role entails wifelike duties to the boyfriend, the stepfather. They also do it to keep peace in the house.''
The figures on teen pregnancy were much sketchier than the abuse statistics. The county began recording them only in November 1987, and the cases included only those that came through the social-service pipeline. Henry Long, a physician's assistant in the storefront medical clinic, is often the first one to discover that a teen-ager is pregnant. On average, they're five to six weeks along and have come in because they've missed a period. If they inquire about abortion, he directs them to Planned Parenthood over in Saratoga. I asked him if the local kids appeared to be ignorant about birth control.
''No,'' he shook his head adamantly. ''They just don't bother with it. They're careless. It's silly. Everything's at their disposal, but they just don't utilize it.'' When I was interviewing the kids down at the youth center, I asked how many of them knew a teen-ager who was, or had been, pregnant. All the hands went up. I was shocked when one of the boys, a 14-year-old, proudly volunteered that his sister was pregnant - shocked because I was acquainted with their mother. She was still a young woman, in her early 30's, who worked very hard at a regular full-time job. She had raised her four children without a husband and without any help from welfare. Now her daughter was about to enter the same miserable cycle.
She agreed to submit to an interview if I didn't use her name - ''it's such a small town,'' she said - or mention where she worked. Born locally, and raised in a distressed family with an alcoholic father, she got pregnant at 16 and quit school.
The first baby's father was a mill hand in his early 20's. The couple was pressured by their parents to marry, she said, but she called it off three days before the wedding. Later, she had two more children with another young man. Returning from a trip out of state, she caught the boyfriend with another woman, ''left him cold, and never saw him again.'' He moved elsewhere and has never seen their two children again. She receives no support from him. This woman moved back home with her mother briefly, working as a grocery clerk and an apple picker, among other jobs. In time, she met another man, married him and moved to Florida. He proved to be a drug abuser. The marriage lasted four months. She was pregnant with a fourth child when she returned alone to upstate New York. That was 10 years ago.
When she learned that her oldest child was pregnant at 15, she ''cried all night long.''
Her daughter is determined to have the child, but doesn't intend to marry the father. He will continue going to community college and work to support the baby. As things stand now, she will remain at home and, in theory at least, find some way to finish high school while caring for a baby. Her mother insists that she must hold at least a part-time job - she currently works at McDonald's in the next town. It is hard to imagine that this pregnant girl will escape the Social Services trap. If nothing else, she'll need Medicaid for the baby's pediatric care. ''I've made it very clear that I'm not going to walk out on them,'' her mother said. ''But I'm not giving up my Saturday nights as a single woman to sit home and babysit. She got herself into trouble. You can't go around holding their hands. Hell, I'm still practically a kid myself. It's a no-win situation. We all lose.''
I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED with David Bullard 11 years ago when I was dead-broke, waiting for my first novel to come out, and he hired me to work as a straw boss in his apple orchard at harvest time. These days our relations are a lot less formal, though I call him ''Squire'' and he calls me ''Kommander.'' As a side benefit I get to picnic in his orchard and listen to him talk about local history, which he does with surpassing verve.
''We like to think that the American victory at Saratoga settled matters, but right down until 1783 the British kept raiding, even though Burgoyne surrendered,'' Bullard told me one sleeting autumn night beside his hearth in the house that had served as a British field hospital 200 years ago. ''What really produced Schuylerville was the Yankee invasion, when Governor Gerry of Massachusetts - who lent his name to the word gerrymander - instituted a head tax. My ancestor Alpheus arrived in 1810, from Sturbridge, set up as a merchant, had a sawmill, an inn, a farm, and lots of sons.'' These offspring started the bank, founded the first paper mill, practiced medicine, presided over the school board and built much of the business district. David, 59, and his two teen-age children are now the last remaining Bullards in town. Their orchard of roughly 200 acres has ''been in fruit'' since 1899. They own an additional 200 acres in woods, and corn and hay fields that they lease out. Bullard has often been subject to the blandishments of developers who, hungrily eyeing his property, seek to cash in on the lively Saratoga real-estate market by building condominiums. So far, he has heroically resisted. I say heroically because, like many other farmers, Bullard could have sold out for a tidy million or so and retired to some palm-sheltered strand. But he loves his farm and the work it requires, and he loves the old decaying village nearby, with all its history, and his view of the Hudson as it meanders south from the Adirondacks. At the same time, he is keenly aware of the changes happening in his village.
''As an employer of up to 60 people, I have a certain feel for what's going on,'' Bullard said, lighting the corncob pipe that tends to disguise the fact that he went to school abroad and speaks both French and Japanese fluently. ''I import apple pickers from Florida at great expense. Those people average $14 an hour, and I can't find anyone in Schuylerville who wants to pick apples for $14 an hour. I know I'm living on borrowed time because these pickers are becoming upwardly mobile in Florida. So I'm furiously planting dwarf trees in the forlorn hope that I'm going to be able to get local people to come out and pick these apples without ladders. In fact, it's almost put me out of business to place myself in a position where I'll be able to cope in five years - or my successors in 20 years.''
The local people won't pick fruit, but they are willing to pack apples for shipment after the harvest. It's easier work, though it pays less. ''The phone in the packing house rings 25 times a day,'' Bullard said, ''the babysitter wanting to know where the spare box of diapers is. I'm paying the woman between $6 and $9 an hour, she's paying her babysitter maybe $3.50, she's half nuts all the time worrying what's going on at home - but she drives a brand-new pick-up to work!'' For other families, it doesn't pay to work. ''I have people come to me and say they want to work, but only under the table,'' Bullard said. ''They don't want to report anything because they're going to lose their money from the Government. The system is tipping people on the margin over the wrong way. Once they start down, they keep falling, and become the bottom feeders in society.''
My old brick cottage in the village was a semi-wreck when I bought it three years ago, its original charm concealed behind wild growths of box elder on the outside and cheap paneling on the inside. It was built around 1900, by an Italian who painted angels on the bedroom ceilings. The cellar was full of wooden crates from a local soda-bottling operation that had gone out of business before World War I. Perhaps the Italian worked there. He is gone, of course, the details of his existence lost in history, like the thousands of boatmen who plied the canal, or the men who labored in the Liberty wallpaper factory, or the nameless British dragoon who was unearthed, along with the skeleton of his horse, when David Bullard's great-uncle Dan dug the foundation for his paper mill in 1866.
Town historian Tom Wood, who remembered his excitement as a farm boy coming into the village for street dances on summer nights in the 1950's, said, ''I feel that Schuylerville is sleeping.''
In 1913, the state of New York dredged the Hudson and re-routed the Champlain Canal. At the rapids north of the village, they built new locks that could accommodate bigger barges. A mile-long remnant of the old canal still runs through town, full of carp and bullfrogs. When I moved in, much of the old towpath beside it was overgrown with impassable honeysuckle thickets. Then, last summer, Tom Wood's scout troop went in with brushcutters and cleared it, so it is now possible to walk from the heart of the village clear up to Lock 5 on a turf-covered road where mules once trod pulling barges loaded with potatoes, lumber and lime.
Following the towpath its entire length for the first time one fall day, I felt happily reconnected with the past. No more than 20 yards to my right, the mighty Hudson flowed parallel to the canal. V-shaped squadrons of Canada geese honked raucously overhead. In this setting, the troubled present was detectable only in the broken smokestack of an idle mill across the river, and in the distant whine of trucks on Route 4 hauling their cargoes of Smurfs, snack foods and Nintendo games. That day, the past seemed to have more in common with the future than it does with the present. Many schemes have been advanced in recent years for promoting the economy of Schuylerville. The worst schemes, it seems to me, are those pegged to tourism and to supposedly endless supplies of leisure and gasoline, as if the village could become, say, the Colonial-history zone of a continent-sized theme park. Others view the town's future as a bedroom community for Saratoga and even Albany, a good hour away. These scenarios seem improbable to me because they simply seek to inject doses of prosperity from somewhere outside.
What remains is the Hudson River, source of all the town's past wealth. It is a more benign river in some ways than it was at the turn of the century, for the Sacandaga reservoir now collects the massive spring runoff out of the Adirondacks that used to cause regular devastating floods, and it is a cleaner river than it was 10 years ago, though hardly pristine. Today, the life of the town could hardly be more disconnected from the river. Schuylerville, and towns like it in the Hudson and Mohawk valleys, changed because their local economies ceased to matter, and it is only now beginning to dawn on us that you cannot have a community without a local economy. To buy things made far away, sold by merchants who also live far away, is to be a colony.
I think we are entering an era when small towns will have no choice except to reinvent truly local economies using local assets. The Hudson is Schuylerville's prime asset. To me, a plausible future for the town is one in which people rediscover the river's value and harness its power to make something useful in a way that is not harmful and wasteful. And in the process, perhaps, rediscover their own value.

HEADLINE: JUNGLE IS WINNING THE COCAINE WAR

 BODY:
The battle in the jungle is doomed from the outset as again the Bush Administration -- like its predessors -- ignores a basic tenet of economics: if there is no demand, there will be no need for supply (''In the Cocaine War, the Jungle Is Winning,'' by Michael Massing, March 4). The produce of the jungles in South America is feeding what the article refers to as ''the nation's immense, insatiable habit.'' Drug traffickers are engaged in bringing their product to a busy marketplace.
Interdict all you want. Give the military a new role as drug police. Pour billions into the War on Drugs. None of it will help if we as people do not find an answer to why can't we face modern life without being high. It's so much easier to send in the troops and continue the delusion that we're really doing something about the problem.

HEADLINE: HOW THE TAX CUT LOOKS NOW

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:

THE GROWTH EXPERIMENT
How the New Tax Policy
Is Transforming the U.S. Economy.
By Lawrence Lindsey.
260 pp. New York: Basic Books. $21.95.
Lawrence Lindsey is the most ecumenical of supply-siders, that tireless band of researchers, editorial writers and lobbyists who brought the gospel of lower taxes to Washington and made a convert of Ronald Reagan. He may also be the least inclined to hyperbole. A Harvard professor of economics who is now serving in the Bush Administration, Mr. Lindsey apparently understands the risks in claiming more than he can deliver. 
It should not be surprising, then, that in ''The Growth Experiment'' he has written a careful and sometimes convincing defense of the 1981 tax cut that put fear and loathing into the heart of the economics establishment. Nor should it really come as a shock that his agenda for further tax reform meshes with the views of a lot of people with no particular affection for Ronald Reagan or George Bush. For the catch to the message of sophisticated supply-siders like Mr. Lindsey is not in what it says about economic efficiency, but in what it usually does not say about the distribution of income.
There was a good case to be made in 1981 for using tax incentives to stimulate work, savings and innovation. But it was the politics of greed, not the economics of the supply side, that dictated the decision to deny lower-income workers most of the benefits. (And the current maneuvering by the President to cut capital gains suggests that Marie Antoinette is alive and well and running a political action committee.) The massive 1981 cut in personal and corporate income taxes was sold to Congress as the ultimate free lunch: the revenues to be reaped from accelerated economic growth, supply-siders insisted, would fully offset the initial losses. Mr. Lindsey concedes that the supply-siders overstated the case, but says that lunch did prove to be a lot cheaper than the skeptics predicted. Roughly two-thirds of the direct costs of the tax cut, he calculates, were recouped. And the offsetting revenues would have been even greater, he suggests, if Congressional Democrats had not engaged in a bidding war with the Republicans over who could deliver the most to business lobbies.
Mr. Lindsey dissembles. It is more than a little slippery for supply-siders to claim full credit for the recovery from the 1980-82 recession and the associated rebound in tax revenues. While the tax cut certainly did lift demand and thereby stimulate the economy, this job might have been better done through an easing of credit by the Federal Reserve. That would have left the economy with both lower interest rates and a lower trade deficit, permitting sustained growth through the 1980's without dependence on hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign capital.
The most interesting chapters in the book are those in which Mr. Lindsey parts company, implicitly or explicitly, with the Reagan party line. In spite of the big income tax cut, he notes, Federal tax revenues as a portion of national income remained near historical peaks during the Reagan years. Thus the primary cause of the ballooning budget deficits had to be increased spending and, in particular, defense spending: by 1987 the cumulative increase in defense outlays under Ronald Reagan amounted to $275 billion, half the total increase in debt.
Mr. Lindsey also acknowledges that ''middle- and working-class taxpayers still bear [tax] burdens far greater than they have through most of the nation's history.'' After much to-ing and fro-ing about ''fairness,'' he calls for tax reform that would have fit nicely into George McGovern's Presidential platform. He would impose a flat rate of 19 percent, with generous exemptions that eliminate income taxes for a family of four earning up to $22,000.
Mr. Lindsey cannot resist a spirited (and partly on-the-mark) defense of the current effort to offer tax breaks on capital gains. But unlike President Bush, he would link the tax preference to the closing of what is probably the most egregious loophole in the tax code: the exemption of estates from capital gains taxes.
Taxing capital gains at death would have collected $5 billion last year, mostly from the estates of the very rich. Moreover, by eliminating the incentive to hold appreciated assets until death, it would dismantle a supply-side barrier to the free movement of capital.
Mr. Lindsey is thus the sort of Reaganite liberals as well as conservatives could learn to work with, if not love. One reason to read ''The Growth Experiment'' is to get a look at the best face of supply-side economics. Another is to understand the tragedy in the co-optation of the supply side by the guardians of economic privilege.

HEADLINE: About Cars

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon;
Oldsmobile's Line of 'Trucks'

 BODY:
A truck from Oldsmobile?
Well, yes. Olds used to sell trucks. And if you look it up in the Standard Catalog of American Light Duty Trucks from Krause Publications of Iola, Wis., you will find such gems as a commercial version of the 1904 curved-dash Olds and that other hot-ticket item, the Economy Canopied Express, meant for vending fruits and vegetables.
True, the last of those came off the line 66 years ago. And, true, Oldsmobile's best-selling truck was a 1920 model. True, too, the 1990 version is only sort of a truck. But it surely isn't a car. 
Olds calls it a Silhouette, and it is one of three new vans from General Motors, the others being the Chevrolet Lumina APV (for all-purpose vehicle) and Pontiac's Trans Sport. They roll like peas off the same conveyor belt at Tarrytown, N.Y., and the big difference between them is their equipment and resultant window stickers.
These vans are straight out of the space age, with beautiful plastic bodies over steel frames, a la the sadly defunct Pontiac Fiero. They have fuel-injected V6 engines, front-wheel drive, acres of windshield, and a profile that would do a monorail proud.
Silhouette is, in fact, the most apt of names for a design that Oldsmobile would like to think is one giant step for van-kind.
Swoopy and innovative as it is, one might question its effect on sales of conventional Olds station wagons. Obviously, the question has occurred to Oldsmobile's brass, but the division's general marketing manager, Michael Grimaldi, said he is confident in his brave new world.
''There is a stable group of buyers out there who want the traditional station wagon,'' he said, noting that Olds will continue to offer its midsize and fullsize wagons, the Cutlass Cruiser and Custom Cruiser. ''But the minivan market has exploded. Sales now are about 800,000 a year, and we see that growing to a million or more in the 90's.''
For this first year of the decade, Olds hopes to sell 30,000 Silhouettes, and Grimaldi was frank about the lack of outward difference among the three G.M. minivans.
''What we are offering is a fully equipped van, a leading entry in the upscale market,'' he said. That means a vehicle with a base price of $17,195 and a high end approaching $20,000.
The standard van has two bucket seats aft and a middle bench that seats three. The more expensive tester, maroon with matching leather interior, had four buckets in back. Leather was a $650 option and then there was the ''touring'' suspension that cost $232. What with other items, it added up to a take-home price of $19,587.
From the side, the Silhouette features a smooth upper surface that sweeps from front bumper to the trailing edge of the roof. The windshield is raked at a 66-degree angle, and the clean exterior produces a very low .30 coefficient of drag.
The windshield measures 17.25 square feet, about a third larger than a full-size sedan's, and that creates problems at the same time that it produces fuel-saving aerodynamics and space-capsule good looks. For one thing, it could easily have meant an interior for growing orchids.
The hothouse problem was headed off with a layer of metallic film embedded in the glass to reduce solar rays by about 60 percent. But the effort to create some sort of sensible interior was less successful, and the sheer sprawl of the dash is the thing that gives pause to every first-time occupant.
Behind the wheel, you stare out at a 3-foot-deep plain of matte black, and the thought occurs that it is totally wasted space - and space that will be very hard to clean. What doesn't occur at first glance - but what becomes painfully obvious the first time that you drive into the sun - is the size of the vents needed to defrost so much glass. The vents reflect perfectly on the inside of the windshield and create large blind spots.
Then there was the way the van felt on the road.
Even with the optional larger wheels and stiffer suspension, the Silhouette wallows. It nibbles this way and that. It feels top-heavy and it behaves even worse than most vans, which generally are no great shakes in the handling department.
The problem is not peculiar to Oldsmobile, however, and I know that because I had the same difficulty with a preproduction Pontiac Trans Sport last year. At the time, I forgave the bad manners because it was a hand-built prototype. But it is hard to forgive in a production model.
Still, the Silhouette cruises easily at 65 or 70 on smooth pavement, and its 120-horsepower engine makes it economical, if not quick off the mark. The roofline is low enough to make it suitable for most garages, and the seats, which weigh only 34 pounds, are easy to remove when you want to carry cargo instead of cronies.
Which brings us to one more complaint - one that this time can't be made.
For years, I have grumbled about cars that have no place to put coffee cups. But the Silhouette's seatbacks fold to create trays, each with two cupholders. There are, further, dual cupholders in a dashboard tray, two cupholders molded into the glovebox lid and twin cupholders in the left rear wheelhousing, meaning that the Olds van offers accomodation for 14 cups and cans.
In a six-passenger vehicle, that satisfies even me.

HEADLINE: IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester;
New York City's Losses, Fairfield's Gains

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A SURGE of leasing activity in Fairfield County, particularly by companies moving out of New York City, is turning Fairfield commercial realtors here bullish for the first time in almost three years.
In spite of 3-point rise in the office vacancy rate last year, to around 25 percent, optimism is buoyed by the steady absorption of existing space coupled with a steep decline in new construction.
The Southwestern Area Commerce & Industry Association, a business council based in Stamford and covering southwestern Connecticut, found in a recent study that 81 companies moved or planned to move into Fairfield County in 1989. Of the total, 48 were from New York City, with the rest from elsewhere in New York State, New Jersey, Colorado, California and other states. Stamford, which benefited substantially, contains some 14 million square feet of the county's total of about 40 million square feet of commercial space. 
While fewer large corporations are moving to the suburbs, a greater number of small companies and divisions of companies are searching for quarters there, in some cases taking small portions of buildings originally occupied by a single corporation.
Among the companies that have settled or expanded in Fairfield in the past year are Deloitte Touche, with 130,000 square feet in Wilton; Cadbury Schweppes, with a 46,000-square-foot research and development center in Trumbull and a relocation of its international beverage headquarters from London to its existing Stamford office; US West Capital Corporation of Denver to 29,000 square feet in Stamford; W. R. Grace & Company with 26,000 square feet in Stamford; and National Securities and Research with 28,800 square feet in Greenwich.
''The cost of doing business in New York, particularly rents, was one reason for moving,'' said Michael Lynch, executive vice-president of National Securities and Research, a mutual fund management firm. ''More importantly, we serve the public nationwide, and the abruptness with which our New York employees treated people was getting to be a problem. Up here they are more civil, and because there are not many firms, they can't go across the street for another $20 a week.''
Rick Rich, senior vice president of the F. D. Rich Company, Stamford's largest builder, said: ''The cycle is returning, based on the fiscal and social deterioration in New York City. This area continues to have the quality of life and allure it had in the 1970's, and it's still only 40 minutes to Manhattan.''
Paul King Jr., senior vice-president at Grubb & Ellis Realtors in Stamford, takes a more cautious view. ''A handful of Stamford buildings have gone bankrupt and others are having cash flow problems resulting from free-rent deals,'' he said. ''Some lenders are dictating lease agreements that can dislocate tenants down the road in order to facilitate the sale of a building.''
Holger Arning, a broker with William Pitt & Company Realtors in Stamford, said that ''in the first two months of this year we have had 10 announcements of moves out of New York City into the Stamford area totaling 195,000 square feet.''
In addition to moves by financial companies, management consultants, auditors and back-office bank operations, Mr. Arning said ''I have a list of 150 maritime brokers, agents, insurers and owners that have relocated in Fairfield County as a result of the decline of New York's freight piers replaced by container ports in New Jersey.''
''CONNECTICUT is still appealing for New York companies because of its lack of a personal income tax,'' said Stephen B. Heintz, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development. ''It's surprising how powerful that is. And our total tax picture compares favorably with New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.''
Connecticut's corporate tax rate is 11.5 percent, with a surcharge on net income that the state legislature increased last year from 15 to 20 percent, to the dismay of many businesses. ''That produces an effective overall rate of 13.6 percent,'' said Mr. Heintz.
The basic corporate tax rate in Manhattan is 8.85 percent, but the total New York tax structure is higher, plus operating costs of around $16 a foot (compared with Fairfield's average of $6 a foot) and rents up to $25 a foot higher than the $17 to $25 range in Fairfield.
John Foster, senior vice-president at Cushman & Wakefield Realtor's Stamford office, noted that ''we have several potential tenants requiring hundreds of thousands of square feet for whom there is not enough space.''
''There are limited opportunities for large rentals at Primerica in Greenwich, and in Stamford at 300 Atlantic Street and 177 Broad Street,'' he said, referring to two buildings recently completed by the F. D. Rich Company. An additional 1 million square feet of space is projected countywide by Albert B. Ashforth Realtors, to be completed by the end of 1991.
Another F. D. Rich building, erected for the Singer Company in the 1970's, was taken over along with the chairmanship of the company in 1988 by Paul Bilzerian. Of the total 242,000 square feet, 137,000 square feet is occupied by Singer - now called Bi-Coastal - and seven sublease tenants. The rest is vacant.
Other companies based in Stamford - swallowed up in buyouts that left the city with a vacancy rate that zoomed from 18 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1988 - have disappeared altogether. But many original, unleveraged corporations that remain principal occupants of their buildings have adopted subleasing as an alternative to empty space resulting from reduced operations. Champion International and General Reinsurance in Stamford, Union Carbide in Danbury, and Primerica in Greenwich, for example, have taken in or are seeking boarders.
Stamford's Grand List, the annual compilation of all taxable properties, grew by almost $250 million a year through the 1980's to $6 billion this year, based on 1981 property values. In 1991 the city will do the 10-year revaluation required by all Connecticut municipalities. ''At that time the Grand List will jump to between $16 and $18 billion, the largest in the state,'' said Paul Pacter, Stamford's Commissioner of Finance.
''We will have a very diversified market in the end,'' said David Doern of Rostenberg Doern, Fairfield-Westchester Realtors. ''With so much space filled by 30,000- to 50,000-foot users rather than dominated by Fortune 500 companies, the region will feel less shock from economic upheavals.''

HEADLINE: Everyman Image Was Governor's Asset

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
AFTER more than nine years in office, William A. O'Neill is still often regarded - and will likely be remembered - as the state's accidental Governor, a caretaker who held the office through luck, timing and political skill.
Mr. O'Neill, who announced on Tuesday that he had finally decided not to seek a third term, was Lieutenant Governor when Gov. Ella T. Grasso resigned in failing health on Dec. 31, 1980. He was administered the oath of office that day, becoming the 84th governor of Connecticut, and was elected to a full term in 1982 and re-elected in 1986.
As Governor, Mr. O'Neill dominated state politics and fiscal policy throughout the 1980's, but his stature never neared that of his popular predecessor, Mrs. Grasso, and it appeared even smaller when compared with the national reputations of the state's neighboring governors: Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Thomas H. Kean, who recently completed two terms in New Jersey.
A former bar owner from rural East Hampton, where he served on the local zoning board, Mr. O'Neill was first elected to the State House of Representatives in 1966. He served six terms as a legislator before being elected Lieutenant Governor in 1978. He was also a Democratic state party chairman, from 1975 to 1978. 
Mr. O'Neill's speech on the night he was sworn into office as Governor seemed to presage the humble, self-effacing tone of his tenure. ''I'm not sure that anyone is ever ready to be the chief executive of a state or a nation or a city,'' he said. ''But you somehow find yourself when called upon to fulfill duties that you yourself and perhaps many others do not feel you capable of.''
Mr. O'Neill, who is 59 years old, is likely to be remembered as an ordinary man and a small-town conservative who turned a lack of flamboyance into a political asset. His was a style based more on personal contact and political skill than on ideological considerations.
He enjoyed marching in parades and dancing with elderly supporters at campaign rallies. Even his occasional malaprops - ''portable'' water for ''potable'' and ''astigmatism'' for ''stigma'' - were endearing to his supporters.
Critics, however, often seized upon his style, or lack thereof. In 1986, he was described as ''unprofessional, unprepared,unresponsive, unimaginative and totally uninspiring'' by Toby Moffett, a fellow Democrat who tried to force a Democratic primary against Mr. O'Neill.
The lowest blow, though, may have come in 1987, when a Republican legislator, Reginald J. Smith of New Hartford, the Senate minority leader and currently a gubernatorial candidate, called Mr. O'Neill a ''potato head,'' a reference to the Governor's round face, short-cropped hair and plodding demeanor.
 
Revenge at the Ballot Box
Mr. O'Neill always scoffed at those who attacked his style. ''I'm a workhorse, not a show horse,'' he once said. ''To be a good leader, you have to have a calming effect on people, rather than the other way around.''
And his revenge came at the ballot box. In 1982, he easily defeated his Republican opponent, Lewis B. Rome. In 1986, the Governor proved what a formidable power broker he could be when he blocked Mr. Moffett from collecting the 20 percent of the party's delegates necessary at the nominating convention. He later went only to defeat the Republican, Julie D. Belaga of Westport, by a landslide.
In 1988, United State Senator Joseph I. Lieberman called Mr. O'Neill ''the most underestimated man in Connecticut politics.''
The son of a chauffeur who opened the bar that Mr. O'Neill sold in 1989, the Governor was a combat flier in the Air Force during the Korean War and sold insurance after attending New Britain Teachers College and the University of Hartford.
He lost his first two bids for the State House of Representatives, in 1960 and 1962. In 1966, after a redistricting squabble forced cancellation of the 1964 election, Mr. O'Neill surprised many observers by beating the Middletown candidate for the Democratic nomination. He finally won the seat in 1966 by 67 votes.
In 1974, Mrs. Grasso, then a United States Representative, picked Mr. O'Neill to manage her 1974 campaign for governor. When John M. Bailey, the Democratic chairman for 30 years, died in April 1975, she backed Mr. O'Neill to fill the remainder of the term, and soon Mr. O'Neill was holding that job along with the position of House majority leader.
When Mrs. Grasso was renominated in 1978 and declined to endorse a running mate, Mr. O'Neill won the battle for lieutenant governor against the state's most ambitious Democrats, including Mr. Lieberman. Two years later, Mr. O'Neill became Governor himself. ''We walked in with great humility and pride, and we walk out the same way,'' Mr. O'Neill said on Tuesday as he stood in the formal dining room of the Governor's Residence in Hartford and told reporters that he would not run again.
Philosophically, Mr. O'Neill has been a conservative Governor who opposed a state income tax, stressed the limits of government. An important task of government is to ''bring in industry and bring in business,'' he said. ''That's what makes the whole thing go.''
He is recognized for creating four consecutive budget surpluses in the middle of the decade, setting up a rainy-day fund that has helped cover some of the state's recent budget shortfalls, improving teacher's pay to the highest in the nation outside of Alaska and responding to the collapse of the Mianus River bridge on Interstate 95 in Greenwich in 1983 with a 10-year, $6.5 billion plan of road and bridge repairs.
Mr. O'Neill's successes as Governor, however, were largely linked to the economic boom of the 1980's. His failures in the past two years, in particular his struggle to close budget shortfalls, were spurred, in large part, by the revenue drain now befalling many Northeastern state governments, a problem made worse by the reductions in Federal social programs under the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
Few chief executives can last almost a decade without scandals within their administration. Mr. O'Neill had his, though most were minor and never tainted him politically.
There was State Police Commissioner Lester J. Forst, who was discharged in 1989 after disclosure that the state police routinely tape recorded telephone calls coming in and out of barracks. There was the state tax commissioner, John G. Groppo, who resigned in 1987 after attempting to embarrass a Republican lawmaker with a secret tax file. And there was Transportation Commissioner Arthur B. Powers, who was charged with accepting bribes.
Mr. O'Neill's largest failure may have been his inability to hold back state spending in light of slowing revenue projections or to restructure the state's tax system to accommodate the fast-growing government. State spending increased at record double-digit paces throughout much of Mr. O'Neill's tenure.
The death knell for his administration may have been struck last summer, when he signed into law a $1 billion patchwork of tax increases, including a rise in the state sales tax to 8 percent, the highest in the nation. The tax hike was the largest in the state's history but was not enough to cover a shortfall of $125 million to $225 million in the fiscal year that ends June 30 and a possible $400 million gap in the next fiscal year.
Mr. O'Neill's withdrawal last week quickly put an end to the relentless attacks that have been fired at him during the past six months. Even though his belated decision left his party without a clear successor only seven months before the election, he is being publicly praised in all corners of the Democratic Party.
Even his staunchest opponents in the Republican Party are painting his departure as a statesmanlike decision. ''Any time any warrior departs the field of battle bloodied but unbowed, regardless of what side they are on, you feel respect,'' said the Republican state chairman, Richard Foley. '' I respect him.''
As for Mr. O'Neill, who as recently as March 15 said he would run for re-election, he will likely spend his last months in office being feted and toasted. He may even grow into a position as a sort of Everyman's eminence of the Democratic Party.
In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. O'Neill said he remained convinced that his policies were right and fair. He maintained that he could have won re-election despite the polls that gave him huge negative job-approval ratings. He also refused to characterize his departure as surrender to his political opponents.

HEADLINE: Westchester and Suffolk Fighting For Lyme Funds

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN a case of competitive shuttle diplomacy, Westchester and Suffolk County officials have been flying back and forth to Washington to plead for Federal help in fighting Lyme disease.
At issue is $500,000 from the first Federal outlay specifically for Lyme studies. Officials from both counties came to the Department of Health and Human Services to argue why their county and why New York State would best benefit from allocations to study Lyme, the nation's fastest-growing infectious disease after AIDS.
Caught in the bureaucratic infighting, the separate requests for money have resulted in mixed reports about the future of Federal money for research on Lyme disease in Suffolk and Westchester. What is clear is that the state should get some money, but not for many months. 
The money that brought Westchester and Suffolk officials to Washington was a fraction of last year's $7 million in Federal outlays for Lyme disease: $5 million for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and $2 million for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. While the future of $500,000 of the Centers money is being decided, the remaining $1.5 million will begin the nation's first Lyme disease center in Fort Collins, Colo.
Beyond that, a maximum of $2 million in grants is available from the National Institutes of Health for Lyme disease research in the area of pathogenesis, studying why the spirochet causes the disease.
At their hours-long summit with Centers for Disease Control representatives, Suffolk officials were told to expect $250,000 in funds for New York State and that the bulk of the remaining $250,000 would go directly to their county. But the Westchester County delegation, who had met with Centers for Disease Control and Health and Human Service officials a few weeks earlier, say they were promised the entire $500,000, probably in the form of a special Westchester County-based study on Lyme disease, where the incidence of the disease is on a par with Suffolk County's.
''We have been told by H.H.S. that we can expect a half-million dollars,'' said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who attended last month's meeting with the county's governmental relations director, Phillippe M. Gille; its public affairs director, Claire Palermo, and Dr. Gary Wormser, chief of infectious diseases at New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center.
Mr. O'Rourke added that the Washington trip was also to advertise this area as an ideal laboratory for national studies on the disease. ''Since we have the population both of ticks and victims, I felt that if they were going to do some research on Lyme, I didn't want it to be done in some place like Nevada,'' he said.
''Westchester is the Lyme disease capital,'' said Mrs. Palermo, who has the disease. Last year the county, which has a smaller population than Suffolk, reported almost as many cases of Lyme disease, and twice the number of cases it recorded in 1988. Suffolk and Westchester, which represent 44 percent of all Lyme disease cases nationwide, reported 1,169 and 1,159 cases last year, respectively.
Acknowledging that Suffolk also claims to be the hotbed of Lyme disease, Mrs. Palermo said, ''It is a strange contest. We're just trying to get our fair share.''
So is Suffolk. ''That's one of the reasons we called this meeting,'' said Representative George Hochbrueckner of Centereach. ''Because we read that the money would go to Westchester.'' He brought the Centers for Disease Control officials together toward the end of February with Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin, County Health Commissioner Dr. David Harris, Dr. Dennis White of the State Health Department and Dr. Raymond J. Dattwyler, who heads the Lyme Disease Center at State University at Stony Brook.
''Lyme disease has had a tremendous economic impact on us,'' said Mr. Halpin. ''Not only has there been the cost of treatment, but this has had a devastating impact on our tourist industry, especially out on the East End.''
Suffolk officials argue that since their county has the highest incidence of Lyme disease, as well as the better ''research infrastructure,'' both within the County Health Department and at the State University at Stony Brook, Federal funds would be more efficiently used in Suffolk.
Despite reports of pledges made, officials at the Centers for Disease Control say they are making no promises.
''I don't want to dispute what they say, but there are no such specific plans for the money,'' said Anne Sims, spokeswoman for the Centers, which has headquarters in Atlanta. She added, ''I don't think we'll even know who gets what until the end of the year.''
Additional word from Dr. George Hardy, who heads the Centers' Washington office, confirmed ''no guarantees'' for Lyme funding, and that no more than $250,000 had been earmarked for research applications from New York.
 
Backbiting
Those familiar with the workings of Federal funding in general and with the Lyme disease efforts in particular say that such confusion is not unusual. Noting that feuds over money, methods and medical priorities have been ripening for years, they caution that it will only get worse as the spreading disease brings more competition for scarce Federal grants.
''There's more to Lyme disease than ticks biting people,'' said Karen Vanderhoof Forschner, president of the Lyme Disease Borreliosis Foundation in Tolland, Conn., the nation's first and only Lyme referral network. ''The real story is behind the scenes: the backbiting, the infighting. From what I understand, this is exactly like what happened in the early days with AIDS.''
Representatives from the two counties say they are not trying to be competitive, they are just serious about fighting a disease that is becoming increasingly costly to combat. From salaries to testing, Westchester spent a total of $384,000 on Lyme disease last year and Suffolk paid out $200,000 to $250,000.
''If the people in Westchester can do a task better than we can, then they should do it,'' said Dr. Dattwyler of Stony Brook. ''But considering the facilities and the tests that need to be made, I don't think they can do it.''
''The idea is to lick this thing, and not to have competition between Westchester and Suffolk,'' said Mr. Gille, who was among the group of Westchester officials who returned to Washington last week to meet with the Congressional delegation to discuss, among other things, Lyme funding.
''But we think that the prevalence of cases is here. And besides, Suffolk is getting most of available funding already, through state allocations to Stony Brook.''
In fact, the great majority of the state's Lyme disease money distributed by the Tick-Borne Institute in Albany, about $400,000 over the last two years, has gone to Westchester. ''There are seven projects that have been funded now,'' said Vicki Zeldin, spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department. ''Most of them happen to be in Westchester.''
But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget, submitted in January, reduced the Tick-Borne Institute's budget to $150,000 for next year, making Federal money increasingly important. Also in question are state grants of $100,000 that went to Lyme disease research at New York Medical College last year and the $250,000 that paid for similar studies at Stony Brook.
Gloria Wenk, an educator in Dutchess County, which received $24,000 in state money (the only state grantee outside Westchester) said that, considering the severity of budget problems, parochialism would be ''very self-centered.''
Added Ms. Wenk, who is a member of the Tick-Borne Institute advisory committee, ''Some of these counties insist that they're the only ones who have a problem. But they have to look at the big picture. The disease is spreading. This is no longer just a local problem.''
Lyme disease has now spread to 44 states, with about 80 percent of the cases in the six northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. About 20 percent of the nation's Lyme victims are in California, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Mr. Hochbrueckner, who was instrumental in obtaining much of last year's Federal Lyme funding, will be pushing for more money in the fiscal 1991 budget. President Bush has proposed $2 million for the Centers for Disease Control; Mr. Hochbrueckner will seek an additional $3 million.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Forschner, a lobbyist who was stricken with the disease in 1984, says she has recently elicited a pledge of $7 million to $10 million in new money from the Senate Appropriations Committee. She added that she was wary about having this publicized. ''When some of these people hear about more money, they'll tear apart the Appropriations Committee'' to get the money for their own localities, she said. Mrs. Forschner says she has been charged with drawing up a list of national spending priorities for possible appropriations.
J. Michael Hall, Senate majority clerk for the Labor, Health and Human Services subcommittee, confirmed a rosy future for Lyme appropriations. ''Any disease that is trendy has potential,'' said Mr. Hall, who added that the $7 million to $10 million figure is not out of the question.
But the next few years may turn out to be crucial for Federal money for Lyme disease. ''The Appropriations Committee people say there's a diminishing return in the amount of funds spent in terms of years,'' Mrs. Forschner said. ''If someone doesn't get out there and push on Lyme disease now, it may not be such a hot topic again.''
 
SEEKING AN ACCURATE TEST FOR THE DISEASE
WHILE local governments begin to expand their search for Lyme funds, researchers continue to squabble over Lyme findings: whether the disease is treatable, whether it is fatal, and whether getting this money for research is worth all the trouble in the first place.
Tired of people engaged in ''hyping the disease,'' Dr. Raymond J. Dattwyler of Stony Brook hopes that an accurate test for the ailment will result from a concerted national Lyme effort being begun by the Centers for Disease Control.
''The tests we have are awful, and as a result, I think the disease is overdiagnosed,'' he said. ''The current lab tests can pick up spirochetes unrelated to Lyme disease. So some people are getting positive Lyme test results for something as minor as gum disease.''
Other researchers say inadequate testing could indicate an under-diagnosis. For example, the State Health Department reported about 2,328 cases of Lyme last year in Suffolk and Westchester alone and 181 cases in Nassau. But there were more than 3,000 other cases that seemed similar to Lyme but did not meet the case definition.
First recognized in 1975, Lyme disease is caused by a type of bacterium called a spirochete transmitted mainly by infected ticks found on deer or mice. Its early symptoms include a skin rash near the tick bite, aches, fever and fatigue. If left untreated, the disease can result in joint, nerve or heart problems.
''This disease is very serious, and very widespread,'' said Dr. Erica Asch. ''And even if they are treated, only 40 percent of Lyme victims feel fine.'' Dr. Asch has been working on a long-term follow-up of Lyme patients from Westchester. She said she and her colleagues, who have worked with more than 250 Lyme patients over the last year, are skeptical about those who feel Lyme is not a top priority.
''People who get this disease are unable to return to work; there have even been a couple of deaths reported,'' Dr. Asch said. Her project is threatened by the budget cuts for the state Tick-Borne Institute. ''We saw someone here who died from Lyme disease about three months ago. He was a patient who contracted the disease while emptying the lawn mower.''
Earlier this month, Gloria Wenk, a public educator who is on the Tick-Borne Institute advisory committee, got a call from a woman in Fulton County, N.Y., whose husband died of complications from Lyme disease.
Other health officials, while mindful of the importance of more research, do not see Lyme as the greatest medical need. ''It is a low priority, relative to serious heart diseases, to other infectious diseases, to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, to AIDS,'' said Dr. David E. Graham of the Suffolk Health Department. ''Influenza is far more serious in term of morbidity and mortality than Lyme disease ever was.''
Dr. Dattwyler said: ''Every few years there's a new pop disease and this is it. My feeling is that it's very important. I've dedicated my career to doing this, but if it came to funding us or funding heart disease, cancer or AIDS, we'd be last on my list.''
As the tick season approaches, medical experts agree on one thing: taking precautions. ''I think people are becoming more aware of checking themselves when they come indoors,'' said Ms. Wenk. ''You can't panic. I mean, we're bigger than these ticks.''

HEADLINE: School Takeover: Gentle Words, Tough Action

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
FIVE months into the nation's first complete state takeover of a public school system, Dr. Elena J. Scambio, the state-appointed Superintendent in Jersey City, is trying to combine the big stick with a soft touch as she seeks to lift the city's educational system from the morass it has floundered in for years.
''We will put together the absolutely most magnificent program,'' Dr. Scambio said at a recent news conference at Ferris High School called by the New Jersey Education Association to focus attention on urban education. ''I will then take it and go out and sell it and get schools to say they'd like to try it. People will have a choice.''
The gentle words are about to be accompanied by some tough action. On April 4, in accordance with the state's school intervention law, Dr. Scambio will announce a new administration structure, and many of the more than 120 people employed in the district's main office are expected to lose their jobs. 
 
A 'Leaner' Central Office
The staff members, from clerical workers to the former Superintendent of Schools, Franklin Williams, who was removed from office when the state took control of the district in October and now serves as an assistant superintendent to several elementary schools, are being evaluated on their performance and the need for their particular positions. Dr. Scambio said the new central office would be ''leaner and more finely tuned.''
''Tensions are high and anxiety levels are great,'' said Dr. Scambio, who has scheduled placement and retirement counseling to ease the transition for those who are let go.
 
'The Tip of the Iceberg'
Administrators are not the only ones feeling pressured. A comprehensive assessment of the district's principals began in January, and dismissal proceedings have been begun against 10 tenured teachers, on grounds ranging from intoxication on the job to excessive absenteeism and poor performance. ''That's just the tip of the iceberg,'' Dr. Scambio said. Yet despite a growing list of potential antagonists, Dr. Scambio, a former Essex County Superintendent of Schools, seems to be gaining new friends daily. The New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union, has commended her as a ''strong leader and a strong decision-maker,'' and the district's newly appointed 15-member School Board, which serves in an advisory capacity, is equally supportive.
''We're supporting her 100 percent,'' said Nadia Makar, one of the board's two municipally appointed members. ''When parents complain about things that have been neglected for years and years, she does them almost overnight, and she always follows up on board members' suggestions.''
Dr. Walter J. McCarroll, an assistant commissioner with the New Jersey Department of Education, who is overseeing the takeover initiative, said Dr. Scambio's ''style is really ideal for this kind of situation.'' He said, ''She gets a very quick fix on problems.''
Where concerns have been raised, they have more to do with the wisdom of the state's intervention plan than with Dr. Scambio's management abilities. Critics contend that the Department of Education's inexperience with city schools and lack of success in the few urban initiatives it has undertaken make it a poor candidate for making any real improvement.
The Jersey City district is the state's second largest school district, after Newark's, and encompasses 35 schools and nearly 28,000 students.
The state began its effort to take over Jersey City's schools nearly two years ago after the district repeatedly failed to meet state standards over the course of four years. The takeover attempt led to a protracted legal dispute between Jersey City's Board of Education and the Department of Education that was settled only after an administrative law judge ruled in favor of the intervention and the board decided not to appeal.
Immediately after the State Board of Education approved the takeover last Oct. 4, the city's school board was abolished and several top administrators were removed. The state began its control of all aspects of the school district for a minimum of five years.
So far, Dr. Scambio's efforts have been focused on three broad initiatives. The key element of her improvement plan is a ''site-based management'' system in which teachers, principals and parents will have a greater voice in the operations of their schools begining next fall. Advisory councils of teachers and parents are being formed, and principals will be given a say in budgetary and personnel matters.
''School empowerment will give our teachers, our administrators and our parents a feeling of ownership in this district and its future,'' Dr. Scambio said. A series of magnet schools was to be a cornerstone of the system, but that part of the plan has suffered a serious setback because of a decision by Gov. Jim Florio to suspend financing of New Jersey's controversial choice initiative, which would have provided Jersey City with the funds to set up the specialized schools. Dr. Scambio said that Jersey City would use its own funds to develop a magnet system, but that the lack of state support would delay the opening of the schools.
In a second element of her plan, Dr. Scambio is asking the business community to contribute gifts, scholarships, teaching grants, after-school and summer jobs and other help.
Among those who have responded, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has provided choir robes, the Hudson County Chamber of Commerce has agreed to pay for new band uniforms and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority offered free tickets to the Ice Capades for students with good attendance records. Donated billboards and bumper stickers are also promoting support of the public schools.
The problem of aging and neglected school buildings is the final point of focus. At Dickinson High School, a drab cafeteria has been brightened with new paint and furniture, and windows have been installed to afford a view of the New York skyline. The menu plan has been overhauled with students' opinions, and the once underused lunchroom now has waiting lines.
In other schools, there is an effort to remove graffiti as soon as the markings appear, and a long-range construction and renovation plan is under development. ?he intervention law was passed in 1988 after two years of intense debate in the Legislature. Despite substantial revisions to the original proposal, Dr. Scambio said she believed there were some major flaws in the legislation, including the lack of a mechanism to raise capital for construction projects.
It is in the area of finance that Dr. Scambio and the Department of Education may disagree most.
''The position we've taken for three years is that there have been sufficient funds,'' Dr. McCarroll said. ''It's a question of where it is spent. The budget she currently has is a reasonable budget.''
But Dr. Scambio is not so certain that the district's $197 million budget is sufficient. ''I don't know about that,'' she said. ''I'm not sure there is enough money.''
In a budget for next year Dr. Scambio will request increases in a number of areas, including textbooks, additional guidance counselors and after-school programs. There are many other things she would like to have asked for, like a program for children as young as 6 months old, but she has put those wishes aside for now because of economic reality and a lack of space.
State officials say any tax increase because of budget increases will be cushioned for Jersey City residents by an expected reduction in administrative costs and a provision in the intervention law that enables state aid to be distributed to takeover districts on a current year basis, rather than a prior year one.
Jersey City's municipal governing body is also exercising a provision of the intervention law that allows it to appeal for state aid if state-required improvements pose an unreasonable property tax burden.
Because of New Jersey's current fiscal crisis, a number of educators are worried about Governor Florio's commitment to the takeover effort. But Dr. Scambio said the Governor assured her late last month that she could count on his support.
More troubling, she said, was the slow pace of change in social institutions, especially in one where operations have been so ineffective that a simple work order would often take several years to complete. ''The thing that's bogging me down and consuming a lot of my time is analyzing those kinds of things so we can develop efficient and effective systems so that we can focus our energies on teaching and learning,'' she said.
Wrestling with a cold, the April 4 deadline and a job that turns up two more problems for every one that is addressed, Dr. Scambio had this to say about her assignment:
''No, it's not impossible, or I wouldn't be here doing it. But it's the nearest thing to impossible I've ever encountered.''

HEADLINE: Florio's Fast Start Draws Support And Questions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IF Gov. Jim Florio's first two months in office are any indication, he is going to leave the state much different from the way he found it.
He has shocked some people, angered others and surprised many, including his supporters, with what Richard Roper, the executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University, calls ''the breakneck speed'' with which he has addressed some issues.
Mr. Florio has appointed an environmental prosecutor and signed an auto insurance bill, two items that came right out of his gubernatorial campaign.
 
Tax Increases Sought
 Within days of signing the insurance measure, Mr. Florio called for increases in both the state sales and income taxes to help close a projected $1.4 billion gap in the state budget for 1990-91 and to finance a state takeover of welfare costs. He also plans property-tax relief and increased aid to education. 
The new insurance law, which requires insurance companies to pay $1 billion to help reduce the deficit in the state-run Joint Underwriting Association, is being challenged in court by a number of insurance carriers.
While lawyers for the state battle with the insurance industry, Mr. Florio, a Democrat, will have his hands full trying to drum up votes in the Democratic-controlled Legislature to raise the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, and to raise the top income tax rate from 3.5 percent for those earning $55,000 or more to 7 percent for those with incomes of $100,000 or higher. The changes would raise about $2.6 billion in increased revenue annually.
The curious thing about the rapid unfolding of Mr. Florio's program is that while the frenetic pace is making many of those who will have to deal with the changes nervous, the new Governor is acting more and more relaxed.
 
'Comfortable' With Proposals
At a news conference the day after he delivered his budget message to the Legislature, Mr. Florio sat in a chair in front of a roomful of reporters and, for an hour, answered questions about the budget cuts he has ordered and the need for major tax changes. At one point he said, ''I am as comfortable with what I am proposing as I have ever been about anything I have done.''
But while he is confident that what he is doing is correct, Mr. Florio acknowledged that he did not know if he had the votes to succeed. He began calling local officials and business leaders immediately after presenting his proposals and said he would campaign across the state to convince the electorate that sacrifices were needed to meet economic changes, improve urban education and provide property-tax relief for low- and middle-income residents.
He has ordered department heads to curtail spending in the current budget year, which ends June 30, and has given them spending targets they must meet in the coming fiscal year. ''I've told everyone to tighten your belts until you feel the buckle hitting your back,'' he said.
 
'Breathtaking' Speed and Scope
Mr. Roper said that one measure of how ''breathtaking'' the speed and scope of Mr. Florio's proposals have been was that ''people have completely forgotten about a governor named Tom Kean, who occupied the same chair for eight years.''
Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, faced many of the same financial problems as Mr. Florio when he took office in 1981, but he had to work them out with a Legislature that had Democratic majorities in both houses. Mr. Kean had pledged not to raise taxes during his first term, but was forced to sign increases in both the sales and income taxes to close a budget gap that grew to more than $700 million in his first year.
A worsening national economy was the chief cause for the budget woes then, as it is today. But when the economy turned around in the middle of Mr. Kean's first term, the higher taxes began creating large budget surpluses.
The largesse also inspired increased spending, and the budget grew to $12 billion from $6 billion in the 1980's.
Mr. Florio said that the failure of the Kean administration to create a rainy-day fund during the good years as a hedge against the inevitable economic downturn helped create the problems he found when he took office. Mr. Kean could not be reached for comment last week because he was out of town.
Mr. Florio did not adopt a no-tax pledge during his campaign, but he said he saw no need for new taxes. He said he was forced to change that assessment quickly when tax collection estimates used by the Kean administration to balance the current budget proved to be ''phony.''
Although the level of state aid to public schools will be the lowest in recent years in the coming school year, Mr. Roper said Mr. Florio's plan to provide $600 million in increased aid next year and to change the aid formula to eliminate the disparity in spending between affluent and poor districts and relieve the property tax burden in urban areas ''addresses something that a number of us have been talking about for five or six years when the economy was in better shape.''
But he questioned the wisdom of Mr. Florio's plan to ask for enactment of the sales tax increase this year and the income tax next year.
''I think he will have one chance and one chance only to get a major tax change,'' Mr. Roper said, ''and I think he should go for as much as he can get at one sitting, rather than try for it on a piece by piece basis.''
 
Reduction of Advantage Seen
Bill Walsh, a state and local tax expert with Arthur Andersen & Company, the financial consulting concern, said the tax increases proposed by the Governor would cause companies and individuals to think twice about moving into the state. ''It's not all that good,'' he said. ''It will reduce the state's competitive advantage over other nearby states.''
Raising the highest tax rate on gross incomes from 3.5 percent, a figure Mr. Walsh said ''psychologically seems reasonable,'' to 7 percent for the top wage earners could also make it ''more difficult for businesses to get good people,'' Mr. Walsh said.
On balance, however, he said the adverse impact ''should not be that great.''
In addition to increasing the sales tax, Mr. Florio wants to extend it to cover paper products, soaps, non-prescription drugs, telecommunications and vehicles weighing more than 18,000 pounds. Exemptions for clothing, food and prescription medicines would continue, leaving the state's tax among the least regressive in the country.
Although they say they have not yet worked out all the intermediate increments in the income tax between 3.5 and 7 percent, Florio administration officials say that most of the anticipated $1.2 billion in increased revenue will come from about 15 percent of the state's wealthiest taxpayers.
Although Mr. Florio's plan calls for the elimination of the average $184 in homestead rebates and the law that allows homeowners to deduct their property taxes from their income when computing their state income taxes, it also envisions creation of a new program that would provide up to $500 for those earning less than $65,000 if their property taxes equal more than 5 percent of their earnings.
 
Spending Political Capital
Mr. Florio, who said he recognized that he was spending much of his political capital early in his administration by proposing tough solutions, said, ''That's what I was elected to do.''
He said he knew he had given the Legislature ''a mouthful and then some'' to digest in the coming year, but added: ''I want to have a real balanced budget, not one balanced with phony fixes. I want to get the state off the fiscal roller coaster we've been on, and onto the road to real economic health.''
Norman Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, called Mr. Florio's attack on the state's fiscal problems ''refreshing.''
''I see it as populist budget plan,'' Mr. Glickman said, ''and it's interesting because he has broken three political rules - the Bush rule, 'Read my lips, no new taxes'; the Koch rule by not resorting to phony accounting practices, and, most importantly, the Reagan rule by taxing upper-income residents to help lower-income individuals.
''It's very distributive, and the relief it promises is something that mayors and homeowners have been asking for for decades. It will be tough for the short term, because of the budget cuts and the new taxes, but down the road things should be better. I think he has shown some leadership.''

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Helter-Skelter Growth? No, a Worthy Plan

BYLINE: By Christy Van Horn; Christy Van Horn is executive director of New Jersey Future, a statewide organization, based in Highland Park, that represents groups and individuals dedicated to promoting a balanced state plan.

 BODY:
CITIZENS in New Jersey know what unplanned growth will bring: a blighted environment, gridlock in farm country, cities in deeper decay, communities that have lost their sense of place.
That's why, four years ago, the New Jersey Legislature empowered the State Planning Commission to develop a comprehensive growth plan for New Jersey's future. Its action reflected the statewide consensus against helter-skelter growth.
With opinions from all sectors of society, the State Planning Commission has devised a worthy, practical draft plan for balanced growth. It's a plan that preserves the vistas that uplift us and the commerce that sustains us. But misinformation about the draft plan persists, fostered by special interests who would trade our long-range prosperity - the very quality of community life - for short-range profit. 
Opponents say it is a no-growth plan that will ruin the state's economy. On the contrary, it's a growth plan that will strengthen the state's economy. Without careful planning now, the natural and human resources that make New Jersey so attractive to corporations will be lost forever. Far from discouraging growth, the draft plan proposes to manage growth on a statewide basis, using the State Labor Department's optimistic population and employment projections.
Those who argue that corporations or entrepreneurs will bypass New Jersey unless they have free run of the land are cynical and wrong. Most businesses strive to be good citizens. They have a long-term economic stake in stable, attractive communities. That's why so many companies support the state planning process.
The draft plan promotes stability. Stability and predictability benefit developers. This has been the case in Hawaii, Oregon, and Florida, and it can be true in New Jersey as well.
Other critics worry that the plan will add another layer of bureaucracy. On close reading, the draft plan burns red tape. It recommends that state agencies, counties and municipalities coordinate regulations and streamline the permitting process in order to reduce cost and delay. Under a final plan, one-stop permits will be closer to a reality.
Everyone knows the immense problems faced by New Jersey's urban centers. Despite this recognition, some argue that too much money will go to the cities under the plan. In the 1990's, the cities must be looked to for a ''return on public investments.''
The cities are gold mines. They contain the great veins of transportation, infrastructure and humanity. It took decades of systematic disinvestment by the Federal and state governments to cripple urban areas. Thoughtful planning and reinvestment can empower the cities to be full partners in the state's prosperity.
The Planning Commission has targeted 16 of the most distressed municipalities for redevelopment assistance. The draft plan encourages the state and private sector to provide incentives for revitalization.
New Jersey cannot continue to prosper unless the cities prosper. We are interdependent. For example, the smartest solution to the impending labor shortage would be to tap the pool of human resources in the cities.
As for housing, the private market has been unable to produce the type and quantity of housing most needed throughout New Jersey: low-cost and rental. The draft plan enlarges the state's responsibility to provide incentives and policies that prod the private sector to build needed housing at a profit.
Property-rights advocates are concerned that property values will fluctuate unfairly under a state plan. However, the draft plan distributes the benefits and costs of growth more fairly. The draft plan does restrain growth in some areas to protect farmland and open space. However, speculators rather than farmers make up more than 50 percent of those demanding compensation if their land becomes less marketable.
Current public policy in state and local spending has given many landowners handsome profits. Many who anticipate a continuing pattern of windfall profits from development are worried. But government cannot guarantee profit on land speculation; clearly it should not.
To give farmers a fair shake, the draft plan encourages putting in place mechanisms like the public purchase of valuable land, the transfer of development rights like the program in Burlington County, or other innovative ways to preserve farmland and compensate farmers.
The State Planning Commission has no zoning authority. Yet many still say the plan creates statewide zoning that requires ''one house per 20 acres zoning.'' The draft plan contains policy goals and guidelines. Their application remains a function of local government zoning decisions.
The draft plan encourages growth within existing communities. It says that in order to maintain viable agricultural or natural areas, a rural community should target growth in existing towns and villages. That means efficiency in expanding infrastructure and public services. The draft plan's emphasis on good design will mean better land use and nicer, more livable communities.
It also says that outside towns and villages, a different settlement pattern is needed to protect prime agricultural land. The draft plan recommends that housing densities be determined locally and be based on the current capacity of the land and infrastructure to maintain a rural character.
What's more, New Jersey is only trying to protect its remaining 600,000 acres of farmland. In Oregon, the state plan reserves more than 16 million acres strictly for agriculture, 26 times the New Jersey goal.
Finally, critics lament that even if a final plan is adopted, it has ''no teeth'' and nothing much will change. Overnight, maybe not. But the state has broad regulatory and spending powers. They will be used to achieve the goals of a final plan. But the final plan's real strength comes from consensus - the shared agreement among New Jersey's citizenry that careful planning is the key to our future.

HEADLINE: Fighting the Competition for Funds to Fight Lyme Disease

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE first Federal allocation for studying Lyme disease is the incentive for a contest of sorts between Westchester and Suffolk Counties, whose officials are competing here for a share of the $500,000 available.
Delegations from each county have visited the Department of Health and Human Services to argue that New York State, and one of its counties in particular, would be the best recipient of the Federal funds. While it is clear that New York will be among the states to receive funds, Westchester and Suffolk are receiving conflicting reports about their chances. The two counties together represent 44 percent of all Lyme disease cases nationwide.
The money they seek is a fraction of the $7 million in Federal allocations that were approved last year for Lyme disease, the nation's fastest-growing infectious disease after AIDS. The National Institutes of Health is receiving $5 million. The Centers for Disease Control gets $2 million, including the $500,000 at issue; the remaining $1.5 million will be used to establish the nation's first Lyme disease center in Fort Collins, Colo. 
 
Westchester Delegation Is First to Arrive
In addition, there is a maximum of $2 million in grants available from the National Institutes of Health for Lyme disease research in the area of pathogenesis, studying why the spirochete causes the disease.
The Westchester delegation was the first to arrive here, meeting in February with officials of the Centers for Disease Control and of the Health and Human Services Department. Its members said they were promised the entire $500,000, probably in the form of a special Westchester County-based study on Lyme disease.
But after an hours-long conference with representatives of the Centers for Disease Control, Suffolk officials said they were told to expect that $250,000 would go to New York State and that the bulk of the remaining $250,000 would go directly to their county.
''We have been told that we can expect a half-million dollars,'' said Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who came here with the county's director of government relations, Philippe M. Gille; its public affairs director, Claire Palermo; and Dr. Gary Wormser, chief of infectious diseases at New York Medical College and the County Medical Center.
Mr. O'Rourke said the trip was an opportunity to advertise Westchester as an ideal laboratory for national studies on the disease. ''Since we have the population both of ticks and of victims,'' he said, ''I felt that if they were going to do some research on Lyme, I didn't want it to be done in some place like Nevada.''
 
Where Is the Lyme Disease Capital?
''Westchester is the Lyme disease capital,'' said Ms. Palermo, who has the disease. Although her county has a smaller population than Suffolk, the 1,159 cases of Lyme disease reported in Westchester last year almost equaled the 1,169 cases in Suffolk. The Westchester total was also double the number of cases it recorded in 1988.
Acknowledging that Suffolk also claims to be the center of Lyme disease, Mrs. Palermo said: ''It is kind of a strange contest. But we're just trying to get our fair share.'' So, of course, is Suffolk. ''We called this meeting because we read that the money would go to Westchester,'' said Representative George Hochbrueckner of Centereach, L.I., who brought together the Centers for Disease Control officials with Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin, County Health Commissioner Dr. David Harris, Dr. Dennis White of the State Health Department and Dr. Raymond J. Dattwyler, who heads the Lyme Disease Center at State University at Stony Brook, L.I.
''Lyme disease has had a tremendous economic impact on us,'' said Mr. Halpin. ''Not only has there been the cost of treatment, this has had a devastating impact on our tourist industry, especially out on the East End'' of Long Island.
 
Suffolk Makes Its Case
Suffolk officials argue that Federal funds would be more efficiently used in their county because it has the highest incidence of Lyme disease and also the better ''research infrastructure,'' within the County Health Department and at the State University at Stony Brook.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control say they are making no promises. ''I don't want to dispute what they say, but there are no such specific plans for the money,'' said Anne Sims, a spokeswoman for the agency at its headquarters in Atlanta. ''I don't think we'll even know who gets what until the end of the year.''
Dr. George Hardy, who heads the Washington office of the Centers for Disease Control, confirmed that ''no guarantees'' for Lyme disease financing had been made. He said no more than $250,000 had been earmarked for research applications from New York.
Those familiar with the workings of Federal financing in general and with the Lyme disease efforts in particular say that such confusion is not unusual. Feuds over money, methods and medical priorities have been developing for years, they said, and may worsen as the spreading disease brings more competition for scarce Federal grants.
 
Backbiting and Infighting
''There's more to Lyme disease than ticks biting people,'' said Karen Vanderhoof Forschner, president of the Lyme Disease Borreliosis Foundation in Tolland, Conn., the nation's first and only Lyme referral network. ''The real story is behind the scenes: the backbiting, the infighting. From what I understand, this is exactly like what happened in the early days with AIDS.''
Representatives from Westchester and Suffolk Counties downplay the idea of competition, stressing that they are simply serious about fighting a disease that is becoming increasingly costly to combat. Westchester, which established both the first walk-in clinic, the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center in Valhalla, and the first hotline, spent a total of $384,000 on such efforts last year. Suffolk paid out between $200,000 and $250,000.
''If the people in Westchester can do a task better than we can, then they should do it,'' said Dr. Dattwyler of Stony Brook. ''But considering the facilities and the tests that need to be made, I don't think they can do it.''
''The idea is to lick this thing, and not to have competition between Westchester and Suffolk,'' said Mr. Gille, who was among the Westchester officials who returned here last week to meet with a Congressional delegation about several issues, including Lyme disease. ''But we think that the prevalence of cases is here. Besides, Suffolk is getting most of the available funding already, through state allocations to Stony Brook.''
 
Dividing the State Money
Stony Brook received $250,000 in state grants last year for Lyme disease research, while New York Medical College received $100,000. But almost all of the state money distributed by the Tick-Borne Institute in Albany - about $400,000 over the last two years - has gone to Westchester.
''There are seven projects that have been funded now,'' said Vicki Zeldin, spokeswoman for the State Health Department. ''Most of them happen to be in Westchester.''
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget, submitted in January, proposes a reduction in the Tick-Borne Institute's budget to $150,000 for next year, making Federal money increasingly important.
Gloria Wenk is a member of the Tick-Borne Institute's advisory committee from Dutchess County, which received $24,000 in state money and was the only recipient outside Westchester. Considering the state's budget problems, she said, parochialism is ''very self-centered.''
 
Stressing the 'Big Picture'
''Some of these counties insist that they're the only ones who have a problem,'' Ms. Wenk said. ''But they have to look at the big picture. The disease is spreading. This is no longer just a local problem.'' Lyme disease has now spread to 44 states, with almost 80 percent of the cases reported in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Many of the nation's other Lyme disease victims are in California, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Mr. Hochbrueckner, who was instrumental in last year's Federal allocations for Lyme disease, will be pushing for more money in the fiscal 1991 budget. President Bush has proposed $2 million for the Centers for Disease Control; Mr. Hochbrueckner is seeking an additional $3 million.
 
RESEARCHERS STILL DIFFER ON ASPECTS OF LYME DISEASE
WHILE Westchester and Suffolk seek more funds to study Lyme disease, researchers in both counties continue to disagree about how to interpret the findings so far.
Dr. Raymond J. Dattwyler of the State University of Stony Brook on Long Island complains about people ''hyping the disease.'' He said he hoped an accurate test for the ailment would result from the national effort the Centers for Disease Control is undertaking.
''The tests we have are awful and as a result, I think the disease is overdiagnosed,'' he said. ''The current lab tests can pick up spirochetes unrelated to Lyme disease. So some people are getting positive Lyme test results for something as minor as gum disease.''
Other researchers say inadequate testing could indicate an under-diagnosis. The State Health Department, for example, reported a total of 2,328 cases of Lyme disease last year in Suffolk and Westchester Counties, and 181 cases in Nassau. But there were more than 3,000 other cases that seemed similar to Lyme but did not meet the case definition.
 
'Serious and Widespread'
First recognized in 1975, Lyme disease is caused by a type of bacterium called a spirochete, which is transmitted mainly by infected ticks found on deer or mice. Its early symptoms include a skin rash near the tick bite, aches, fever and fatigue. If left untreated, the disease can result in joint, nerve or heart problems.
''This disease is very serious, and very widespread,'' said Dr. Erica Asch, who has been conducting a long-term follow-up study of patients in Westchester. ''And even if they are treated, only 40 percent of Lyme victims feel fine.''
Dr. Asch, whose work with more than 250 patients is threatened by budget cuts for the state's Tick-Borne Institute, added: ''People who get this disease are unable to return to work. There have even been a couple of deaths reported. We saw someone here who died from Lyme disease about three months ago.''
Gloria Wenk, a public educator who is on the Tick-Borne Institute's advisory committee, said she received a call earlier this month from a woman in Fulton County, N.Y., who said her husband had died of complications from Lyme disease.
 
How High a Priority?
But other health officials, while agreeing that more research is an important goal, put Lyme disease in a different perspective.
''It is a low priority, relative to serious heart diseases, to other infectious diseases, to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, to AIDS,'' said Dr. David E. Graham of the Suffolk Health Department. ''Influenza is far more serious in term of morbidity and mortality than Lyme disease ever was.''
Dr. Dattwyler said: ''Every few years there's a new pop disease and this is it. My feeling is that it's very important. I've dedicated my career to doing this. But if it came to funding us or funding heart disease, cancer or AIDS, we'd be last on my list.''
As the tick season approaches, medical experts agree on taking precautions. ''I think people are becoming more aware of checking themselves when they come indoors,'' said Ms. Wenk. ''You can't panic. I mean, we're bigger than these ticks.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Unity, Pace Awaits New President

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: PLEASANTVILLE

 BODY:
PACE UNIVERSITY has reached to Chicago for a new president to help focus the identity of an increasingly comprehensive and complex educational system as it prepares for a new century.
Patricia O'Donnell Ewers, the 56-year-old chief academic officer at De Paul University, will succeed Wiliam G. Sharwell as the fifth president of the 84-year-old university. She will also be its first female leader. Dr. Ewers, chosen from among 150 candidates in a two-year nationwide search, will assume her duties after she moves to a new home in Hastings-on-Hudson with her husband, John, this summer.
She will oversee a sprawling university system that includes six graduate and undergraduate schools and colleges, enrolls 24,000 full- and part-time students and extends from upper Westchester to lower Manhattan. Its three main campuses, including two in Westchester, are linked by a minibus transportation network whose 100,000 passengers each year make it almost as busy as the county's public system. 
 
'There Must Be a Unifying Mission'
''How to have an institutional image when there are so many locations and programs is a major challenge,'' Dr. Ewers said. ''But there must be a unifying mission for us, whether we are in downtown New York or in Pleasantville.'' This year, for the first time, more Pace students were enrolled in Westchester than in Manhattan.
Dr. Ewers is leaving a university similar to Pace, where she helped resolve a series of challenges similar to several now facing her here. De Paul, like Pace, combines urban and suburban settings, has a reputation for business education and is developing an increasingly diverse academic program at its eight colleges and schools. De Paul, like Pace, is eager to attract high-quality students while providing educational opportunities for the less academically able.
As dean of faculties at De Paul, Dr. Ewers raised declining freshman enrollments, strengthened academic standards while providing additional programs for the less qualified, helped complete a major fund-raising effort and initiated an academic-planning process that relied on strong faculty input to redefine the goals of the institution for its 15,000 students.
Since her selection in December, Dr. Ewers has been making monthly visits to Pace. ''I don't want to spend my whole first year learning,'' she explained.
She will direct a major re-evaluation of the role of the institution, which has grown rapidly from its modest beginnings in l906 as an accounting institute in lower Manhattan, to a college in l947, to its current incarnation as the 12th-largest private university in the nation. Pace University offers degrees in more than 100 fields of study, from a master's degree in computer science to a doctorate in environmental law.
Making sense of all the parts of the Pace University system will not be an easy task, Dr. Ewers said. ''But until you do, it's hard to communicate that mission to others. We'll do it, because in five years, I want Pace to be known.''
Enrollments have leveled off, and the competition for students is growing more intense, reflecting a national trend. Dr. Ewers will oversee a university trying to change from an almost exclusively teaching institution to one in which significant amounts of research is expected, in order to raise academic standards and better compete for a limited student pool.
 
Seeking a Balance Between Two Worlds
She will supervise a $130 million annual budget that has been supported almost exclusively by tuitions but which now must find more non-tuition revenue. Trustees are in the middle of a $100 million capital campaign that Dr. Ewers will help complete.
The university is attempting to maintain an equal balance between its city and county campuses and the competing demands of two very different student populations. The trustees say they are determined to see the university continue to reflect both worlds.
They also hope to maintain and enhance their school's ''entrepreneurial'' reputation with its finely tuned response to its political, business and social environment. The university said also that it intended to remain accessible to a wide variety of student ability, reflecting what Dr. Ewers characterized as a ''strong history and tradition of access for nontraditional students.'' It is a quality, she added, that attracted her to Pace.
 
'Where Are We Going?'
What is needed, Dr. Ewers said during a visit earlier this month, is for Pace University to develop a clear, unifying focus. The process is already under way, with a small group of university leaders convening to begin discussing the goals and objectives of the university.
One of Dr. Ewer's first priorities when she arrives in July ''will be to help us answer the questions 'Who are we?' and 'Where are we going?' said Joseph M. Pastore Jr., provost of the university, ''We are at the brink of establishing academic credibility, which goes beyond our traditional reputation in business education,'' Dr. Pastore said. ''Now we must ask to what extent we can become a legitimate player in higher education. Pace is much more comprehensive today, and we must define and communicate that reality.''
Pace, to a larger extent than many other institutions of higher learning, has carved a role for itself as a school attuned to the political and corporate world around it. Becoming more research oriented while maintaining a practical, product-oriented reputation will not be an easy combination to achieve, Dr. Pastore and Dr. Ewers agreed.
Pace's Michaelian Institute of Sub/Urban Governance in White Plains has traditionally drawn upon the teaching skills and real-life experience of local political officials while it trained such leaders as the Westchester County Commissioner of Social Services, John J. Allen, and the Yonkers City Manager, Neil J. Deluca.
Local corporate leaders serve on the faculty, 12 major corporations have developed specialized employee-training programs with the university and a cooperative-education program is providing 1,400 undergraduates with paid career-related work experiences while they attend school. The majority find jobs with those same employers when they graduate.
 
Declining Enrollment
But enrollment in several university areas is declining, particularly in the master's degree program in business administration at Pace's Lubin Schools of Business in White Plains, which is not accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business.
Many members of the Pace faculty have opposed seeking accreditation, saying that it would require a larger full-time teaching staff, produce only a perception of higher academic quality and limit the university's ability to hire market-oriented business leaders. Many business leaders can teach at Pace only on a part-time basis.
The trustees have voted to seek accreditation, a move the new president supports. Chief among her priorities, Dr. Ewers said, is achieving an admittedly ''quantitative measure,'' which she said reflects ''which percentage of the faculty have published in particular journals within a five-year period.''
 
Demands in a Competitive Market
But the university, Dr. Ewers said, ''is in a competitive market, and we need to accredit the business school to reverse the M.B.A. decline. Let's get it done.''
Maintaining the university's close ties with area corporations will continue in a number of ways, Dr. Ewers said, as long as Pace remembers that ''an institution must be driven by the locale in which it is located.''
Looking at what she said was a growing number of unemployed professionals, and eager to stabilize enrollments, Dr. Ewers said she planned to initiate a master of arts in teaching for older professionals interested in changing careers.
''Look at the I.B.M. layoff situation,'' she said. ''Here you have all these sophisticated people, and here's a work force we desperately need in the schools. This is an area where we can step in and help. We must never let our agenda only be the internal agenda of the institution.''
 
Excellence Versus Access
Pace trustees and Dr. Ewers are committed to maintaining and enhancing academic standards, and she said that fact would require university officials to address what she called the ''excellence versus access'' question.
''Pace has an obligation not to be exclusive,'' Dr. Ewers said. ''That is it's tradition. You can't bring students in and charge them without offering quality education. Pace is a good school. It could be a better school.''
For students who don't meet traditional academic standards but who demonstrate academic potential, Dr. Ewers said she hoped to introduce a bridge program similar to one she began at DePaul. Such students would be invited to spend five weeks in an intensive residential summer program at Pace, where they will be given special academic help. ''Institutions like ours just can't sit back and say 'they just aren't providing us with the right kids.' ''

HEADLINE: Fiscal Bureaucracy in Japan Loses Credibility

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 25

 BODY:
By engineering Japan's miraculous economic recovery after the war, steering the shaken economy deftly through the oil crises of the 1970's and then stabilizing the nation's financial markets quickly after the United States stock market collapsed in October 1987, Japan's economic policy makers won an international reputation for unparalleled management ability.
Hard earned over 40 years, that reputation has been a source of immense confidence here, even arrogance. But in the last three months, that reputation has begun to unravel. For the first time, market forces are looming larger than the powers of Government bureaucrats. 
Persistent turmoil has wracked the financial markets this year, sending stock prices down by more than 20 percent, the yen down more than 5 percent and interest rates up sharply, despite numerous Government attempts to restore order. As a result, Japan's elite bureaucrats are watching their credibility erode almost daily.
Stunning as it seems, the loss of Government control stems from measures taken by the bureaucrats themselves. In recent years, under heavy pressure from the United States, the Government initiated a process of financial liberalization that made Japan's huge capital markets more open to the world. The markets became vastly larger and more powerful, less subject to bureaucratic control - and far more volatile.
''It is not as easy to control the market as we would like to,'' a senior Finance Ministry official acknowledged. ''But that is a development that we created. If you want to have the benefits of allowing market forces in, you cannot have as much control as there was before.''
The liberalization of the financial markets included allowing interest rates to float at market-determined levels, making it easier for Japanese corporations to raise capital abroad, permitting trading in interest-rate and stock-index futures and providing foreign instititutions with increased access.
As a result of the recent turmoil, the Government must deal not just with the technical problem of what steps it can take to stabilize stock prices and bolster the battered yen, but it must also try to rebuild confidence that the system can run efficiently.
The first signs that something fundamental had changed came last fall, when the yen started to weaken against the dollar and defied every attempt by the Government to bolster it. A surprise increase in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate in October not only proved ineffectual but was followed by an unseemly public row between the central bank and the Finance Ministry over whether another increase was necessary to cool inflationary pressures.
There is no simple explanation for the slide in the yen's value. But foreign-exchange experts and economists said the yen's fall was not because of speculation but rather the belief of Japanese institutions that they can earn better returns on investments abroad. In investing overseas, these companies are in effect selling yen to buy dollars or marks or another currency, pushing down the yen's value.
Starting early this year, the yen lost even more ground. Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, declared that the decline was a speculative trend that would soon reverse. But it did not.
The slide of the yen came even as the Japanese economy was in sound shape: Growth has been unimpeded for nearly four years; corporate investment in research, plants and equipment is running at three times the level of the United States on a per-capita basis and inflation, though rising, is less than 3 percent annually.
 
Going Into Panic
Despite these positives, interest rates were rocketing upward, threatening the economy; the yen was still falling, threatening to increase inflation, and stock market investors were going from nervousness to panic.
Both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan publicly continued to say there was no sound reason for the problems. In private, officials expressed confusion and exasperation with the way the markets failed to respond to their prodding.
Perhaps the worst news came last week, when the Bank of Japan again lifted its discount rate. It was a move expected to attract capital back to Japan and strengthen the yen. Instead, the stock market had its most volatile day on Thursday and the yen remained just as weak.
The loss of confidence this spectacle engendered has been almost palpable. Until recently, for instance, the attitude of many Japanese toward American demands that Japan open its markets further was best summed up by the title of a popular book, ''The Japan That Can Say No.'' Owed to the U.S. Suddenly, a far different attitude is being expressed. Last week, Shin Kanemaru, one of the most powerful politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was quoted as telling his party: ''Japan depends on the United States, not the other way around. We owe the United States for the well-being we now enjoy.''
Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said: ''This has been a particularly difficult time. People are seriously questioning the ability of Japanese Government officials to keep the markets on track.''
The loss of confidence in the bureaucrats has even started turning into disdain. It is dawning on many people here that Japan has become a capital-rich, labor-poor country whose vast wealth is dedicated to making Japanese corporations competitive rather than improving the standard of living.
The huge flow of Japanese capital into the United States and other countries, which was viewed as an emblem of success until recently, is now regarded in some quarters with resentment. If used at home, that capital could be improving the lives of the Japanese. But there are not enough opportunities to invest profitably in Japan, forcing the outflow.
 
Lack of Opportunity
''The fundamental problem is a lack of investment opportunities here,'' Mr. Koo said. ''Japanese realize that they are shipping all their capital overseas and investing in improving living standards outside Japan, while their own living standards are much worse.'' Investments in Japan are made difficult, he said, by Government restrictions and distortions caused by regulators.
Michiya Matsukawa, a senior adviser to the Nikko Securities Company and former top official at the Finance Ministry, asserted, ''The point is, Japanese are frustrated by the fact that there are better investment opportunities outside Japan.''
Now the steep decline in stock prices is being blamed on the fact that the Government's misguided policies caused share prices to rise too high too fast in the first place.
''The problem is not the inability of the Government to control the decline in stock prices now, but in their having permitted the speculative bubble to have grown so big in the first place,'' said Yoshihisa Kitai, manager of the economics department at the Long Term Credit Bank. ''That was the real failure.''
 
Increasing Risks
To some extent, the Government's lack of effective action and its continuing search for measures to restore order to the financial markets has even increased the risks.
''They can act, but if they fail it will create more problems by damaging their credibility,'' said Shijuro Ogata, deputy governor at the Japan Development Bank and formerly the top international official at the Bank of Japan. ''Or they can wait for the market forces to correct themselves and risk that the markets overshoot and get even more out of control.''

HEADLINE: FIRE IN THE BRONX;
The Living Search the Faces of the Dead

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Jerome Ford stared at the photographs spread on the table at Public School 67 in the Bronx yesterday. He recognized five faces: his wife's three brothers, a teen-age niece and a cousin. He realized what the photographs meant: the five had been trapped when an illegal social club was transformed from an oasis of dancing and drinking into an inferno.
His eyes were red, his Sunday-morning stubble of a beard streaked with tears. Oblivious to the sirens and the police officers shouting into their bullhorns, keeping the crowd in line, he could think of nothing but the advice he wished his relatives had taken.
''I told them not to go,'' he said, ''but kids are kids. I knew it was dangerous.'' 
The awful ritual of identification was repeated time after time at P.S. 67 yesterday. The corridors and classrooms, usually filled with the chatter of students, were filled with the sobs of relatives, friends, friends of friends, young and old.
Like Mr. Ford, they knew the faces in the photographs - the photographs of the dead, snapshots the authorities had taken before the 87 bodies were sent to the morgue in Manhattan. Some of the loved ones screamed at the sight. Some grieved wordlessly.
One woman said she was there because her two sons had not come home after a Saturday night out. One man was worried about five friends from a neighborhood soccer team. Another was hoping against hope that he would not be shown a picture of a friend whose car he had seen outside the burned-out Happy Land Social Club, a two-story graffiti-streaked building that was an after-hours hangout favored by Central American immigrants.
''He's dead - I know,'' said 13-year-old Glenda Martinez, who said she was waiting to identify her 23-year-old uncle, Venecio.
The wait at the school was long, at least three hours for most people, and painful - a new kind of pain in a section of East Tremont that knows the pain of poor housing, drugs, unemployment and truancy. People had to stand in four different lines before they reached the room where pictures of the victims had been laid out for identification.
For some, the trip confirmed the terrible suspicions they had had since daybreak, when they realized that loved ones had never made it home. Over and over during the day, people who had seen the pictures would come out and tell others in line the sad truth: whoever they were looking for was dead.
Four women waiting in line saw a woman friend coming out of P.S. 67 and learned that some loved ones were dead. In frustration and anger, one woman knelt and began flailing her fists at a pile of cardboard boxes. Two tried to comfort each other, sobbing as they embraced.
For some, the wait at the school was tense with uncertainty: they did not know if their loved ones had been at the club when the fire started. With luck, maybe they had left the club - alive, before the blaze - and gone somewhere besides home. Maybe they had gone to a friend's apartment and fallen asleep. Clutching photographs they hoped would not match the ones on the table, they realized this was a long shot.
Joanne Colon, 27, said her brother, Luis Rodriquez, sometimes stayed out late. Sometimes he went to the Happy Land club. ''I'm a nervous wreck,'' Ms. Colon said in a shaky voice. ''I told my mother and his wife not to come down here, that I'd take care of it.''
But for some, there was no doubt, only the horrible reality of the photographs and the certainty of death. Kelly Mena found the photo of his 30-year-old brother, Rene. ''He had on his black leather coat,'' he said, blinking back tears.
A friend broke through the crowd and grabbed his arm. ''Oh, Kelly,'' the friend, Lisette Martinez, said. ''My father just told me.'' First Family Was Calm One woman fainted after she left the school and had to be carried away by Emergency Medical Service personnel.
''The very first family came in and was very calm,'' said Debra Ricciardi, the assistant director of public relations for the Red Cross of Greater New York. ''They moved right on and said, 'What do we do next?' The next woman fell to the floor and started screaming.''
Some relatives brought photographs of their own. Alva Romero went to the school with snapshots of her 18-year-old daughter, Alva Escoto; her 32-year-old brother, Kerri Romero, and four cousins: Luis Manaiza, 22; Wendy Manaiza, 18; Norman Clarke, 17, and Isabel Christina Lopez, 17. The family had moved to the Bronx from Honduras over the last seven years, she said, and now in a single night they had died.
''We came looking for a better life,'' she said, tearfully. ''We just found disappointment and disgrace.''
 
One Line, Then Another
Like the other relatives, Ms. Romero had waited in a line that started at a side door of the school, at 2024 Mohegan Avenue, a block from the Happy Land. It took about 45 minutes to work one's way to the door; police officers were admitting groups of 15 or 20 at a time.
Inside, people waited in a second line that formed in a large room, around a dozen or so white picnic tables with attached benches. Some sat, but most stood by the door, waiting for the signal to take their places in yet another line.
In the lines, and in the crowds that gathered across from the school, people talked about how the Happy Land had become a neighborhood social center. Jose Cerrato, a native of San Pedro Sula in northwest Honduras, said he left the club about 3:30 A.M. yesterday because he had drunk too much and was falling asleep. By midafternoon all he could remember was the calypso music and a particular Honduran dance, samunango teleno.
A short time after he left, the music stopped and there were firefighters and paramedics, body bags and gruesome photographs - and broken dreams.
 
'Too Much Violence Here'
Sadia Torres, 28, said her boyfriend, Jose Francisco Gonzalez, 31, had left home about 9 P.M. Saturday. Ms. Torres said she had stayed home because she was tired and there was no one to take care of her three children.
She said she had lived with Mr. Gonzalez, a construction worker, for four years, ever since he came to the Bronx from Honduras. They were making plans to go back. He did not like life in New York.
''He used to say there was too much violence here,'' Ms. Torres said as she waited her turn at P.S. 67. ''He said his land was so peaceful, and his family was there, he has no one here except for me.''
A few relatives who could not make identifications from the photographs on the tables at the school were taken to the morgue in a Police Department bus. They were escorted by a clergyman, a Red Cross worker, an official from the City Human Resources Administration and an official from the New York State Funeral Directors Association. Ms. Ricciardi said the officials from the city and the funeral directors association were there to help with funeral arrangements and, if necessary, to arrange welfare benefits.
''They said they could bury her in Honduras if I want,'' said Sagrario Gomez, who lost her 35-year-old sister and two cousins. ''But how am I going to live without Erlinda?''

HEADLINE: Labor Party Claims Victory in Australia

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 25

 BODY:
Prime Minister Bob Hawke said today that his Labor Party had prevailed in parliamentary elections and his conservative opponent, Andrew Peacock, conceded a Labor victory was likely.
Mr. Hawke said he expected a one-seat majority in the 148-seat House of Representatives. He said a ''worst case scenario'' would give Labor 73 seats, and the conservative coalition 73, with 2 independents. 
The Prime Minister, clearly surprised by the tight outcome of the elections on Saturday, said that when final results are in, ''I hope it may be a bit better than that.''
''It will give a sense of discipline for sure and we can do it.''
 
Calculating the Odds
Mr. Peacock, 51 years old, the leader of the Liberal and National Party coalition, would not concede defeat. But today he acknowledged that Labor had a better chance of taking the election.
''If you are setting a book I suggest the shortest odds would be regrettably on a hung Parliament, followed then by a Labor government just ahead of a possibility of a coalition government,'' Mr. Peacock said in Melbourne. Mr. Peacock, who made his second bid for the prime ministership, emphasized that the outcome of six or seven seats in the states of Western Australia and Queensland had not been decided.
Vote counting, routinely suspended on Sunday, was to resume on Monday. Political leaders said the official results would not be known until Thursday, when mail-in ballots are counted.
 
A Small Party Gains
Forty of 70 Senate seats were also contested on Saturday, and early results showed the small Democratic Party made strong gains. The House, the more powerful chamber, chooses the Prime Minister.
Communities with undecided races included the small town of Kennedy in northern Queensland, where several thousand voters were unable to cast their ballots because polling booths were cut off by floodwaters.
Mr. Hawke, 60, has governed for seven years. He campaigned on his record of economic management, despite dissatisfaction over record home mortgage interest rates and a $100 billion foreign debt.
The Prime Minister said the 1990 election would set the course for Australian politics into the 21st century.
Australia has 10.6 million eligible voters among its 16.5 million people, and voting is compulsory.
 
Independents Win 2
When vote counting closed on Saturday night, Labor appeared to have won 73 seats, the coalition 70 and the independents 2.
The independents, the first elected in 24 years, could hold the balance of power in the House. Labor, which had 85 seats in the previous lower house, needs 75 seats for a working majority.
Australia is a close United States ally, and President Bush said he hoped to visit the country before the year's end.
Mr. Hawke came to power in 1983, was re-elected the following year and again in 1987. He has said that if re-elected in this race he will seek a fifth term before retiring.

HEADLINE: Liberian President Leads the Good Life While His Country Grows Poorer

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
The delivery of a new luxury plane for the personal use of the Liberian President made front-page headlines in January in this impoverished West African country.
The 60-seater Boeing 707, which diplomats here say was purchased for nearly $20 million, is ''yet another cost-saving measure adopted by the Government,'' the state-owned newspaper said, because ''it will minimize the high cost of chartering private planes.''
What news reports did not mention, however, is that only two runways in this small country are long enough to accommodate the new aircraft, and both are near Monrovia, the capital. As for foreign travel, the President, Gen. Samuel K. Doe, has not flown overseas since he visited Romania nearly three years ago.
''It's an immense waste of money,'' a Liberian businessman said, ''especially in a country that is nearly bankrupt.'' 
 
Rich Yet Poor Land
In its way, the new plane may be an apt metaphor for Liberia, which often gives the impression of forward motion, while it is rolling steadily toward financial and political collapse. Liberia is rich in minerals and has one of West Africa's most skilled and educated work forces. It also has a reputation as one of the African continent's most egregious examples of economic mismanagement.
The timing of the plane's arrival was especially striking, Western and Liberian analysts said, because it came during the visit of a delegation from the International Monetary Fund.
''To acquire that plane right now, with everyone watching so closely, is either an act of incredible arrogance or incredible incompetence,'' a longtime Western resident said.
Three years ago Liberia, which was founded in the mid-19th century as a republic for freed American slaves, became the only country in Africa ever suspended from I.M.F. and World Bank borrowing.
The lenders and the Government are in the midst of negotiations over the next disciplinary step - whether Liberia should be formally declared in default and unlikely to repay $1.2 billion in debt owed to them and other foreign creditors. Later this year, in the third and final step of the sanctions process, Liberia could become the first country ever expelled from the international lending agency.
At the same time the United States, Liberia's largest trading partner and foreign investor, is also cutting back. From 1980 to 1985, the United States gave this country of 2.3 million people nearly $500 million in aid and loans, making Liberia the largest per-capita recipient of American aid in sub-Saharan Africa. But charging mismanagement and misappropriation, the United States Congress has steadily slashed aid levels, to $19.5 million last year and about $10 million in 1990.
 
Leader Lives Well
The sense of economic disarray is compounded, Western donors and bankers say, by President Doe's growing appetite for government-subsidized extravagance. He owns a small fleet of luxury automobiles and is said to spend lavishly on clothes and jewelry. And while no reliable estimate has ever been made, rumors run through the capital that General Doe and his wife, Nancy, and other family members have accumulated extensive real-estate holdings.
One telling detail about Mr. Doe's changing values, Liberian political analysts say, is his insistence on being called ''Dr. Doe,'' the consequence of a visit to South Korea several years ago in which he received an honorary doctorate. By law, the President's image appears ubiquitiously in public places and many people hang his picture in private offices as a display of fealty.
''He is definitely encouraging a cult of personality,'' a Liberian businessman said, ''and you don't dare suggest that there's anything wrong with it.''
Well-connnected senior Government workers have also grown wealthy through lucrative business opportunities obtained through the executive mansion. And despite the Government's deteriorating fiscal condition, in recent months at least a dozen West German limousines were purchased for the small group of political cronies who surround the President.
Nonetheless, when confronted with accusations of corruption, the 39-year old General Doe has said he is a victim of disinformation and has blamed his political opponents for such reports. The President's aides said he was too busy to be interviewed.
 
Rebellion in the Northeast
Of late, however, the most immediate threat to the Doe leadership is an armed one. Since late December, Government forces have been trying to crush an invasion by guerrillas opposed to the President's rule.
The rebels, led by Charles Taylor, a former Doe Cabinet minister who is remembered here mostly for fleeing the country in 1986 after being accused of embezzlement, invaded Nimba County, about 300 miles northeast of Monrovia. The Liberian Government sent troops and provincial policemen to oust them.
In interviews on the Ivory Coast side of the border, refugees reported that the soldiers indiscriminately engaged in vicious and mostly arbitary reprisals, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians - people they apparently believed were sympathetic to the rebel cause.
Amnesty International and Africa Watch, human rights groups, as well as the United States Embassy in Monrovia, have also said that soldiers attacked unarmed civilians.
So far, at least 140,000 Liberians are believed to have fled across the eastern frontiers to escape the bloodshed, most of them settling in the heavily forested hills of the Ivory Coast and Guinea.
Diplomats say that about half of Nimba County - its northern and eastern portions - is still contested. Guerrilla activity in these areas remains strong, and the army has been unable, despite a variety of tactics, to bring them under control.
 
Food a Sensitive Issue
The Nimba invasion also has potentially far-reaching implications for Liberia's economy because about 30 percent of agricultural production comes from the region.
By the accounting of Western economists, the sudden flight of tens of thousands of farmers has already clouded the prospects for this year's rice harvest, and there is talk of potential food shortages and other hardships.
''If there is anything people react to here, it is food shortages and price increases; that combination could be explosive,'' said a Western relief worker who recalled that it was nearly a decade ago that proposals to increase the price of rice set off a wave of protest that eventually led to the overthrow of President William R. Tolbert.
In 1980, General Doe, an 11th-grade dropout and a 28-year-old master sergeant, came to power after he and other army noncommissioned officers shot and bayoneted President Tolbert and took over the Government.
Ten days later, the foreign press was invited to record the sight of 13 senior Government officials, including most of the former Cabinet, marched nearly naked through the streets of Monrovia, tied to seaside posts and then executed at point-blank range.
President Doe's international reputation has never fully recovered from that moment. Leaders of neighboring West African countries, particularly the President of the Ivory Coast, Felix Houphouet Boigny, have maintained diplomatically correct but nonetheless strained relations with the Liberian leader.
 
State Department Criticism
General Doe's image here and abroad has also suffered from persistent accusations of human rights abuses. The State Department's 1989 human rights report said, ''Brutality by police and other security officials during the arrest and questioning of individuals is fairly common, and there has been no evident government effort to halt this practice.''
Liberia's tightly controlled press rarely touches on such subjects and those who do can be expected to be dealt with ruthlessly. Dozens of journalists have been detained in recent years, often without charges, and several newspapers have been closed. The Daily Observer, Monrovia's leading independent paper, has been ordered shut five times since 1982, once for almost 20 months.
Perhaps the greatest source of internal tension in recent years is the widespread impression here that a Krahn tribal elite has begun to replace the American-Liberian elite that virtually ran the country until the 1980 coup.
Unlike most countries in West Africa, until recently Liberia has been relatively free of ethnic strife.
This began to change with the ascendancy of President Doe, a Krahn. Since then, the Krahn, though they make up only about 4 percent of the population, are disproportionately represented in the executive mansion, senior government positions, and the leadership of the armed forces.
Most significant, senior military soldiers directing government forces in Nimba County reportedly engaged in bullying tactics and even murder. Most of the officers were Krahn, and the civilians attacked, members of the Gio and Mandingo tribes.

HEADLINE: Clash of Cultures Grows Amid American Dream

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENCINITAS, Calif.

 BODY:
Marjorie Gaines and Cirillo Guerrero are neighbors, after a fashion, in this slice of Southern California where two very different visions of America have come into conflict.
Mrs. Gaines, a local Councilwoman with a pleasant ranch-style home, enjoys a relaxed suburban way of life almost within sound of the Pacific surf.
Mr. Guerrero an undocumented immigrant who lives just over the hill from her under a piece of plastic sheeting, was drawn here by a more elemental dream: a job and food for his family in Mexico.
In the past few years, as communities of expensive homes have spread rapidly across the rolling hills of San Diego County, the first stop for immigrants from across the Mexican border, a clash of cultures that sometimes flares into violence has become increasingly acute.
 
An Unsettling Reminder
It is a clash that resonates through California, where immigration is changing the demographics and the character of the state. With the local economy dependent on their labor, people like Mr. Guerrero are an unsettling reminder to residents of the social forces that are at work. 
Homeowners like Mrs. Gaines complain that the migrants, who line the roadsides seeking jobs and who camp out at night within shouting distance of their homes, bring crime, unsanitary conditions and a breath of the third world to their carefully tended communities.
The migrants say they are routinely abused by people who shout and throw garbage at them, destroy their campsites, cheat them at work and sometimes attack them physically.
''The housing developments are growing pretty much in proportion to the number of undocumented people coming into the country,'' said Roberto Martinez, a social worker with the American Friends Service Committee. ''What I've observed is that as the developments have encroached into migrant areas, we are seeing more tension and more incidents.''
 
Crime and Violence
Last month, a 19-year-old man named Kenneth Kovzelove, who said he hated Mexicans, was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison for shooting to death two Hispanic men, one of them a United States citizen, on a rutted lane that snakes through the hills where many immigrants camp.
In what appears to be a more common occurrence, immigrant-aid groups say migrant workers in the hills around the nearby town of Poway have in recent months been shot with paint-pellet guns, which are used in mock warfare. Mr. Martinez said migrant workers were sometimes run down by vehicles on the back roads near their campsites, in what appear to be deliberate acts of violence.
Most attention is now focused on the coming trial of a grocer and a butcher at the Country Store in Carlsbad, a town where migrant workers play an essential role in the flower, strawberry and citrus industries.
As the immigrant flow has continued, large groups of Hispanic men have begun gathering every day in the store's parking lot, seeking odd jobs, in a scene that is repeated increasingly throughout Southern California.
The two men from the Country Store, charged with kidpnapping and assault, are accused of seizing one of those workers in January, binding his hands and feet and taping a bag over his head. A sign attached to the man read, ''No mas aqui,'' or roughly: ''Don't come back.''
Law enforcement officials say the rate of violence and crime are also high among the migrants themselves. They are often attacked and robbed both by other migrants and by non-Hispanic residents.
 
Migrants as 'Perfect Victims'
''The migrant workers here are what I describe as perfect victims,'' said Lieut. Bill Flores, commander of the Fallbrook substation for the county sheriff's office. They are in a foreign land where they do not speak the language, they sleep in the open without access to telephones, they often fear the authorities who could help them, and they generally carry with them all the money they have.
At the heart of the cultural clash, said Gene Louden, a spokesman for United Way of San Diego County, is an unusual demographic fact. Only 10 percent of the people who live in the county were born here, most having come in search of one of the life styles exemplified by Mrs. Gaines and Mr. Guerrero.
The population of the county, which now stands at 2.4 million, has been growing, even though the number of births is dropping sharply. Mr. Louden said this was another indication that the county's growth continued to be based on migration both from within and outside the United States.
At the same time, the county's ethnic balance is shifting from 73.7 percent Caucasian and 14.8 percent Hispanic in 1980, to a projected mix of 60 percent Caucasian and 23 percent or more Hispanic by the end of the decade. The other fast-growing segment of the population is the Asian minority.
An immigration amnesty law enacted in 1986 may have heightened the sense of invasion that local residents have. Under the law, some of the migrant workers who camp out on the hillsides now have the legal right to live and work in the United States alongside their more established neighbors.
''In the last three years, particularly in the last two years, it's become intolerable,'' Mrs. Gaines said. ''People call to complain. They say, 'This isn't the community I bought into 8 years or 10 years or 5 years ago.' ''
Back then, she said, ''We did not have the great numbers of people using our backyards and our little canyons for campgrounds. We did not have people lining our streets waiting for work. We did not have people publicly defecating and urinating, and we did not have business people complaining that their businesses were being ruined because of all the people hanging around.''
Residents say they fear the spread of tropical diseases and are concerned about strains on social services, including hospitals and the police.
These complaints come even though much of the local economy, particularly with the building boom, depends on the labor of these migrant workers.
''Whether they like it or not, there's a symbiosis going on between the workers who live in the mountains and the yuppies who live in the valleys,'' said Tom Burgess, an aide to Representative Jim Bates, Democrat of San Diego.
 
Impact of Immigration Law
Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, a private group, said that since some of the Hispanic population had been granted legal documentation, residents no longer called the Immigration and Naturalization Service to remove their unwanted neighbors.
''Now it's nuisance abatement,'' she said. ''They go to the health department or they consider bans on street solicitation. You have cities hounding workers from encampment to encampment. There's a real attempt to depopulate the coastal communities, which I call yuppiedom, of migrant workers.''
If there is such a policy, it does not seem to be succeeding.
Standing amid the litter of his makeshift home, as hummingbirds flitted past, Mr. Guerrero said he had been forced to move repeatedly to new campsites as housing developments have spread across the hillsides. ''We have been raided and bulldozed and moved,'' he said.
Jobs are scarce, and when he does find work in the fields or in construction, he said he is often cheated of his pay.
But he still looks forward to the day when he can bring his wife and children from Mexico to live with him.

HEADLINE: Clean Air Debate: Odd Allies and Formidable Foes

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Senator Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, former leader of the Democratic majority and longtime power on Capitol Hill, walked through the corridors of Senate office buildings last Tuesday dropping off handwritten notes asking his colleagues for help.
The white-haired warrior was seeking support for an amendment to the clean air bill that would help his coal-mining constituents in West Virginia. The proposal, to provide financial relief to miners who lose their jobs as a result of the bill's provisions, is opposed by Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine.
Mr. Mitchell, who succeeded Mr. Byrd as majority leader, believes the Byrd amendment would jeopardize the bill by breaking the compromise reached by Senate leaders and the White House. 
The two formidable Senators have been using their considerable influence to win votes in the hotly contested debate over the legislation.
 
Politics as Unusual
The day after Senator Byrd worked the hallways, Evelyn Dubrow, a veteran labor lobbyist, stopped Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, as he was coming out of the chamber. She asked him why he was not supporting the Byrd amendment.
Mr. Dodd leaned toward the diminutive Ms. Dubrow and, in a whisper loud enough for those standing nearby to hear, said, ''I'll tell you in one word: child care.'' Then, as the elevator door was closing, he held up his hands in a what-can-I-do gesture and said, ''George is being very tough on this one.''
For the record, an aide to Mr. Dodd said later that the Senator had not yet decided what he would do about the Byrd amendment, yet the message was clear: Senator Dodd was convinced that if he wanted his pet child care bill acted on by the Senate, he would have to stand with the majority leader.
The clean air legislation, which Senate leaders have called the most important bill before Congress this year, is producing both politics as usual and politics as unusual.
As usual, promises are being made, unspoken warnings are being issued and chits for favors performed over the years are being called in. Industries are spending millions of dollars in a lobbying effort to persuade senators to ease the requirements of the bill, and environmental groups are urging lawmakers to take the moral high ground by adopting stronger protections for clean air.
But the usual partisan lines have been largely erased. Divisions over the bill, which would impose new controls on acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air, are shaped instead by unusually sharp regional differences over who gains from the bill, who loses, who pays, who doesn't. States with dirty coal-fired power plants want financial help to pay for cleanup costs; states that have already cleaned up insist that the polluters must pay themselves.
 
Filibuster Seemed Certain
Western states with clean air are demanding the right to dirty it a bit in the future for the sake of economic growth. States with large numbers of chemical plants and refineries are objecting to the high costs of controlling chemicals in the air.
Senator Mitchell has said he entered into a compromise with the White House because he could not defeat a filibuster that was almost certain to develop over the bill without President Bush's support. As a result, the Senate is now considering legislation that is weaker in some respects than the bill approved by its own Environment and Public Works Committee. But the measure is stronger in some respects than the clean air proposal made by Mr. Bush last June.
Senator Mitchell is struggling to make the compromise stand up against opposition both from environmentalists and their allies who want to strengthen the bill and from industrial interests who want to weaken it.
The result has been some unlikely alliances. For example, some senators who consistently oppose environmental legislation voted for an amendment offered last week by Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and Pete Wilson, Republican of California, that would require stricter controls on pollution from automobiles.
Among those who voted for the amendment, which was strongly backed by environmental groups, were Senators Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and James McClure and Steve Symms of Idaho, all of them Republicans who have scored zero or nearly so on the voting assessments of the League of Conservation Voters, the chief political arm of the environmentalists.
To Senator Mitchell, their motive was transparent. ''There are a substantial number of senators who don't want a bill,'' he said. ''They are voting for amendments that are not part of the compromise hoping they will kill the bill.''
 
Criticized by Old Allies
Mr. Mitchell said he is finding the process of guiding clean air legislation through the Senate ''the most difficult and demanding thing I have ever been involved in.'' Coming from Maine, where there is a strong interest in air quality, he has been a leading Senate champion of clean air for 10 years and he has come under heavy and, he believes, unfair criticism from his old environmental allies.
The majority leader is also uncomfortable about twisting the arms of his fellow Democrats to support the compromise with the Republican-controlled White House. He did not warn Senator Dodd on the child care bill, Senator Mitchell said, adding, ''I care very deeply about that bill, and there is not a chance I would do anything to block it.''
The most dramatic moment in the clean air debate so far came late Wednesday night, when Senator Byrd took the floor to plead for his amendment. The Senate chamber is usually empty when a member makes a speech, even during the middle of the business day. But one by one, senators filed in and sat silently while Mr. Byrd made an emotional appeal for his proposal to aid coal miners. Mr. Mitchell, exhausted and suffering from a bad cold, sat nearby, for a time with his head buried in his hands.
 
Old Foes Enter the Fray
One after another, senators, including old legislative foes of Senator Byrd like the Republican minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and Strom Thurmond, the conservative Republican from South Carolina, rose to challenge Senator Byrd.
Mr. Byrd answered them with a plea for the miners. They are specifically ''targeted'' by the legislation, he said, because it would encourage power companies to switch from the coal with high sulfur content that is mined mainly in the East to the low-sulfur coal that is mined in the West. This would reduce the pollution that causes acid rain.
Mr. Byrd won that night's round, getting the Senate's support for alterations in his amendment. But he has not been able to bring the amendment itself to a vote because the Senate leadership is hoping to avoid a test of strength on the issue.

HEADLINE: A Bad Bill Where a Fix Would Do

 BODY:
An impartial auditor examines the books of a corporate pension plan and determines that it is overfunded. Money, therefore, can be withdrawn without jeopardizing promised payments to current or future retirees. So the corporate managers remove the excess money and give it to shareholders. 
Are such withdrawals - known as reversions - lawful theft? Or fiscal prudence? The Senate Labor Committee implies theft, so it has approved a bill, sponsored by Senators Howard Metzenbaum and Nancy Kassebaum, that would effectively bar reversions. Employers yell foul: they argue that since they're legally required to fork over more money if the plan runs low, they should be able to reclaim excess money they mistakenly put in.
The truth is that both sides are exaggerating. Some employers are abusing the tax-free status of pension contributions. But the Senators exaggerate the problem and propose a draconian - and potentially crippling - solution. A modest revision of the tax code is all that's needed.
The controversy concerns so-called defined benefit plans. These plans pay a retirement benefit that, typically, depends on the worker's salary at retirement. Employers are required to put enough money into the plan to cover future outlays. But that requires guessing the future level of salaries and rates of return on invested pension contributions. Unforeseen events in stock, bond and real estate markets can lead to underfunding or overfunding.
The fight is over companies that wind up with overfunded plans and decide to make a lump-sum withdrawal. In many cases, the law now requires that they first terminate the plan. That can hurt workers because a terminated plan, if not reinstated, pays a retirement benefit keyed to the worker's salary at termination, rather than the higher salary at the time of retirement. Senators Metzenbaum and Kassebaum would eliminate this threat by essentially forbidding reversions unless the company builds in cost-of-living adjustments. That may sound noble. But the bill, if passed, would backfire.
The type of inflation protection the Senators envision is virtually nonexistent in the private sector. The risk is too great. If Congress makes it mandatory, employers might just decide to scrap defined-benefit plans. Or companies will avoid excess buildup by contributing the legal minimum. Then, if the plan slips into insolvency, taxpayers are at risk. Because of Federal guarantees, they pay the retirement bills of a company whose plan goes bankrupt.
Bellicose rhetoric has served to divert attention from a real but fixable flaw in pension regulations. Companies have discovered a clever way to turn pension plans into tax shelters. First, they make excess contributions - tax free - into the plan. Then they withdraw the excess money, say, 10 years later. In the interim, the company has earned interest on money that otherwise would have been paid to the Internal Revenue Service. This amounts to an interest-free loan, a glaring loophole in the tax code.
Congress closed part of this loophole with a 15-percent penalty on pension reversions. But a recent Government study shows that the penalty is too low. Raising the penalty would not end terminations; but it would eliminate the unfair tax incentive for them.
Fixing a technical flaw in the tax code is not the stuff of political fanfare and voter appreciation. Too bad, because if Congress ventures any further - as the Senate bill proposes - it risks doing real harm. Burdensome restrictions will discourage use of defined-benefit plans or encourage dumping unfunded retirement liabilities into the lap of taxpayers.

HEADLINE: No Decade for Movies Like 'Driving Miss Daisy';
'Roger and Me'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
So encouraging to read the rational voice of David Bensman discussing the film ''Roger and Me'' (Op-Ed, March 2). As one who grew up in Flint, Mich., who was a little acquainted with Michael Moore and who has watched the city's decay over the last 20 years - along with that of my adopted home, Pittsburgh - I found his film exceedingly unfunny. I heard a few laughs from the Pittsburgh audience when I saw the film early this year. But not many, certainly not what the early reviewers reported, when this film was touted as rivaling Woody Allen's best. 
I had the sense that Michael Moore was more concerned to get footage that exposed people's absurdities than to depict their troubled socioeconomic situations, which so stressed, even deformed, their lives. Thus, the viewer looks askance at the county officer in charge of evictions; looks down on the ''air-head'' mentality of fluffy Miss Michigan (later Miss U.S.A.); looks with clinical concern at the ''meat or pets'' rabbit woman, who has such obvious disabilities that she can't be counted as an unemployed worker; looks with frustration as the Flint boosters flail away with their failing tourist strategies; looks with disbelief at the socialites locked in the ''Jailhouse Rock.''
But nowhere do the film maker, the viewer and the people captured on celluloid come together. Always there is the sense of Michael Moore waiting for the next opportunity to videotape, to add to the collection of things to ridicule, sometimes to expose or humiliate. For one whose overt message is ''help the people,'' this film conveys the feeling of the elitist film maker, who is as humanly insensitive as the General Motors robber baron he blames for Flint's demise.
Not to say that I don't agree with the message of ''Roger and Me.'' Flint is a mess. Much of Michigan is an economic morass. So too is Pittsburgh filled with parents who are often walk-ing tragedies and growing numbers of children at risk. There is something inherently wrong with our country when workers in Flint can't find jobs while G.M. is hiring thousands of Mexicans for a few pesos in expanding automotive plants just over the border. Or when steelworkers wait for a decade for the plants along the Monongahela to reopen, only slowly realizing that the rusting hulks will remain abandoned while new plants open in the Deep South or overseas.
I agree with Mr. Bensman that many workers and communities have made remarkable adaptations, and ''Roger and Me'' neglects the strength these copers with change show. But my experience is that only about half the population possesses the social and psychological resources to respond and adapt positively. Half are the victimized workers and families who end up in drugs, drink, crime and emotional deviance.
Those who increasingly find themselves at the bottom of the economic heap - hampered with little education and many mouths to feed, sometimes homeless and usually alienated, all too often without hope that their children have a chance for better fates - need our attention and thoughtful concern. They should not be the objects of our laughter. This is the most serious challenge we face as the next century looms.

HEADLINE: Needle Exchange Succeeding in Australia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was dismayed to learn that in New York City, your Mayor has decided to close the city's only needle and syringe exchange (news article, Feb. 14). Outlets for sterile needles and syringes have been established in almost every country in Western Europe. I understand that Canada has also opened such exchanges. In Australia, outlets for sterile needles and syringes are available almost throughout the country. 
A needle and syringe exchange program was established in the state of New South Wales in Australia in 1986. A recent independent evaluation of the needle and syringe exchange program was commissioned by the state government from a leading research company. This evaluation concluded that the exchange program has been an outstanding success and recommends its further extension.
Similar findings were contained in an independent evaluation commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain. Academic research to support the value of needle and syringe exchanges is available from the Netherlands, Britain and Australia. In a study I presented as a poster at the fifth International AIDS Conference held in Montreal last year, it was found that the opening of a needle and syringe exchange adjacent to a methadone maintenance unit did not increase drug taking in the methadone program as assessed by analysis of urine specimens.
Australia has the sixth highest rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Despite this relatively high rate of AIDS, Australia has a low rate of human immunodeficiency virus infection among intravenous drug users. A national study in 1989 showed that the rate of HIV infection in intravenous drug users in Sydney is about 3.5 percent. In Australia, a ''war on AIDS'' is preferred to ''a war on drugs.''
As more and more countries decide to introduce needle and syringe exchange, and as each of the participating countries opens more and more outlets, the decision to close the only needle and syringe exchange in New York City is both bewildering and dismaying.

HEADLINE: New York State Relying More on One-Time Revenues

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 25

 BODY:
Faced with bills it cannot pay, New York State is increasingly relying on financial maneuvers that provide quick cash but often cost the state more money in the long run.
So many of these maneuvers, known as one-shots, are expected to be included in the next state budget that analysts say they are becoming a threat to the long-term financial health of the state.
''These patchwork and Scotch-tape solutions just don't make sense,'' said Hyman Grossman, a managing director of Standard & Poor's. ''A really good, credible show would be to do away with one-shots altogether. But New York has gotten used to it, and they do it again and again and again. It's certainly going to be expensive.'' 
Among the moves that the state is expected to make to raise one-time revenues for the coming fiscal year are these:
* Changing payment schedules to put off expenses until nexteaear.
* Refincicing bonisissues tnrfree up thgmcash reserves atat are required under the current terms of t b bonds.
* Usg g complicated transactions to tradlolong-terasassets for oneimime cashayaymentpm including t s sale of the state's leases in the World Trade Center.
The state's growing reliance on complex maneuvers to convert assets into quick cash is, to some officials, reminiscent of the moves that New York City made leading up to the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's.
 
'Less Than Prudent'
''It's important to keep in mind that in the years leading up to 1975, there was an increasing volume and innovativeness in financing to produce short-term gains,'' said Stephen J. Weinstein, executive director of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the agency established during the fiscal crisis to give the city access to credit markets. ''To repeat such a pattern today would certainly be less than prudent.''
One-time revenues come in many forms. The most straightforward is a withdrawal from one of the state's reserve funds, which are maintained as insurance against unexpected costs.
But the state has had such severe financial trouble in recent years that many of its reserves are already depleted. Over the last few years, for example, the state has drawn almost $1 billion from reserves of the State Insurance Fund, which pays workers' compensation claims for the state and some private companies. Lacking ready reserves, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget office has come up with more and more complicated strategies for obtaining cash.
To many analysts, these maneuvers smack of gimmickry.
''None of them passes the smell test,'' said Cindy Green, a senior analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. ''And when you add them all up, they smell like Fresh Kills,'' the colossal landfill on Staten Island.
As New York's budget problems have worsened in recent years, the amount of nonrecurring revenues included in the budget has increased steeply. In 1986, the budget included $250 million in nonrecurring revenues, according to a recent report by the Assembly minority. By this year, the total had climbed to more than $1 billion. And for the next fiscal year, which starts next Sunday, the total is expected to grow again, to as much as $1.5 billion.
''The numbers are just too big,'' said Mr. Grossman of Standard & Poor's.
 
Credit Rating at Risk
Standard & Poor's has warned that it may lower the state's credit rating, and the agency has cited New York's increasing reliance on one-shots as a symptom of its inability to deal with its persistent budget problems.
The trouble with one-shots, financial analysts say, is that they mask a deficit that then becomes harder and harder to fill.
The state ends up paying for continuing programs with revenues that are available for only one year. This means that the next year, when inflation drives up the cost of the program, the gap between recurring expenses and recurring revenues will have grown that much wider.
''You are taking a recurring expenditure, but taking a revenue you can't repeat,'' said the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan. ''You just keep escalating the problem and then one day the bubble bursts.''
 
Practice Is Defended
Cuomo administration officials defend their heavy use of one-shots as a logical response to the state's sudden fiscal problems. They liken them to temporary aid that parents might give their children if they have suffered an economic setback.
''In the abstract, people will always complain about one-shots,'' Governor Cuomo's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, said. ''But what they have to decide is whether in the financial architecture of the budget it makes sense to use these nonrecurring revenues.''
Mr. Forsythe noted that without the money, the $51 billion budget that the Governor proposed in January would have had even more tax increases or spending cuts.
''It would have been more controversial than it already is,'' Mr. Forsythe said. Governor Cuomo proposed suspending the next phase of the state's scheduled income-tax cut. He also proposed raising $800 million in new fees and taxes, including a tax on long-distance telephone calls.
 
Sometimes Money Is Saved
The Governor has argued that suspending the tax cut, a move that would yield more than $1 billion next year, justifies the use of more than $1 billion in one-shots this year.
Some of these one-shots actually save the state money over time. By refinancing bonds that were paying high interest, for example, the state may be able to reduce its debt service costs. Several of the refinancing arrangements the state is planning, however, are intended simply to reduce the requirements for cash reserves.
Many one-shots provide cash for one year that must simply be paid back in the next year. For the coming fiscal year the Governor has, for example, proposed changing the schedule of state payments for the City University of New York's community colleges. This move would push $23 million of costs into the next fiscal year.
Other one-shots carry long-term costs, for often the money that is saved now has to be made up at greater expense later on. Recently, the state raised more than $400 million by refinancing bonds for the State University of New York. But over the next 30 years, it will cost the state $800 million more.
 
Complex Strategies
Some of the one-shot strategies the Cuomo adminstration wants to use to generate cash are so complex that even most budget experts in the Capitol confess they do not understand them.
An example of one of these maneuvers is the sale of the state's World Trade Center leases, which is supposed to yield $200 million in cash. In broad terms, the transaction would work like this:
New York State leases office space in the World Trade Center from its owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, at a rate lower than market value. The Port Authority has asked the state to move out of the World Trade Center so that it can lease the space at a higher rate. In return, the authority promised to deposit the profits from its higher rents in a fund that the state would use for capital projects.
Now the Cuomo administration wants to collect all of the money that would have gone into the fund at once. Under the plan, the state's Urban Development Corporation would float a bond issue and hand over the cash from the bond sale to the state. The U.D.C. would use the Port Authority payments to pay back the bonds over the next 25 or 30 years.
''What the state is doing is taking a stream of revenue and spending it in one lump sum,'' said one government economist, who asked not to be identified.
''Think of it like a cabinet where each drawer has cash,'' he continued. ''You may be able to rationalize taking the cash from some of the drawers. But at the point you've cleaned the whole thing out, you're up against the wall. And that's where they are now.''

HEADLINE: Dr. N. S. Fatemi, 79; Directed an Institute For Foreign Studies

 BODY:
Dr. Nasrollah S. Fatemi, director emeritus of the Graduate Institute of International Studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the author of books on subjects ranging from international economics to poetry, died of a heart attack on Friday at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Saddle River, N.J.
Dr. Fatemi, who was born in Nain, Persia, was a mayor, governor and member of Parliament after the country became Iran. He came to the United States in 1946 and served as Iran's delegate to the United Nations in 1952 and 1953.
He lectured at Princeton from 1950 to 1955 and then became a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson. He was appointed chairman of the social sciences department in 1960, dean of the graduate school in 1965 and director of the graduate institute, which he founded, in 1971. He retired in 1981.
Among the books he wrote were ''While the United States Slept'' (Cornwall, 1981), ''Diplomatic History of Persia'' (Whittier, 1951), ''Oil Diplomacy'' (Whittier, 1954), ''The Dollar Crisis'' (Fairleigh Dickinson Univeristy Press, 1964) and ''Multinational Corporations: Problems and Prospects'' (A. S. Barnes, 1975). The first volume of his projected four-volume autobiography, ''Reflections on the Time of Disillusion,'' was published recently by Mellioun.
Dr. Fatemi was Mayor of Shiraz from 1939 to 1941, Governor-General of the Fars province from 1941 to 1943 and a member of the Iranian Parliament from 1943 to 1947. He represented Iran at several international conferences after World War II.
He was a graduate of Stuart Memorial College in Iran and received a master's degree from Columbia University and a doctorate from the New School for Social Research.
He is survived by his wife, the former Shayesteh Ostovar; three sons, Faramarz, of Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.; Fairborz, of Washington, and Farivar, of Suffern, N.Y., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Klaus E. Knorr, 78, Professor; Argued Against Use of Military

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Dr. Klaus E. Knorr, professor emeritus of public affairs at Princeton University and the director of its Center of International Studies from 1960 to 1968, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 78 years old.
Dr. Knorr, a German-born economist and political scientist, wrote many books developing a thesis that the nuclear age had necessitated a global ascendance of diplomatic and economic policies over military options. The volumes included ''On the Uses of Military Power in the Nuclear Age'' (Princeton University Press, 1966), ''Military Power and Potential'' (Lexington Books, 1970) and ''Power and Wealth: The Political Economy of International Power'' (Basic Books, 1973). 
In mid-1968, while the Johnson Administration was continuing to accelerate American military involvement in South Vietnam, Dr. Knorr and three associates at the Princeton center wrote a detailed proposal for the withdrawal of American and North Vietnamese forces, the introduction of an international peacekeeping force and the formation of a neutral Saigon government. The war continued for seven more years.
Klaus Eugene Knorr was born on May 16, 1911, in Essen, Germany, and earned a law degree at the University of Tubingen. He resisted increasing pressure to join the Nazi party and immigrated to the United States in 1937.
He earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1941. He then taught economics at Stanford University and international economics and political science, first at Yale and then at Princeton. He taught at Princeton for 28 years, edited the journal, World Politics, for a decade and was the Tod Professor of Public Affairs from 1964 until he retired in 1979.
Over the years, Dr. Knorr was a consultant to the Department of State, the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency and was awarded the Government's National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal.
Surviving are his wife, Marianne; two daughters, Monica, of Washington, and Jean, of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Nicholas, of Glencoe, Ill., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Japan's Scratch-Pad Computers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 25

 BODY:
More than a decade into the personal computer revolution, tens of millions of people are still far more comfortable scribbling on a pad than typing on a computer keyboard. And few countries are more keyboard-phobic than Japan, where the enormous complexities of entering 7,000 Chinese-based ideographs into a personal computer have left offices shockingly unautomated.
Now, a few computer makers here are beginning to sell computers with a simple solution to the problem: They get rid of keyboards altogether.
In what may be a glimpse of computing's future, the Sony Corporation and Canon Inc. have begun to sell notebook-size machines that allow users to write on a touch-sensitive screen with a pen. Their writing is converted, not quite instantly, into neat rows of glowing computer type, which can be intermingled with careful electronic sketches or digitized doodles, then printed out in type just as is done on an ordinary personal computer. 
 
A New Way to Communicate
The battery-operated machines -some call them ''pen computers,'' others ''stylus systems'' or ''smart paper'' - cost from $500 to $2,300, and so far they are available only in Japan, where makers say the need is greatest. They still have their share of annoying technical glitches, chiefly mistakes in reading handwriting, and a host of Japanese and American companies are scurrying to improve the technology.
But experts say the sudden appearance of the Sony Palmtop and the Canon AI Note in Tokyo's gadget-jammed electronics stores mark the beginning of an entirely new way to communicate with computers - a user interface that may be even less intimidating than the ''mouse'' pointing devices that were invented to make personal computers more inviting. The technology could, in 5 or 10 years, make a computer the size of a writing tablet approachable to people who do not type and who refuse to go near anything that clacks and beeps.
Over time, the development could also rectify a huge technological imbalance: Though Japan's population and economy are half the size of those of the United States, market forecasters predict only 1.6 million personal computers will be sold here this year, compared with 12 million machines in the United States.
 
A Dream Notebook
''This has been a dream for us, because keyboards are so difficult,'' said Shingo Tamura, a leader of the development team at Sony.
Right now Mr. Tamura's dream looks more like a cross between an electronic Filofax and a Post-It Note - a place to keep quick notes, to append a description to an electronic picture, or to update a phone list or a calendar or a schedule. The difference is that the computer can retrieve, organize and combine drawings, notes and names that might be lost in a voluminous notebook.
Sony's machine goes a step further: It can take a handwritten note, convert it into clean type and drawings, dial the phone and send it as a facsimile.
 
Future Uses
In the future, the machines are expected to be used as an architect's sketchpad, a traveling salesman's order and notebook, and a place for musicians to compose and for lawyers to update their electronic files without disturbing the quiet of the courtroom.
Ultimately, the machines will be able to perform virtually all the functions of laptop computers with keyboards, including organizing columns of numbers, reaching powerful data bases and communicating with other computers of all sizes.
And there is a higher purpose: The arrival of computers without keyboards finally brings ''a socially acceptable way to doodle while looking busy during dull meetings,'' said Richard Shaffer, the editor of the Technologic Computer Letter.
 
Contest for Technology
Who will get the upper hand in the technology - American companies building on their strengths in computing or Japanese concerns building on theirs in consumer electronics - is far from clear.
Virtually all of the critical hardware technologies for the new machines are Japanese, including the pressure-sensitive screens that ''read'' handwriting and the high-density circuitry that makes it possible to pack the needed computer power into a tablet that weighs less than two pounds. But the software to make it all work, many believe, will play to the strengths of the American computer industry, and already there are forays into the technology.
The Grid Computer division of the Tandy Corporation already markets an ''electronic clipboard'' useful to people who fill out forms, though far less versatile than what is coming out in Japan. Similar technology has been used on desktop machines by Wang Laboratories, with only modest success so far.
The most promising project is at the GO Corporation, a Silicon Valley start-up. GO's first product is widely expected to be a versatile, pen-based machine that allows easy transfer of data to desktop personal computers.
 
Problems Inherent in Kanji
Anyone familiar with Japanese handwriting would know why the technology is of greater value to the Japanese. In written form, Japanese is a mixture of three ''alphabets'': two phonetic alphabets, called hiragana and katakana, which reproduce 46 sounds each (and a host of variants), and the more complex Chinese ideographs known as kanji. Most Japanese know more than 4,000 kanji.
Kanji have driven computer engineers to distraction. Early efforts to place the characters on keys produced keyboards so unwieldy that they were virtually useless. Most Japanese keyboards now use only the two phonetic alphabets, and software converts them to the appropriate kanji. Though the systems have improved greatly, they are still slow.
In the Sony Palmtop, which costs $1,300 and has optional equipment that can cost up to $1,000 more, the software is programmed to recognize the complex kanjis that are written on its screen - along with kana and the 26-letter Roman alphabet. The current version of the Canon machine, which at $500 is intended more as an electronic notebook, only recognizes the two phonetic alphabets and Roman letters; future versions are expected to include kanji.
 
Similarity to the Macintosh
The 4-by-6-inch liquid-crystal display screen of the Sony machine, which is hard to read except in direct light, draws heavily on the use of the small pictographs or ''icons'' in the Apple Macintosh. With a special pen, a user can open up a clean ''page,'' or touch the picture of a shredder to eliminate a file.
Entries can be written in an agenda, and names or telephone and fax numbers scribbled in an electronic telephone book. Database software in the machine catalogues the information, and it can also record eight seconds of sound, mostly voice messages, that are appended to individual files.
A small $300 disk drive and a $475 modem for connection to a fax machine, which can be used instead of a printer, are essential for anyone who needs to save and transmit data.
 
The Machine's Heart and Heel
But the machine's heart - the handwriting recognition system, which took Sony five years to develop - is also its Achilles heel.
There are two ways for machines to recognize handwriting. One is a ''static'' system that looks at the letter after it is written, much as a person would glance at a written letter. Its success depends on the clarity of the writer's handwriting, because each letter must come close to matching an ideal image of that letter in the computer's memory.
But kanji are incredibly complex, sometimes requiring 20 or more strokes to write. So Sony and Canon chose a second way to recognize handwriting, called dynamic recogition.
 
Relying on Order of Pen Strokes
The computer literally traces the pen strokes used to write a Roman letter, a phonetic letter or a kanji as they are being made, and compares them with a series of pen strokes stored in the computer's memory. This system lends itself to Japanese users, because from their earliest schooling all Japanese are taught a specific stroke order for writing each kana or kanji.
''We are depending on the Japanese being well disciplined,'' said Tomoshi Hirayama, a member of the team that developed the machine. ''And most of them are.'' The problem is that if a writer makes an error forming any character, the result, although clear to the eye, may be unrecognizable to the machine.
In the West, of course, schools do not teach a uniform way of making pen strokes to form letters, so the Japanese machines may prove unworkable.
 
Advantages for Canon
Canon actually beat Sony to the market, but has significantly further to go. Its machine's advantage is that users can write notes anywhere on the screen, while on the Sony Palmtop letters or characters must be placed in a small box. But the Canon computer recognizes only handwritten kana, not kanji. The kana are converted to kanji later, a somewhat laborious process.
Nonetheless, Canon sold 30,000 units of a less-capable version of its machine, far better than expected, when the computer came on the market last year. A new model, available this month, is expected to do better yet; it can easily be connected to a printer.
While the notebook computer is mostly a novelty for now, it could someday become popular enough to help Canon and Sony attack the dominant positions of the NEC Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation in the laptop computer market in both Japan and the United States.

Pressure On the Fed Increasing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee is probably not going to approve a change in monetary policy when it meets tomorrow in Washington. But a growing number of analysts say the central bank may now be leaning toward its first tightening of policy in nearly a year.
The impetus for tightening is clear, these economists say. Inflation, though restrained from its spurt in January, remains at naggingly high levels. And reports on the economy, though distorted by abnormally warm winter weather, nevertheless suggest that recession has been avoided. 
There are, however, sizable impediments that for now block a policy change that would move the overnight federal funds rate, the market rate the Fed most closely controls, from its current 8 1/4 percent.
The dollar remains very strong, particularly against the yen. Higher American rates would cause the dollar to climb even further, making American exports more expensive and leading to greater trade imbalances with the Japanese and other nations.
In addition, analysts say the Fed cannot afford to ignore the possible fallout from the sharp slide in Japanese stock prices.
 
'Not Open and Shut'
''We think the case for tightening is pretty solid, but it is not open and shut,'' said Richard B. Berner, a vice president and economist at Salomon Brothers. ''At the very least, the Fed has to be dismayed with the latest inflation numbers, which have edged up in spite of special, weather-related factors. But for currency reasons, right now is probably a bad time to think about tightening monetary policy.''
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president and chief executive of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants, a subsidiary of John Hancock Freedom Securities, said: ''The main impediment to a Fed tightening is the dollar. If it remains strong against the Japanese yen, it will prevent them from tightening, and may even force an ease in interest rates.''
At the moment, the Fed has no reason to react to the recent steep drop in the Tokyo stock market. But the plunge, which since the start of the year has wiped out close to $1 trillion in wealth, has to be a source of concern.
''The fall in the Tokyo stock market is not something the Fed has to respond to yet,'' said S. Waite Rawls, vice chairman of Continental Bank, ''but it is impossible to think that there will be no ripple effect from what has happened in Tokyo.''
David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, estimates that $800 billion to $900 billion worth of wealth has been erased in Tokyo's market plunge.
 
'Act of Masochism'
Japan's problems are serious, he said, but the Fed has other reasons to reject an urge to tighten monetary policy.
''For the kind of economy we are now in, one that is teetering on the brink of recession, it would be an act of masochism for the Fed to tighten policy,'' he said. ''We need to have lower interest rates.''
Even if the Fed maintains a neutral stance, market interest rates are likely to remain close to current levels for some time to come, analysts said.
A renewed supply of Treasury securities, starting with this week's auctions of two- and four-year notes, will tend to prevent rates from falling. And uncertainty about the economy is almost certain to linger.
''The market has to wait until it sees the March economic data before it can be satisfied that the numbers are a bit stronger,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''But right now the market doesn't have any conviction as to what it ought to do.''
 
Short-Term vs. Long-Term Yields
Indeed, given the current configuration of the yield curve, with yields on shorter-term notes above those offered on long-term bonds, some money managers say the market may have already anticipated a tightening by the Fed.
''The front end continues to expect that the Fed will tighten,'' said Gail P. Seneca, managing partner at GMG/ Seneca Capital Management, a San Francisco firm that has $200 million in taxable fixed-income securities under management. ''But I can't see a reason for the Fed to do that. As a result, if I were going to be making a bet on the yield curve, I would do it at the short end.''
At the end of last week the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.58 percent. The 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price to yield 8.47 percent.
After weeks of moving higher, interest rates have recently become more stable, causing an increasing number of corporations to issue new debt securities. $2 Billion in Corporate Debt Last week, investment-grade issuance of corporate debt amounted to around $2 billion, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers, well up from an average of $900 million for the first 10 weeks of the year.
This week's calendar of expected offerings looks fairly light, but corporate finance specialists say that appearance could be deceiving. They note that with the implementation of shelf registration, corporations can file a debt prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission far ahead of when a deal is actually priced.
''Based on the last couple of weeks, business should be O.K.,'' an investment banker said. ''We are in the last month of the quarter, and people feel like they need to get some things done. And they might be worried that rates are going to go higher.''

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Global Strategies Vs. National Ties

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOR many American manufacturers, putting factories abroad - going global - is a top priority. They are learning to be as much at home in Europe and Asia as they are in the United States, and in the process they are redefining the meaning of ''home country.'' Having one is still important, it seems, but not in the old sense of the phrase.
The issue is not patriotism, but whether global companies like International Business Machines or Ford Motor or Motorola, drawing much of their revenue and profits from the sale of products made in their overseas factories, have to concern themselves with the prosperity of the United States. Can an American company be competitive in the world marketplace if the United States is losing ground as a center of skilled workers, research and high-technology industries? 
The final answer is not in yet, but some important hints are emerging in the responses of various executives to a recent article on global companies in The Harvard Business Review. The author, Robert B. Reich, a political economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, argued that global companies, whether Japanese, American or West German, do not greatly concern themselves with national loyalties. Over the long run, their factories go to the countries offering the best conditions for modern production. The United States, therefore, should create those conditions, Mr. Reich wrote, and not worry about the nationalities of the companies lured here. What really counts is the wealth their spending and production bestow on Americans.
Many executives agree in principle with Mr. Reich but say that he misses some subtleties that tie companies and countries together. Few corporations in the world are more global than I.B.M., which has huge operations in Japan and Europe as well as in the United States. But Jack Kuehler, I.B.M.'s president, took exception to Mr. Reich in a letter to The Review. Mr. Kuehler, in his letter, and another I.B.M. official, in an interview, argued, in effect, that I.B.M. has to be concerned with the competitiveness and well-being of any country or region that is a major source of I.B.M. revenue. And the United States accounts for 40 percent of the company's worldwide sales.
Thus, I.B.M. is developing with Siemens A.G. of West Germany a 64-megabyte computer chip that is many times more powerful than the semiconductors now in use. The research is being done in both the United States and Europe. The goal is to have a source of supply in each marketplace by the mid-1990's, for use in I.B.M. computers made and sold here and in Europe. As for Japan, the source of supply for I.B.M.'s operations there might be Japanese companies developing a similar chip. Describing the American, Japanese and European economies as three legs in a stool, the I.B.M. official said, ''We want to balance this game out, so that two legs don't get bigger than the third.'' For I.B.M., then, all three regions are ''home country,'' requiring sophisticated production networks.
Richard W. Heimlich, vice president for international strategy at Motorola Inc., acknowledged that Motorola does sometimes have to ignore its American ties in pursuit of technology and the best manufacturing centers - but it does so unwillingly. ''Any company has a national bias, and to the extent a company can keep its best stuff at home, it will do so,'' Mr. Heimlich said. That bias helps to explain why the United States remains for Motorola the center of its research and its most advanced manufacturing for two major products: cellular telephones, so common now in cars, and the telephone pagers and beepers that people wear on their belts.
Both products originated in the United States, which remains a leader in the field. When it comes to semiconductors for calculators and other consumer devices or advanced electronic systems to control highway traffic, Motorola goes abroad, national bias notwithstanding. Government policies in Europe and East Asia have helped to give those areas an edge in these fields.
''Japan has identified intelligent vehicle highway systems as a priority, while the United States is just talking about this technology,'' he said. ''If the other folks push ahead, then we want to participate, and we've set up an operation abroad to work closely with them.''
So, are American managers concerned about their nation's well-being? Plainly, many are. Will the ties remain strong? No one knows. If China were somehow, someday to become a bigger market for I.B.M. computers than the United States, then I.B.M. executives in the 21st century are not likely to insist on wrapping themselves in the American flag. But as Mr. Heimlich argues, many executives running American companies today, given their druthers, prefer to stay home.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Fell by 3.4% Last Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
New orders for American-made machine tools in February fell by 3.4 percent from January, the third consecutive monthly decline. The drop reflected a slowing of the economy and a stagnancy in the automobile industry.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, the trade association for the machine tool industry, said in a report released today that machine tool orders declined to $194.5 million, from $201.3 million in January.
The February total was down by 31 percent from the $281.9 million in new orders in February 1989. For the first two months of the year, new orders were down by 22.8 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. 
 
Linked to Economic Growth
''This is an industry that is closely tied to economic growth,'' said Robert F. McCarthy, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ''And because the economy is slowing, the machine tool industry is directly affected. Because of uncertainty about the economy, companies are delaying their buying of new machinery. And the auto industry is still in a slowdown, which affects the order rate of new machine tools.''
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of machine tool orders generally reflects the strength in industrial production, and economists consider their sales patterns to be important indicators of capital spending patterns by manufacturers.
The level of orders from foreign customers declined by 11.2 percent in February, and the analysts said that was a sign of a stronger dollar. Compared with the level of orders in February 1989, new foreign orders rose by 11.3 percent. The orders from foreign customers increased by 27.3 percent in the first two months of this year from the levels of the comparable period last year.
''We are seeing a pause in domestic business activity, as manufacturers weigh their investment needs for the 1990's,'' said Albert W. Moore, the president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va. ''There is concern about United States interest rates and the effects of higher rates in Japan and West Germany.''
 
Concern Over Standards
Mr. Moore said American manufacturers were concerned about coming fuel and pollution standards on products and manufacturing. ''But United States manufacturers cannot afford to pause much longer,'' he said. ''World competitive conditions dictate that they must invest to survive.''
Many executives of machine tool companies acknowledge that the industry is in a slow period but predict that conditions will improve dramatically in the second half of the year.
''Things will be slow for another two months or so,'' said Michael J. Murphy, the vice president of sales and marketing with the Danley Machine Corporation, a machine tool subsidiary of Connell & Company. ''But things will pick up in the last half of the year, unless there is a recession. Even though some capital spending programs are on hold, they are programs that will have to eventually proceed.''
Shipments of machine tools were up by 18.4 percent in February, to $268 million, from January's level. Shipments increased by 17.1 percent from February 1989. The level of shipments climbed by 29.8 percent, compared with the 1989 period.
The association's report showed that new orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were down by 17.6 percent from January, to $116.3 million. That segment of the industry typically accounts for about three-quarters of the industry's orders. New orders for metal-forming tools increased by 30.1 percent, to $78.2 million.
The backlog for machine tools was $1.7 billion in February, down from January's $1.77 billion. The February 1989 backlog was $2.32 billion.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Pressures On Drug Stocks

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
THE robust earnings growth that polished the attractiveness of drug stocks in the 1980's owed much to aggressive increases in drug prices. But pressures to restrain prices are building and that may at least partly explain why pharmaceutical stocks have slipped. This year, pharmaceuticals trail the market by about 5 percent.
Other reasons for the slippage that several analysts cited include profit taking by investors worried about the possibility of a general slide in the stock market and uncertainty about the dollar, which has been strong against the yen. Those pharmaceutical makers that have a large presence in Japan would suffer if the dollar continued to advance against the yen, which would reduce their Japanese profits. 
On the price front, Senator David H. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Aging, is preparing legislation to prod the drug makers to bid against each other for state Medicaid business. This business accounts for about 13 percent of American drug sales. The Pryor bill is given little chance this year. Even if passed, it would probably not take effect before 1993. But Mr. Pryor's attack on drug prices, which seems to be gathering support in Washington and among insurers, has upset some investors.
Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck & Company, acknowledged in a talk with analysts late last year that ''there is tremendous pressure on pricing now.'' He said annual price increases at Merck had been ''targeted on recovering what we lost to inflation'' in the 1970's. Last year, Merck's increases were, on average, at the level of the Consumer Price Index, he said. The index rose 4.6 percent in 1989. ''We believe we have caught up,'' he said. ''That's where we like to be.''
In Japan, which is second only to the United States in pharmaceutical sales, the Government will lower drug prices next month by 9 to 10 percent. Merck and Pfizer Inc. have the biggest exposure in Japan, said Mary Ellen McCarthy, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. She said drug prices would also be under pressure in Western Europe, where lower trade barriers are planned in 1992. ''Wholesalers will buy in Spain, for example, where prices are lower, and sell in the United Kingdom,'' she predicted.
Nonetheless Ms. McCarthy said she was moderately bullish about drug stocks. She singles out Eli Lilly & Company, whose results have been helped by its Prozac antidepressant drug and strong sales in medical instruments.
Lilly's stock closed unchanged Friday at $61.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Merck was at $69.625, up 87.5 cents, and Pfizer at $58.875, up 50 cents.
Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber said he was more concerned about American prospects than foreign ones. He said that overall corporate earnings were slipping and that the relatively strong drug earnings would shine in the ensuing gloom.
''We think earnings of the Standard & Poor's 400 and 500 will be down 5 to 10 percent in 1990, followed by 10 to 12 percent growth in 1991,'' he said. ''By comparison, drug earnings will be up in aggregate by 19 percent in 1990 and 17 percent in 1991. The relative earnings story will make drug stocks turn around.''
Among the first signs of what lies ahead will be the first-quarter results released in mid-April. Barbara Ryan at Prudential-Bache Securities said she expected 10 percent growth, on average, in drug earnings, compared with about 16 percent in the first quarter of 1989, which was a banner year for the companies. ''We don't think the group will outperform the market this year,'' she said.
Earnings of three companies - Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lilly and Schering-Plough - are accelerating, Ms. Ryan said, adding: ''The rest are all decelerating. Our single best idea is Bristol-Myers.''
She said she was enthusiastic about Bristol-Myers's research potential and the company's ''strong over-the-counter presence.'' The over-the-business is important, she said, because pharmaceutical companies will be coming under pressure from the Government and major insurers to slow the rate of price increases on prescription drugs. ''But the consumer products that you and I buy will continue to be able to raise their prices,'' she said. ''We think Bristol will have consistent 20 percent growth over the next several years.''
Bristol-Myers closed at $52.25, up 25 cents, while Schering-Plough was at $78.75, up $1.
For more aggressive investors, Stuart Z. Levine at Gruntal & Company likes SmithKline Beecham. The company was formed last year by the merger of the British company Beecham and SmithKline Beckman of Philadelphia. He said the stock had been selling at a deep discount compared with the other drug companies, after reports that the recently merged company was having trouble finding a buyer as it tried to sell its cosmetics business to pay down debt.
''We are looking for a lot of benefits coming out of the merger from restructuring during 1990 and co-promoting each other's products,'' Mr. Levine said. He also likes Merck, Warner-Lambert and Schering-Plough.
On Friday, SmithKline closed at $40.75, up $1, while Warner-Lambert was at $103, up $1.875.
Steven M. Kaye, who manages the Fidelity Select Health Care Fund, said, ''SmithKline is clearly the cheapest buy in the drug group.'' His fund recently bought some stock in the company. ''They took it on the chin after they reported their numbers,'' he said. ''I am taking a longer-time view.''
Mr. Kaye is also a contrarian on Pfizer, which he said he bought ''fairly heavily'' when news about problems with a Pfizer heart valve drove the stock down in February. ''Those reports were totally overblown,'' he insisted.

HEADLINE: Judge Permits Wickes Suit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., March 25

 BODY:
A judge has cleared the way for a union representing employees of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation to sue the Wickes Corporation for damages stemming from a failed 1986 takeover attempt of Owens-Corning by Wickes.
A spokeswoman for Wickes said it would appeal the Friday ruling by Superior Court Judge Raymond F. Drozdowski that denied Wickes's request to dismiss the case. 
The Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International union, based in Media, Pa., contended in its suit that Wickes had ''interfered with economic expectations'' between union members and Owens-Corning.
In August 1986, Wickes, best known for its home improvement centers and furniture business, abandoned the takeover attempt after its $2.1 billion tender offer apparently lost to a restructuring plan proposed by Owens-Corning, which is based in Toledo, Ohio.
In October 1986, Owens-Corning announced that it would lay off 5,000 workers nationwide, including 500 at its Barrington, N.J., plant, to thwart the takeover attempt. Wickes, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., made a $30 million profit after expenses from the takeover bid.

HEADLINE: An Aging Nation Grapples With Care for Old and Ill

SERIES: Care of the Elderly; Private Burdens, Public Choices - First of four articles.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Care of the frail and chronically ill elderly, long a private burden of families, is fast becoming a public obsession and a volatile political issue as the older population increases and members of the baby boom generation face the aging of their own parents.
The nation's current system of long-term care leaves many elderly people in fear and some destitute and demoralized, in the view of many experts and families who have struggled with the problem.
A shortage of affordable community programs - a visiting aide to watch a wandering Alzheimer's patient or a day center to provide meals and society to the frail and isolated - forces some people into nursing homes unnecessarily. It also means there is too little relief for the millions of relatives, usually wives or daughters, who care for the disabled at home, often at the expense of their own lives.
And haunting most of the elderly is the specter of financial ruin. Accounts abound of people who watched in despair as nursing home bills consumed the savings of a lifetime. Many who need chronic care must spend their assets until they qualify for Medicaid, the Federal-state welfare program for the poor - a process of ''spending down'' that people describe as terrifying and humiliating. 
 
The Spending 'Kills People'
''Spending down is horrendous,'' said Nancy Lombardo, a director of the Alzheimer's Association, who has talked with hundreds of families with a member affected by the irreversible brain disease. ''It kills people.''
The political passions surrounding the health concerns of the aged became abundantly clear last year, as Congress was forced to repeal a major program to cover the medical costs of catastrophic illnesses after adopting it with fanfare the year before. An unexpected outcry about the way of paying for the program incited the opposition that led to the reversal. But the debate also threw a spotlight on what many older people said was their greater worry, long-term care.
So far, there is no agreement on where private responsibility ends and public responsibility begins, on how much money Government should, or could, spend to ease the burdens.
In Washington and in state capitals, well-organized groups are demanding more government support. ''We have insurance for retirement, and we have insurance for acute medical care,'' said John Rother, the chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, referring to the Social Security and Medicare programs. ''It doesn't seem logical to leave out the thing that can wipe families out, long-term care.''
Politicians are taking up the cry, but even the most sympathetic shudder at the thought of a major new Government obligation, one for which the cost is certain to rise dramatically in the decades ahead. Officials are only too aware of the strains that programs like Medicare are already placing on the Federal budget.
The numbers are daunting. Those 85 and older, who are most apt to need assistance, are increasing more than three times as fast as the population as a whole. A 1987 Federal study projected that the total number of elderly Americans needing some type of help, then about six and a half million, would climb to 19 million by 2040.
Yet the number of family members able to aid the disabled at home - still the mainstay of the nation's care system - is expected to decline, not only because of the changing demographic structure but also because more women, who have traditionally handled such care, hold jobs and more families are smaller or scattered. Both are especially true of the baby boom generation, whose parents are now reaching old age.
 
Facing Poverty
Surviving Spouses Left With Little
Only a minority of the elderly ever face huge bills for chronic care. People 65 years old have a 44 percent chance of entering a nursing home at some point in their remaining years. Only 13 percent, or about one in seven, can expect to spend a year or more in a nursing home, according to a study by LifePlans, a private consulting group on long-term care in Waltham, Mass.
But a prolonged stay in a nursing home or extensive paid assistance at home often means financial disaster. Nursing homes cost an average of close to $30,000 a year, and the cost is more in some regions like New York. A 1987 study by the House Select Committee on Aging found that two-thirds of single elderly people would have their incomes and assets depleted to the Federal poverty level if they paid for one year in a nursing home. Half of elderly couples would be similarly impoverished in a year.
One who knows what nursing home bills can do is Mabel Crim, a 92-year-old widow in Margate, Fla. She and her husband, Russell, a former plant manager for Standard Oil, had felt secure on their retirement in Florida, given his pension, Social Security benefits and the $35,000 they had saved ''to take care of us when we got old,'' as she put it in a recent interview.
Then, at age 88, Mr. Crim had a heart attack and a series of strokes that left him seriously incapacitated, and he spent his last two years in a nursing home.
''The nursing home took all my savings,'' Mrs. Crim said. ''I was glad I had it and could pay it, but it left me high and dry.'' Once her funds were exhausted, the state's Medicaid program took over.
Now, her husband gone, she maintains herself and her one-bedroom apartment with Social Security benefits and financial help from her daughters. ''I get along,'' she says without bitterness.
But one daughter, Iona Gilbert, is angrier. ''My mother is turning 92 this month, and they left her without a cent,'' she said.
''She had daughters to help her, or she'd be out in the street,'' said Mrs. Gilbert. ''I don't know what happens to those little old ladies down there with nobody.''
 
Facing Distress
Using Welfare Torments Many
While Medicare and private health insurance will usually pay for medical treatment, neither covers custodial care of the type needed by those with chronic physical or mental disorders. Increasingly, private insurance is offered for long-term care, but only a small number of people have bought it so far, and policies, usually costing $100 a month or more, are beyond the financial reach of most elderly people, experts say.
Instead, except for the poor, chronic-care bills must be paid out of pocket. Middle-income people often pay until their assets are so depleted they can qualify for Medicaid.
The Medicaid spend-down has achieved a fearful notoriety among the elderly; spouses of the disabled have sometimes even resorted to divorce so they could preserve their standard of living. For a widowed or single person too, the quick loss of a lifetime's savings and of any chance of passing assets on to children is a wrenching blow.
Recent changes in the law have increased the amount that spouses, like Mabel Crim, can keep before getting Medicaid help. The rules differ by state, but Federal guidelines allow spouses to keep the couple's house and, this year, at least $856 a month in income and at least $12,516 in assets. States may allow as much as $1,565 in income and $62,580 in assets, though most have chosen the lower limits.
While advocates of the elderly cheer these changes, they say the limits still force a real decline in living standards and security on some surviving spouses. And single people are still left with virtually nothing: they can usually keep a small spending allowance and little more than $2,000 in assets. Those who are able to return home after spending time in an institution are often left with little.
The critics also argue that reliance on a welfare program, Medicaid, to meet a basic, predictable need of millions of middle-class Americans is a distortion of that program and a source of humiliation.
''Here's a man who always paid his taxes, who raised four daughters, a World War I veteran, and he ends up on charity,'' Mrs. Gilbert said of her father. ''That's the part that really hurt.''
''Knowing that the only way to get help is to give up your funds and go on welfare only adds to the distress,'' said Mrs. Lombardo of the Alzheimer's Association. ''People are tormented by this.''
Protecting assets has become a fixation for many older people who figure that if they should be incapacitated, they will need to rely on Medicaid but want to preserve their spouse's standard of living or their children's inheritance. The recent improvement in the law should reduce the number of divorces, but still, more than a few widowed older people are avoiding remarriage to avoid putting their assets in jeopardy, said Fernando Torres-Gil, an associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California.
Although the Government says it violates the spirit of the law, many people find legal ways to transfer assets to relatives or to use trusts or other devices to shelter funds.
''Financially sophisticated people who are accustomed to dealing with attorneys, accountants, and financial planners can find ways to protect their assets and still qualify for Medicaid,'' writes Stephen A. Moses, a former official the Department of Health and Human Services, in the February issue of The Gerontologist. ''Others, with less financial savvy, often lose what little they have before they learn how the system works.''
This means that fewer families of nursing home patients are bankrupted than would be suggested by income data alone. But it also means that the burdens of care and the benefits of public aid are being apportioned inequitably.
 
Seeking Help
Providing Care Fills the Day
At least Medicaid pays for nursing homes once people have used most of their own money or if they were poor to start. But for everyone, nursing homes are the answer of last resort. A much larger problem is the lack of home services and aid for the family and friends who care for the disabled elderly.
The stereotype of callous children notwithstanding, most of the country's disabled are cared for in their own homes or those of their children.
With the aging of the population, ''increasingly the caregivers are old too,'' notes Stephen McConnell, the director of public affairs with the Alzheimer's Association. ''More and more, it's the 65-year-old woman taking care of 85-year-old parents.''
Relatives often go to extraordinary lengths before they send a loved one to an institution. Social workers say they know of too many daughters working themselves to exhaustion trying to attend to an infirm parent while raising families of their own and too many devoted wives and husbands, frail themselves, struggling for years to provide grueling 24-hour aid to a chronically ill spouse.
Uldene Ditter, 72, of Ferndale, Mich., considers herself among the more fortunate of those caring for a disabled spouse, but her daily strains and especially her financial insecurity have led her to become an outspoken advocate of change.
Her husband of half a century has been in bed for the last five years with advancing Alzheimer's disease. She is determined to keep him out of a nursing home. ''He doesn't have a bedsore,'' she said proudly in an interview. ''I feel like I'm doing the right thing.''
Mrs. Ditter's job is an unpaid one almost without end. She gets away for 4 hours on Tuesdays when a volunteer comes, and another 4 hours on Wednesdays when a hired women comes, but apart from that, she said, ''I'm here, 24 hours a day.'' These brief hours of respite are crucial. ''It just lifts me up to get out,'' she said. ''Sometimes I get real down.'' She also gets help from a nurse who comes three times a week to bathe her husband.
But money, and thus her own future, are constant concerns. ''Just bed pads and diapers cost me $135 a month,'' she said. ''I'm getting into my savings.''
''You think you're doing well, then something falls apart in the house,'' she said. ''And of course, with him here I have to keep the furnace up a little higher.''
Of $15 billion in Federal Medicaid funds to be devoted to long-term care in the 1990 fiscal year, less than 3 percent will pay for home services. Many states and localities are now experimenting with a host of promising programs designed to help disabled people stay in the community. But overall, ''there are very few services available to people caring for older relatives and friends,'' said Bette Mullen, the director of the women's initiative program of the A.A.R.P. ''And there's a lack of knowledge of the services that do exist.''
 
Daunting Prospects
More Will Need Extensive Care
Demographic and social change portend an enormous rise in the need for expensive care. The problem is not just the aging of the population, but also ''the aging of the elderly population,'' observes Kenneth G. Manton, a demographer at Duke University. Those over 85 are rapidly increasing in number.
At the same time, Dr. Manton said, there will be relatively fewer relatives available to provide care at home. And this, he warns, almost inevitably means ''a shift from voluntary, family sources of care to paid care'' like professional home services and nursing homes.
Now, on any given day, about 5 percent of the elderly are in a nursing home, or a total of 1.4 million in 1987, according to Federal data.
Three-fourths of the nursing home residents are women, mostly widows, reflecting the tendency for women to outlive men and the related consequence that they are less likely to have a surviving spouse to care for them at home.
But these numbers mask the enormous differences in the conditions of the younger and older ones among the elderly. Of those age 65 to 74, only about 2 percent are in nursing homes and of those 75 to 84, 6 percent.
But in the 85-plus age group, 23 percent, or more than one in five, are in nursing homes, according to Federal surveys.
Simply because so many more of them suffer severe dementia or physical infirmities, the rapid growth of the group over 85 means that a rising share of the elderly will require nursing homes or other close, expensive care. It also means there will be relatively more infirm elderly people relative to healthy elderly people who could assist them, Dr. Manton said.
At the same time, the tendency of more women to hold jobs and other changes in the family mean that relatively fewer children are likely be available to help. Without a corresponding increase in professional home-care services, there could be ''a deterioration in the ability of the disabled to stay in the community,'' Dr. Manton warned.
For a variety of economic and cultural reasons, blacks, Hispanic people and other minority groups are dramatically under-represented in nursing homes relative to the proportion of the population they make up. Many Hispanic people and Asians, for example, still see nursing homes as ''a strange and unnatural system,'' said Dr. Torres-Gil, and a tradition of extended family ties and care in the home, as well as financial concerns, has meant that the disabled from minority groups were especially likely to be kept in the community.
But now the elderly from minority groups, too, are increasing rapidly, and traditional family ties are often breaking down. This, he asserted, only underscores the desperate need for home-care services and other alternatives tailored especially to minority communities.
 
Planning Ahead
Future Poses A Social Choice
One reason nursing home costs come as such a shock to so many people is simply that they have not planned for them. Saving for retirement is part of the American way, but Americans have not traditionally thought of saving or buying insurance to cover the expenses of long-term care. Yet Government policy explicitly requires people to devote nearly all available resources on such care before receiving aid. Given these clashing assumptions it is not surprising that those who encounter the large expenses of such care feel bitter and betrayed.
''We do not expect people to exhaust their resources or sell their homes when they suffer a heart attack, but we do so for long-term care,'' said the report issued this month by a bipartisan commission on health care known as the Pepper Commission, after the late Representative Claude Pepper. ''There is no intrinsic reason why this is so; it is a matter of social choice.''
Broader government support of long-term care costs could take the form of universal coverage without considering recipients' resources, like Medicare, or remain linked to recipients' ability to pay. Any new program is apt to encourage wider use of private insurance by the more affluent among the elderly. Even the most sympathetic politicians warn, though, that any new Federal aid is unlikely to be generous, given concerns over the budget deficit and competing social needs.
More and more, experts say, planning ahead for the possible expense of chronic care will have to be a customary rite of aging.

HEADLINE: Losses at Savings and Loans In 1989 Were the Biggest Ever

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The savings and loan industry had its worst year ever in 1989, with losses soaring to $19.2 billion, Federal regulators said today.
With the industry's recent troubles, a record loss was expected, but not one of that magnitude. It was far steeper than the biggest previous shortfall, which came in 1988, when savings and loans lost $13.4 billion, and the size of the deficit for the fourth quarter, $6.5 billion, took many by surprise.
In fact, the 485 troubled institutions had losses from operations of $2.6 billion in the quarter. That works out to a loss to taxpayers of $29 million a day for as long as the ailing institutions stayed open in the last three months of 1989. The remaining $3.9 billion loss was a result of the institutions reducing the stated value of some loans and assets, in recognition that they were worthless, at the instructions of regulators. 
Some analysts have noted that both the recent legislation to bail out the industry, which put numerous restraints on surviving savings and loans, and competition from banks and other financial institutions for mortgage business are making it significantly harder for the savings and loans to make money.
 
'New Reason for Insolvency'
''I see a growing viability problem that, in effect, is a whole new reason for insolvency,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''I find these numbers troubling.''
There is little disagreement that a year from now the industry will be significantly smaller than it is now, as institutions are sold off by the Government or liquidated.
Some have argued that there are simply too many savings and loans and that the failures, insolvencies and losses will not stop until most of that excess capacity has been eliminated.
Experts pointed out that aggressive regulation by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency that is managing the savings and loan bailout, is forcing institutions to acknowledge accumulated losses by reducing the value of their loans and real estate holdings to market levels for accounting purposes.
The cost of the savings and loan collapse was underscored when L. William Seidman, chairman of Resolution Trust, told Congress that the failure of Florida's largest savings institution, the Centrust Bank of Miami, was likely to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
Centrust, which was seized by regulators on Feb. 2, has become the latest institution to come under scrutiny by the House Banking Committee. The committee is investigating the causes of the Centrust failure; with $10 billion in assets, the institution had invested heavily in high-yield ''junk bonds'' and was run, as regulators described it, as ''a private investment banking or trading operation.''
 
Flamboyant Chairman
The committee is also investigating Centrust's chairman, David L. Paul. Known for his flamboyant, high-spending life in Miami, he had Centrust buy a $6 million yacht, called the Bodacious, received more than $16 million in compensation over five years and used his home to display large parts of Centrust's $29 million art collection, including Renoir's painting ''Man as Mars.''
Regulators are now saying privately that the cost of Centrust could be as high as $3 billion, eclipsing the cost of closing the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif. That would make Centrust the single costliest failure to date.
The industry's huge deficit capped a year in which regulators and members of Congress tried to confront the tremendous size of the problem created by lax regulations, bad real estate lending, fraud and insider dealing. The landmark legislation passed last summer was intended to close down at least a third of the industry at a cost to taxpayers and healthy institutions over the next decade of at least $159 billion; analysts say the estimate has now risen to more than $200 billion.
The fourth-quarter losses were almost entirely concentrated at the 485 insolvent savings and loans that either had been taken over by the Government or were targets for Government seizure, regulators said.
 
Hopes for the Future
James Freund, the acting chief economist of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the regulatory agency created by the legislation, painted a hopeful picture, saying that ''we are seeing a substantial segment of institutions emerging that are profitable and going about their business successfully.''
Some members of Congress rejected the characterization of the situation as an improvement.
''Not only are the numbers devastating, but once again the O.T.S. attempts to sugar-coat the news, a pattern reminiscent of Danny Wall's era of rosey scenarios,'' said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. M. Danny Wall had been the head of the Office Thrift Supervision until he left the agency under pressure earlier this month.
Other analysts also saw ominous signs in the numbers released by regulators today.
They noted that in the fourth quarter alone, 581 institutions that had not been scheduled for Government seizure had a total loss of $1.3 billion, indicating that many of these associations might have a hard time surviving. A group of 1,818 healthy institutions had a total profit of about $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. There were 88 fewer institutions reporting a profit than in the third quarter.
 
Signs of Trouble
''I have always found that the number of unprofitable institutions is a leading indicator of S.&L.'s on their way to trouble,'' Mr. Ely said.
Since August, the trust corporation has sold or liquidated 52 institutions and just last week Mr. Seidman announced plans to either liquidate or sell 140 more by the end of June.
Regulators have been severely criticized for the slowness of the initial pace in addressing the problem, adding to the ultimate cost to the public. Some experts predicted that examiners from the Resolution Trust corporation will continue to come down hard on institutions to reduce the book value of their assets, to put as much of the problem behind them as quickly as possible.
That could lead to similar high losses in coming months.
 
Board Member Named
WASHINGTON, March 26 (AP) -President Bush said today that he would nominate Philip C. Jackson Jr., an Alabama banker, to the oversight board of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Mr. Jackson is an adjunct professor at Birmingham Southern College in Birmingham, Ala. He is a former vice chairman of Central Bankshares of the South in Birmingham.

For Lithuania, Few Allies in Moscow

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Thursday, March 27

 BODY:
After two weeks of battling with Moscow over the sovereignty of their tiny republic, the Lithuanians may or may not be independent, but one thing is clear: they are on their own.
At a time when they desperately need well-placed allies in Moscow, the Lithuanians have little support in the Soviet capital for their claim of statehood.
Even opposition groups that advocate full democracy and Western-style economics, as does Lithuania, are divided on the crisis, worried that Lithuania's secession was precipitous and may strengthen the hand of hard-liners.
Members of the Soviet legislature said in interviews on Monday that Lithuania's support there was so thin that if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided to use force or impose a state of emergency - measures that few expected but no one ruled out entirely -Parliament would back him up. The interviews were conducted before Soviet troops stormed a Lithuanian psychiatric hospital to arrest army deserters. 
Politicians in Moscow said the Lithuanians themselves had alienated potential allies by their aloofness, their disregard for the fears of other ethnic groups, and their romantic, one-great-leap approach to independence.
 
Moscow's Shrewd Propaganda
But Moscow has compounded the republic's political isolation by the shrewd use of propaganda to raise doubts about whether the independence government is really democratic.
Lithuanians have also been largely disappointed in their hopes of support from the outside world - especially from countries like the United States, which never officially accepted Lithuania's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.
Western nations and countries newly liberated from the Soviet bloc have called on Moscow to open a dialogue with Lithuania. But because they have been doubtful of the new government's durability and solicitous of Mr. Gorbachev, they have all stopped short of formally recognizing free Lithuania.
''There are three textbook conditions for recognition: territory, people and control,'' a Scandinavian diplomat said today. ''The new Lithuanian government has the first two, but we cannot yet say that they have control.''
 
Georgians Rally in Support
The Lithuanians have heard muted promises of solidarity from independence campaigners in neighboring Estonia and Latvia, and Georgian separatists rallied in support of the new government in Lithuania on Saturday.
A few members of the Soviet Parliament, such as Yuri N. Afanasyev, a historian, and Yuri Y. Boldyrev, a Leningrad lawmaker, have called for recognition of the republic's proclamation of independence, made March 11.
But most legislators have been hostile or lukewarm to the Lithuanian declaration, including members of the opposition Interregional Deputies Group, which has often been allied with members of Parliament from the Baltic republics in campaigning for greater democracy and economic pluralism.
When the Congress of People's Deputies voted March 15 to declare Lithuania's secession invalid, only 94 of the 1,557 legislators voting dissented. In Parliament on Monday, a day before reports of the seizure of Lithuanian deserters, legislators generally applauded Mr. Gorbachev's handling of the situation, including his decrees tightening security and demanding the surrender of private firearms.
 
Many Disapprove of Tactics
Many who admire Lithuania's non-Communist government said they disapproved of the tactics of separation, accomplished by an act of Parliament rather than a referendum.
The idea of representative democracy is still a novelty in this country, and many Soviet deputies consider anything short of a direct plebiscite undemocratic, although the Lithuanian Parliament was freely elected and voted unanimously for independence.
Other critics say the Lithuanians lost support by not showing greater concern for the members of the Russian and Polish minorities in their republics, many of whom worry about their place in an independent Lithuania.
''The Lithuanian freedom-lovers do not want to give first priority to human rights,'' said Nikolai N. Engver, a legislator of Latvian descent who represents a region of central Russia. He said he had repeatedly queried Lithuanians about plans to make Russians learn Lithuanian or to limit their citizenship rights, and had been given no satisfactory answers.
 
Opposition Divided
The Lithuanian move has divided Soviet opposition groups like the Interregional Deputies Group. ''A lot of deputies in the Interregional Group support Lithuania, but we don't support the form they picked to attain their independence,'' said Anatoly A. Sobchak, a Leningrad lawyer active in the opposition faction.
''They are creating opportunities for conservative forces that would like to say that the disintegration of the country must be stopped, that force must be used,'' he said.
Moscow political insurgents who met over the weekend to organize a protest on the issue next Saturday found that they were not unanimous on framing the rally as an endorsement of Lithuanian independence. Instead, they have billed their protest as a condemnation of Kremlin pressure tactics.
''If we are not united on the policy of Sajudis,'' said Galina Y. Kovalskaya of Moscow Tribune, one of the groups sponsoring the rally, referring to the Lithuanaian pro-independence movement, ''we are at least united against force and pressure. We all agree that there must not be tanks in Lithuania under any circumstances.''
Several deputies said the Lithuanians hurt themselves by failing to practice the old art of legislative logrolling.
''People ask, 'Where were the Lithuanians when our issue was debated?' '' said an Armenian legislator who has championed self-determination for his own people.
The Soviet authorities have also weakened sympathy for Lithuania with propaganda portraying the new Lithuanian leaders as reckless and undemocratic.
Roy A. Medvedev, a leading historian, said many of his fellow members of Parliament were shocked by reports, widely circulated in the Soviet press, that the Lithuanian government was on the verge of enacting a law providing a three-year prison term for activities against the new state.
Lithuanians have said that they are drafting a law outlawing attempts to overthrow the government by force, but that it will not restrict speech or political activities.
Mr. Gryazin, the Estonian deputy, conceded that the Baltic cause was hurt by the lack of support in Moscow, but he said most deputies from that region never counted on it.
''Everything we've gained until today, you've seen it yourself, has come through a very strong battle,'' he said. LAST GRAF CAN BITE

HEADLINE: Suddenly, China Looks Smaller in the World

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 26

 BODY:
If maps were based not on the physical dimensions of nations but on perceptions of their importance, the world would have to be redrawn: China has shrunk dramatically by that standard over the last year.
The result is that China is less important a country now than it used to be, in the view of diplomats, scholars and business executives. In a range of interviews in recent months, they asserted that the changing perceptions have far-reaching implications for both diplomacy and business.
''No one cares about China any more,'' a European diplomat said recently. ''In Europe, it's impossible to get people's attention about China, after what happened here in June and afterward in Eastern Europe. When China says, 'We will not apologize and you must kowtow before us,' they say --.'' He made a rude noise and extended his arm in an obscene gesture. 
Whether or not such a view is warranted, it seems to be widespread. The Bush Administration has continued to court China, and so have some business executives, but the most common view is that China does not matter nearly as much as it used to.
 
Three Factors Cited
''There's no doubt that the pendulum has shifted,'' said Richard Feinberg, the executive vice president of the Overseas Development Council in Washington. Diplomats and scholars cited three principal reasons for the devaluation of China.
The first reason is the disillusionment with business prospects in China, particularly after the upheavals and the rise of the hard-liners last year. No longer is there a widespread faith that China is inexorably proceeding toward an open-market economy that will yield riches to foreign corporations.
Second, in the 1980's China captured the West's imagination as an example of ''cuddly Communism,'' and it was a star pupil of the World Bank and other international agencies. These days it is Eastern Europe that symbolizes the hope for change.
Third, the China card is less useful for the West because of the diminishing strategic threat posed by the Soviet Union. It is striking, for example, that no one is concerned about Prime Minister Li Peng's planned visit to the Soviet Union in late April.
''Their great concern is the evaporation of leverage,'' an American diplomat said of the Chinese leaders. ''What can you do when you can't play the Americans off the Russians? This has been a great game for years, and it's gone, temporarily.''
 
The Power Remains
These analysts do not regard China as unimportant; they simply assert that it is not so important as it used to be. Any nation that is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is powerful, particularly when it has a population of 1.1 billion.
But the fascination with China over the last decade was based on more than population and a nuclear ability. The open-door policy of the 1980's fostered a sense of awe for China that spilled out of the corridors of power and into the boardrooms. Major corporations often felt obliged to do business in China.
All that has changed. Western companies were already becoming disillusioned with China's bureaucracy, high costs and elusive profits when they were hit last year with both a deepening austerity program and the killings and repression in Beijing. Now many still say China has a great deal of potential, but they add that so do a lot of other countries.
''There used to be a missionary aspect to it, with the board of directors having a vision of an enormous consumer market - you know, two billion armpits in need of deodorant,'' said Mats Engstrom, chairman of California Sunshine Inc., a food company that does extensive business with China. ''But since Tiananmen Square, they've realized that it's a long-term prospect, and even then unless you're in the right area you're not going to succeed.''
 
Lending Rates Change
The change in attitudes can best be seen in lending rates. Just a few years ago, when China was blooming in its greatest glory, some Japanese banks were making loans to Beijing at no mark-up from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, a common benchmark. Now the ''spread'' has risen to about three-quarters of a percentage point above Libor.
China is also hurt by the growing international awareness of Taiwan's financial muscle. It is impossible to regard the tiny island of Taiwan as an international power, but it is difficult not to notice it when its foreign exchange reserves are five times as large as China's and its per capita income is more than 20 times as large.
Executives also note that while Taiwan's population of 20 million is less than 2 percent of China's, Taiwan's total foreign trade is about 6 percent more than the mainland's.
Taiwan's wealth has led to a series of embarrassing diplomatic defeats for the mainland, as one poor country after another responds to economic incentives and recognizes Taiwan as the government of China.

HEADLINE: The U.S. Needs a Domestic Marshall Plan First;
Don't Shift Assistance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The revolutionary turn of events in Eastern Europe, coupled with dramatic political changes in Central America, have led some in Congress and the Administration to advocate cuts in foreign aid levels to our main allies, such as Israel, Egypt and the Philippines, to provide aid to Eastern Europe and elsewhere (''Congress, Hoping to Aid New Democracies, Finds Itself Shackled by Budget,'' news article, March 8).
I strongly disagree with that approach. What the United States needs is a larger overall foreign assistance level, so that it does not unwisely undermine old friends while trying to help new ones.
It makes no sense to rob the Philippines to pay Poland. Given new political realities, it makes more sense to shift money from military spending to economic aid. In recent years, United States aid to our main allies, such as Israel and Egypt, has declined in real dollars, and I see no reason to squeeze them further.
For our nation's own economic health, the first priority of any peace dividend must be to reduce the Federal budget deficit. After that, our national security interests demand that we do not underestimate the strategic value of economic aid to needy nations in Eastern Europe. It would be counterproductive, however, simultaneously to weaken support for our historical allies.
President Bush's proposal to pay for new economic assistance for Nicaragua and Panama from fiscal year 1990 Defense Department funds is a step in the right direction. This can be a classic case of making swords into plowshares.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Details Additional Cuts In City Budget

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday announced details of the city's latest budget cuts for the current fiscal year, a $75 million reduction that he said would cut ''to the very marrow of city services.''
The cuts will mean, the Mayor said, that schools and hospitals will have to further trim spending on supplies, streets will be dirtier, a planned expansion of drug-treatment programs will be delayed until the start of the next fiscal year, and there will be further reductions in subsidies to libraries and cultural institutions.
The Sanitation Department Clean Team, a group that uses push brooms to sweep streets, will be reduced, from 505 employees to 282. The Mayor said the staff would ''be less than one-fourth the size it was just a few years ago.'' 
Acknowledging that ''none of these actions will be popular,'' Mr. Dinkins said at a news conference that the reductions ''are the regrettable but inevitable steps we must take to maintain this city's fiscal integrity.''
 
'That's Where the Money Is'
On Feb. 28, Mr. Dinkins announced that because of new shortfalls in tax revenues, city agencies would be asked by April 1 to make $75 million in budget cuts on top of other cuts and actions taken since last fall to close a gap of more than $1 billion for the fiscal year that ends on June 30.
Last week the Mayor said that New York City faced an additional budget gap of at least $700 million for the next fiscal year.
That is on top of the $1.1 billion gap expected when Mr. Dinkins announced his $27.8 billion preliminary budget for 1990-91 on Feb. 1.
Among the 1989-90 budget reductions announced yesterday were the Board of Education, $16.7 million; Health and Hospitals Corporation, 13.7 million; Social Services Department, $6.7 million; Housing Preservation and Development Department, $6.1 million; Police Department, $3.2 million, and Sanitation Department, $3.7 million. There was no new reduction for the Fire Department.
Asked why schools and hospitals were cut the most, the Mayor said both had very large budgets. ''That's where the money is,'' he said.
About half the Health and Hospitals Corporation's new cuts will be from unspent money. The rest will be from a $1 million reduction in overtime and a $6 million decrease in supplies and materials and contractual costs. The Board of Education, which has already reduced its budget by $50 million in the last several months, will have to cut further on computers, typewriters, science equipment and other supplies.
The cut for the Police Department will force a delay in hiring 81 civilians, but will not affect the scheduled hiring next month of 750 officers who will begin training at the Police Academy.
Mr. Dinkins said he would go to Albany today to ask the state ''for help that will permit us to help ourselves,'' including approval to enact new and higher taxes previously proposed.
''If there is a political risk,'' the Mayor said, referring to the taxes, ''I will bear it, for I know that there is a far greater risk in further service reductions.''
 
Advisers to Review Spending
Earlier in the day, Mr. Dinkins announced the appointment of a 17-member Council of Economic Advisers, drawn from business and city governnment, to help the city develop long-range economic policy.
He said that the group would annually review budget policies, including expenses, revenues and labor contracts, and that it would help the city try to obtain additional state and Federal aid for economic development. These are the members of the council:
 
Carol O'Cleireacain, Commissioner of Finance.
Joseph Flom, partner, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Earl G. Graves, president and chief executive, Earl G. Graves Ltd.
Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
Reginald Lewis, chairman and chief executive, the TLC Group.
Philip R. Michael, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
G. G. Michelson, senior vice president for external affairs, R. H. Macy & Company.

HEADLINE: FIRE IN THE BRONX;
Koch Bill Cracking Down On Clubs Died in Council

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A centerpiece of the Koch administration's promised crackdown on New York City social clubs - a bill to require owners of clubs closed for safety violations to post a large bond before re-opening - died in a City Council committee last year after members said it might penalize innocent landlords.
The measure would have provided for civil penalties of up to $1 million for safety violations that resulted in death or serious injury and would have forced clubs closed for safety violations to carry $1 million in liability insurance before reopening.
The bill's fate was part of a city initiative that has dwindled since it was announced with fanfare by Mayor Edward I. Koch in August 1988, after a fire at another Bronx social club killed six people. The effort also included an interagency task force to conduct inspections of clubs, which officials said yesterday had shrunk from a dozen four-member teams of building and fire inspectors and police officers to two teams before Sunday's fire. 
 
Cooperating 'With Relish'
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he would propose new legislation, probably with some of the same elements, to toughen penalties for clubs found to have violated fire and safety laws. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said that he would cooperate with the administration ''with relish'' and had scheduled a hearing for Thursday.
But last year, aides to Mr. Dinkins and to former Mayor Koch said, Councilman Jerry L. Crispino, who was then chairman of the Public Safety Committee and now head of the Land Use Committee, blocked the bill as too broad. Mr. Crispino acknowledged yesterday that he had believed the bill might hurt landlords, but he said it was not acted on because the Koch adminstration failed to resolve questions about it.
It is by no means clear that the proposed law could have prevented the fire at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx that killed 87 people on Sunday. In that case, the city had already posted an order that it be vacated. Officials said yesterday that inspectors had visited it several times and found it closed.
 
Happy Land Didn't Even Try
The proposed law would have required owners of clubs closed for violations to post a bond of $10,000 or $10 per square foot, whichever was higher, before they could re-open as legal establishments. Happy Land apparently re-opened without making any efforts to become legal.
But Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division of the city's Law Department, said another provision of the bill would have allowed the city to seek a court order to lock and seal for up to a year any club with a vacate order pending against it. Even then, he said, ''it would have depended on us going to court.''
Mr. Crispino introduced the bill in November 1988, at the request of Mr. Koch, and held one hearing on it the following January. Aides to Mr. Koch said Mr. Crispino had expressed reluctance to act on the bill, and at a meeting in April with Robert Esnard, then the deputy mayor heading the social club task force, had said he would oppose it.
Yesterday, Mr. Crispino denied meeting with Koch aides on the bill. ''I never had a formal meeting with anybody in the administration on this legislation,'' he said.
 
Might Hurt Fishermen
Mr. Crispino, who as a lawyer has handled real estate transactions, said he worried that the bill could have been used against owners of small businesses or legitimate ''hunting or fishing clubs.'' Asked whether he thought it likely that such clubs would be the subject of vacate orders, which are issued for serious fire and safety violations, he said, ''They could possibly.''
Mr. Vallone said yesterday that the bill applied to ''everybody.''
But it applied only to places used for eating, drinking, dancing or entertainment, and its preamble said the Council intended the maximum penalties to apply only ''in the case of the most egregious and flagrant violations.''
Mr. Esnard said yesterday that the bill was to be an economic weapon. ''The people running these social clubs were not running church socials,'' he said. ''You had to take that economic benefit away.''
 
Little Pressure for Passage
Of the Council, Mr. Esnard said: ''They said they weren't going to pass it. They knew that I would have negotiated. They didn't want to negotiate. If they had wanted to do it, it would have gotten done.''
On the other hand, Mr. Koch acknowledged in an interview yesterday that he did not recall personally pressing Mr. Vallone or Mr. Crispino to get the bill passed.
Mr. Vallone said he believed the Council should consider legislation to cut off utility services to clubs operating with safety violations, and that he would not be opposed to a bill that required the posting of a bond, as long as it was narrowly drafted.
As for the inspection effort that Mr. Koch began, which made more than 2,000 inspections in 1989 and more than 300 so far this year, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said they had dwindled because, ''I think there was a slackening of effort.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo May Be Blamed, But Ratings Aren't Votes

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26

 BODY:
Republican leaders predicted today that they will be able to pin the downgrading of the state's credit rating on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo like a badge of fiscal dishonor. But Democratic officials and political consultants, both in New York and in Washington, said that credit ratings are too abstruse a subject to make for potent political symbolism.
Wall Street's two major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, both dropped New York's credit rating on short-term bonds today. Standard & Poor's took the unexpected step of lowering the rating on New York's long-term credit by two notches, from AA- to A, and said the state's budget impasse contributed to its decision. 
A lower rating translates into higher interest payments on the millions of dollars worth of bonds sold by the state each year.
''The Governor has been the chief executive of this state for the last seven and a half years so I think a lot of it rubs off on him,'' said J. Patrick Barrett, the state Republican Party chairman, who has been seeking a challenger to Mr. Cuomo for this year's gubernatorial race. ''It happened on his watch.''
 
Should Get Out of Albany
Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a former Republican Congressman, said he does not think a credit-rating drop alone could cost Mr. Cuomo an election. But he said the image of a Governor who has prided himself on his fiscal management would be tarnished.
''He's got to take draconian measures so I think you'll see his popularity drop,'' he said.
Mr. Molinari suggested that if Mr. Cuomo has serious ambitions to run for President in 1992, he should consider leaving office this year rather than facing the fiscal demons that may haunt Albany for the next few.
The strong step taken by Standard & Poor's suggested that the rating agency had passed judgment on the state's fiscal condition even before the Governor and the Legislature settled on a way to close a projected $1.5 billion deficit in the 1990-91 budget. But Democratic officials said voters will judge Mr. Cuomo more on his ability to handle the fiscal crisis.
 
'Not In My Tax Bill'
''The average person is going to make a decision on how it affects him or her or the person around him rather than what rating agencies say,'' said John A. Marino, the state Democratic Party chairman.
Joseph F. Crangle, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a former chairman of the Erie County Democratic Committee, added: ''The average guy on the street doesn't understand it. It doesn't show up in his tax bill.''
Mr. Crangle also said Mr. Cuomo may find a silver lining in today's announcements because the news may pressure the Republicans who control the state Senate to adopt some of Mr. Cuomo's measures for closing the budget gap.
The Governor has proposed closing most of the deficit with new taxes and ''one-shot'' revenue measures, but Senate leaders have refused to consider many of his initiatives.
 
No Candidate in Offing
Any talk of political damage to Mr. Cuomo on the state level may be abstract since Mr. Barrett has been unable to find a gubernatorial opponent.
And some national political analysts said they doubted Mr. Cuomo's Presidential chances would be hurt unless he fails to cure the state's problems. New York is not Massachusetts, where a plummeting credit rating came to symbolize the decline of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, because Mr. Cuomo has not staked his political future solely on his fiscal prowess.
''Dukakis's problem was that he ran a Presidential campaign on the 'Massachusetts Miracle' and it turned out to be the 'Massachusetts Mirage,' '' said Alvin From, executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council. ''When you run as an economic genius and the bottom falls out, then you've got troubles.''

HEADLINE: Dire Regan Predictions Finally Gaining Respect

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan's dire warnings about New York State's finances, an annual rite in Albany, took on new urgency yesterday with the reduction of the state's credit rating.
Even before the drop in the rating, which will force the state to pay millions of dollars more in interest, Mr. Regan had been sounding his fiscal siren more loudly than usual.
He had threatened to refuse to certify the state budget for the new fiscal year, a move that would further alarm the financial community. Such certification is required for the state to borrow money. 
Mr. Regan, a Republican who rarely tangles with the Democratic Governor, has said he will not certify the budget unless it is ''demonstratively conservatively balanced'' - meaning it has conservative estimates of revenues and expenditures, requires no raids on the state pension funds and calls for tax increases only if they are accompanied by substantial spending reductions.
 
Budgetary Brinksmanship
The threat has opened a game of budgetary brinksmanship.
Many legislators and aides to Governor Cuomo said they expected Mr. Regan to back down in the final budget talks this weekend. The new fiscal year begins on Sunday.
But Mr. Regan said last week, ''Let's see who blinks first.''
Still, his aides concede that Mr. Regan, who faces a potentially difficult re-election campaign this year, is trying to walk a fine line between stopping state practices he considers profligate and alarming the financial community so much that it shuts down all credit -a budget disaster. If credit is cut off, the Governor might be able to blame him for all the state's problems.
''That what this game of chicken is all about,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group, ''If that happens, that's Armageddon.'' He said a credit shutdown would have ''an instant spillover to the city'' because the state pays much of the city budget.
 
Why He Certified Last Two
In calmer times, state officials often ignored Mr. Regan's audits and warnings. This year is different.
''I think he's perfectly serious and he's very justified,'' said Manfred Ohrenstein, the State Senate minority leader. ''We've run a deficit for two years.'' He also said Mr. Regan ''joined in the consensus'' by certifying the budgets.
Asked why Mr. Regan had certified the last two, his spokesman, Marvin Nailor, said the budgets ''became imbalanced after they were enacted because of the erosion of revenues.''
Mr. Regan said the state's budget problem ''is the worst crisis we've ever had, worse than the mid-70's'' when the State Urban Development Corporation threatened default on its bonds, shocking New York and other cities.
This year, the state faces at least $1.5 billion in deficits not only for the new fiscal year but for the current year. Republicans, like State Senator Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan, contend that the budget has been in the red in seven of the last nine years, with a cumulative deficit of at least $5 billion, despite a state constitutional requirement that the budget be balanced.
 
May Face Carol Bellamy
Mr. Regan, 59, is seeking a fourth term this year and his aides anticipate a strong challenge, possibly from Carol Bellamy, the former City Council President.
This time he could be hobbled by criticism of his campaign financing by the State Government Integrity Commission and an investigation of it by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
He has also angered other Republicans by privately blaming State Senate Republicans as well as the Governor for the state's problems and by saying Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican Governor, was a bigger spender than Mr. Cuomo.
He has also argued that New York City, with its serious fiscal problems, ''is in better shape than New York State,'' largely because of restraints imposed on it by the State Financial Control Board.
Republicans hope to portray Mr. Cuomo as a liberal big spender and taxer in the gubernatorial campaign, adopting the image hung on a neighboring Democratic Governor, Michael Dukakis of Massachusettts, in the 1988 Presidential campaign.
 
Pork Barrel Campuses
In the meantime, Mr. Regan has been talking tough - even before yesterday's fiscal blow.
''You borrow and you pay back with one-shot revenues, that's what New York State has been doing for the last two and a half years,'' Mr. Regan said. ''The state has historically spent two and three times the rate of inflation, to the point that it has run out of all of its options.''
Tackling a sensitive subject, he described the State University system as ''pork barrel - a campus for every assembly district.'' There are 84 campuses in 51 cities.
He said he would not allow Governor Cuomo to raid the state pension system. ''He's not getting the money,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Lower Betting Tax Could Help New York

 BODY:
Last Friday morning at a hearing room in downtown Manhattan, the chairmen of two New York State Assembly committees demanded to know why the operators of Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga did not have more money in the kitty at the end of last year.
It was as if a whale had drained a swimming pool in one gulp and then asked its owners where all the water went.
To say this is no slap at Ivan Lafayette, the Queens Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Standing Committee on Racing and Wagering, or Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who chairs the Standing Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation. Unlike most of their colleagues, these legislators have taken an active interest in New York racing, and that alone is cause to hope for improvement. 
But the biggest problem with racing in New York State is New York State.
Officials of the New York Racing Association, which operates the state's three major tracks, defended their finances Friday by taking the offensive. While much of their presentation was self-serving, the facts they presented were indisputable:
The 5.3 percent tax extracted by New York State from the parimutuel handle is badly out of line with other racing states. The state's share is only 1.9 percent in Pennsylvania, 0.9 percent in Maryland and 0.7 percent in New Jersey.
Nationwide, New York attracts 26.6 percent of all parimutuel betting, but pays 40.2 percent of all parimutuel taxes.
Over the last decade, New York on-track betting has declined 6.5 percent despite inflation, while operating expenses have increased by 20 percent. rrIs it any wonder that the N.Y.R.A., after handing over more than $42 million to the state last year, had nothing left over?
Despite the frequent characterization of New York racing as an industry in crisis, and the pining of old-timers for the good old days that never were, overall business has never been better. Purses are climbing steadily, and were nearly 50 percent higher at Aqueduct this winter than they were amid better weather, more soothing surroundings and classier horses at Gulfstream near Miami.
Betting is booming as well. The handle on Saturday's nine races at Aqueduct was $9.96 million. The same day, 11 Gulfstream races drew $2.61 million in bets.
The problem is that only $4.1 million of that $9.96 million in New York was bet at Aqueduct, with the rest being wagered at Offtrack Betting and simulcast outlets. The N.Y.R.A. retains 9.3 cents of every dollar wagered on track for its operations, but only 1.9 to 2.5 cents of every dollar wagered at OTB. In 1981, 47 percent of the statewide handle was bet at the track. Last year, only 37 percent was.
OTB hurts rather than helps New York racing because of its inane structure. A generation ago, misguided N.Y.R.A. executives turned down the chance to operate OTB as an arm of the tracks, and the sport has paid for it ever since.
Legislators created six redundant regional OTB corporations whose primary function has been to drain money from the sport in order to support a bureaucracy. New York OTB has become a nationwide laughing stock and model of what not to do. Every other state has linked OTB with the tracks. rrThe N.Y.R.A. argues that it supplies a product, and that OTB should be the marketing arm for that product rather than a competitor. At the same time, the N.Y.R.A. has got to do a much better job of marketing its own product.
While many of the N.Y.R.A.'s problems stem from lack of funds, it has failed in a more basic way. With the exception of the 24-day Saratoga phenomenon, the N.Y.R.A. has not made going to the races a sufficiently attractive proposition to stem the departure of patrons to OTB shops or other forms of amusement. A new paint job every few years and new flavors of fast food are not enough. The game needs truly new ideas and promotions to attract new players.
It also needs relief to keep the old ones. The parimutuel takeout of 17 to 25 percent, coupled with punitive Federal and state withholding taxes on bettors' gross proceeds rather than their net profits, have made winning more difficult and losing more expensive than ever.
Every experiment and study in reducing takeout and taxes has shown that business will increase in the long run. Legislators, however, are always unwilling to sacrifice any short-term revenue.
The same is true with reducing the state's piece of the action. The resurgence of Maryland racing was due in part to the late Frank DeFrancis's superior management, but he never would have had the chance had the state not reduced its cut to 0.9 percent of the handle. That freed up operating money so that he could improve the facilities, install attractive high-tech handicapping aids and make Laurel and Pimlico places where people wanted to spend an afternoon.
The N.Y.R.A. could be doing a better job with its current resources, and it probably does deserve closer outside scrutiny than it has gotten in the past. Its shortcomings, though, pale next to the state's taxation rate and the current structure of OTB. The legislators only need to turn the mirror on themselves to find the game's most serious problems, and the solution to them.

HEADLINE: Patient's Marrow Emerges as Key Cancer Tool

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
DOCTORS have long suspected that colossal doses of chemotherapy and radiation could triumph over a number of otherwise fatal cancers. The only hitch was that doses large enough to overcome the tumor frequently killed the patient as well, generally by destroying the bone marrow, the body's crucial factory for making cells for the blood and immune system.
Now cancer specialists are sidestepping that problem using a dangerous but ingenious technique: they remove and treat some of the patient's own marrow, give the patient previously unthinkable doses of chemotherapy and radiation and then return the purged marrow to the patient, where it gradually resumes its vital function.
Although such autologous bone marrow transplants were first used experimentally over a decade ago as heroic treatments for hopeless cases, researchers have only recently accumulated enough data to prove definitively that they work. Some of the initial patients have long outlived the time they were expected to survive with their fatal diseases. And, although the risk of dying in the procedure is still 5 to 15 percent, autologous transplants have taken off. 
Further, experts say the recent isolation and production of several naturally occurring molecules called growth factors, which dramatically hasten the recovery of a transplanted marrow, promise to make the procedure safer and cheaper.
''These transplants have moved from the world of evangelical religion to the world of science,'' said Dr. Peter H. Wiernik, the chairman of the Department of Oncology at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''We are just now at the point where we can look people in the eye and say this is the treatment for your disease.''
Based on these impressive results, autologous transplant has become the treatment of choice for certain tumors of the immune system, or lymphomas, and a few tumors of the blood, or leukemias, with cure rates of over 50 percent. Researchers hope the technique might eventually help save many patients with widespread breast cancer, ovarian cancer and melanoma as well.
''We are about to see an exponential rise in the number of autologous transplants,'' said Dr. Richard O'Reilly, the head of the bone marrow transplant program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ''Particularly as we find new diseases that respond to the technique.'' An estimated 2,000 autologous transplants were performed in 1989, about double the number two years before.
Since autologous transplants require over a month in the hospital and cost over $75,000, insurers and health care economists look to this boom with some apprehension. Because most uses of the treatment are still in the experimental stage, insurance companies may refuse to pay. And while the procedure is not technically demanding, few hospitals can accommodate more than a handful of marrow transplant patients at one time.
Also, experts caution that for patients the month without functioning bone marrow, called the nadir period, is a harrowing, painful ordeal with almost daily bouts of fevers from infection and sometimes bleeding. These ensue because the bone marrow, about a quart of which is usually taken from the patient, makes red cells to carry oxygen, white cells to fight disease and platelets to promote clotting.
Heart, lung and kidney tests before a transplant disqualify many patients as not healthy enough to survive the ordeal.
''It was the worst experience of a lifetime,'' said Donna Rossi, 37 years old, of New Jersey, who had an experimental autologous transplant in 1983 for lymphoma, then generally considered incurable. ''During the transplant you're at such a low point that you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I gave up a year of my life, because nothing else held out hope of a cure.''
 
Not a Traditional Transplant
The new procedures are different than true transplants when a patient's diseased marrow is destroyed and then replaced with marrow from a donor who must be genetically matched to prevent rejection of the foreign tissue. These transplants were initially developed to treat patients with inherently defective marrows, although they have since been use successfully on cancer patients as well.
Only 30 to 40 percent of patients waiting for conventional transplants find compatible donors. The procedure is generally considered too risky for patients older than 30 because of a devastating reaction in which the immune cells of the donated marrow attack the host and which becomes more deadly with age. But autologous transplants are performed on people into the 60's.
When the autologous method is used to treat patients whose cancers, like leukemia, involve the marrow, before the marrow is reinfused it must be cleansed in a laboratory.
Since the autologous transplants theoretically can be applied to any tumor for which more chemotherapy is considered better, ''the question everyone is asking is: who can benefit?'' said Dr. Jerome Ritz, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University's Dana-Farber Cancer Center. Patients with advanced metastatic breast and ovarian cancer have already shown dramatic responses.
''The next bastion for autologous transplants is breast cancer,'' said Dr. Hillard Lazarus, director of the bone marrow transplant program at Case Western Reserve University's Ireland Cancer Center. ''The technique is still investigational, but the results are pretty compelling.'' Although metastatic breast cancer is generally first treated with surgery and chemotherapy, over 50 percent of women will relapse and the recurrent disease is uniformly fatal.
In one study of women with breast cancer that had spread to the bones or lungs, as well as the bone marrow, 60 percent showed no sign of disease after an autologous transplant and a fraction have already survived more than five years. In another of study of 14 women with relapsed ovarian cancer, more than a third were alive and free of disease more than three years after the transplant.
Buoyed by these successes, a number of research teams are now studying the use of autologous transplants to treat some early cancers that are likely to be incurable with traditional therapy.
 
Use for Earlier Cancers
''There is now lots of data to indicate that the earlier and more aggressively you treat these tumors, the better the chance for cure,'' said Dr. C. Dean Buckner, director of the autologous bone marrow transplant program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center of the University of Washington in Seattle.
Although the basic autologous transplant is now fairly standardized, scientists are experimenting with modifications which promise to improve the technique.
At the University of Nebraska, Dr. James Armitage and his colleagues are stockpiling bone marrow cells collected from patients' bloodstreams and using it in autologous transplants. Scientists have long known that a small number of bone marrow, or progenitor, cells circulate, but the technology to filter out the vagrants has been developed only in the last few years, Dr. Armitage said. Scientists say these so-called peripheral progenitors mature more quickly into functioning red and white blood cells than cells harvested from within bone, leading to faster recovery after the transplant.
 
Growth Factors Hold Promise
But the biggest boon to the transplant world seems most likely to come from a class of naturally occurring molecules, called growth factors, which were isolated in the mid-1980's and can now be produced in large quantities using recombinant DNA technology. ''Growth factors have been the major advance in the last couple of years,'' said Dr. Buckner.
The compounds, more than a dozen of which have been identified, speed the development of the undifferentiated marrow cells into working red cells, whites cells and platelets. A growth factor for red cells, called erythropoietin, and several for white cells, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, are currently available for investigational use.
Several centers around the country are now giving patients white cell growth factors at the time of transplant in the hopes of speeding the return of immune function. Patients whose blood contains low levels of white cells are vulnerable to life threatening infections.
Transplant patients generally spend three weeks in isolation with perilously low counts. They usually fall ill with infections anyway, stricken by the bacteria that inhabit their own skins and intestines.
When transplant patients have been treated with growth factors in clinical trials, their marrows have rebounded more quickly and effectively. White cell growth factors proved capable of shortening the nadir period to about 10 days, reducing the number of infections by half and hastening discharges by two weeks or more.
Experts say they hope to utilize combinations of growth factors and the quickly developing peripheral blood progenitor cells to further shorten the nadir period and, maybe, to eradicate it altogether.
In a field ringing with scientific optimism, the most troubling issues involve money and logistics. Most insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare, will now pay for the procedure for lymphomas and some leukemias. But what if transplant proves the treatment of choice for all women with newly diagnosed metastatic breast or ovarian cancer, for example? Tens of thousands of women fall into these categories each year. The largest transplant center in the United States, the Hutchinson Center at the University of Washington, performs 400 transplants annually; only 4 or 5 of those can be covered by grant funds. ''Who will pay?'' said Dr. Buckner. ''Who will fill the gap?''
Experts say that if growth factors prove successful they may ameliorate the problem. ''If you can keep people out of the hospital and decrease the number of infections and transfusions, that will lower costs,'' said Dr. Lazarus. ''Hospital charges run $1,000 a day and $5,000 a day in the intensive care unit.
If growth factors reduce the costs, some of the savings will be spent on the growth factors themselves, but even so, studies indicate that for properly selected patients the big investment is cost effective in the long run, especially for patients treated early in their disease, said Dr. Buckner. ''If you transplant a patient early and cure his disease, it's much cheaper than multiple hospital admissions and 10 rounds of chemotherapy spread over years,'' he said. ''You may also save his life.''
 
BEFORE HOSPITALIZATION
Storing the marrow
Some bone marrow is harvested from the breast bone and pelvis through hollow needles, treated if necessary, and refrigerated. Then the patient is hospitalized for the cancer treatment.
 
TREATMENT
High-dose radiation and chemotherapy
During treatment, marrow dies. The patient loses red blood cells, which carry oxygen; white cells, which fight infection, and platelets needed for clotting. Even with isolation and frequent transfusions, side effects are severe.
 
REPLACEMENT
Replenishing marrow
Re-injected into the bloodstream, marrow migrates to the bone and starts making cells again. Growth factor infusions may shorten the time needed to resume production of white blood cells. In clinical trials, injecting marrow progenitor cells filtered from the patient's blood makes the recovery period even shorter.

HEADLINE: Coral Reefs Off 20 Countries Face Assaults From Man and Nature

 BODY:
CORAL reefs off the coasts of more than 20 countries are suffering from increasingly severe human and natural assaults, new research shows.
Overfishing, coral harvesting and vessel groundings, widespread pollution caused by chemicals, sewage and deforestation, and such natural phenonomena as sharp swings in water temperature have threatened the corals, scientists say.
The problem affects the coasts of Australia, China, Japan, Panama, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, India, Indonesia and Kenya, as well as the Red Sea and many reefs in the Caribbean and the Atlantic.
Off the Florida coast, more than 100 square miles of the only barrier reef in North America are being threatened by toxic pollutants and vessel groundings. In the last few months, groundings in the Florida Keys have caused $20 million in damage and pulverized thousands of square feet of coral, according to the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington. In many cases, the damage has been irreparable. 
In the South China Sea, widespread coral harvesting for aquariums has wiped out all but 20 of 110 coral species recorded in 1960, according to a United Nations report, ''Human Induced Damage to Coral Reefs.'' In Indonesia, blasting of coral and fishing with traps has damaged corals. In Bali and the Maldives, coral mining, spear-fishing, dredging and pollution are killing corals.
''Virtually every reef system in the world is suffering,'' said John Ogden, director of the Florida Institute of Oceanography, a consortium of nine Florida universities studying the problem. ''We have reached the point where coral reefs are being turned into wastelands.''
 
Tiny Tentacled Animals
The tropical reefs are the handiwork of minute, tentacled coral animals. They range in size from a half an inch to eight inches and live in large, tightly knit colonies, attached permanently to the limestone skeleton that the colony builds as it grows.
For reef-reliant economies, the continued loss of corals could be devastating. Living coral reefs form the basis of a delicate ecosystem that shelters thousands of marine organisms, including fish, crabs and other seafood. Their loss would be most severely felt in underdeveloped nations because coral reefs are a crucial source of food and provide jobs for thousands of fishermen.
Brian Lapointe of the Florida Keys Land and Sea Trust estimated that 30 percent of all coral cover in the Keys has been lost since 1970.
In one study, James W. Porter, a zoologist at the University of Georgia, and fellow researchers have documented the disappearance of 8 percent of corals on several large reefs in only a two-year period. Dr. Porter, who used time-lapse photography in the study, said he was worried that the loss would continue. ''We saw a significant loss of coral,'' he said. ''But the exact cause seem to be elusive.''
''It's a very complicated problem which has many causes,'' said Jeremy B. C. Jackson, chief scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. ''Some would like to say it's because of human activity, but there's also a natural component.''
 
Nature Joins in Conspiracy
Hurricanes, radical swings in water temperature and El Ninos, the warm ocean currents that periodically cause climate disturbances, are among the natural causes.
On many reefs the shortage of fish as a result of overharvesting and the loss of coral-protecting sea urchins has stripped away two major natural protections of corals. In many places the urchins have been replaced by a venomous, coral-eating starfish known as the Crown of Thorns.
The Crown of Thorns is abundant in a dozen countries, including Japan, where teams of divers working together are injecting them with lethal poison and putting up underwater fences to halt their migration.
Since 1987, Caribbean corals have suffered from widespread bleaching, a blight that impairs or kills corals. Scientists blame rising water temperatures, which sensitive corals cannot withstand. The bleaching occurs when the algae that coral organisms depend on die. Because the algae give corals their coloration, their death causes the reef to turn ghostly pale.
 
Oil Spills and Chemicals
Scientists say that the human impact on reefs, such as freighter groundings, oil spills and chemical pollution are now the main threat to coral survival.
In an ecological study on spills in tropical waters, Dr. Jackson reported last year that such damage to coral is not only immediate and severe but can leave them susceptible to disease and blight for years.
Scientists say reef-killing algae can proliferate as a result of human pollution. This occurs when groundwater and streams carry nutrients from treated sewage and agricultural chemicals from crops and golf courses into the ocean. The nutrients travel miles offshore to pristine reefs where they fertilize the algae. The algae outcompete corals for living space, effectively killing them.
But scientists say the most long-term damage occurs when stands of coral are leveled by freighters or knocked down by objects like boat anchors. They say the branching elkhorn coral, which take 400 years to grow and are the most common of 1,000 coral species, can take up to 50 years to grow back.
 
Concern in Congress
Some Federal lawmakers have voiced concern about what is happening. Last fall Congress ordered the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study three Florida sites for inclusion in the National Marine Sanctuary Program.
Then within three weeks, four major vessel groundings in the Keys flattened thousands of square feet of coral and prompted further Congressional action. Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida, introduced a bill to create a Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary that would extend 122 miles from the coast of Key Largo to the Dry Tortugas near Key West out to the 300-foot depth. If passed, the law would give teeth to current enforcement, allotting additional Federal funds for more enforcement agents and mooring buoys.
A Senate bill introduced on March 7 by Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, would make most marine sanctuaries off-limits to freighter traffic. The Coast Guard, meanwhile, has been holding hearings on a proposal to ask the International Maritime Organization to create ''areas to be avoided'' by international freighters off the Florida coast.
In less developed countries, corals have suffered decades of abuse directly related to slash-and-burn deforestation, which consumes thousands of acres of trees each year. Heavy nutrient runoff from clear-cutting has led to sediment-filled waters, which spur algae growth and choke corals. ''The Caribbean reefs seem to be in an advance state of decline,'' Mr. Lapointe said.
 
Aiding Third World Countries
In an effort to halt the decline of coral reefs in the third world, the Bush Administration has drafted guidelines for the United States representative to the World Bank to follow in considering the financing of projects that might adversely affect rain forests and coral reefs.
Scientists are urging that Federal and state governments continue to reorganize their environmental priorities toward coastal resources, imposing tougher penalties on freighters that run aground, imposing bans on some agricultural chemicals and installing mooring buoys along reefs.
They warn that unless further steps are taken, corals could become endangered within decades. ''We still don't know if we're dealing with long-term variations,'' said Mr. Ogden of the oceanography institute. ''There are natural cycles we know little about.''

HEADLINE: Multi-Use Credit Card Is Offered by A.T.&T.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday introduced a combination telephone-calling card and general-purpose credit card affiliated with Visa and Mastercard International.
In doing so, A.T.& T. decided not to issue a card on its own, as did Sears, Roebuck & Company when it introduced the Discover card in 1986. Although the Discover card has posted small profits in the last two years, it has not yet reached the targets set for it by Sears.
The new cards bear A.T.& T.'s name and corporate logotype but will be issued by the Universal Bank of Columbus, Ga., and will be called the A.T.& T. Universal card. The card is a so-called affinity card, which carries the name of a company or organization that helps promote its use in return for a share of the profits earned by the issuing bank. The banks say such cards offer new marketing niches in an industry that is quite profitable, but which analysts say is approaching the saturation point. 
Banks already issue similar cards on behalf of many airlines, university alumni associations, professional athletic teams, charitable groups and other organizations.
A.T.& T. officials said the company was sponsoring the card to strengthen its position in the long-distance telephone market and to meet a perceived desire among consumers to carry fewer credit cards. The U S Sprint Communications Company, a rival of A.T.& T.'s in the long-distance market, started offering a combination calling card and Visa credit card last November. Another rival, the MCI Communications Corporation, reached agreements in the last few months with a dozen banks to allow the billing of long-distance MCI calls to Visa accounts at these banks.
A.T.& T. attached a variety of services to the new card to make it competitive with so-called gold credit cards.
Those who apply for the card this year will pay no annual fee if they use the card for at least one purchase a year.
Customers who charge telephone calls to the A.T.& T. Universal card will receive a 10 percent discount off regular calling-card rates.
Charges for long-distance calls will appear on the same bill as regular purchases, but must be paid in full each month.
The card includes free collision-damage insurance coverage on rental cars paid for with the card and a free extension of the manufacturer's warranty on products purchased with the card.
 
Adjustable Interest Rate
The card's intitial annual interest rate will be 18.9 percent, which was higher than most analysts had expected. The interest rate is equal to the prime rate plus 8.9 percentage points, and will be adjusted automatically every three months.
Most of the 70 million American households that have A.T.& T. long-distance service will be offered the card, said Paul Kahn, the president of A.T.& T.'s new credit card division. The first applications have already been sent out, he said.
A three-year research program by A.T.& T. found that consumers were abandoning single-purpose oil company and department store cards in favor of general purpose cards, and this also gave A.T.& T. an incentive to replace some of its 40 million calling cards, Mr. Kahn said. ''More and more people don't want their wallets bulging with cards,'' he said.
A.T.& T. intends for the Universal card to replace existing Visa and Mastercard credit cards issued by other banks, Mr. Kahn said.
 
Partners in Venture
A.T.& T.'s partners for the new card are the Synovus Financial Corporation, the Columbus, Ga., holding company that recently set up the Universal Bank to handle the new card, and Total Systems Services Inc., a large credit-card processing services company that will keep track of billing for the Universal card.
A.T.& T. will share in the revenues from the Universal card. Mr. Kahn and James H. Blanchard, the chairman of Synovus, declined to discuss the details on the arrangement.
In addition, A.T.& T. received the right to buy an 8.6 percent stake in Total Systems. Synovus owns 82 percent of Total Systems.
A.T.& T. had considered creating its own card, but its market research found that customers wanted a card that was already widely accepted, Mr. Kahn said. Visa and Mastercard are accepted at seven million locations worldwide.
The Universal card's high interest rate reflects a belief among A.T.& T. officials that the company's well-known name and other features offered would attract enough customers to make a lower rate unnecessary, said Gregory R. Sawers, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York.
He estimated that the card would cost A.T.& T. from $100 million to $150 million for the next two or three years, and that the new card would attract five million customers in each of its first two years.
Depending on creditworthiness, customers will be offered a regular or gold Universal card affiliated with Visa or a regular Universal card affiliated with Mastercard.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Faces Test at Mazda Plant

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLAT ROCK, Mich.

 BODY:
The auto industry is closely watching a dispute between the Mazda Motor Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union over the use of temporary employees.
When Mazda came to this community just south of Detroit to build cars three years ago, it agreed to recognize the U.A.W. and promised not to lay off regular hourly workers except as a last resort. And the Japanese car maker has so far kept its promise despite the weak auto market, which has forced production slowdowns at the plant.
But there's a catch. Local U.A.W. officials complain that Mazda has been able to stand by its no-layoff pledge by jettisoning scores of temporary assembly-line employees, who work side by side with regular hourly workers and pay union dues but lack the job security. 
Although they are paid the same hourly wage as regular workers, the temporaries at Mazda have a limited health-care and disability package, no access to unemployment benefits financed by the company and the union, and no guarantee that they will be hired back first when production picks up again - provisions enjoyed by regular workers in the industry.
While the union agreed to accept some temporary workers at the plant here in a three-year contract signed in 1988, it is now putting pressure on the company to cut back on the hiring of such employees, which is common in Japan. Union officials accuse the company of using temporary workers in far greater numbers and for longer periods than the contract stipulates, which company officials deny.
Other auto companies are watching to see whether Mazda can keep the union at bay. Executives for the Big Three view Mazda's use of temporaries as a competitive edge, enabling the Japanese car maker to keep its costs lower and lay off workers with impunity.
With job security likely to become the central issue in national bargaining talks scheduled before contracts expire in September, analysts say the American auto companies may seek to exploit the situation at Mazda, by pressing for expanded use of temporary workers in their own plants.
''Anything that gives a cost advantage to a competitor needs to be examined in contract negotiations,'' said a labor relations executive at one of the American car makers.
The cutbacks in Mazda's temporary work force also foreshadow a major problem facing the U.A.W. in the coming contract negotiations, said Harry Katz, professor of labor and industrial relations at Cornell University.
''The U.A.W. would like to have it both ways: employment security and no temporaries,'' Mr. Katz said. ''But that is not the way the world works. The union must live with the consequences if they demand tighter job security.''
The consequences of such demands will be a separation of auto workers into two groups, Mr. Katz predicted, one with guaranteed jobs and the other with no employment guarantees and leaner benefits.
 
A Violation of Principles
Allowing two classes of workers goes against longstanding U.A.W. principles aimed at creating union solidarity and protecting jobs. When the General Motors Corporation sought a two-tier wage structure at its components plants in 1987, the union was bitterly opposed.
''It creates a lot of political problems within the union to make these explicit distinctions,'' he said. ''A burning question for the U.A.W. is how far it should head down this road.''
Solving its problem with Mazda would help the U.A.W. prove it can find common ground with the Japanese auto makers. So far, the union has been able to organize only those Japanese plants engaged in partnerships with unionized domestic auto makers, like Mazda's Flat Rock plant, which makes Probes for the Ford Motor Company, and New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the joint venture of the Toyota Motor Corporation and General Motors. The union has not had success in organizing the Honda Motor Company plant in Marysville, Ohio, or the Nissan Motor Corporation plant in Smyrna, Tenn.
 
Abuse of Provision Seen
While the U.A.W. did agree in its contract to allow temporary workers to fill assembly-line jobs, local union officials say the company has abused the provision.
''When the original contract was negotiated, the assumption was that these would be primarily people to fill in as casual replacements, when people got sick or were on vacation, not that they would be used by the hundreds for six, eight or twelve months,'' said Phillip Keeling, president of U.A.W. Local 3000.
Although the temporary workers are dues-paying union members, officials at the U.A.W. local said they were unable to provide firm figures on the number in the plant before and after the production slowdown. One union official estimated that the number had fallen to fewer than 100 from a peak of 400; the plant has 2,900 regular hourly workers. None of the temporary workers remaining on the job perform assembly-line tasks, the offical said.
The union leaders say the second-class status of Mazda's temporary employees represents the dark side of Japanese employment practices, exported to Flat Rock along with a workplace philosophy of teamwork and mutual sacrifice in hard times.
 
'Throwaway People'
''It don't give us much of a life, working on the edge as a temporary employee,'' said a 24-year-old worker who was afraid that using his name would hurt his chances of being hired as a regular. ''They think of us as throwaway people.''
Mazda officials say they have abided by the contract, which allows temporary workers to fill in for absent regular employees. Masahiro Uchida, president of the Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corporation, said the company uses temporary workers ''to keep our regular hourly employees in the plant, to avoid laying them off.'' He added, ''In our discussions with the union, we never said we would use a certain number of temporary workers.''
Some local union officials at the Mazda plant criticize the international union for negotiating away the job security of temporary workers in their eagerness to plant the U.A.W. flag in a Japanese plant.
The Big Three have for several years used small numbers of temporary hourly employees with the union's blessing on Mondays and Fridays, when assembly-line absenteeism is high. Mazda insisted on the same provision.
The U.A.W. has tried to contain the practice at Mazda by pushing it to hire more temporary workers as regular employees.
 
'They Lay You Off'
But the company is dragging its feet, union officials say. ''They lay you off before you can get your 90 days in,'' one temporary worker said, referring to the contract provision granting regular hourly status to temporary workers after 90 days of continuous work. ''It happened to me twice.''
All of the ''transplants,'' as Japanese auto manufacturers in the United States are called, hire contract laborers, or temporary workers, to perform housekeeping chores; Mazda and Toyota are the only Japanese auto makers in the United States that use them for production jobs.
Mazda has also responded to the auto industry slowdown by eliminating overtime, combining some jobs and shuffling regular hourly workers into new roles.
Mazda has slowed production of the two-door sports coupes and sedans made in Flat Rock, and ''rebalanced'' workers' duties instead of shutting down its assembly line for a week or two and instituting layoffs - which is the standard approach of the Big Three to bloated inventories.
Because the assembly line is running more slowly, each ''team'' of half a dozen or so workers is expected to accomplish its assigned tasks with fewer people. The pool of hourly employees freed as a result serve as quality inspectors, undergo additional training or help plan the introduction later this year of Mazda's new 626 model.
So far, only 70 of the plant's 2,900 hourly workers have been reassigned.
 
'There Was Some Confusion'
Mazda executives acknowledge that the quality of cars coming off the assembly line has deteriorated during the reassignments. ''Many people were not accustomed to their new job, and there was some confusion,'' Mr. Uchida said.
If quality has suffered, the loyalty of many regular employees appears to have soared as a result of Mazda's effort to keep its core work force employed during the downturn, interviews with plant workers show.
''So far, Mazda has lived up to their promise of not laying people off,'' said Derek Greer, 22, a regular hourly worker who was reassigned when the line slowed down. ''All the extra training we've been getting is useful. We're no use to Mazda out in the street.''
But the recent reduction of temporary workers has strained already fragile relations between the union and Mazda, which was only the second Japanese manufacturer to welcome the U.A.W.
Three years after the opening embrace, Mazda has been stung by absenteeism of 10 percent, unusually high for a Japanese transplant, where the figure is normally less than 5 percent. At Honda, it is below 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan to U.S.: Tighten Up. U.S. to Japan: Loosen Up.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 26

 BODY:
Japan has a few ideas how President Bush can move quickly to tighten up the American economy. To start with, he should strictly limit every American to just a couple of credit cards. Then he should build a network of bullet trains across America, impose a stiff gasoline tax and get rid of low-interest car loans, all to get gas-guzzlers off the road. And he should ban the tax write-off for many types of home mortgages because it subsidizes consumption, not savings.
That is a sampling of 80 very concrete ideas that the Japanese Government presented the Bush Administration several weeks ago, part of the broad critiques that Japan and the United States are making of each other's economies. The list was leaked to the Japanese newspapers over the weekend and confirmed by officials on both sides today. 
''Is this a recipe for political suicide?'' a senior Japanese official said after he was asked whether Japan actually expected the President - or other American politicians - to embrace reforms that would likely cost most American voters thousands of dollars. ''Maybe it is. But you should see America's ideas for Japan.''
There are 240 of those - the Japanese press termed them demands when they leaked late last week - including a suggestion that the leaders of Japan's biggest and most secretive business conglomerates make public the minutes of their monthly meetings. The Japanese business community has scarcely rushed to voice its support of the idea.
For months, both countries have broadly criticized each other's economies. But the two recently exchanged lists make up the most specific plans either side has ever put together to close Japan's trade surpluses and open the country's markets, or to end America's budget deficits and restore United States industrial competitiveness.
From the start, both sides say, the plan was to put together the best suggestions they could come up with, paying no heed to political realities on either side. ''We don't expect every suggestion to be adopted,'' said a senior official of the American Embassy here, ''and neither do they.''
The result is what Makoto Kuroda, a former high official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, calls ''a bunch of very crazy ideas.''
 
Giving as Well as Getting
''But as long as you gave us your crazy ideas,'' Mr. Kuroda told an American tonight, ''we thought we would give you a few of ours.''
Some Japanese suggestions are familiar to anyone who has followed the often-repetitive trade dialogue of the countries. For example, the Japanese said American companies should report earnings, and pay dividends, only twice a year, rather than quarterly. That is the system Japan uses, and the proposal grows from the ritual argument here that American companies are too shortsighted.
Some American ideas are also familiar. A draft of the United States' proposals calls for raising Japan's public spending to about 10 percent of gross national product from the current 6 percent. It wants to ''abolish the distinction between areas for urban development'' and areas where such development is regulated, like farmlands. It calls for a repeal of the law that makes it difficult to establish large department stores, American or Japanese, anywhere it might hurt small shops.
It is Japan's ideas, however, that have attracted much of the curiosity here. The ideas were presented to Washington a few weeks after American negotiators dropped off their list.
 
On 'Junk Bonds'
Japan suggests legislation or regulations against ''junk bonds,'' the high-yield, high-risk debt financing tactic that has brought down several companies.
In the past, Japan has made only general criticisms about the American educational system, saying that it has to work harder to produce an educated, highly skilled work force. In the documents made public over the weekend, Japan suggested that business school curriculums should stress corporate management and manufacturing and educate students in the Japanese language and ''Japanese business customs.''
The proposed limit on the number of credit cards that consumers could hold appears to be a new idea, but one that stems from talks over how to raise the United States savings rate, which is several times below Japan's. Japan is still largely a cash society, and officials here say they have a hard time understanding why Americans would fill a wallet with plastic.
Japanese officials say that despite Mr. Bush's commitment to stop any tax increases, Japan suggested several - including a Federal value-added tax and the gas tax. The Japanese know about high gas taxes: It often costs $35 to fill the tank of a compact car. Japan's solution is to build bullet trains, a mode of transport that works wonderfully along the narrow, jam-packed Japanese coast but seems ill suited for much of the United States. It may also be unsuited for closing the trade deficit: Bullet trains are made in Japan and Europe, but not in the United States.

HEADLINE: Quicksand For Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bankers knew their problems with real estate loans were mounting, but Federal examiners now suggest that the problems are far more serious than the bankers have admitted.
At bank after bank, groups made up of 150 or more examiners are sifting through records on construction and commercial real estate loans. In most cases, the result has been a recommendation for a sharp increase in the reserves that banks set aside to cover bad loans. And those increased reserves cut into profits, making bankers more wary about making new real estate loans. 
Last week, large losses from real estate lending led the Shawmut National Corporation in Hartford to announce a $128.9 million loss for 1989 and the Southeast Banking Corporation in Miami to announce a first-quarter loss of $53 million to $57 million. A week earlier, Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., and the Hibernia Corporation of New Orleans announced real estate losses after visits from examiners.
 
'Credit Crunch' Seen
Indeed, some real estate experts assert that the tougher examinations are aggravating the downturn in real estate prices by causing bankers to cut off the supply of credit for new projects, even those that are creditworthy. Charles Cranmer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said a general cutback in lending was already noticeable. If continued, he warned, it ''could mean slower economic growth - in effect, a credit crunch induced by regulatory pressures.''
And Andrew J. Singer, president of Ackman Brothers & Singer, a specialist in arranging financing for commercial real estate projects, said, ''Bankers who committed themselves to lend a year or so ago are now finding ways to not go through with the commitment, because they know it would automatically result in a loan that runs afoul of the new policies.''
 
Loans Continue to Rise
So far evidence of a squeeze on credit for business borrowers is scanty. A Federal Reserve survey of bankers taken early this year showed that the bankers said they were becoming more cautious, but other Fed data show that both real estate loans and business loans have continued to increase this year among large banks that report data weekly.
Karen J. Wilson, deputy comptroller at the Northeastern district office, disputed the suggestion that examiners were causing credit to be curbed. In markets with office vacancy rates of 20 and 30 percent, and with many bank loans already troubled, ''is it any wonder that banks are not taking on significant new risks,'' she said in a speech to analysts last week.
Officials at the Comptroller of the Currency's office say their standards have not changed. ''We are not holding banks up to a new list of commandments,'' Ms. Wilson said, ''we're simply applying our old standards to a changed environment.''
 
Fleet/Norstar Exposure
One of the banks thought to be most exposed to real estate losses is Fleet/ Norstar Financial Group Inc. in Providence, R.I., where an examination is now under way. The Midlantic Corporation, the Summit Bancorporation and the UJB Financial Corporation, all of New Jersey, are thought to be vulnerable. The Michigan National Corporation is another heavy real estate lender whose debt ratings are under downward pressure.
Other banks in the Southeast and Middle Atlantic States have rapidly increased their real estate lending in recent years, including the Citizens and Southern Corporation of Atlanta, where an examination started last week. A few days before that, Moody's Investors Service said its ratings for Citizens and the Sovran Financial Corporation were no longer under consideration for upgrading. The two have agreed to merge.
 
Views at Citicorp and Chase
Larger banks with national lending operations are also warning that they expect rising losses. Executives at Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Corporation told analysts last week that real estate losses would increase in 1990.
John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, noted that many purchasers of real estate loans, such as Japanese banks, had stopped buying in the last few months. During 1990, he said, commercial real estate lending will earn a profit for Citibank, a Citicorp subsidiary, but nowhere near the $1.50 it usually earned on each $100 of loans.
Officials at the office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury that regulates national banks, say they are aiming their examinations at banks with rapid increases in real estate loans and in areas where prices are weakening.
Based on experience with failed banks in Texas, and the experience of other regulators with savings and loan associations, the Federal examiners are more experienced in gauging how badly a bank can be hurt by falling real estate prices. In Texas, for example, they learned that personal guarantees by developers did not provide as much protection as some bankers expected.
It is widely assumed by bankers and analysts that regulators are taking a tough line now to avoid blame for any new debacle such as the one that put banks in Texas out of business in the mid-1980's and resulted in billions in losses for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Joel B. Alvord, chairman of Shawmut, said last week that estimating the quality of loans had always been an imprecise business, with much room for disagreement. But there is no doubt, he added, that examiners were judging bank loans more harshly than he expected.
One new practice by examiners that raises the hackles of bankers is the labeling as ''nonperforming'' loans on which interest and principal payments are still up to date. Normally the nonperforming label was reserved for loans that were 90 days delinquent. The harsh judgments of the examiners have led to the introduction of a new term in banking jargon, the ''performing nonperforming loan.'' At Shawmut, about a third of the $1.045 billion of the nonperforming loans were loans on which payments are up to date.
Even if the borrower is paying interest when due, Mr. Alvord said, examiners might assume that the developer of a particular project might not be able to continue drawing on personal funds or profits of other projects in order to keep making payments on a troubled project.
Other bankers say that examiners are overriding recent appraisals and applying lower values to properties backing bank loans, based on their knowledge of overall real estate market conditions.

Gold Falls As Mideast Sales Jump

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Gold prices plunged yesterday in New York in near-panic selling on reports of unexpectedly large sales by Middle Eastern interests. Statisticians at the Commodity Exchange in New York said the decline of more than $23 an ounce was the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 28, 1983, when bullion plunged by $42.50, to $400.50.
''The weakness in gold was no surprise, given the continued strength of the dollar and the relatively low level of inflation, said Peter I. Cardillo, metals analyst at Josephthal & Company. ''What did shock the market was the source and magnitude of the selling. It was largely from the Mideast and came in lots of a million ounces. While European bullion dealers absorbed much of the sales at ever-decreasing prices, the full import of the sales was not realized'' until the markets opened in New York. 
 
British Pounds Bought
News reports from Europe attributed the bulk of the selling to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, which used much of the proceeds to buy British pounds, causing that currency to rise sharply against the dollar, West German mark and other key currencies.
At the time of the earlier big loss, the winter of 1983, oil prices were falling, which caused some Middle East oil-exporting countries to either reduce or halt their purchases of bullion. In the week before Feb. 28, 1983, gold tumbled by $105 an ounce. Until then, the oil exporters had preferred bullion to the inflation-riddled dollar and other paper investments. Indeed, it was the rampant inflation of the late 1970's that caused the cash price of gold in New York to reach a record high of $850 on Jan. 21, 1980.
Gold and other precious metals lost much of their attractiveness as investments or hedges against declining currency values as inflation declined since then.
At the close of the Commodity Exchange in New York, the spot March gold contract, which expires tomorrow, settled at $365.80, down $23.10 on the day. The more active April delivery dropped by $23.20, to $366.20. Comex volume was uncommonly high at more than 90,000 contracts of 100 ounces each.
Other precious metals declined in sympathy, with the expiring March silver contract down 8.8 cents an ounce, at $4.955, and the April platinum delivery down $10.20 an ounce, at $483.60, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The failure of oil prices to keep pace with the rising cost of Saudi Arabia's development and social programs has prompted its monetary authority to sell bullion from time to time, according to several dealers.
Moreover, Saudis and other Middle East oil exporters have been diversifying their investments and reducing their traditional interest in gold. In recent years, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have been the major buyers of precious metals. The central banks of Taiwan and South Korea in particular have bought huge amounts of bullion as a means of reducing the soaring volume of dollars created by their favorable trade balances with the United States and other countries.
 
Decline in Reserves
While Saudi gold and hard-currency reserves have been estimated at between $40 billion and $60 billion they are well below those of several years ago.
Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that ''while the OPEC lands of the Mideast have been net sellers of bullion from time to time, the already weakened market did not expect to be hit by sales of three to four million ounces in one day. The Mideasterners are usually very astute gold traders and don't plunge into a soft market. Another mystery is why they would sell gold for British pounds.''
In a move aimed at calming its metals market, the Comex raised both speculative and trade margins, effective this morning. The new speculative initial cash margin for gold was raised to $2,100 from $1,700 for a 100-ounce contract. The initial margin for gold hedgers and others in the trade was raised to $1,400 from $1,000.
The initial margin for Comex silver was increased to $1,400 for a 5,000-ounce contract from $1,000 for both speculators and the trade. The Comex also raised margins for its copper and aluminum futures contracts. While these are the exchange's minimum margins, most brokerage houses require somewhat more cash from their clients.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Insurers Testing Basic Coverage

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
WITHOUT waiting for Congress, which seems reluctant to act on important health insurance issues in an election year, insurers in a number of states are testing new types of coverage for at least some of the 31 million Americans who lack health insurance.
Insurers expect the Governors of Virginia and Washington to sign legislation that exempts small businesses from many required types of coverage. When the bills are signed, the Virginia and Washington Blue Cross plans will offer relatively inexpensive basic coverage to small employers, who often cannot afford coverage with many expensive benefits.
The Virginia program would cover uninsured workers earning $10,000 to $25,000 a year at companies with no more than 50 employees. It would cost $98 a month, half of which would be paid by the employer. ''We did not price it to make money,'' said Donna DeWitt, a product manager with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia. ''It will be a break-even product.'' 
Eric J. Rohlman, a vice president with the Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska plan, said employees of Washington businesses with 25 or fewer uninsured workers would be eligible after a 12-month waiting period. Both the Virginia and Washington plans would encourage prenatal and preventive care. ''Everybody is scrambling to provide access to care for small groups,'' Mr. Rohlman said. ''It's a huge problem and a political issue.'' Programs for the uninsured are also going into effect in Oregon, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Massachusetts. In Connecticut, most of the influential Hartford-based insurance companies are supporting a similar program, which is considered likely to be approved by the Legislature.
In California, which is considering far-reaching legislative proposals, Blue Cross of California has jumped ahead with an offer to insure all but the riskiest of high-risk small groups at rates only 30 percent above those for groups without many health problems. Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of California Blue Cross, said his plan could not wait for the state to act.
Massachusetts hopes to cover 100,000 of the state's 600,000 uninsured by summer. The state has awarded contracts to five insurance companies that will offer lower-cost coverage to a pool of small businesses. The state will help with subsidies (which were reduced because of state budget problems to $6 million, from a planned $30 million). Massachusetts employers will have to contribute to coverage for people who receive unemployment compensation; disabled people will be able to buy into the state Medicaid program, and college students will be required to have health insurance.
Oregon is offering a tax credit to employers who offer a basic coverage; it emphasizes primary health care but would not cover expensive procedures like heart transplants. In Oklahoma, which does not require health insurance coverage, Blue Cross is offering a basic, lower-cost plan. Hawaii, which has long required all employers to provide health benefits, has just enacted a voluntary ''bare bones'' program for part-time, seasonal and agricultural workers and their dependents, said Greg Scandlen, state research director with the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
At the national level, the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers group, is working on a proposal that would set limits on renewal rate increases for small groups and provide a privately financed reinsurance pool for high-risk people with a history of expensive health problems. Linda Jenckes, an association vice president, said insurers would lobby for the plan in all states. They also want Congress to exempt small employers from the 800 or so state-mandated types of coverage.
Insurers welcomed many of the recommendations to Congress for ''insurance market reform'' by the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care. But the insurers association strongly objects to the commission's call for Federally standardized health insurance benefits and regulations that would ban the exclusion of individuals or groups because of pre-existing health conditions.
The House Ways and Means Committee's health subcommittee plans to hold hearings on the commission's package on Tuesday. The subcommittee's chairman, Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat and a member of the commission, said the bipartisan panel was nearly unanimous in its support for the market-reform proposals.
But both Mr. Stark and Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, said they did not expect Congress to act this year. Representative Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of the bipartisan commission, said it was already ''late in the session'' for action on controversial health-care proposals.

HEADLINE: Harvard Administrator to Head Stanford Business School

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 26

 BODY:
A. Michael Spence, a renowned economist and the second-highest administrator at Harvard University, today was named the next dean of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
The appointment was considered a coup at Stanford. As dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, Mr. Spence held one of the nation's most prestigious academic posts, with a rank equivalent to that of provost at many other universities.
Mr. Spence said today that he realized many people would view his new position as a step down. But he said the more manageable size of the Stanford job would eventually allow him to return to teaching and research while remaining an administrator. 
''I think it's a real chance for me to get to where I came from and still do the job I'm doing,'' he said.
 
Other Considerations
Mr. Spence also said the move would allow his wife, Ann, to spend more time with her parents, who live in Northern California and are in poor health. Moreover, he said, it made sense for him to step down now before Harvard begins a major fund-raising effort, because it would be difficult to remain as dean for the seven to eight years it would take to complete the campaign.
At Stanford, in Palo Alto, Calif., in Mr. Spence will replace Robert K. Jaedicke, an accounting expert who has been dean since 1983 and who said last year that he would return to teaching.
''I can't think of anybody who could generate such enthusiastic support from people ranging from theoretical faculty to hard-headed practical businessmen to eager students,'' said Charles T. Horngren, a professor of accounting at the business school and vice chairman of the search committee that chose Mr. Spence.
 
Degrees From Oxford
Mr. Spence, who is 46 years old, was born in Montclair, N.J., and reared in Toronto. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Princeton University and received bachelor's and master's degrees as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University.
He earned a doctorate in economics at Harvard, where he later taught in the economics department and at the business school. His specialty had been how markets communicated information through prices and other mechanisms, and how companies and individuals made decisions based on that information. In 1981, he received the John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economics Association to outstanding economists under age 40.
Mr. Spence became the dean of arts and sciences in 1984, a job that put him in charge of 9,000 students and 700 faculty members in Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, though not in the professional schools. He became best known for a plan that encouraged the university to promote more of its junior faculty rather than hire senior professors from outside.
''All of Harvard owes Mike Spence a great debt of gratitude for the skillful and imaginative way in which he has led the Faculty of Arts and Sciences during the past six years,'' said Derek C. Bok, Harvard's president. ''Though I regret Mike's departure deeply, all of us can understand and respect the personal considerations that have led him to this decision.''
 
To Oversee 800 Students
At Stanford, where he will start this fall, Mr. Spence will be in charge of fewer than 800 students and 120 faculty members. Mr. Spence had taught economics at the university for two years in the mid-1970's, as his wife earned a degree from the business school.
Stanford is perennially ranked as one of the nation's best business schools. A survey by U.S. News & World Report recently ranked it No. 1. But it is not without problems.
Students have complained in recent years about inadequate teaching and an emphasis on research, and some notable faculty members have left. But Stanford officials say that faculty departures are to be expected and that the teaching complaints focused on some visiting faculty members who are no longer there.
Mr. Spence said he had some ideas on what he wanted to do at Stanford, mentioning as an example the need to emphasize manufacturing. But he said he would not set an agenda before meeting with students and faculty members.
''There's not going to be any dramatic change,'' said James N. Rosse, the Stanford provost who was chairman of the 18-member search committee. The panel had considered more than 100 people.

HEADLINE: Stocks in Tokyo Decline Slightly

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, March 27

 BODY:
Stock prices declined slightly today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The United States dollar opened higher against the Japanese yen.
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which had gained 1,468.33 points, or 4.83 percent, on Monday, rose and fell in volatile trading throughout the day, and by the end of the session stood at 31,825.96 down 14.53 points. Volume was at the 700 million level, or fairly active.
Dealers attributed the loss to the yen's continued weakness against the dollar.
The dollar started trading at 156.90 yen, up 0.50 yen from the Monday close in Tokyo.
''Because of the yen's decline, issues sensitive to interest-rate movements are being sold,'' a Nomura Securities dealer said.
Monday's gain was second only to the 2,037.32-point rise on Oct. 21, 1987, when share prices rebounded from the worldwide market crash.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved modestly higher yesterday in listless trading, pushed upward by continued strength in the dollar.
Much of the session's gains were recorded during overnight trading, when the dollar rose strongly against the Japanese yen.
But dealers said there was no follow-through once trading shifted to Europe and then to the United States.
With the Federal Reserve Board unlikely to approve a change in monetary policy at the meeting today of its policy-making Open Market Committee, traders and analysts said coming auctions of two-year and four-year notes may be the only events that will spark much interest this week. 
''The Fed has to be quite happy at this point,'' said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Short-term interest rates have moved up, and they aren't going to fight that. I think they are going to sit back and watch.''
Because of the rise in short-term rates, Mr. Held and others said demand for the new Treasury notes should be strong.
''Retail participation should be very aggressive at the auctions,'' Mr. Held said. ''The yields are there.''
 
Ten-Year Note Auction
The Treasury will auction $10 billion of new two-year notes today. Late yesterday, the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.55 percent.
Good demand from small investors for short-term securities was also in evidence at the weekly Treasury bill auction yesterday.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.85 percent, down from an average rate of 7.97 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.83 percent, compared with an average rate of 7.92 percent a week ago.
Non-competitive bids, a good indication of demand from retail investors, totaled $1.5 billion for the $8 billion of three-month bills that were sold. Investors placed $1.2 billion worth of non-competitive bids for the $8 billion of six-month bills that were auctioned.
The strength of the dollar, and a big drop in gold prices, provided modest support for prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the day, the 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 100 14/ 32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.45 percent.
Among note issues, 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 31/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.50 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 7/8, up 2/32, to yield 8.51 percent.
 
Tax-Free Municipal Bonds
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said prices were little affected yesterday by a sweeping ratings downgrade by the Standard & Poor's Corporation on more than $13 billion worth of outstanding New York State debt obligations.
Included in the downgrade was a lowering of Standard & Poor's rating on $3.9 billion of general obligation bonds to A, from AA-minus.
In addition, Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on the state's auction today of $775 million of tax and revenue-anticipation notes. The notes were downgraded to MIG-2. The notes, which are issued annually, were rated MIG-1 last year.
''The downgrade will affect the pricing of the notes, but it hasn't had much of an impact on the bonds,'' one municipal bond trader said. ''New York's problems have been well known for some time, so these steps were not unanticipated.''
New-issue activity in the tax-exempt market was dominated by a $492 million offering of bonds issued by O'Hare Airport in Chicago.
The issue, which is subject to provisions of the alternative minimum tax, consisted of serial and term bonds.
The largest part of the issue consists of $199 million of 7.5 percent term bonds due in 2017. The bonds were preliminarily priced at $96.6245, to yield 7.80 percent.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale. The issue is rated A by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
In the new-issue corporate bond market, the Carolina Power and Light Company offered $75 million of first-mortgage bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The 9.14 percent bonds, which mature on April 1, 1995, were priced at 100, which was 67 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary markets for tax-exempt municipal bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds was light, dealers said.
Prices of most tax-exempt issues were unchanged to a 1/8 point higher. Prices of actively traded corporate bonds posted similar results.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

Dollar Climbs Against Yen, But Loses Ground to Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen yesterday, stoking the bearish attitude toward gold that has been building for weeks. But the dollar retreated against the British pound.
The Saudia Arabian Monetary Agency is said to have been a big seller of gold - an estimated 3 million ounces - and to have bought pounds with the proceeds. The agency acts as the country's central bank and is the main repository of hard currencies and gold reserves. 
The dollar has been bid up on speculation that American interest rates will remain at current levels or will climb. There is a perception that the Federal Reserve will not nudge rates down because economic growth appears adequate while inflationary pressures persist.
Tension in the Soviet Union over the Lithuanian independence movement and forecasts of further weakness in the Japanese yen have also driven up the dollar.
The dollar rose to 156.70 yen in New York, from 154.30 yen late Friday. In Tokyo yesterday, the dollar rose by 1.33 yen, to 156.40 yen, its highest close since Jan. 13, 1987. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 156.35 yen.
The British pound, benefiting from the reported Saudi sterling purchase, strengthened to $1.6185 in New York, from $1.6010 on Friday. Sterling traded late in London at $1.6135, up from $1.6040 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, were: 1.7075 West German marks, down from 1.7135; 1.5205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5200; 5.7480 French francs, down from 5.7720; 1,256.00 Italian lire, down from 1,260.25, and 1.17595 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17505.
Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Friday's levels, were: 1.7155 West German marks, up from 1.7100; 1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5179; 5.7745 French francs, up from 5.7645; 1.9267 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9249; 1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,258.50, and 1.1748 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1751.

HEADLINE: Strategies to Let Elderly Keep Some Control

SERIES: CARE OF THE ELDERLY; PRIVATE BURDENS, PUBLIC CHOICES - SECOND OF FOUR ARTICLES.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Home care services, adult day care and a host of other programs to aid the disabled elderly are proliferating as more people search for alternatives to traditional nursing homes.
Over the last decade, public and private agencies have begun to respond to the near-universal desire of frail or chronically ill people to remain in familiar surroundings, with control over their lives, whenever possible.
Innovative programs are providing help with daily activities to frail or chronically ill people who do not want, or need to live in a nursing home. The new approaches include home-repair services, day centers, foster homes for the elderly and apartment buildings where residents can get more care as they need it.
 
Need for New Services
Nonetheless, experts say, the need for new services is far from met. Most of the disabled elderly are still cared for by relatives at home. But many elderly people are placed in nursing homes simply because they lack help with dressing and bathing. And many wives, husbands and children still strain to care for the disabled at home without any assistance or relief. 
''There's no question that the experiments and alternatives are out there, but they're serving only a small proportion of those who need them,'' said Dr. Carroll Estes, director of the Institute for Health and Aging at the University of California at San Francisco.
For elderly people who want to stay in the community, she said, the biggest need is in-home help with bathing, dressing and homemaking.
 
States Try New Strategies
''While there are a lot more of those programs than there were 10 years ago, very few deal with large numbers of people,'' she said.
To be sure, nursing homes may be the best alternative for the frailest people, the most disabled, the severely demented or violent, those with complex medical needs and those with no family or friends to lend a hand.
But states are trying out many new strategies as they face ever-higher nursing home costs, and growing concern about the sense of confinement and lack of personal control that so many nursing home residents feel.
''Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington State and Illinois have been among the leaders,'' said Diane Justice, deputy director of the National Association of State Units on Aging. ''And where programs aren't being developed, it's usually due to a lack of state dollars, not a lack of interest.''
In Wisconsin, the $35 million annual Community Options Program assists 7,700 people needing long-term care, half of them elderly and half younger disabled people. The program will arrange almost any service needed to keep a resident at home, whether it is paying the next-door neighbor to cook dinner twice a week or finding a nurse to come every day. The services are provided free to the poor and on a sliding scale to others.
Oregon is trying a different approach, creating a network of foster homes for the elderly. The state is also encouraging developers to build ''assisted living'' apartments, where residents can get the same level of nursing care available in a nursing home, along with housekeeping services and meals in a group dining room, without forfeiting the chance to live in a private apartment with their own furnishings, carpeted floors and a door that can lock. New Approaches Sorting Out What Works Many community programs, some public, some private, have developed across the country. There are now about 2,200 day centers for the elderly, compared with a dozen 20 years ago. Hundreds of new respite programs provide a companion or nurse to look after an elderly person while the person who usually provides the care takes a break.
There are also telephone reassurance programs, in which frail people get daily calls to make sure they are well. Technology can also play a part. Some elderly people get a sense of security by wearing an electronic alarm they can set off if they fall or need help.
Many cities also have housekeeping, gardening or home repair programs for the elderly, to help prevent people from retreating to a nursing home simply because they cannot manage the chores of daily life.
 
New Role: Care Manager
The proliferation of programs has spawned a new profession: the private care manager, who coordinates and monitors an elderly person's care, signing up for the meal programs, checking the performance of the home health aide, scheduling doctor's visits and arranging transportation.
Such services are appealing to the growing population of adult children whose aging parents live far away. Rather than making weekly trips to check on a parent, many choose to hire a local care manager, at $50 to $120 an hour. Some care managers work with their own nurses and aides, while others contract out the work. And while one client may need only a monthly check-in call, another may require daily visits. The National Association of Private Geriatric Care Managers, in Dayton, Ohio, is creating a national referral network.
Many public and nonprofit agencies use case managers to screen clients and help them find their way to the most appropriate programs available locally.
Some nursing homes have created their own services for elderly people in the community.
 
An Array of Services
Since 1980, for example, the Jewish Home and Hospital for Aged in New York City has started a ''nursing home without walls'' home care program; two day centers, one of them for the blind and visually impaired; an in-home Alzheimer's emergency respite program; outpatient rehabilitation that offers therapy, nursing and counseling, and an at-home recovery program, which cares for patients newly released from the hospital and helps train the family to take over. The Jewish Home has also started a telephone Guideline, (212) 663-4663, to help clients decide which services they need and qualify for.
''Most of the things that are likely to help solve the long-term care problem are being tried in some pilot project somewhere, but we're really still at the very beginning,'' said Dr. Burton Reifler of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., who directs a pilot program that finances several day centers. ''It's going to take 15 or 20 years to sort out what works, what people want, what they will pay for, what the government will pay for, and then to see that the services we need are widely available.'' Home Living Someone to Take Care of Things Most health policy experts agree that too many people live in nursing homes not because they need much medical attention but because that is the most widely available option. Also, for those who have used up their resources, it is the one that Medicaid, the joint Federal-state health program for the poor, is most likely to pay for.
The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 5 percent of Americans over 65 now live in nursing homes, more than double the percentage of the early 1960's. Most of the increase came shortly after the 1965 creation of Medicare and Medicaid, which helped nudge long-term care into a medical model, with the disabled and elderly seen as patients, rather than a social model, with programs designed around daily living needs, and medical services added as needed.
''The field of long-term care has been too medicalized, because programs are driven so much by the funding mechanisms available to pay for them,'' said Jeffrey Mitchell of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which supports many experimental long-term care programs. ''We did some research to find out what the elderly want, and we found that services like home repair, shopping and housecleaning may contribute more to the elderly's being able to stay in the community than traditional medical services.''
 
Help With Home Repairs
One such program is the home repair service that the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens operates for elderly people with limited incomes. It has helped Rose and Michael Katz stay in the Brooklyn home they have owned since the 1950's.
''We thought about leaving because we weren't sure we would be able to manage the upkeep,'' said Mrs. Katz, 76 years old. ''They've probably come 30 times and fixed the locks on our doors, the washers on the faucets, taken care of the washing machine and cleared the drains. The house would have fallen apart without them.''
In Dallas, the Visiting Nurse Association offers a program called Independence Plus, which arranges $10-an-hour housekeeping, and yard maintenance for the elderly.
''We get a lot of widows who can't take care of the yard, or need help with shopping, and a lot of men who don't know how to take care of the house and need heavy cleaning, shopping and meal preparation,'' said Sue Seifert, the director of the program.
 
Nine Visits a Week
With more than 10,000 public and private home health agencies nationwide, even people who need a great deal of nursing care can often remain in their homes.
Margaret Pawley, 78, of Brookside, Del., has had several disabling strokes and a colostomy. She is bedridden, diabetic and catheterized, with a bedsore and a surgical incision that still need dressing. She gets three visits a week from a nurse who checks her blood and her dressings, three visits from a physical therapist who helps her with upper-arm exercises and three visits from an aide, who changes her bed and bathes her.
''It's hard and I did think about a nursing home,'' said Mrs. Pawley's daughter, Mary Lucille Walstrum. ''But when Mom was in the hospital, she only said two things to me: ''I love you' and 'When am I going home?' So I thought I would try it,'' Mrs. Walstrum has moved her family into her mother's house and hired her husband's sister to care for her mother while Mrs. Walstrum is at work. Assisted Living Varied Strategies Succeed in Oregon Richard Ladd, the administrator of Oregon's Senior and Disabled Services Division, estimates that only about 5 percent of the state's 20,000 Medicaid recipients receiving long-term care have complex medical needs.
''Most of them just can't do what they need to do, whether it's getting dressed or taking their medicine,'' he said. ''Long-term care is not a medical problem, but too often we put them in nursing homes where they have less control over their lives and less freedom than the average prison inmate.''
One of Mr. Ladd's alternatives to nursing homes is a network of foster homes, each caring for up to five elderly people.
''I've got a lady who's 95, three in their 80's and a 67-year-old Alzheimer's patient, and they're all confused in their minds,'' said Geraldine Maurig, 62, who runs a foster home near Portland. ''It's no different than having five children at home to look after. You become their mother, the one they turn to. I cook and do their hair, and take care of their whiskers, and even when I have incontinent people you don't smell anything when you walk in my door.''
Mrs. Maurig, who trained her granddaughter to open a foster home of her own, charges $1,000 to $1,400 a month, depending on the level of care. The state pays an average of $1,700 a month for nursing home care.
Oregon also emphasises assisted-living apartments, in which the elderly and disabled live in a building where meals and housekeeping are provided, with other services, like nursing, added as needed. Mr. Ladd estimates that half the state's nursing home residents could be cared for in such apartments.
 
A Couple Stays Together
Gladys and John Chaffin moved from California to the Regency Park assisted-living complex in Portland two years ago, when Mr. Chaffin began needing care for Alzheimer's disease.
''We had looked at a lot of nursing homes,'' said Mrs. Chaffin, who is 81, ''but to tell the truth, I wouldn't have moved into a nursing home with him, and when you've been married 60 years, it seems sad to be separated.'' She said the assisted-living arrangement ''is wonderful for us because I can go and play bridge twice a week and there's someone to take care of him.'' In the future, she added, ''when he starts needing more care, they'll be able to handle that, too.''
Assisted-living often becomes sensible when home care proves too difficult, and many profit-making companies, including hotel chains like the Marriott Corporation and the Hyatt Corporation, are entering the field, expecting that, as the population ages, there will be a large market for care.
''It's not always practical to keep people at home,'' said Keren Brown Wilson, a consultant who helped develop Regency Park.''It's very expensive and very tough to manage home care for someone who needs care round the clock, or needslike someone to help whenever they have to use the bathroom. If you design it carefully, assisted living gives you the economies of scale and a lot of the feeling of a home.''
Regency Park, with costs starting at $1,500 a month for a studio apartment, has about 20 residents receiving state assistance, but most of the residents pay privately.
 
Expected Savings Not Realized
Rosalie A. Kane, an expert on long-term care at the University of Minnesota, is optimistic about assisted living. ''I think the most promising model for people with heavy long-term care needs is housing where lots of different services can be added on,'' she said. ''If you can separate the idea of housing from the idea of care, you can break through the rigidity of nursing home life.''
Dr. Kane and others said that most of the alternatives to nursing homes were started with idea of saving money. But often, the cost savings are illusory: indeed, round-the-clock home care is apt to be more expensive than care in a nursing home, because it requires a caretaker for each patient.
''For the most part, the initial glowing reports about how much money these programs save, and how long they delay nursing home admission, have not panned out,'' she said. ''Cost aside, most people do not want to enter a nursing home. Quality of life can be just as important a factor as cost.'' Helping the Helpers Day Centers Give Needed Relief Much of America's long-term care is still provided informally, most often by wives, daughters, daughters-in-law and neighbors. And increasingly, policy makers are trying to find ways to support them.
Day centers and respite programs, which can help those caring for disabled people as much as the disabled, are mushrooming, and becoming increasingly specialized, with programs especially for Alzheimer's patients, the visually impaired, AIDS patients and other groups.
''It's a godsend to be able to take my husband to the day center every morning,'' said Gloria Lowe, whose husband, Martin, 80, has had Alzheimer's disease for 17 years and now attends an Alzheimer's center in Delaware. ''When he's home, he needs constant attention, so this is my only chance to catch up on shopping and cleaning. I would have run out of money if he had been in a nursing home all this time and this is better for him.''
Alzheimer's patients, who make up about half the population of nursing homes nationally, pose the most troubling long-term care problems as their dementia progresses.
 
Benefits of Music
Some programs are finding new ways to engage them and lessen their distress. The Sunshine Terrace day center in Logan, Utah, uses extensive music therapy, having found that it helps to soothe demented older people.
''We have patients who can no longer say five words, but who can still sing the lyrics to 20 or 30 songs from their childhood,'' said Bonnie Smith, the program director. ''We sing a lot of 'Let Me Call You Sweetheart' and 'Springtime in the Rockies.' ''
The center even has a choral group, whose conductor, Viola Israelsen, an 84-year-old Alzheimer's patient who lives with her son, has a wandering problem and can no longer quite remember her age or how many children she has. But singing is second nature to her, and she sound utterly lucid at rehearsal.
''I was trained by mother and dad to like and originate music, to make it sing in my heart,'' she said.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS AGREE NEW YORK IS FACING BIGGER BUDGET GAP

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 27

 BODY:
Apparently chastened by a downgrading of the state's credit rating on Monday, Senate Republicans agreed today that the gap in Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed 1990-91 budget had grown to $1.5 billion.
The accord between Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders included an agreement to reduce spending by $500 million, but none of of the officials involved would disclose details of the cuts. The accord was reached during long negotiations that ended early this morning. Though the leaders have yet to decide how to solve the fiscal quandary, it was the first time they had agreed on how severe it was.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., had resisted an agreement even though the Governor and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, both Democrats, and Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, concurred on the number more than two weeks ago. 
 
Now the Talk Is of Taxes
A smaller budget gap might have enabled Mr. Marino to avoid supporting some of the tax increases Mr. Cuomo proposed.
Mr. Marino's concession on the size of the budget gap, coupled with the accord on spending cuts, seemed to signal that the Senate, with a Republican majority, might now be willing to discuss a smorgasbord of new and increased taxes that Mr. Cuomo has proposed to fill much of the budget gap. But Mr. Marino stopped short of saying so.
''We have not accepted the need for revenues,'' Mr. Marino said at a news conference today. ''We are discussing revenues, however. We're not going to tax the people of this state one cent more unless it's absolutely necessary, and we can't see any other way of getting this budget done.'' #2 Targets: Retirement Funds While continuing to argue over how to cut spending and where to raise taxes, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders did appear to agree on one facet of a plan to close the budget gap. All three want to save at least $400 million by simply reducing the state's contribution to two huge retirement funds for public employees and teachers.
Similar changes last year saved $600 million, but custodians of the funds, including the State Comptroller, are resisting the new proposals. They say further cuts in state contributions could impair their ability to meet obligations to more than a million pensioners, but Mr. Cuomo has insisted that the pensions are now overfunded and that a reduction is warranted.
Officials with Standard & Poor's, one of two major credit rating agencies that lowered New York's rating on Monday, said their decision was influenced by the inability of state leaders to agree on even the magnitude of the gap - the difference between how much the government plans to spend and how much it expects to take in.
Standard & Poor's took the unexpected step of lowering the state's credit rating on longterm bonds by two steps, from AA- to A, making New York's credit rating the third lowest of all states that are rated.
 
'A Breakthrough'
In a fiscal landscape that darkened from gloomy to bleak with the drop in the credit rating, the leaders portrayed the agreement on the size of the budget gap as a ray of good news.
''After three months, we finally agreed there is a deficit, so I suppose it was a major victory,'' Mr. Miller said.
Calling the accord ''an extraordinary breakthrough,'' Mr. Cuomo said it was crucial to negotiate a budget by April 1, when the fiscal year starts. ''We made a mistake,'' he said. ''We didn't agree fast enough that there was a problem.
O.K., that's behind us. Now we want to be constructive and get this done.''
After meeting for more than five hours Monday night, a session that ended at 12:30 A.M. yesterday, the Governor and legislative leaders also said they had agreed on $500 million in spending cuts, leaving them to find $1 billion through other means.
They have consistently refused to disclose which items they plan to cut from Mr. Cuomo's $51 billion proposed budget, fearing that such an announcement would mobilize opposition that could paralyze an already delicate budget process.
 
An Ever-Widening Gap
The projected gap in Mr. Cuomo's 1990-91 budget has grown since the Governor proposed it in mid-January. When fiscal analysts saw that state tax collections in January and February were far lower than anticipated, they revised their estimates for tax collections in the coming fiscal year.
That created the budget gap that the leaders now agree is $1.5 billion. That gap exists in addition to a $2 billion gap that would have occurred in the 1990-91 budget if Mr. Cuomo had maintained state spending at the previous year's level plus inflation.
State law requires the Governor to present a balanced budget, so he has proposed filling that gap by suspending the final year of a four-year cut in the personal income tax, by levying a series of other taxes, by taking a number of so-called one-shot revenue measures, and by making spending cuts.
There is another gap in the existing budget, passed last April for the 1989-90 fiscal year. That gap has been estimated at more than $1 billion and has been reduced through spending cuts and raids on reserve funds and by selling $775 million in short-term bonds.
The credit rating drop was already felt today with the sale of those bonds, which mature at the end of the year. Marvin G. Nailor, a spokesman for the State Comptroller, said the lower credit rating caused the bonds to trade at an interest rate that is one-tenth of 1 percent higher than it would have been had the credit rating not fallen. That means the state will have to pay $580,000 in additional interest.
 
Even Lower Rating Feared
Although the start of the fiscal year, and thus the state's budget deadline, is April 1, the Legislature has not met that deadline since 1984. Mr. Cuomo, who had warned previously that missing the deadline could mean lower ratings, said today that the state credit rating could be threatened further if a budget was not negotiated quickly.
''If we don't do this budget right we could make this a junk bond state,'' Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference.
He expressed concern about ''rumors'' that some Senate Republicans believed that the lowering of the credit rating on Monday alleviated the pressure to pass a budget on time.
Mr. Marino insisted that he and his colleagues were indeed working toward an April 1 deadline, but several Republican senators conceded that the early drop in credit rates made it less likely that they will meet that date.
Mr. Marino threw one new item on the negotiating table today by proposing a mandatory cap on state spending. The Republican proposal, which was rejected by a spokesman for Mr. Miller, would restrict the annual growth in state spending more than a similar cap long supported by Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo's spending cap would limit the annual growth in spending to the average growth in state personal income over the previous three years.
Mr. Marino's plan would limit spending growth to either 80 percent of the average rise in personal income over three years or to the previous year's increase in inflation adjusted for population growth, whichever figure is less.

HEADLINE: Accord on Control of Nicaraguan Army

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 27

 BODY:
Representatives of the Sandinista leadership today recognized the right of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to exercise full authority over the country's Sandinista-dominated army and security forces.
That provision, part of an agreement signed after four weeks of talks, is the first concrete effort to determine the role of the powerful Sandinista military apparatus under an incoming Government that has defined itself in opposition to Sandinista rule. It appears to address broad concerns that the Sandinistas would attempt to retain military power despite their defeat by a wide margin in national elections on Feb. 25.
The document declares that serving soldiers and officers, who now receive intensive political instruction, will be prohibited from holding leadership positions of any political party. It notes explicitly that the size and structure of the armed forces, which now include 65,000 troops on active duty, may be adjusted ''in accordance with the economic capacity and social necessities of the country.'' 
But the agreement, described as a ''protocol on procedure for the transfer of presidential authority,'' also declares that a respect for the ''integrity and professionalism'' of the armed forces will be a crucial element in an orderly transfer of power. And it commits Mrs. Chamorro to respect a number of cherished Sandinista projects, ranging from grants of land to the rural and urban poor to maintenance of monuments to Sandinistas who died in the 1979 revolution and on the Government side of the country's long war against the United States-supported rebels known as contras.
 
Other Agreements Expected
The document, released at a press conference late today, is the first and broadest of what is expected to be a series of agreements between the Sandinistas and Mrs. Chamorro's nascent administration as the two sides attempt to work out the practical aspects of Nicaragua's first democratic change of government, scheduled for April 25.
''The nation's defense forces and forces of public order will be subordinated to the civil power of the President of the republic, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the republic,'' the agreement declares. ''The armed forces will have a professional character and will not belong to any political party.''
Although Sandinista leaders have issued harsh and frequent warnings that Mrs. Chamorro's Government must not tamper with the ''integrity'' of the army or the security forces, today's announcement was reinforced by a passionate, conciliatory speech by the chief negotiator of the Sandinista transition team, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra, who is the younger brother of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and a key strategist of the Sandinista Government.
 
Goal of National Reconciliation
Declaring that Nicaraguans ''voted for peace'' in last month's elections, Mr. Ortega urged them all to work together to work for national reconciliation. He underscored the document's demand for the carrying out of recent agreements to disband the contra army, which both sides have described as the most important remaining obstacle to a smooth transition.
In a passage clearly aimed at responding to Sandinista fears of a wholesale turnover in the Government after Mrs. Chamorro takes power, the agreement declares that both sides support ''a guarantee of job stability for Government functionaries and employees, on the basis of their efficiency, administrative honesty and years of service.''
But the document also takes aim at widespread evidence that the Sandinistas have handed out automatic weapons to their military and civilian supporters in the weeks since the election, directly underscoring ''the need to insure that arms and combat equipment be kept exclusively in the hands of the armed institutions of the republic.''
The agreement was signed by Humberto Ortega and by Mrs. Chamorro's chief negotiator, Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, her son-in-law and former campaign manager. It was witnessed by Nicaragua's Roman Catholic primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo.

HEADLINE: Colleague Denounces Comments By Illinois Congressman as Bigoted

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Remarks made by Representative Gus Savage of Illinois in the closing days of his successful Democratic primary campaign have been condemned as ''divisive and bigoted'' by the House Democratic whip, Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Gray, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, gave that assessment in a statement Monday after reviewing a videotape of Mr. Savage's comments, which have been denounced by Jewish groups as anti-Semitic.
Mr. Savage made his remarks at a Chicago campaign rally the weekend before the March 20 election. The rally was attended by his fellow black Congressmen Mr. Gray and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. 
After his two colleagues had left the rally, Mr. Savage charged that his opponent, Mel Reynolds, a black former university administrator, had received much of his campaign money from what Mr. Savage termed ''pro-Israeli Jewish lobbies.'' Mr. Savage suggested that pro-Israel groups wanted him defeated because he favored a shift in foreign aid from Israel to sub-Saharan African nations.
 
A Colleague Was 'Shocked'
Mr. Rangel issued a statement last Friday saying he was ''shocked'' by reports of Mr. Savage's remarks. At that time, Mr. Gray, in New Orleans to attend a Democratic conference, said that ''if anti-Semitic, bigoted statements were made,'' he condemned them and that he wanted to review a videotape of the event when he returned to Washington.
In his statement Monday, Mr. Gray said: ''After reviewing the videotape of Mr. Savage's speech before the Illinois primary, I find much of his language and remarks unacceptable, divisive and bigoted. Such language I reject and condemn.''
Repeated efforts today and tonight to reach Mr. Savage or a spokesman for comment were unsuccessful.
Mr. Savage is known for his extravagant use of language. Last month, when the House ethics committee was about to rebuke him for improper sexual advances toward a female Peace Corps worker on a trip to Zaire, he attacked his accusers as ''white liberals'' and ''self-appointed guardians of public morality.''
Aides to Mr. Gray said he had just returned from a trip to South Africa when he was invited by Mr. Savage to appear at the campaign rally and speak of the candidate's help in passage of a bill to impose economic sanctions against Pretoria. The aides said that by appearing at the rally Mr. Gray had in essence been repaying Mr. Savage for his support on South Africa sanctions and that Mr. Gray had no idea what Mr. Savage would say there.

Ribbs Out of Indy 500

 BODY:
Willy T. Ribbs, who enlisted the support of Bill Cosby last November in his attempt to become the first black driver to compete in the Indianapolis 500, has abandoned his plans to drive in that race in 1990.
Jim Dinsmore, a spokesman for the Raynor-Cosby Racing Team, said yesterday that the team still planned to enter Ribbs in the 11 road-racing events on the 16-race Indy-car schedule this year. 
Ribbs abandoned an attempt at Indy this year, Dinsmore said, because the team could not get a 1990 model chassis in time for the May 27 race.
The team started searching for a major sponsor relatively late, Dinsmore said, and that fact, combined with the weakening economy and the Porsche Indy-car team's unexpected entry into the sponsorship hunt, was too much to overcome.
More than one Indy-car team so far has complained that the 1989 cars, when updated to meet the new rules taking effect this year, are very skittish.
Ribbs hit the wall while testing a 1989 chassis last month at the mile oval in Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Fire Alarms, and Fire, in Albany

 BODY:
As threatened, the top bond rating agencies have now downgraded New York State's credit rating, leaving no doubt that the state is in serious financial trouble. With the legal deadline for approving the next budget now just four days away, leaders in Albany can no longer afford political games at public expense.
The task confronting Gov. Mario Cuomo and Senate Republicans is to close a $1.5 billion gap for the fiscal year that begins Sunday. There's one hopeful sign: Ralph Marino, the Senate majority leader, after weeks of irresponsibly shrugging off warnings even from his fellow Republican Edward Regan, the State Comptroller, finally acknowledges that a problem exists. 
But that's hardly enough. New Yorkers need a plan that would not merely solve this year's problem but restore the state's long-term financial stability.
The decision by Standard & Poor's and Moody's to downgrade the state's credit rating could cost taxpayers dearly in higher interest on state bonds. The higher debt service could also make new initiatives, like Mr. Cuomo's proposed Environmental Bond Act, unaffordable.
Part of the problem is the downturn in the economy that has cut tax revenues throughout the Northeast. But part of it is also the way Governor Cuomo and the Legislature have been managing the state's money. They have cut taxes without reducing spending and engaged in fiscal gimmicks that dismay the rating agencies.
Only in recent days has Mr. Cuomo shown signs of strong leadership. He's gone along with the tax cuts and high spending, he's given his blessing to the questionable use of one-time revenues like raiding reserve funds, and - except for a few tantalizing hints, like his welcome call for higher gasoline taxes - has yet to let the public in on his proposed solution to the current mess.
But the Senate Republicans remain the biggest obstacle. Even now, Mr. Marino won't agree to defer the next phase of the state's income tax cut, vaguely holding out for unrealistic spending cuts.
Posturing is inevitable at state budget time, especially in an election year. But as the siren from the rating agencies now makes clear, this year the rules have changed. Mr. Marino and his colleagues appear intent on dragging out the process in an effort to hurt Mr. Cuomo. It's a destructive, possibly self-destructive strategy and it's already costing New York millions.

HEADLINE: Not-So-Crazy Talk From Japan

 BODY:
Just who do the Japanese think they are? Tokyo's negotiators and Washington's have been talking jargon to each other for seven months about ''structural impediments'' to trade. Now the Japanese have found a way to show America how it feels to be patronized.
Their device is a list of 80 specific ideas for improving the U.S. economy. The Japanese say that consumption-mad Americans have too many credit cards. They argue that U.S. corporations should take a longer view, reporting earnings and paying dividends twice a year, like the Japanese, instead of quarterly. They say gasoline taxes are too low and that the tax deduction for interest on home mortgages should be abolished. 
The forum is a bilateral discussion called the ''Structural Impediments Initiative.'' Washington initiated the talks in hopes of persuading the Japanese to change their ways, and eventually import more and export less. But Japan insisted on discussing what's wrong with America, too.
Now, in a stroke, the Japanese have shown how preposterous it is to think that national norms can be reordered by negotiation. Japan's list of ideas for making the American economy more efficient and competitive has not been made public, but a sampling found its way into the Japanese press. The published examples are suggestions that responsible critics have made many times. By and large, they make sense - and they don't stand a chance of being adopted.
Knowing that Washington politicians would sooner take poison than accept these unpopular suggestions, one Japanese authority called the list ''a bunch of very crazy ideas.'' But, he went on, ''as long as you gave us your crazy ideas, we thought we would give you a few of ours.''
Indeed, the U.S.'s own list of what's wrong with Japan spells out two hundred forty things that Washington says need fixing. It suggests that Japan raise public spending to 10 percent of its gross national product, from the current 6 percent. It calls for repeal of a law that protects shopkeepers by making it hard to open department stores. Another suggestion, smacking of fantasy, proposes that Japan's giant conglomerates make public the minutes of their monthly meetings.
Washington's 240 ideas for Japan are no less valid than Tokyo's 80 for America, and no more likely to be swallowed whole.

HEADLINE: Proposed New York State Budget Would Hurt Farm Families

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York State needs to corral state spending. The proposed $50 billion budget is 8 percent higher than last year's - twice the inflation rate. State spending has risen nearly 25 percent in just four years. 
Agriculture is New York's largest industry and could be a growth industry for the 1990's and beyond. However, the state's excessive tax burden is suffocating New York's $3 billion agricultural industry. New York's 39,000 family farmers work long, hard hours and are highly productive. However, their overall tax burden places them at a competitive disadvantage with farmers in other states and countries.
New York Farm Bureau, the state's largest farm advocacy organization, believes state spending must be put on ice. Spending should increase no faster than what current revenue rates can handle. In addition, we believe no new revenue sources should be created.
The proposed executive budget contains revenue-raising plans that can best be characterized as budgetary hocus-pocus. For example, transfering $230 million from the State Insurance Fund to the general fund ultimately contributes to higher worker compensation premiums for New York farmers and other business people. This money was paid by hard-working business people and is a reserve to protect them, not a budget-balancing mechanism.
Since 1986, special revenues, such as fees, have increased state spending dramatically. This shift of general fund programs to special revenue programs has increased about 150 percent, with a negative impact on agriculture.
The $1.9 billion proposed environmental bond is another revenue raiser that will hurt family farmers. The state holds a collective debt of about $49 billion. Adding another bond act will jeopardize future generations, farm and nonfarm alike.
New York family farmers own about nine million acres, some one-third of the state's total acreage, and pay more than $150 million in property taxes. A big share of the land taxes farmers pay goes toward school taxes.
Adjusting the school aid formula to reflect both enrollment and attendance will hurt rural school districts. Since New York farm families bear much of the school tax burden for rural areas, altering the formula will hurt those who produce our food. An excessive property tax burden for New York's food producers jeopardizes the state's biggest industry.
The Governor and the Legislature need to practice tougher fiscal management. New York State agriculture will remain competitive if spending is controlled and taxation inflation is stopped. New York State must not become a miniature version of the Federal quagmire. This state needs true economic growth, not budgetary expansion.

HEADLINE: Fire in the Bronx;
Bronx Social Club's Sublease: How a Firetrap Skirted the Line

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
A lease for the Bronx social club where 87 people died in an arson fire early Sunday shows that the building's landlord was aware that the club was to be used as ''a bar and game room.'' But responsibility for making sure the club complied with the law was left to the club's owner, Elias Colon, who was killed in the fire.
Court records also show that while the Happy Land Social Club's landlord tried to evict the club for nonpayment of rent, the landlord never informed Housing Court that it had been ordered closed for serious fire and and building code violations.
Legal experts said the landlord, Little Peach Realty, a large concern whose principals are Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffee, is unlikely to face any criminal liability.
 
Skirting the Rules
The role of the landlord in a property that is operated illegally was illustrated in a review of court records and city documents that show how Happy Land and dozens of other social clubs carefully skirt the limits of government regulations and the fine print of the real estate establishment. 
Alan Vogeler, a lawyer who represents Little Peach, which holds a 30-year lease on the property, said last night that Mr. Weiss had never been inside the social club and had not visited the property since April 1989 at the latest.
He said Mr. Jaffe regularly visited their properties to collect rent, but that to the best of his knowledge Mr. Jaffe had also never been inside. He said he had not been able to reach Mr. Jaffe to confirm this. Asked if either man ever knew of illegal activities in their property, Mr. Vogeler said, ''We're not making any statement on that.''
 
Open Despite Orders
Under the eyes of enforcement agents, who cited it time after time, the club was able to remain open, buy and sell liquor illegally, and apparently build an illegal second floor without any city approvals and without fire alarms, sprinklers or emergency exits.
At the same time, the club's owner obtained a lease that treated the club as if it were to be operated as a legal tavern, even though residents of the neighborhood knew it was an illegal social club.
The records and interviews with neighborhors and city officials provide the following picture of the club's operation:
* Despite a series of law enforcement actions, including the arrests of three men at the club on charges of selling liquor without a license on Sept. 11, 1988, the club remained in business.
* Seven months after the club was ordered shut by a team of inspectors in November 1988 for building and fire code violations, a police report showed that both the Fire Department and Building Department were notified that it was still in business.
* Although it appears to be a business that charged admission and was open to the public, Happy Land was incorporated in 1988 as a not-for-profit corporation for ''the purpose of providing for members entertainment, sport, recreation and amusement of all kinds.'' The incorporation papers, tax officials said, appeared to enable Mr. Colon to avoid filing state and city income tax forms.
The first official record of Happy Land, a bright red storefront on Southern Boulevard at East Tremont Avenue with a smiling ''happy face'' on its sign, is the seven-year lease between Mr. Colon and Little Peach in October, 1987.
Rafael Camacho, who is listed as an initial director of the Happy Land Social Club corporation, said that he was unaware that he was.
''It was without my consent,'' he said. ''At no time have I signed any papers or anything.'' He said he once put up some wallpaper at the club.
 
Nestled in a Strip
The club is nestled in a strip of 13 stores and medical offices purchased in 1985 by Alex DiLorenzo 3d, a real estate developer whose father was once one of the largest property owners in the city.
Mr. DiLorenzo, real estate officials said, has bought commercial property in good locations in low-income neighborhoods in the past few years. He paid $885,000 for the strip of stores in June 1985.
While these stores are not as profitable as stores in middle class locations, they provide a stream of customers with a steady source of income - public assistance - that is less subject to swings in the economy than middle-class salaries.
Within a few months, Mr. DiLorenzo leased the entire strip to Little Peach for 30 years. Mr. DiLorenzo and Mr. Weiss, whose wife is the actress Kathleen Turner, are in deals involving at least 16 properties in Manhattan, city records show.
 
Combined Two Storefronts
In September, 1987, Queens Apple Realty, an agent for One Peach Associates, an entity related to Little Peach Realty, leased the site to Mr. Colon for seven years.
Local storeowners said Little Peach combined two ten-foot-wide storefronts to accommodate Mr. Colon's club. One of them had once been used for a much smaller social club.
Under the terms of the lease, Mr. Colon's rent went from $1,500 a month the first year to $2,700 the seventh year, plus payments for insurance and taxes.
The lease specifies that the store was to be used as a ''bar and game room'' and specifies that ''the tenant shall not be permitted, under any circumstances to allow any person under the age of 21 years to enter.''
Many of the victims of the fire were less than 21 years old.
In the event that ''any governmental authority,'' complained about the club, the lease gave the landlord the right to evict the club, if it could not quickly correct the problem.
The arrests for illegal liquor sales were made in September, 1988.
Two months later, on Nov. 21, the building was ordered closed for ''imminent danger to safety and life of the occupants.'' The order said the building had no second exit, no fire alarm or sprinkler system, and no emergency lighting.
In May 1989, the landlord sought to evict Mr. Colon because he owed more than $3,000 in back payments. At no time was the question of an emergency vacate order or serious health or safety violations raised.
 
DiLorenzo Told of Violations
A landlord would not normally have been informed of the arrests, city officials said.
The New York City Building Commisioner, Charles D. Smith Jr., said yesterday that notice of the violations was sent to Mr. DiLorenzo, who was on the city's records as the owner of the property. Real estate operators say the building owner would typically pass such notices along to the next leaseholder, who would take them up with the tenant.
Mr. Weiss's attorneys said they never received a formal notice of the violations, but would not say whether they knew about them.
Carlos Negron, the owner of Neighborhood Video, around the corner from the social club, said that last May, at a time when the club was supposed to have been closed, he paid $500 to hold a party at the club.
During the party, he said, the second floor shook and partly fell.
He said Mr. Colon subsequently replaced the entire second floor, redid the dance floor and put in new lights.
No second floor for that building seems to appear on the certificate of occupancy for the strip.
But the owners of the club may never bear liability for the deaths. To prove criminal liability, state legal officials said, a prosecutor would have to show that a landlord knew firsthand about illegal conditions and either helped create them or deliberately allowed them to continue.
Civil liability is easier to show, they said. A jury in a negligence lawsuit might find, for example, that a landlord had reason to know of dangerous conditions and failed to act.
New details also surfaced yesterday showing how the efforts of a city task force to shut down dangerous social clubs faltered.
The Sept. 11, 1988 arrests for illegal liquor sales were the fourth time the task force took action against the club.
On Nov. 21, the building was ordered closed because it was unsafe.
On July 24 1989, seven months after the club was ordered shut, a bartender was arrested by a police officer of the Public Morals Division on charges of selling liquor without a license.
The police report, which was sent to the Fire Buildings Departments, noted that the club was operating in violation of the earlier vacate order.
 
Opened Only for Parties
Yet no further action appears to have been taken. The club was inspected again on Nov 1, 1989, a weekday, and police found it closed. But neighborhood residents said it often closed, or open only for private parties.
Mr. Smith, the Building Commissioner, said that his department responded at all hours to reports of building emergencies, but not to complaints about social clubs.
He said building inspectors only went to social clubs as part of the Koch administration-era task force administered by the Police Department, because inspectors feared for their safety.
The bartender arrested last July, Santos Batiz, a 48-year-old buildling superintendent, said yesterday that he had not been a regular employee and was helping out during a celebration following a soccer game.
''The owner told me one time he was going to get a license,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fire in the Bronx;
Hondurans Lack Place to Grieve Over Fire

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Honduran authorities were told yesterday that more than 60 of the 87 people killed by the fire in a cramped Bronx social club were their countrymen, and in Tegucigalpa the President declared a day of national mourning.
But for the tens of thousands of Hondurans who live in New York, there was no suitable place to share their grief.
Unlike more established groups in the city like Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, hundreds of thousands of Colombians or even the relatively few Argentines, the Hondurans have established no landmarks of their presence - no bars, no prominent Honduran restaurants, no predominantly Honduran churches.
Over the years, they have often gathered in small civic groups, but those have tended to dissolve more quickly and easily than they have formed. Amid the bands and dancers and floats of different countries at last year's Columbus Day parade the Honduran representatives were a flag-bearer and four older men who walked alongside. 
Young Honduran men were something of an exception: they came together every Sunday, in soccer clubs that bear the names of towns and favorite teams from their homeland's especially poor Caribbean coast.
Last year, the Happy Land Social Club sponsored one of the teams, and Honduran players from around the league based at Van Cortland Park in the Bronx lavished the club with business. It became their place, the players said, and the salsa, merengue and calypso music played to their tastes.
When leaders of the teams met last night to plan some sort of memorial for the at least 17 players who were killed in the fire, they had to borrow a room from the Cuban Interamerican Club.
''There are many of us, but we are all scattered,'' said Juan Ramon Cisneros, a Honduran journalist who came to the United States 20 years ago from San Pedro Sula, the country's second city. ''And a lot of us get together in each others' houses because there's no place that's decent.''
Like many older Honduran immigrants, Mr. Cisneros said he did not consider the Happy Land a place for ''good people.'' The younger generations, both young and more newly arrived, strongly disagreed.
''It was a very pleasant place,'' said a 23-year-old Honduran man who identified himself only as Mario, and he told detectives he had left the club on Sunday morning not long before the fire started. ''Maybe somebody might punch somebody else, but it would start and end right there.''
What generally kept the Happy Land under control, many of its patrons insisted, was the fact that it tended to fill each weekend with natives of the same stretches of the same impoverished country.
They have come since the turn of the century, when the well-to-do arrived on business with the American banana companies that dominated their republic, and the more desperate sought a share of the wealth that seemed so much more abundant here.
In the last decade their flow has quickened, as mismanagement, corruption and the neighboring wars of Nicaragua and El Salvador have drained the Honduran economy more quickly than $1.1 billion in United States economic aid could shore it up.
Salvador Rodezno, minister-counselor of the Honduran Embassy in Washington, said he believed that about 50,000 Hondurans of varying immigration status now live in the greater New York area. A spokeswoman for the city's Planning Commission, Martha Ritter, said about 25,000 Hondurans believed to reside legally in the city, most in the East New York section of Brooklyn and the Bronx.
''More than anything, they have come looking for a better life, better standards of living, a better education,'' said Arturo Flores, a former president of the Honduras-New York Society, one of the civic associations that have come and gone.
Almost since its independence in 1838, Honduras has been the hardest spot on a hard-luck isthmus. While tiny El Salvador to the south and Nicaragua to the southeast grew more valuable coffee and cotton, Honduras grew bananas. And it exported them at the prices that all-powerful American fruit companies cared to pay.
 
Struggling Economy
When Honduras has been able to afford finer things, it has generally had to import them, to what its few artists and intellectuals complain has been the detriment of an already meager national culture.
Honduras still jostles Haiti and Bolivia to avoid distinction as the hemisphere's poorest nation. But in a region that has always struggled under the weight of American commercial culture, Tegucigalpa has perhaps the highest distribution of Dunkin' Donuts shops per capita in Central America.
The Happy Land, its patrons said, was like many of the attractions that draw young Hondurans here. It might not have seemed like much to those better off or to those who have been in the United States longer. Still, most of the young Honduran patrons said that by the standards of the crumbling brick nightclubs that dot the north coast of Honduras, where they came from, it was quite a place.
Occasionally, the club's owners would get a few cases of Nacional or Salvavida, two of Honduras's four brands of beer. But most of its Hondurans visitors were happy to drink Budweiser and Heineken, several regular patrons said.
 
'He Grabbed Life Here Too Fast'
Jose Diaz, a 29-year-old Bronx factory worker whose father grows bananas near the small northern town of Potrerillo, said that he had tried on Saturday night to convince his nephew, Jose Alexis Diaz, 19, that the Happy Land was not only not so great, it was probably dangerous.
''He grabbed life here too fast,'' the uncle said. ''In Honduras he didn't make enough money to do all these things you do here.''
Standing nearby, outside a schoolhouse adopted by the American Red Cross as a disaster relief headquarters, the Honduran Consul, Norma Mejia, was telling reporters that the newly inaugurated Honduran President, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, on Monday declared a day of national mourning. With some help from donors, she was saying, Honduras would fly the bodies of its dead home for burial.
From the crowd around her, the unsteady hand of an older man thrust forward a $10 bill.
''Diez pesos de un puertorriqueno,'' Jose Suco, 66, told the aristocratic-looking diplomat, meaning ''Ten bucks from a Puerto Rican.''
Then Mr. Suco walked away, as quickly as he could, it seemed. An onlooker stopped him as he approached his car and asked about the donation.
''I live on a pension and Social Security,'' he said. ''But for these things there is always enough. And God always pays you back.''

HEADLINE: Job Hoppers Take Losses On Housing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONVENT STATION, N.J.

 BODY:
Just as housing prices here rose in step with the metropolitan region's economy through the mid-1980's, they are stumbling now that the economy has slowed and businesses are trimming back.
As long as the economy remains in a slump, housing experts say, demand will remain comparatively soft, keeping a lid on prices. Lower mortgage interest rates might help, but not much. In the meantime, they say, home sellers will be hurt the most, particularly corporate employees whose relocations here, a wealthy suburban neighborhood near Morristown, in the last decade helped drive up the prices. 
Housing and the economy have always been related, but experts say the 1980's were extraordinary. When the economy in the metropolitan region was churning out new jobs at rates much higher than the long-term average, so many more people with so much more money were chasing after homes that prices rose at a startling 2 to 3 percent a month.
But now that fewer jobs are being created, demand has slackened throughout the region and brokers say prices have flattened or, in some instances, dropped as much as 30 percent.
 
On the Market Longer
While that may be good news for potential buyers, a lack of optimism that values will rise soon prompts them to keep their price ranges conservative. Houses stay on the market months longer than before, and inventories of unsold homes have swelled.
''The scale and growth of jobs after the 1981-1982 recession, and the scale of corporate in-migration of employees, essentially drove the surge in housing prices,'' said James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University who has studied the region's housing prices.
''They were extremely powerful forces in the housing market because they tended to erode any market discipline,'' he said.
Now, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, ''Economic growth is the vital missing ingredient in these areas. The absence of growth is enough to create a shakeout in the real-estate market.''
Besides the connection between job growth and house prices, there is a belief among some in the industry that corporate relocations were at the leading edge of the price strides of the 1980's. In real estate, as in horse racing, they say, the pace is set by the leaders.
Real-estate brokers throughout the region have concluded that transferred executives are the most motivated of buyers: They shop with substantial benefits from their corporate employers, who are eager to satisfy prized workers and get them back behind their desks as quickly as possible.
When there were many new jobs but few available houses in the mid-1980's, transferees paid top dollar for the house of their dreams. That tended to pump up the price of housing because one high-priced sale became the comparable basis for others in the same neighborhood.
''Then the sky was the limit,'' said Marion J. Beatty, corporate relocation coordinator with Weichert Relocation Company in Morristown. ''Relocating buyers would do the maximum; they would buy more house, go to the higher price range. It was a gangbuster market.''
 
Paying for Generosity
But analysts say the corporations may have shot themselves in the foot by being so generous. Prices soared so high that recent surveys show that employees do not want to come into the region, citing housing costs.
Anyone trying to sell a house in today's market feels pinched, but some of those hurting the most are the same workers who were transferred here at the peak of the market.
In 1982 David J. Romeiko was transferred from BellSouth in Atlanta to A.T.&T. in New Jersey and bought a house in Morristown for $152,000. When he decided to move to a condominium in 1988, he sold the house for $350,000.
In February 1988 Mr. Romeiko, who is now 42 years old, bought a three-bedroom town house in the Liberty Greens complex in Convent Station for $224,000. Six months later a similar home in the same complex sold for $259,000.
 
Loss on Condominium
Late last year Mr. Romeiko learned he was being transferred back to Atlanta. He listed his condominium at $229,000, $5,000 more than he had paid.
After a month, not a single offer had come in. He has reduced the price to $205,000 but is not optimistic. He said he may take the price the company offers, which, based on independent appraisals, will be less than $205,000.
''I hate to think I lost $60,000, but if you look at the potential, that was probably the case,'' Mr. Romeiko said.
Geoffrey A. Gardner of Glen Rock, N.J., also will be hurt. Mr. Gardner, an engineering manager in the marine and power division of the Alfa Laval Company in Fort Lee, N.J., relocated to New Jersey in 1981. Now he is being transferred to Warminster, Pa. He thought he could sell his four-bedroom colonial for about $350,000, but his real-estate agent convinced him it would not sell for more than $299,000, the price at which it is now listed.
 
'You Just Don't Have Control'
''Our house was worth more a couple of years ago, I'm sure,'' said Mr. Gardner, who is 40. ''You just don't have control over these things.''
Some of the larger relocation companies in the metropolitan region report that the number of transferees coming in has dropped by 30 percent since the mid-1980's. PHH Homequity of Wilton, Conn., fell 26 percent, to 903 last year from 1,225 in 1985. RELO, the International Relocation Network, which covers 1,400 real-estate companies across the country, showed decreases of 21 percent in New Jersey, 30 percent in New York and 37 percent in Connecticut from 1985 to 1989.
However, some smaller companies have increased their relocation business. William Pitt Real Estate Limited Partnership in Stamford, Conn., showed a 30 percent increase in incoming business from 1986 to 1989. The Julia B. Fee Real Estate Company in Scarsdale has grown by about half in the same period.
It is impossible to tell which set more accurately represents the current picture because there are no figures available on the number of job relocations throughout the region.
 
A.T.&T. Still Relocates Many
Corporations generally are reluctant to discuss personnel matters. But based on the experience of one of the largest private employers in the region, A.T.&T., relocations continue no matter what the state of the economy might be.
Relocation figures from A.T.&T. in New Jersey, where the corporation has 51,500 employees, show that in 1987 1,416 employees were brought into the state. Last year the total was almost the same, 1,366. So far in 1990, 970 relocations have been undertaken.
''The needs of business more than anything else dictate any moves,'' said Lynn M. Newman, a spokeswoman for A.T.&T.

HEADLINE: New York's Budget Squeeze;
Ratings Given by Agencies to Shape Interest Rates for Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When rating agencies assess state and local governments with a letter grade, they are doing more than just issuing an opinion. They are shaping the interest rates governments will pay for years, even decades into the future.
In the case of New York State, which seemed to shun repeated warnings by executives at Standard & Poor's Corporation to bring its budget closer to balance, the rating reduction announced Monday by Standard & Poor's is certain to result in higher interest payments for state bonds and the myriad of state agencies that sell bonds with state backing. 
Higher interest rates on bonds the state sells to pay for long-term projects such as roads, office buildings and environmental projects mean there will be less money available for day-to-day expenses like workers' salaries or education aid payments to hundreds of school districts around the state.
 
Rates Still Rising
Exactly how much interest payments will increase is not known. But early reports from traders on Wall Street are that interest rates for state bonds are still rising after substantial increases earlier this year when the state's budget problems became apparent.
In the first full day of trading after Standard & Poor's cut the state rating to A from AA-, yields on long-term bonds have increased about five-hundredths to seven-hundredths of a percentage point, and prices fell about $6 per $1,000 bond. For state agency bonds, prices fell roughly $7.50. One typical long-term issue, the 7.2 percent issue due in 2020, was offered to small individual investors yesterday at $994.50 per $1,000 bond to yield about 7.25 percent, down from about $1,000 a day earlier.
For 10-year state bonds, yields of 7.10 percent were barely lower than the 7.31 percent yield for a widely watched index of 20 municipal bonds compiled by The Bond Buyer, a trade publication. In June 1988, 10-year state bonds were 6.70 percent, compared with 7.73 percent for the Bond Buyer Index.
 
Significance Assessed
James F. Lynch, president of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter, said, ''The rating cut is more significant for the state agencies whose ratings fell to the triple-B category than for the state.'' He noted that many municipal bond funds do not invest in bonds rated in the triple-B category but do buy bonds in the slightly higher-quality single-A category. State agency bonds typically carry slightly lower ratings than the state's.
Mr. Lynch said yields of 10-year state bonds have risen in the last year by about 35-hundredths of a percentage point relative to 10-year bonds of top-rated states with triple-A ratings. Assuming New York State sells $500 million of bonds this year with an average life of about 10 years, the extra 35-hundredths of a percentage point would raise its interest payments by about $17.5 million over the life of the bonds. But the cost is likely to be far higher because other state agencies will also be paying higher interest rates.
So far, the additional expense of higher interest rates does not loom large in the $51 billion state budget proposed for the coming year.
Assuming that the state and its tax-supported agencies sell $6.6 billion of bonds over the next four years as planned, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said, an increase of 20-hundredths of a percentage point in the state's borrowing costs would increase the interest payments by $180 million over the 25-year life of the bonds.

HEADLINE: New York's Budget Squeeze;
Bond Rating: A Censure of Bickering

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 27

 BODY:
More than just an indictment of the state's finances, the lowering of New York's credit rating on Monday was a censure of its political process.
Two years of procrastination and bickering in Albany, financial analysts say, have allowed what were once manageable problems to approach a fiscal crisis.
Over the last few weeks, when the need to stem the crisis was becoming increasingly clear, instead of coming up with a concerted plan, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders reacted with partial solutions and partisan debate.
''What the rating agencies look at is: Is there a rational plan to deal with the problem and is there a mood within the executive and the legislature to solve it?'' Gerald H. Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said. Among New York lawmakers, he said, ''there doesn't seem to be any willingness to deal with things.'' 
 
Lowered by Two Notches
On Monday, one of the nation's two leading credit-rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, signaled that it had effectively given up hope on state leaders' ability to produce a sound financial plan. The agency lowered New York's long-term bond rating two notches even as budget negotiations for the fiscal year that starts on Sunday were still in progress.
The new rating, an A, is the lowest in the state's history.
In a statement explaining the rating, analysts at Standard & Poor's said they were distressed by the state's recurring deficits and the failure of state leaders to agree even on the size of the problem. The analysts cited the ''absence of a credible plan'' to address the problem as another reason for the downgrading.
Hyman Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, said Governor Cuomo had called him after the new rating was announced and accused him of changing the rating in response to newspaper editorials.
''I said, 'You told us last year you would fix things, and you did not,' '' Mr. Grossman said. ''The problem's just gotten worse.''
 
An Operating Deficit
New York's current financial fix had its beginnings in 1988, when a month after a new state budget had been approved, Mr. Cuomo announced that tax collections were falling hundreds of millions of dollars short of expectations. The Governor lowered his revenue estimates twice more that year, and the state ended the fiscal year with a $1.1 billion operating deficit.
At that time, Cuomo administration officials attributed the shortfall to changes in the Federal tax code, which, they said, had produced an unexpectedly sharp drop in tax revenues from capital gains.
But in 1989 the pattern began all over again. The administration lowered its revenue estimates every few months, this time linking the problem to an unexpected downturn in the economy. The Governor proposed a plan for making up only a small part of the revenue shortfall through spending cuts, and the state is expected to end the 1989-90 fiscal year, which closes March 31, with an operating deficit of at least $600 million.
The state's accumulated deficit, which it rolls over from year to year, is expected to grow to $5 billion, a rise of 50 percent over the last three years.
Even as the state was running up larger and larger deficits over the last three years, the Republicans who control the State Senate were accusing Governor Cuomo of exaggerating New York's fiscal problems. They loudly condemned his proposals to raise new tax revenues (although they voted for many of them) and they seemed almost to relish the state's troubles as a way to embarrass Mr. Cuomo.
In January of this year, when Mr. Cuomo proposed his budget for the fiscal year that starts Sunday, financial analysts were already skeptical about Albany's capacity to put aside partisan differences and impose fiscal balance. The events since then, as Monday's lowering of the credit rating shows, has only reinforced that skepticism.
By February, Mr. Cuomo's proposed $51 billion spending plan had developed a hole, which was the result, administration officials said, of yet another unexpected drop in tax collections. But many financial analysts, including Mr. Grossman of Standard & Poor's, say they believe the Governor's proposed budget never was really balanced.
''We said back in January the revenue projections were too optimistic,'' Mr. Grossman said. By mid-March, the hole in the Governor's budget had grown by most estimates to $1.5 billion. Mr. Cuomo never presented a detailed plan to close the gap, saying it would be easier to move the recalcitrant Senate Republicans by negotiating the plan in private.
That tactic, however, met with only limited success. Until early this morning, the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, refused even to acknowledge the size of the budget gap. And now that he has agreed on the size of the gap, he is still reluctant to discuss the new taxes that both the Governor and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, say will be needed to close the hole.
As the Governor and legislative leaders continue to wrangle, the state's April 1 budget deadline is drawing nearer. Despite repeated assurances from Mr. Cuomo and the legislators, it now appears that a new budget will not be approved in time.
''My assumption is that Standard & Poor's watched patiently for the state to put its fiscal house in order,'' said Cindy Green, a senior analyst at the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. ''And while the state leaders said they would put the house in order, they did not, and their doing so is not in sight.''

HEADLINE: Fire in the Bronx;
Unlawful Clubs Posing Hazards In Other Cities

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 27

 BODY:
From seedy speakeasies called ''blind pigs'' in Detroit to chic underground clubs in Los Angeles, unlicensed nightclubs pop up in cities around the country, local officials say.
Interviews with fire officials across the nation after the fire that killed 87 people at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx on Sunday indicate that the problem probably is worse in New York than in other cities. Outside of New York there are more possibilities for informal social gatherings in homes or backyards.
Officials in some cities say their enforcement is vigorous enough so they do not have a problem with illegal clubs. But others say that, especially for the poor, there is always some incentive to bypass the letter of the law and the safety standards that go with it. 
 
Activity Hard to Gauge
''In any large city with a culturally diverse population that includes many immigrants, you will have an illegal club problem,'' said Garry Briese, executive director of the International Association of Fire Chiefs.
By definition, the extent of illegal club activity is impossible to gauge. Some communities that would seem vulnerable, like Miami and Houston, say they are not aware of any problems.
''I don't think it's a problem here,'' said Robert Crossman, deputy fire marshal for the City of Miami, where there was only one fatal fire in the entire city last year. ''One difference between here and New York is that people have backyards, they have more options for socializing than up there, where people have to do something inside.''
But in other cities officials admit informal clubs are a part of life.
In Chicago's predominantly Puerto Rican Humboldt Park community, there are more than 50 social clubs, of which nearly half operate without liquor licenses, said Alderman Luis Gutierrez. Most are in ground-floor storefronts of apartment buildings and have a small bar, a band and room for socializing and games, like dominoes.
 
Safety a Standard Concern
''We should check them out for fire safety,'' Mr. Gutierrez said. ''The exits on these places don't conform to regulations, and in most places in this neighborhood, there are a lot of bars on the doors and back gates.''
But he added that he did not see the potential for a disaster like the one in New York. ''There is no establishment where 150 people go,'' he said.
In Detroit, officials say they wage an unrelenting battle to contain small, unlicensed drinking spots known as blind pigs.
''We constantly close down those type of facilities as often as they open,'' said Christopher Buck, a spokesman for the Detroit police. ''Sometimes that proves to be fruitless, because there are more of them than their are of us.''
In Los Angeles the illegal club business flourishes at the upper end of the economic spectrum. Promoters complain that tough occupancy standards and regulations have led some people to operate clubs illegally in warehouses or vacant buildings.
 
'I Needed the Money'
''I myself have always been very concerned with the number of exits in a space we plan to use for a club,'' said Keith Merryman, a 25-year-old entrepreneur who has organized and managed unlicensed spots, commonly known as underground clubs, in Los Angeles. ''But there are clubs I've worked that I know are potential fire hazards, but I needed the money, so I worked regardless. The fire in New York definitely has stimulated some thought.''
The fire in New York has prompted some responses in other communities. In Miami, Mr. Crossman said officials planned to increase random inspections at nightclubs instead of just responding to complaints. In Chicago, Mayor Richard M. Dailey said he planned to intensify the pace of inspections and begin inspections on weekends, when many of the clubs are open.
Still, the National Fire Protection Association says only a small portion of the fire deaths annually in the United States occur in clubs.

HEADLINE: Using Self-Esteem To Fix Society's Ills

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IT is being called a vaccine against drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy, welfare dependency and other social ills. But some experts are calling it little more than yet another ''feel good'' approach to life's travails.
At issue is the age-old concept of self-esteem, defined by the Second College Edition of Webster's New World Dictionary as ''belief or pride in oneself.'' But the California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility reported recently that there's a lot more to it than that.
Make people feel better about themselves and the whole nation will benefit: that is the message of the task force, a 25-member commission of unpaid volunteers formed in 1986 to explore self-esteem among Californians. Employees will then become more productive, teen-agers will be less destructive, crime will decrease and welfare recipients will move toward financial self-sufficiency. 
There are few scientific data to buttress this view, nor is there agreement on how self-esteem is nurtured, harmed or rehabilitated. Skeptics are also concerned that the emphasis on self-esteem glosses over deep social problems and the necessity for more complex solutions. Nonetheless, the self-esteem movement is taking hold across the country.
Hundreds of school districts have added self-esteem motivational materials to their curriculums. American employers have turned increasingly to consultants who say they can raise employees' morale and work performance through self-esteem techniques. New companies have formed, devoted to teaching on self-esteem themes, and hundreds of books on self-esteem and self-enhancement have been published.
At a recent daylong self-esteem seminar in Sacramento run by Jack Canfield, a former schoolteacher and the founder of Self-Esteem Seminars in Los Angeles, 30 teachers were led through a series of motivational exercises that began with the students massaging their classmates' shoulders, to relax the group and create a bond.
Then, in small groups, they did ''E.R.O.'' exercises: they made up events (E), demonstrated their responses (R) and explained the outcomes (O) that would arise from their responses. They were also encouraged to recall successes in their lives dating from childhood or to describe the highlights of their lives in five minutes. The teachers attending the seminar use the techniques with their own students.
''It's pretty intense,'' said Mr. Canfield. Each seminar runs about seven hours and includes video and audiotapes as well as kinesthetics. ''All of these exercises are the foundations of raising self-esteem and building strength.'' In addition to California, 10 states are considering establishing self-esteem task forces.
''It's been a remarkable shift in this movement since I first got involved in 1984,'' said John Vasconcellos, the California Assemblyman who sponsored the bill to establish the task force. He attributed the growing interest to widespread frustration. ''People are exasperated,'' he said. ''Nothing else has worked, so they're willing to listen to new proposals.''
The things done in the name of self-esteem can take many forms:
* Students in social studies and English in San Antonio are being graded not only on subject matter, but also honesty, truthfulness, kindness, courage and conviction.
* Recovering alcoholics and drug users in Philadelphia are practicing breathing techniques said to ease stress, depression and anxiety, which can badly damage self-esteem.
* Welfare mothers in Cumberland County in New Jersey are consulting I.A.L.A.C. flashcards (the acronym stands for I Am Lovable and Capable). The cards were developed by Mr. Canfield.
* Selected prisoners in California are mapping out productive incarcerations with ''facilitators'' and videotaped lectures on goals.
In his self-esteem course at Apollo High School in Simi Valley, Calif., Geoff Schofield was taught such maxims as, ''It doesn't matter what you do, but who you are.''
''It helped me a great deal,'' said Mr. Schofield, who is 21 years old now and is an apprentice plumber. He is not upset that his friends are swapping campus-life stories while he is fixing sinks. ''I'm learning a skill and I'm earning money,'' he said.
But many researchers and social scientists say self-esteem is being oversold. ''There is among academics a lack of consensus about how to define it and how to measure it,'' said Martin Ford, an associate professor of education at Stanford University who has done extensive research on self-esteem and confidence. ''Therefore, it's difficult to make strong statements about techniques or interventions to enhance self-esteem.''
Most skeptics say the principles of self-esteem can do no harm, but they add that they worry that supporters are promoting it at the expense of other social goals.
''We certainly are for self-esteem; it's a good thing for kids, particularly, to have confidence in themselves,'' said Gary Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council in Washington and a leading voice for conservative family values. ''We do feel, however, that there are a lot of odd things going on out there in the name of self-esteem. And in some cases, self-esteem degenerates into just another form of almost selfishness.''
Roger Wilkins, a professor of American history and culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., expressed another concern: ''For those born into or living in situations where there is no stability, or where the only successful people are criminals, self-esteem isn't going to do it for them.''
There is also a sense that the haste with which the idea is taking hold has spawned a gold-rush atmosphere in which people with dubious credentials - former convicts, say, or fashion models - are hanging out shingles as self-esteem specialists.
''It's not necessarily bad,'' said Dr. Ford of Stanford, who is a developmental and educational psychologist. ''The more nurturing and helpful people you have in life the better.
''But often those who do the best self-esteem promotion in this society are not those with specialized credentials, but those who are caring, concerned and competent parents, teachers and employers of society.''
Another concern is that self-esteem programs are papering over the friction that occurs in an increasingly diverse population with conflicting views, and even infringing on personal liberties.
When several California companies tried three years ago to motivate employees through meditation, self-hypnosis, inducements to trancelike states or instructions to visualize certain events, they were met with union resistance and threatened with lawsuits from employees who said the techniques were alien to their religious views.
''The new-age philosophy may have been contrary to an employee's own religious views or personal philosophies,'' said Curtis E. Plott, the executive vice president of the Society for Training and Development, an association of training professionals in Alexandria, Va. ''Employers are discovering, however, that self-esteem training that assists employees in recognizing their skills, dealing with their own limitations and understanding their emotional abilities to cope with stress, change and criticism is necessary because they are hiring from a limited professional labor pool, women, minorities and new immigrants, who may need help in enhancing their self-esteem.''
A survey of 200 companies among the Fortune 500 that was conducted last year by Mr. Plott's organization found that 42 were offering self-esteem training.
Black Americans, who many sociologists and psychologists say are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem because of racism, give self-esteem programs mixed reviews.
''I'm all for self-esteem,'' said Charles Joyner, 22, a student at Fordham University. Mr. Joyner, who is black, has written a paper on self-esteem among black men.
''But I'm concerned that some of the self-esteemers are imposing mainstream American values on our kids without stressing the African culture. So you end up with kids who don't think they are worth anything, unless they have a fancy car or gold jewelry.''
Some analysts connect the quest for self-esteem with economic and social trends that have seemed to make life in the United States both harsher and more materialistic.
''The materialism of the 1980's stemmed from a terrible vacuum of identity,'' said Laurence Shames, the author of ''The Hunger for More: Searching for Values in an Age of Greed'' (Times Books, 1989). ''Possessions can't provide meaning, a sense of identity,'' he said. ''And they certainly can't provide a solid base for self-esteem.''
Self-esteem grabbed headlines in 1986, when the California task force was alloted $735,000 in state money. At the time, many people dismissed it as a California fad. Garry Trudeau lampooned the group in his ''Doonesbury'' comic strip.
The concept, however, had played an important social role years before. In the Brown v. Board of Education case, which struck down segregation in public schools in 1954, the Supreme Court cited the ''dolls tests'' conducted by Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the black sociologist and psychologist.
In the tests, young black children were shown both black and white dolls and asked which they preferred. A majority chose the white dolls. In its opinion, the Court said the children had ''definitely been harmed in the development of their personalities.''
For scholars, the self-esteem movement has roots that reach back more than a century. Dr. Donald Meyer, a professor of American history at Wesleyan University, traced the tradition of positive thinking to a period of psychological malaise after the Civil War and found its seeds in American Protestantism. Among the figures he included in his book ''The Positive Thinkers'' (Pantheon, 1965) are Mary Baker Eddy, Dale Carnegie and the Rev. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale.
Today, some self-esteem exercises seem to echo the drills, complete with yoga techniques, prescribed in the ''success'' handbooks popular just after the turn of the century. In 1922, Dr. Emile Coue began national fads in England and the United States with his motto ''Day by day, in every way I get better and better.'' His work regained popularity in 1961, at the dawn of the current ''human potential'' movement. But for many the self-esteem concept remains a riddle. Were ninth graders at Grant Union High School in Sacramento, Calif., reading at a fifth-grade level because they had low self-esteem, or were their reading problems contributing to their poor self-image?
''I don't know the answer,'' said Richard Owen, the principal at Grant Union. ''But don't just say, 'They don't like themselves,' and that's it. Teach them how to read and write properly, and they'll feel better about themselves.''

Winter Strawberry: Its Life and Its King

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

DATELINE: PLANT CITY, Fla.

 BODY:
PLANT CITY calls itself the ''Winter Strawberry Capital of the World,'' and Robert E. (Roy) Parke is its undisputed king.
Of the 5,000 acres of strawberries under cultivation in this town 15 miles east of Tampa, 250 belong to Mr. Parke. For the last 25 years, his strawberries have been the Grand Champion of the Florida Strawberry Festival, held in Plant City during the first two weeks of March. Even his competitors say the 69-year-old grower knows everything there is to know about the strawberries that brighten winter produce counters across the United States and in Europe. 
Mr. Parke has built a life of winter berries. He has studied and cultivated enough strawberries to know how to grow the size, shape color and taste that please him and thrill ''the housewife up north.'' Along the way his erudition became the strawberry esthetic by which he lives.
His prizes are different from the thimble-sized, purple-red strawberries that grow wild during the summer in the north. The wild summer berries return year after year, even if untended, producing successively smaller and more intensely flavored fruit. The strawberries from Mr. Parke's Parkesdale Farms are generally closer in size to a golf ball and are scarlet. ''You want something smaller than a baseball and bigger than a pea,'' Mr. Parke said.
He also wants a high yield, so he sets new seedlings every fall and relies primarily on three varieties. Selva, which ripens before Christmas, is tart and has very little in common with its wild cousins. Pajaro, a slightly sweeter berry, begins to ripen in January. The Osso Grande variety that Mr. Parke describes as ''the sweetest berry we know, the Cadillac of your winter berry,'' begins to ripen in December, is at its peak now and will remain in grocery stores until mid-April, when the California crop begins to appear.
The three varieties look alike: fat, red and beautiful. But berry to berry, they seldom taste the same. Their flavor ranges from bitter to jam-sweet. In texture, they can be as taut as well-developed biceps, or as tender as a sunburned cheek. As soon as a connoisseur pledges never again to fall for the chubby red charms of a winter strawberry, when he swears that he cannot bear the betrayal of their ungiving flesh or punishingly tart taste, he will happen upon another in the same pint that is soft and sweet. This sends him off in frenzied pursuit of just one more plump, sweet promise of summer.
The lure of blue skies on a gray day makes lucrative business. Between October and April of last year ''strawberries pumped $162 million into Florida's economy,'' said Mr. Parke, who is a member of the Florida Strawberry Growers Association and was the first inductee into that organization's Hall of Fame. Although he has been the leading exporter of the berries since 1956, the one who first successfully air-freighted winter strawberries to Europe and followed that with regular shipments to New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, Mr. Parke is still confounded by the variation in their flavor. There are, of course, subtle differences among the three varieties. The sugar content of each berry rises and falls with the temperature of the nights and the burn of the Florida sun.
The sugar that ripens and sweetens a berry can also be its demise, Mr. Parke said. A very sweet berry rots faster and, he said, ''won't ship, won't keep.'' Mr. Parke and his wife, Helen, two sons Bobby and Gary and three daughters Cheryl Meeks, Sandee Sytsma and Colleen Fulton do their best bringing up the mercurial berry.
''You have to be a tough breed of cat to be a good strawberry grower in Florida,'' he said. Because the Plant City terrain is so flat, the rows of strawberries are raised to promote drainage and wrapped in black plastic to keep moisture and fertilizers in the sandy soil. Stretching for acres and acres from his ranch-style house, Mr. Parke's fields look like wide-wale corduroy. A sprinkling system helps protect against freezes. The handpicked berries are packed and weighed in mobile sheds which are immediately driven to a packing station, parked in a garage-sized cooling chamber, and cooled to 34 degrees.
''Slows down the sugar,'' Mr. Parke said. But it's no guarantee. ''Some'll be sweeter than others,'' he added. He claims there is no such thing as a perfect berry, even though every single one is ''a beautiful thing to see.''
He maintains a strawberry esthetic in most aspects of his life. He drives a red tractor, frequently wears a red shirt and green cap and has strawberries stenciled on the door of his white pickup truck. Tours of his home begin with the garage, where strawberry prizes and memorabilia and pictures of great moments in strawberry history are all on display.
Inside, every inch of the three-bedroom home is carpeted with thick, strawberry red carpet. There are strawberry pillows and cookie jars and ash trays, needlepoint pictures, place mats and pitchers and all of the wallpaper is strawberries. There is a walk-in closet full of Mrs. Parke's red clothes; her strawberry jewelry is arranged neatly on a dish in the bathroom. There, a few years back, Mr. Parke posed for a magazine photograph in his pink bathtub, covered with strawberries. He looked like the Frank Perdue of strawberries.
Yet his romance with the fruit has an abiding gratitude. Parkesdale Farms started as a 10-acre patch in 1956. Today, it is the largest family-run strawberry farm in the country, Mr. Parke said. He and his family also own Parkesdale Motel (''Gateway to Strawberry Country'') and Parkesdale Farm Market; both are on Route 92. People line up 10 hours a day for bowls of the Parke family's strawberry shortcake at the market.
No one complains about the wait. No one fusses about the difference in taste from berry to berry. Mashed with sugar, ladled on butter-rich cake and crowned with a rococo tower of whipped cream, the berries are part of an irresistible tableau.
Those who understand the nature of winter strawberries know better than to expect them to stand alone. The winning recipes at the festival use strawberries in a celery and yogurt soup; as a counterpoint to a spinach salad; in an omelet with cheese; steamed in pudding; layered in a black bottom pie, or as fondue.
Mr. Parke is intrigued by these uses of his berries. He imagines the dishes taste good: ''I breed for flavor before shipping and keeping,'' but he doesn't know for sure.
''I don't eat strawberries,'' he said with a hint of the Hindu's respect for the holy cow in his voice, as he led a visitor to his backyard to show off his strawberry-shaped swimming pool. ''The berry,'' he said, ''built it all.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Fed vs. Treasury On Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, at a conference in Tokyo, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Manuel H. Johnson, said he was ''not uncomfortable with the current level of exchange rates.'' Hidden in that off-the-cuff comment may be a growing rift between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department over the dollar.
Although Mr. Johnson's remarks seemed entirely consistent with those he had uttered in the past, this time the foreign exchange markets reacted by sending the dollar to three-year highs against the yen. Since then, the dollar has climbed even higher, although other factors, like the drop in the Tokyo stock market, have also had an effect. 
The most elementary reading of Mr. Johnson's remarks was that the Federal Reserve was content to hold interest rates firm and would refrain from intervening in the foreign exchange markets. But given the uncertainty in Japan's stock market, a non-interventionist policy would almost certainly drive the dollar higher against the yen, something the Treasury, which is concerned about exports, almost certainly does not want.
Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, found Mr. Johnson's comments so important that ''I devoted two issues of my newsletter to them.'' Normally, the Fed does not take a position on the value of the dollar. ''It does what it is told by the Treasury,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''But this remark signals a potential shift in the way the Fed sees itself.''
When the Plaza Hotel accords were negotiated in 1985 to bring down the value of the dollar and stimulate exports, it was the Treasury that worked out the agreement while the Fed sat silent. ''But now it is very explicit that the Fed has a view,'' Mr. Weinberg said.
Policy regarding the dollar is set by the Treasury but executed by the Federal Reserve when it buys or sells foreign currencies in the open market. By law, the Fed must follow the Treasury's instructions even if it disagrees with them. Changes in interest rates, which are the domain of the Federal Reserve, also affect the value of the dollar by making dollar-denominated financial investments more or less attractive to foreign investors. But changes in interest rates have much more of an effect on the domestic economy than operations in foreign exchange markets.
Francis Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also sensed tension between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury hidden in the Johnson remarks. He said that while the Treasury wanted a lower dollar, the Federal Reserve was more concerned about a lower dollar's effect on inflation. ''From the Fed's point of view, a falling dollar raises the prices of imports and adds to inflation,'' he said. ''This means the objectives of the Fed and the Treasury are now at odds with each other. That is why Manny Johnson's remarks are so significant.''
There are other reasons why the Fed is troubled by intervening in foreign exchange markets at the Treasury's behest: ''If the Treasury instructs the Federal Reserve to buy yen, it is the same as the Treasury telling the Fed to create money,'' Mr. Schott said. ''The Fed doesn't like this because it means the Treasury is instructing it to do something that may go against its own policy objectives.''
Conflict between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury may hinge on another element as well. ''I have yet to see a study that shows that sterilized intervention, the most common type of intervention used by the Fed in the foreign exchange markets, has any effect on the value of the dollar at all,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University and co-founder of the Shadow Open Market Committee, which monitors the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. ''But it costs the taxpayers money.''
The Federal Reserve, with holdings of foreign currencies worth only $20 billion, does not have the resources to move the foreign exchange markets, which can trade $500 billion in a single day. ''Of course Mr. Johnson knows this,'' Mr. Meltzer said. ''But the Treasury's position is that it doesn't care if its policy doesn't work. It is intervening in the markets for other reasons.''
Where will the conflict lead? While not every analyst sees the dispute widening, others are clearly worried. Mr. Schott of Equitable said: ''Manny Johnson may be saying that the Fed does not want to buy yen for the Treasury. If he is saying this, it could lead all the way to Congress before it is sorted out. The issue of who controls the dollar must be resolved.''

HEADLINE: Brazilian Loans Decline In International Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The price of Brazilian debt has fallen since the country's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, announced his tough economic program 12 days ago. But traders in the highly specialized market that deals with such debt say the decline is not a reflection of unhappiness with Mr. Collor's program.
Traders say the declines are a response to the provision in the Brazilian program that freezes more than $100 billion in bank accounts for 18 months, prohibiting various swaps and other kinds of transactions that had been supporting the price of the debt.
''It is more supply and demand than a judgment,'' said Paul A. Masco, a trader with Salomon Brothers in New York. 
''The demand for Brazilian paper is gone,'' added Manuel Mejia, a debt trader at Merrill Lynch.
 
Vulnerable Market
Another debt trader said the decline showed that this small $70 billion market was sometimes more vulnerable to temporary and technical forces than to significant changes in a country's domestic economic policy. It is not easily moved, like the foreign exchange market, by politics and promises.
These traders said the price of Brazilian debt could stay in a very narrow range for some time, perhaps $20 to $25 for each $100 of face value. Getting the price to rise again will require action that directly affects the foreign debt, like a renewal of interest payments by Brazil, they said.
Since the beginning of March, just before Mr. Collor's inauguration, Brazilian debt has fallen from 32.50 cents to the dollar to as low as 19.75 cents last week. Yesterday it was 23.75 cents for each dollar.
Before the freeze was announced there had been some activity in what are called swaps of debt for debt. In effect, the Brazilian central bank would buy existing debt from lenders at a discount and the lenders would use the money to make new loans.
 
'The Ultimate Buyer'
''The central bank was the ultimate buyer of the loans and was holding the price up,'' said a trader who asked not to be identified.
Both Mr. Masco and Mr. Mejia said the announcement last week that Brazil would not resume making interest payments on its debt did not have a big impact on the market because it was expected. Brazil stopped payments on its debt to banks last September. Its total debt is $114 billion, the largest in the developing world.
The fact that a renewal of interest payments and a renegotiation of Brazil's $65 billion in loans with commercial banks could be delayed into next year is helping keep the price down. Another negative is the widespread expectation that Brazil will insist that a large amount of the debt must be reduced in the negotiations.
The debt of two other large Latin American debtors - Mexico and Venezuela - is trading at a much higher level, with Venezuela at 39.75 cents yesterday and Mexico at $39.50 cents. This reflects, in part, the fact that each country has reached an agreement with its commercial bankers to reduce and reorganize its debt.
 
Creating a Demand
In addition, these countries hold out some promise of swaps of existing loans for shares of stock in domestic companies, and this prospect provides a demand for the loans in the secondary market.
''The real demand for the debt is not long-term investment or because an investor thinks Brazilian debt makes sense at 25 cents on the dollar,'' said Mr. Mejia of Merrill Lynch. ''The demand comes when the debt can be used in a project.''
The debt of Argentina, another troubled debtor, is priced even lower than Brazil's and has fallen since the hope of economic reform under the new President, Carlos Saul Menem, evaporated last fall.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Rapid Movement On Mexican Trade Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
The United States and Mexico are moving more rapidly than expected toward opening negotiations on a free-trade agreement, Administration officials said today.
The decision on starting such talks is likely to be announced in early June when Mexico's President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, visits President Bush in Washington, the Administration officials said.
Such a pact, similar to one already in place with Canada, could lead to a North American common market from the Arctic to the Yucatan, embracing 350 million people.
 
Acceleration of Schedules
An early June announcement would represent a sharp acceleration of earlier schedules for the elimination of Mexican-American trade barriers, an idea that has been discussed on the American side since the early 1980's. 
Deferring to Mexican political sensitivities about closer links with the giant to the north, Washington had not pressed for negotiations.
A statement issued by the Mexican Embassy today said a Mexican team was now ''analyzing possibilities'' to permit Mexican exports to ''reach the stable and growing U.S. market.''
''Once this analysis is concluded,'' it added, ''the governments of both nations will decide the best way to continue deepening their trade relationships.''
The statement followed a report in The Wall Street Journal that Mexican and American leaders had already agreed to negotiate such a pact. ''It cannot be confirmed that a free-trade agreement will be established between both countries, as the above mentioned article affirms,'' the statement added.
 
Younger Leaders a Factor
Now, however, Mexico has younger business and Government leaders who, according to American officials and other analysts, see increased trade, investment and technology flows as essential to strengthening competitiveness and general well-being.
''There is more confidence, more a sense of common interest with the United States and more a feeling that Mexico can be a beneficiary of trade with the United States,'' said Robert E. Herzstein, a former Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade.
Last year Mexico enjoyed a $2 billion trade surplus with the United States and ranks after Canada and Japan as the third-biggest American trading partner.
Also contributing to greater interest in free trade by Mexico is the democratization of Eastern Europe, placing it in competition for the multinational investment capital that Mexico hopes to get through closer economic ties with the United States.
''A free-trade agreement would buy security of access to the American market that would galvanize investment in Mexico,'' said Guy F. Erb, a Washington consultant specializing in Mexican business.
 
Rise in Canadian Spending
The free-trade agreement with Canada, which went into effect Jan. 1, 1989, has led to a robust increase in capital spending in Canada. There has also been agreement to accelerate some tariff cuts that were to be made over a 10-year period.
A Canadian Embassy spokesman, Malcolm McKechnie, said his Government would follow Mexican-American negotiations ''with interest'' and seek ''assurances Canadian interests were safeguarded.''
During his Washington visit, President Salinas will address the June l1 annual meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group of 200 chief executives of the biggest American companies. A Business Roundtable working group, headed by Colby H. Chandler, chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company, is preparing a report on economic relations with Mexico that is expected to be published between now and June.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today that no agreement existed at this time to negotiate a free-trade agreement, and declined to speculate on what might happen in June. But she insisted that whatever occurred would not affect the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which is expected to be concluded next December, well before any free-trade talks would actually begin between Mexico and the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking Trade Pact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BONN, March 27

 BODY:
The United States wants the Soviet Union and all participants at a 35-nation economic conference being held here to sign a declaration committing themselves to Western-style free-market principles, United States officials said today.
Among other things, the declaration, called the ''Bonn Principles for Economic Cooperation,'' says the 35 nations recognize the importance of ''international policies which support the expansion of free, open trade, investment and capital flows'' and ''full recognition and protection of rights of citizens to hold and use private property.'' 
A high-ranking Soviet official at the conference, Sergei Zotov, said he supports the idea of setting out principles for East-West economic cooperation, but that the document ''presents more a code of behavior'' for East bloc countries rather than concerning itself with ''purely principles of economic cooperation.'' Mr. Zotov is the deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Department of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The meeting of government officials and business executives began last week and will run through April 11. The 35-nation group includes the United States, Canada and all Eastern and Western European nations except Albania.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Drop Sharply After Comex Limits Buying

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Copper prices plunged yesterday even though there is a growing global shortage of the important industrial metal.
This contradiction of the usual relationship between supply and demand is caused in part by moves taken by the Commodity Exchange in New York to prevent a ''squeeze'' from developing in its spot March copper futures contract, which expires today.
A squeeze develops in a commodity market when the amount of the commodity represented by the number of outstanding contracts exceeds the stockpile of the commodity registered with the exchange. At the close yesterday, 891 March copper contracts were still outstanding, representing about 11,137 tons. But the Comex copper stocks total roughly 3,000 tons. 
To discourage speculation and dampen buying, the Comex began yesterday requiring traders to pay all cash for the March contracts. At yesterday's close, the expiring March copper delivery settled at $1.2165 a pound, down 4.55 cents, which means that the 25,000-pound contract sold for $30,412.50. On its other copper futures contracts, the exchange's margin standard remains unchanged and a trader is required to put up only $1,800 to control a contract.
The March contract set a contract high of $1.33 a pound last Wednesday, after soaring from a low of 95 cents on Jan. 24, as the supply situation became more severe.
''Copper supplies have been falling dramatically since the end of 1989,'' said Frederick R. Demler, minerals economist at Paine Webber Inc. ''For example, Comex copper stocks have dropped to 3,000 tons from 16,000 since Dec. 31. Those on the London Metal Exchange have dwindled to 72,000 tons from 108,000. Copper stocks in the hands of domestic producers are down 37 percent; consumer stocks down 20 percent, and worldwide stocks of the metal are down 70,000 tons since the year began.''
One reason for the tight supplies, Mr. Demler said, is that the domestic economy is stronger than statistics indicate, while foreign industrial activity remains fairly strong. But many industrial copper fabricators were persuaded by forecasts of an economy downturn to reduce their inventories of the metal during the last year or so.
''Meanwhile,'' he noted, ''global supplies have been shrunk by a number of factors such as strikes in Peru, technical problems in Chile, and mines in Papua New Guinea, which promises to be another major copper source, have been shut for almost a year because of terrorist activities.''
Another indication of tightening copper supplies is the rising cost of high-grade No. 1 scrap. Mr. Demler said this grade of scrap copper was no longer selling at discounts to Comex prices. This is a most unusual peacetime situation.
On other futures markets, petroleum futures finished mostly higher on the New York Merc on buying in advance of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventories report. The report, released after the close, showed a larger-than expected increase in United States stocks of crude oil, a greater-than-expected decline in gasoline supplies and drop in heating oil stocks that was within market expectations.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork futures fell in reaction to weaker cash markets. Cattle futures retreated slightly in sympathy with the pork price movement.

Gold Prices Recover a Bit As Dollar Continues to Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices rebounded slightly yesterday after a tumultuous plunge Monday that strategists traced to the dollar's strength and abnormally large gold sales from the Middle East.
The late price at the Republic National Bank in New York was $368.85 an ounce, up $2.10 from the previous session.
The dollar finished higher against most major currencies except the British pound yesterday, extending a rally that reflected fears of growing political and economic instability abroad. 
The shaken gold market appeared to stabilize somewhat from its severe beating Monday, when bullion prices plunged as much as $30 an ounce and nearly erased a rally that began six months ago. Some traders said the Monday decline was the worst rout they had seen in years.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $2.90 a troy ounce, to $368.70. Earlier, gold rose 75 cents an ounce, to $369.25 in London, and rose $6.25 an ounce, to $369.25 in Zurich. It fell $13.10 a troy ounce in Hong Kong, to $370.65.
 
Questions Over Japan
Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise largely to questions over Japan's ability to manage the country's unwieldy financial markets and other economic problems. They also said the Soviet Union's resolve to suppress Lithuanian independence was unsettling European markets and raising demand for dollars.
''I'm basically a dollar bull, just based on a fundamental assessment of the world situation,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief trader at the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch. ''As a safe haven, I don't think anybody can beat the United States right now.''
The dollar strengthened in Tokyo to 156.96 yen, up from 156.40 Monday. In London, the dollar traded at 157.35 yen and in New York it fetched 157.74 yen, up from 156.70 yen late Monday. The dollar was at the highest level against the yen in more than three years.

Treasury Issues Fall in Quiet Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers placed bids on $10 billion worth of new two-year notes - the only real activity of the day.
''We thought the two-year would spark some interest, but even though the auction went well, it wasn't enough,'' said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''We believe there is a lot of money on the sidelines, but at this juncture there is no reason for that money to come in.''
At the auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.59 percent, up from the 8.50 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Feb. 21, and the highest yield on a two-year note since the auction last May 24.
As expected, the attractive yields generated strong demand from investors. 
Non-competitive bids for the notes, a good barometer of retail demand, amounted to $1.56 billion for the new notes. It was the largest non-competitive bid since the two-year auction held on April 26. $8 Billion Sale Today Today the Treasury is expected to sell $8 billion worth of new four-year notes. That auction will be followed tomorrow with the sale of $13 billion of 16-day cash management bills.
Late yesterday the four-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.57 percent.
But away from the auction, little was going on.
''There is a general malaise throughout the whole government market, and I don't know what is going to shake us out of it,'' one bond trader said. ''The Fed is on hold, and we are going to have to wait and see what the direction of the economy is, and how the dollar will do against the yen and the mark.''
Yesterday, members of the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee met in Washington, but Mr. Liro and other analysts said that the central bank gave the market no sign that it had altered its current stance on monetary policy.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered in late trading at a price of 100 3/8, down 3/32, to yield 8.46 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 31/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 8.50 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.53 percent.
 
Three-Month Bills Rise
Treasury bill rates edged higher. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.88 percent, up five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.85 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late rate of 7.75 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, prices of outstanding general obligation New York State bonds that were downgraded by Standard & Poor's on Monday fell by 3/4 point to 7/8 point in fairly light trading.
The downgrade, announced late Monday, did not surprise most participants in the municipal bond market, because S.&P. had been issuing progressively negative reports on New York's fiscal prospects since November.
 
New York City Pricing
An indication of how the downgrade might affect debt offerings by New York City will come today, when the city is expected to price a $648 million bond offering.
In advance of the auction, traders said that yields were likely to be well above the securities that the city sold at competitive bid in mid-February.
For example, preliminary price talk was that the five-year bonds to be sold today would yield 7.60 percent. By contrast, in February five-year securities were sold at a yield of 6.80 percent.
A good part of today's offering -roughly $150 million - is likely to be insured, market participants said.
''On the face of it, it would seem that the ratings downgrade won't help the city,'' said one municipal bond trader, who asked not to be identified. ''But yields on city paper have backed up a lot over the last six months, and the Mayor has been coming out and addressing the city's budgetary problems, something that a lot of people were worried he wouldn't do after he was elected. Right now city yields seem extremely attractive.''
Municipal market participants said that away from the New York State sector, prices of most issues in the secondary market were unchanged on the day.
 
Philip Morris Offering
In the new-issue market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the Philip Morris Companies offered $200 million of five-year senior notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The 9.45 percent notes, which are noncallable for three years, were priced at $99.877, to yield 9.481 percent, 95 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The notes are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate issues prices of actively traded bonds dipped by about 1/8 point, market participants said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Edward Cristy Welsh, Economist And Space Program Pioneer, 81

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Edward Cristy Welsh, an educator and economist who played a leading role in developing the nation's space program, died of a stroke on Sunday at the Charter House nursing home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 81 years old and had lived at the nursing home for two years.
Mr. Welsh was the executive secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, a White House advisory group, from 1961 until his retirement in 1969. He then remained active as a consultant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
As chief staff officer of the space council, Mr. Welsh was principal adviser to the White House and was a strong advocate of increased spending to overcome the early Soviet lead in space. He also helped draft legislation creating the Communications Satellite Corporation.
Earlier, as a legislative aide to Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri, he helped draft the legislation that created NASA and the space council in 1958.
 
An Aide to MacArthur
He began his government service in 1937 as an economist with the National Resources Committee and moved to the Temporary National Economic Committee in 1940. In 1942 he became head of the Office of Price Administration's regional office in Cleveland and in 1945 became director of price operations for the agency in Washington.
In 1947 Gen. Douglas MacArthur summoned him to become chief of the antitrust division at Occupation headquarters in Japan. There he broke up the major cartels and reorganized Japan's largest companies.
He returned to Washington in 1950 and served as assistant to Mr. Symington, then as chairman of the National Security Resources Board and later chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. After Mr. Symington was elected to the Senate, Mr. Welsh served as his legislative aide from 1953 until 1961, when he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to head the Space Council.
Born on March 20, 1909, in Long Valley, N.J., Mr. Welsh earned a Ph.D. in economics in 1940 from Ohio State University, where he taught for eight years.
He is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Jones of Chambersburg, Pa., and Dorothy Vernon of Dunedin, Fla.

HEADLINE: FREE-TRADE TALKS WITH U.S. SET OFF DEBATE IN MEXICO

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 28

 BODY:
In a break with the policy of economic nationalism that has prevailed here since the Mexican Revolution of 1910, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has agreed to consider negotiations for a free-trade agreement with the United States.
The move represents a huge political gamble and has prompted a spirited public debate.
The Bush Administration said Tuesday that the two Governments had begun ''preliminary discussions'' that could lead to a pact similar to one that last year eliminated major trade barriers between the United States and Canada.
But such an agreement, which could pave the way for a North American common market, is extremely controversial here and would also force other Latin American governments to rethink their place in the world. 
 
Elimination of Barriers
Free-trade agreements are intended to eliminate barriers to the flow of goods between the countries involved. These restrictions include quotas limiting the import of goods and services or duties on product shipments. For example, the United States-Canadian free-trade agreement, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989, calls for duties to be reduced or eliminated on 8,000 categories of products over the next 10 years. The pact also makes it easier for Americans and Canadians to work in each other's markets.
Since coming to power in 1929, the Institutional Revolutionary Party has emphasized development of the Mexican economy by keeping foreign competition out and subsidizing domestic producers. That model was developed in large part to prevent Mexico and its economy from being swallowed by United States interests, whose extensive acquisition of mines, railroads, oil companies and ranches helped detonate the revolution that the party still claims to defend.
 
Suspicion Still a Force
Over the last decade, a period of crisis marked by stagnation and inflation, Mexico has given up some of its traditional economic isolation by moves like joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986. But suspicion of American intentions remains a potent force in Mexican politics, and no candidate for office ever gives a speech without promising to protect the country's ''sovereignty'' and ''independence.''
There is no timetable for talks about formal economic integration between the two countries, Mexican and American officials said, and the obstacles that must be overcome are likely to be formidable. Among the most politically sensitive issues are the immigration of Mexican labor to the United States and American ownership and exploitation of natural resources in Mexico.
In a statement issued Tuesday, the Mexican Embassy in Washington said ''it cannot be confirmed that a free-trade agreement will be established between both countries.'' Nevertheless, the mere fact that such a possibility is now under consideration has generated immediate alarm and concern here.
''Our way of life is at stake,'' a political analyst, Lorenzo Meyer, wrote this morning in Excelsior, Mexico's leading newspaper. ''We should take decisions knowing, as much as is possible, what we will gain and lose by integrating ourselves with the economy of a great power, one from which we previously considered it our historic and patriotic duty to protect and separate ourselves.''
Political parties on both the left, which emerged as the country's second-largest political force in the 1988 elections, and the right have already accused the Salinas administration of rushing too eagerly into Washington's economic embrace and said the North American common market would be a major issue in next year's midterm elections. A columnist, Gaston Garcia Cantu, a fervent nationalist who generally supports Mr. Salinas, recently suggested that what was really at stake was not economic integration but an ''annexation'' similar to that of Texas in 1836 and a betrayal of the rest of Latin America.
 
'Tied to Latin America'
Most Latin American countries appear to believe that the destiny of Mexico lies to its north, not to its south, and that the willingness of Mr. Salinas to consider a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada left them out in the cold.
''Mexico has always talked about the economic integration of Latin America,'' a South American diplomat here said, ''but they are at the gate of the largest market in the world, and whether they like it or not, economic logic dictates that they associate themselves more closely with that market. It appears they have now reached the same conclusion.''
Like his predecessors, Mr. Salinas, a 41-year-old Harvard-educated economist, initially shunned too close an economic relationship with the United States and sought trade and investment links elsewhere. In an interview in January 1988 after being named the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, he said that ''I am not in favor'' of any free-trade or common market plan because ''there is such a different economic level between the United States and Mexico.''
But Mexican officials and foreign diplomats here said that since taking office in December 1988, Mr. Salinas had come to question whether Mexico could realistically hope to use Western Europe and Japan as an economic counterbalance to the United States. They say he has been profoundly influenced by recent events in Europe, especially the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the decision of the European Community to eliminate all trade barriers in 1992.
 
European 'Fascination' Cited
In late January, Mr. Salinas visited Europe and complained that Western Europe's ''fascination'' with events in the Eastern bloc was resulting in ''a relative lack of attention to other parts of the world.'' A Mexican official said Mr. Salinas was particularly sobered by his meetings with Prime Ministers Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Margaret Thatcher of Britain and his discussions with business executives in both countries.
Mexican officials and foreign diplomats said Mr. Salinas emerged from those contacts with the belief that Mexico could not hope for large flows of European investment during the next few years.
Late in February, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Jaime Serra, and Mr. Salinas's chief economic adviser, Jose Cordoba, agreed to discuss a unified North American market further while in Washington for talks on other matters.
 
Bank Debt Converted
Approximately $44 billion of Mexico's commercial bank debt was converted into bonds yesterday, the Mexican Government and Citibank announced. William R. Rhodes, Citibank's senior executive-international, said the transaction was the largest long-term bond issue ever.
Also yesterday, Mexico received $370 million in its first drawdown of some $1.1 billion in new money provided by the agreement.
The 30-year bonds were issued as part of an agreement Mexico worked out with its bank lenders last year and signed earlier this year.
The agreement covered virtually all of the $48.5 billion in medium- and long-term debt that Mexico owes to 470 banks worldwide. Under the plan, the banks chose between making new loans to Mexico or exchanging their debt for bonds on terms that reduce Mexico's debt burden by 35 percent.

HEADLINE: ATOM BOMB PARTS SEIZED IN BRITAIN EN ROUTE TO IRAQ

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Six people were arrested in Britain today in what American and British officials said was an attempt to smuggle electronic devices used to trigger nuclear weapons to Iraq.
Triggering devices that had been disarmed and other electronic equipment that has military uses were seized in the raids in Britain today, the officials said.
The officials said the moves capped an 18-month undercover investigation that has already produced a sealed indictment, returned by a Federal grand jury in San Diego, describing a scheme in which several foreign nationals tried to smuggle out of the United States through England small electronic devices that were said to be required by Iraqi officials for building nuclear weapons.
 
Some Are Charged
Some of the six people arrested in London have been charged in the indictment while others have not, officials said. They identified one of those arrested, Ali Ashour Daghir, as the leader of the smuggling ring. The names and nationalities of the others were not divulged, but officials said they included citizens of Iraq, Britain and Lebanon. 
American officials said the investigation began after a CSI Technologies, a California company, informed the United States Customs Service that a British company had been inquiring about obtaining devices called capacitors. The devices, not much larger than a matchbox, have many uses in industry, but the British company, called Euromac, was seeking a type of capacitor that clearly was for military use, most probably to detonate a nuclear warhead.
The British and American authorities said what followed was a long and complex charade as they lured the British company's officials - Mr. Daghir among them - into a trap, promising delivery of the devices while gathering evidence on the company and its connections to Iraq. [Page A14.] The case adds fuel to the debate over Iraq's weapons programs, including a suspected program to build a nuclear bomb. But because of the secrecy surrounding the case, many questions remain unanswered, including details of the criminal charges and the exact status of Iraq's weapons programs.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today: ''This issue raises once again our concern for the nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. It continues to pose a serious risk to U.S. interests, and it continues to exacerbate regional problems.''
Abdul Rahmen Jamril, the press attache at the Iraqi Embassy here, said that he knew nothing about the case but that Iraq was ''not developing nor does it intend to develop any nuclear capacity.''
One complication is that law officials who know the details of the case have not shared a lot of their information with intelligence and nuclear experts who are more familiar with Iraq's weapons programs.
 
A Puzzling Factor
Some of the devices sought by the Iraqis, capacitors, are particularly well suited for triggering nuclear explosions. This puzzles some intelligence experts who believe that Iraq's program lacks crucial supplies of plutonium and enriched uranium that would be needed to make nuclear weapons.
One intelligence expert pointed out that capacitors are also used in separating the stages of missiles and rockets. Officials said Iraq also has a missile program that is far more advanced than the nuclear program.
But law enforcement officials, relying to some extent on statements made to an undercover agent by principals in the case, said they believed the multi-pronged Iraqi effort was for use in the nuclear program.
At Heathrow Airport near London today, British officials seized 40 electrical devices that were being shipped from the United States to Baghdad by way of London. Officials in Britain had switched the shipment, which arrived in London a few days ago, and substituted inoperable devices.
The devices seized were krytrons, high-speed capacitors that can be used to trigger nuclear explosions but that also have commercial applications. There are few manufacturers of these specialized devices, which have figured in smuggling cases in the past involving foreign nationals accused of trying to circumvent the United States' export laws.
E. G. & G., a Massachusetts company that makes krytrons, said today that it had cooperated with the Customs Service and supplied more than 40 inoperable trigger switches, including krytrons.
Ed Kittredge, a Customs spokesman, said that the British authorities had searched sites in Scotland and Cheshire today in connection with the attempted shipment of ''naval equipment to Iraq.'' He also said that an office in Surrey was searched in connection with the export of certain restricted ''electronic devices'' from the United States to Iraq by way of England.
Though the operation was undercover, the Customs Service permitted television crews unusual access. In advance of the arrests, NBC News television crews were allowed to film the preparation of the capacitors and loading in California and their arrival in London, as well as the comings and goings of Mr. Daghir, the alleged leader of the ring. They were also on hand for the arrests and the raid on Mr. Daghir's office in the London suburb of Surrey.
Mr. Kittredge said ''the Brits have asked us to soft-pedal the case because of the British citizens living in Iraq and we have deferred to them.''
The case comes at a sensitive time in British-Iraqi relations. The British Ambassador in Baghdad was recalled this month after the Iraqi hanging of an Iranian-born journalist working for a British publication. The reporter, Farzad Bazoft, was accused of spying.
There have been cases in the past of other countries trying to obtain krytrons, including Israel and Pakistan. Israel sent its warplanes to destroy an experimental nuclear reactor south of Baghdad in 1981.
A United States Government expert said he believed that Iraq was more than a decade away from developing nuclear weapons. But the official noted that Iraq had been trying to obtain technology and equipment that could used in a future plant to enrich uranium to nuclear weapons grade.
Other Government officials have described the Iraqi program in more alarming terms.
Rear Adm. Thomas A. Brooks, the director of naval intelligence, recently told Congress that the Iraqi program was ''well advanced.''
 
International Pressure Urged
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project, which studies nuclear proliferation issues, said that the Iraqi effort ''is part of a worldwide, well financed, dedicated effort to get nuclear weapons.''
''It appears to be the first open violation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty by a non-nuclear weapons state,'' Mr. Milhollin added.
Leonard S. Spector, an expert on nuclear proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that he believed that Iraq was 5 to 10 years away from acquiring nuclear weapons, but added that the Iraqi case was nonetheless very worrisome.
''It demonstrates a clear intention to acquire nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Spector said. ''Now is the time for international pressure to be brought on Iraq, especially from countries like France and the Soviet Union that are supplying arms to Iraq and from various Western states that are extending economic credits.''

HEADLINE: Paying for Long-Term Care: The Struggle for Lawmakers

SERIES: Care of the Elderly; Private Burdens, Public Choices - Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Senator Max Baucus fed Gladys Foote, a 97-year-old stroke victim in Helena, Mont., who was his kindergarten teacher. Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th assisted an 82-year-old Alzheimer's victim in South Charleston, W.Va., while Representative Charles E. Bennett held a 4-year-old mentally disabled child on his lap at a center in Jacksonville, Fla.
They were among 75 lawmakers who spent a day feeding, dressing and caring for the severely disabled last year in a program sponsored by the Long Term Care Campaign, a coalition of 138 organizations including groups of the elderly, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Way. The coalition is pressing for more Government assistance for long-term care of the frail and the disabled, whether they are in nursing homes or being cared for at home. And increasingly, the nation's lawmakers are listening.
After a decade in the legislative shadows, the national debate over long-term care is moving toward center stage, propelled by the rising costs faced by growing numbers of disabled elderly Americans. 
It is an emotional debate involving morality and politics, fueled by different visions of what is right and what is feasible. It is a debate about government responsibility and family obligations, the roles of the public and private sectors, and whether the disabled elderly have as strong a claim on limited Federal resources as other groups like children and the poor.
''Sometime in the not-too-distant future we will get a major national program protecting families against the cost of long-term care,'' Robert M. Ball predicted in a recent interview. Mr. Ball was Commissioner of Social Security in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon Administrations and is now chairman of the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. He went on: ''I expect it to come, not primarily because of the political power of the elderly - although this is important - but because of pressure from those of middle age, the sons and daughters of the elderly. They are the ones most at risk.''
But few expect such legislation in the next two or three years. ''The public isn't willing to pay more taxes,'' said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Health of the Ways and Means Committee. ''Unless the President is willing to spend some of his popularity, we'll never have it.''
 
The Issues
Who Benefits? Who Will Pay?
The debate over a new national policy turns on basic issues of philosophy and practicality:
* To what extent should middle-class people be expected to save funds for possible long-term care, or buy private insurance?
* Should Government programs be universal, like Social Security, with everyone paying and everyone getting a benefit? Or should they be aimed only at the needy, as programs like Medicaid are now?
* If eligibility for benefits is based on need, how poor should people be before getting aid? Should spouses of the disabled be able to maintain their former standard of living? Do people have a right to keep assets to pass on to their children?
* How much support should the Government give to care in the home, which many say is the greatest need but others fear could be an endless drain on the Treasury?
* How should any new program be financed? Through payroll taxes, personal or corporate income taxes, estate taxes or others?
Some people cast the debate as an intergenerational conflict, contending that the major beneficiaries will be the elderly, who are already benefiting from immenseGovernment programs like Social Security and Medicare. But others, like Mr. Ball, say aid to the elderly helps an entire family, especially the middle-aged, who he said face ''the poignant choice of spending time and money on their parents at the sacrifice of their own children.''
 
The Politics
Nightmare, Now or Later?
The debate is complicated by a national ambivalence. Public opinion polls show overwhelming support for Government protection against the financial nightmare so many families fear. But many politicians doubt that the public would support the new taxes needed to pay for these benefits.
Still, with the elderly growing in number and more families confronting the problems of the soaring costs of long-term care, there is a widespread feeling that something needs to be done. ''This could be a campaign issue in 1990 and 1992,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. He added that ''there is very strong public support'' for more Government aid for long-term care.
The Democrats, who championed Social Security and Medicare, have sought to portray themselves as protectors of the aged, and are the strongest supporters of such coverage. Republicans have taken the major role in questioning whether the middle-class elderly and their families, who would be the major beneficiaries of a new Federal benefit program, should receive more Federal money from tight budgets at a time when more than 31 million people lack health insurance and poor pregnant women and children need better health care. Republicans also tend to give more stress to the potential for private insurance to meet the care needs of many.
 
The Budget Squeeze
Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said, ''If we assume that there's some limit on how much taxes people are willing to pay, a major new middle-class program means that other parts of the budget are going to get squeezed.''
Nor is long-term-care legislation expected to become law without the support of the Bush Administration, which has resisted major new social programs, especially those that provide benefits to the middle class.
The poor already receive coverage for nursing homes, and occasionally home care, under Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for the poor. Many middle-class people rely on Medicaid to cover their expenses in nursing homes, but can do so only after spending most of their assets, a process many call humiliating and unfair. Others find legal ways to shelter assets and obtain Medicaid.
Medicare, the Federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, covers acute rather than chronic illness, so it provides relatively little support for nursing homes or home care.
The policy debate accelerated earlier this month because of the recommendations of the United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, called the Pepper commission for the late Representative Claude Pepper, a Florida Democrat who championed long-term coverage. The commission, created by Congress, is composed of 12 members of Congress and three private experts appointed by President Ronald Reagan. By a vote of 11 to 4, it called for a $42.8-billion-a-year plan for long-term care, with a majority of the money going to home health care, despite objections by the Bush Administration.
''The White House message was, 'Don't let the Democrats have an issue,' '' said Senator Rockefeller, who is chairman of the commission. ''The White House said, 'Don't do anything until after the November elections.' ''
But Republicans have insisted that their opposition was based on substance, not politics, including the commission's failure to fulfill one task assigned by Congress: proposing a way to finance the program. The $42.8 billion would be in addition to the $19.4 billion projected in the fiscal year 1990 for long-term care under Medicare and Medicaid, of which only $424 million is projected for home health care and the remainder for nursing homes.
''Before the Pepper commission, long-term care was a concept,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of the Families USA Foundation, which promotes the concerns of the elderly poor. ''Now, it's a concrete package.''
 
Wary of Another Debacle
But Deborah Steelman, who was George Bush's health policy expert in the 1988 Presidential campaign and now heads an independent Government commission studying health and social policy, balked at the Pepper commission's price tag. ''Why do we stick to ideas that are bigger than we have any reasonable expectation of paying for?'' she asked.
The Pepper commission sought to defuse the intergenerational debate by recommending long-term care for the severely disabled of all ages. About 40 percent of the severely disabled are under the age of 65. Of this younger group, a vast majority are cared for at home.
Under the Pepper plan, the Government would pay for the first three months of care in both skilled nursing homes and intermediate care centers. Thereafter, additional coverage would be provided to individuals with assets of $30,000 or less (not counting a home and some other essentials), and to couples with assets of $60,000 or less. The commission estimated that such institutional care would cost $18.8 billion, in addition to the $15 billion that Medicaid now pays for nursing homes.
Under the Pepper plan, the Government would also pay 80 percent of the costs of home and community-based care for up to 400 hours a year. The commission projected that this and other home health care benefits would cost $24 billion.
But members of Congress appear reluctant to endorse any new benefits package since last year's demise of the year-old Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, which was repealed after vociferous objections to a new surtax paid by elderly people with higher incomes. Lawmakers appear to have learned several painful lessons from the episode: People do not like to be singled out for special taxes; health legislation is complicated and costly, and complicated legislation is hard to explain and justify to angry taxpayers. ''There are some real hangover feelings from the catastrophic coverage experience,'' Senator Rockefeller said. Instead of recommending specific financing measures, the Pepper commission offered a list of possible ways to meet the $42.8 billion cost. For instance, this amount could be raised by making all wages subject to the Social Security tax, rather than just the first $51,300, or it could be raised by increasing income tax rates 1 or 2 percent and taxing the highest incomes at a rate of 33 percent.
 
The Outlook
Responsibility And Coverage
A major issue in the debate involves whether the middle class as well as the poor should receive Government coverage for long-term care.
''I think we need some form of social insurance approach,'' said Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''You get better programs if everybody pays and everybody benefits, as they do in Social Security and Medicare, instead of programs financed out of general revenues and specifically targeted at the poor, as in Medicaid.''
But others ask why the Government should provide coverage for the David Rockefellers and Donald Trumps.
''The question is, Can we afford to expand Government coverage on an entitlement basis, with benefits regardless of income?'' asked Gail Wilensky, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare and Medicaid.
Another issue involves the role of private insurance. Mr. Ball, the former Social Security Commissioner, says only 20 percent of elderly couples could afford private insurance, those with incomes of $40,000 a year or more. ''Private insurance is for people who are relatively well off, and have some assets to protect,'' Mr. Ball said.
But Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, says 40 percent of the elderly have enough income or assets to pay an average premium of $1,100 to $1,400 a year, at the age of 65, for private long-term-care insurance, or to pay directly for their care needs. Is Insurance the Answer? Representative Gradison said that although only about one and a half million million people have private long-term-care insurance, these policies were first offered only five years ago.
''It's way too early to throw up our hands and say the insurance industry can't do the job,'' Mr. Gradison said. ''They're just getting started.'' Thirty-two million Americans are 65 or older.
Health experts disagree on whether a Government program should pay at the outset of long-term care, or after a period of months or years. The two approaches help different groups.
The Pepper commission would have the Government pay for the first three months, and then provide coverage for those whose assets fall below $30,000 ($60,000 for couples). But Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health Care Association, which represents 10,000 nursing homes, said that when it comes to his own elderly parents, ''I can handle the first three months, at an average cost of $2,000 a month, but not the five to seven years of late-stage Alzheimer's.''
George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the Senate majority leader, has proposed providing Government coverage only after two years in a nursing home, as well as home health services and respite care. His program would cost $25 billion a year.
But critics say the Mitchell approach favors the more affluent, those who still have assets after two years.
Mr. Ball said people who return to the community after nursing home stays ''will need their resources.''
Judith Feder, a health economist and the Pepper commission's staff director, said, ''The fundamental premise of our plan is that the program should focus on those at home and those likely to return home.'' Half of those in nursing homes for three months return home, Dr. Feder said, and two-thirds of all those who ultimately return home do so in three months.
 
'Flexibility Is the Key'
Another plan, developed by the staff of Ms. Steelman's commission, would give Medicare beneficiaries the option of paying a substantial deductible, ranging perhaps from $20,000 to $40,000, and then having the Government pay all the costs for long-term care, as well as all the costs of prescription drugs, hospitals and doctors. The commission is expected to make its recommendations early next year.
''Flexibility is the key,'' Ms. Steelman said. ''The question is whether we can modify Medicare to provide long-term care benefits.''
Home health care poses a policy problem. It is both more prevalent and usually less expensive than nursing home care. But some question whether the Government should pay for services that are now often provided without charge by relatives and friends. In addition, they say, home care coverage could easily be overused.
Dr. Warren Greenberg, professor of health services administration at George Washington University, said: ''Most elderly people can use such care as assistance in dressing, eating, shopping and other aspects of daily living. Once you pay this up, and say that we will pay for this as a nation, many people would qualify, and there would be no end to it.''
But others emphasize that many families badly need outside aid to keep providing the care they want to give and that home services can sometimes keep people out of nursing homes.
Whatever the form, Government aid for long-term care will be a major issue in this year's Congressional elections and in the 1992 Presidential election, if its supporters have their way.
''The '92 election is our friend,'' Senator Rockefeller said. ''The political pressure for long-term care is very substantial. The problem is mobilizing the will that exists out there, and getting the President to take the lead.''

HEADLINE: Rise in Minimum Wage Offers Minimum Joy

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EUFAULA, Ala., March 25

 BODY:
''I sew front pockets,'' Filena Craft says of her work at the Reltoc Manufacturing Company here, where she is among 100 workers who make men's cotton pants. Ms. Craft, who is 27 years old, earns the Federal minimum wage of $3.35 an hour and takes less than $100 a week home to the trailer where she lives with her two young daughters.
On Sunday, April 1, Ms. Craft and about 3.2 million other workers at the bottom of the wage scale will see a big change in their earnings. In November, Congress voted a 25 percent increase in the minimum wage, the first since 1981. Half the increase, to $3.80, takes effect next week and the second half, to $4.25, in April 1991.
But because these workers will see an increase in income, those who receive food stamps will lose some of their allotment. For example, Ms. Craft, who now takes home $85.89 a week, will take home about $97 a week after Sunday. She said her food stamps for the month of March were worth $200; food stamp officials, while declining to discuss individual cases, said the reduction in food stamps in a case like hers would probably be about $40 a month. The result: virtually a wash. 
So there is not much rejoicing in Eufaula. Not from Ms. Craft, not from her co-workers at Reltoc, Pamela Akins and Geanette Tennille; not from Annie Ruth Scott, who works at the Hardee's fast-food restaurant here and has a son with diabetes but has no health insurance, and not from Christine Dennis, who has a temporary job at Southern Plastics Inc., a maker of soft plastic fishing lures.
All are single mothers with young children and representative of the two-thirds of the nation's minimum-wage workers who are women. Such families, even with a full-time wage earner, fall below the poverty line, making them eligible for food stamps.
''When a woman maintains a family and her earning potential is at or near the minimum wage, she generally cannot keep out of poverty,'' the Labor Department's Monthly Labor Review said last October in a study of 6.4 million people whose family incomes were below the official poverty level in 1987 even though they worked or looked for work at least half the year.
''There's not much you can do with the minimum wage,'' said Ms. Akins, the mother of 4- and 6-year-old girls.
 
Costs Paid by Employer
The immediate costs of the wage increase, of course, are borne by the employers - retailers, service establishments, a sprinkling of light manufacturing companies - and their customers.
The families that will end up with more money from the wage increase are those that already have a bit more than the Crafts or the Akinses. Youths who live with their parents and work will gain. So will members of two-worker families, who earn too much to qualify for public assistance.
The Bush Administration and some leading Democrats are now considering enhancing another device, the earned income tax credit, which is meant for the working poor and in effect pays them a subsidy for working.
Under the credit, familes with incomes up to $6,500 get a maximum benefit of about $910, usually as a tax refund or as a check if they owe no taxes, according to Robert J. Shapiro, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. At incomes of $9,000 or so, the credit starts phasing out and stops at about $19,000.
Democrats and the White House support a higher benefit level. In addition, as part of child care legislation, the Administration would extend the benefit to mothers who stay home with their children, while Democrats would use it as an incentive to encourage work.
In the South, particularly, the minimum wage increase has a wide effect - at least on paper. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 1.5 million workers - 7.2 percent of the region's work force - receive no more than the minimum wage. The bureau defines the South as 16 states and the District of Columbia.
 
Life on the Chattahoochee
Eufaula (pronounced you-FAH-lah) is a tranquil city of 15,500 people and a per capita income of a little over $9,000 a year, putting it among the nation's poorest communities. Its north end is a living museum of antebellum and Victorian mansions. Like many rural Southern communities, Eufaula is surrounded by forests, pastures and the shacks and mobile homes of the poor.
Eufaula has an unusually diversified, low-wage but also low-cost economy, with about 40 old and new industries. A sizable minority of workers are paid the minimum wage or a little more, among them some of the women at Reltoc, the maids at the motels, the help at the many fast-food shops, the beginner clerks at the K Mart discount store.
Some of these people say they started their jobs four or five years ago at $3.35 an hour and have yet to see even a penny raise. Some say they hold two jobs. At the Barbour County seat, 20 miles from here in Clayton, Ala., the supervisor of the food stamp program, Jean Teal, said 1,500 households, mostly in and around Eufala, get food stamps. ''Most people on the program work,'' she said. But at the Store. . . .? Ben and Rosalyn Turner, both 28, are among those who stand to gain from the wage increase because they are already above the poverty line. They earn a total of around $19,000 a year, he as a $7-an-hour janitor at a union-organized lighting fixture plant, she as a minimum-wage worker at Reltoc. With daughters 9 and 5 years of age, they live 30 miles away in a mobile home on land that Mr. Turner's mother gave them. Their cars are a 10-year-old Toyota and a nine-year-old Toyota. ''I'll be able to give my older daughter an allowance,'' Mrs. Turner said.
But it is hard to know how much these people will really benefit as the higher wage filters through the economy. Some retailers say they will raise prices to offset the higher wages they will have to pay - offsetting the workers' gains as well. Some employers might lay people off and postpone hiring new people.
Frank Comer, executive director of the Eufaula Chamber of Commerce, said that if he were a local businessman, he would look a little more closely for ways to cope with the higher wages.
''I would look at the productivity of that person,'' he said. ''Can he do more? If not, I would look for other things I can cut. But I might have to let that person go.''
Terry Spence, vice president and co-owner of Southern Plastics, said: ''We started tightening our belt two or three months ago. We're paying a lot more attention to who's producing and who's not.'' Even with better productivity, he added, ''We're going to have to have some price increases this year.''
Howard Cotler, chief executive of the H. Cotler Company in Manhattan, owner of Reltoc (Cotler spelled backwards), said his company, too, expected to impose price increases.
That is the sort of thing that makes some economists in Washington wince. Fast-food restaurants that can find workers to hire at the minimum wage ''will pass it on in the price of hamburgers,'' said Isabel Sawhill, economist at the Urban Institute there. ''That's what we should worry about if we worry about anything - the inflationary effects.''
But speculation about the national economy bears little relation to the world of Reltoc's women. Reltoc has become the flashpoint of industry's efforts in Eufaula to hold down costs to preserve profits and meet foreign competition.
 
Clothing Workers in Drive
This is anti-union country. Only three or four companies here have unions. But Reltoc is the target of an organizing drive by two women from the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers: Hilda Parker and Karen Hart, who have opened an office at the Holiday Inn.
The Cotler family, which operates two other plants in Alabama and two in Arkansas, all unionized, was warmly welcomed by the Eufaula business establishment about a year ago. Cotler bought a sewing plant that had closed the previous Christmas season, putting about 120 people out of work; Cotler rehired many of them. ''They are seen as a savior,'' Mr. Comer said.
But women at the plant who are leading the union organization drive say Reltoc pays less than the previous owners or other textile and apparel plants in the area. The women complain less about the minimum wage, which is all the company assures them, than about the company's requirements for earning more than the minimum.
By working fast and reaching a quota, called ''production,'' of completed pockets and other tasks, they can earn $4 to $5 an hour, and many do.
Even that is not enough to bring the workers up to the $1,090 level of monthly income that Mrs. Teal at the food stamp office says is the cutoff for a mother with two children. Ms. Tennille, who has children 16 and 9 years old, gets $24 a month in food stamps. ''I push myself,'' she said. ''You've got to have speed to make production.''
 
Running, Just to Stay Even
But Ms. Tennille said she was afraid that after April 1, the company would raise its production quotas so that she would have to work harder to stay even. The manager of the plant, Hern Bennett, declined repeated requests for comment and called the police when a photographer started taking pictures outside the plant.
Ms. Craft's prospects for escaping poverty and depending on food stamps are bleaker than Ms. Tennille's. For a week of stitching pockets, her paycheck stubs show that she takes home $70 to $90 a week after deductions of about $12 for taxes and Social Security and $39.73 for health insurance - a benefit many workers decline because of its unusually high cost.
She said she rarely meets her production quota - completing the pockets on 824 trousers a day. ''The majority of us can only do 500,'' she said. ''We're complaining that production is too high to make money.'' When Ms. Craft signed up for the health insurance a few months ago, she said the Government raised her food stamp allotment from $131 a month to $200. It could be years, she said, before further wage increases could free her from the need for food stamps.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Bush's Adviser on Domestic Policy: The Perfect Person to Win the Point

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Roger Porter has a theory that you can learn a lot about people by watching them on the tennis court.
Take Mr. Porter himself, an expert player who often plays doubles with President Bush.
The court strategy of the Assistant to the President for Economic and Domestic Policy is patient, steady, cerebral. He is scrupulous about line calls and he is willing to rally eight or nine times while he decides exactly which shot to set up for a put-away.
''A lot of players play impatiently,'' he says, talking about tennis and about life. ''And it is not easy in tennis, unless you're much better than your opponent, to score a lot of outright winners. My point is to win the point, but not to do it in any particular time frame.'' 
 
An Emphasis on Details
Because of his amiable, meticulous and tenacious nature, Mr. Porter is regarded as the perfect person to run the domestic policy shop at a time when the President is focusing on the more heady foreign policy agenda, earmarking the first part of the peace dividend for aid to Panama and Nicaragua, while domestic policy is found more in details than in grand schemes.
Some wags wonder what Mr. Porter does all day, arguing that Mr. Bush's domestic policy, as George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, drily observes, ''is notable primarily for its absence.''
This month Senator Mitchell noticed Mr. Porter's presence. The paradigm of the team player so celebrated in the Bush Adminstration, Mr. Porter was not very visible in his first year. He gained a higher profile as indefatigable point man for the Administration's Clean Air Act, winning from Mr. Mitchell a compromise measure that is tougher in some respects than the White House wanted but is still weaker than a Senate committee version - weaker enough that some of his colleagues think the majority leader is giving away too much.
 
Domestic Approach Disputed
Democrats hope the White House strategy is a vulnerability, that American anxiety about trying to make America work better at home and so compete better abroad will lead to dissatisfaction with the President's domestic approach.
Mr. Porter argues that within the constraints of fiscal responsibility the President has advanced a bold domestic and economic agenda on clean air, child care, education, capital gains, and drugs and crime.
''I do not agree with the notion that the President has failed to put forward dramatic initiatives,'' Mr. Porter said. ''Quite the contrary, his initiatives are dominating the agenda. He is also building bridges to governors, to Congress and to the country. His domestic policy is not dependent on heavy-handed Government mandates, but on market-oriented approaches. The rest of the world is now following our lead on this.''
 
A Black Belt in White Paper
Even in a city of policy wonks, Mr. Porter is an acknowledged black belt in white paper, a voluminous note-taker and voracious document-reader who spends long hours brokering complex programs with a host of bickering agencies and interest groups.
''Policy is his bag,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. ''He's one of those guys who reads the Federal Register and notices the fine print. He can tell you how much carbon monoxide amounts to how much global warming.''
Told that on the subject of policy he often utters pedantic sentences, Mr. Porter replies with self-deprecating humor, ''But I am a walking textbook, you know that.''
Methodical? He is so methodical that he tears out the advertisements from news magazines before he reads them so that they can be stored in smaller stacks afterward.
Hard-working? Mr. Porter, who eats warmed-over dinners when he gets home past 9 P.M. and who has been known to spend the night on his office couch, processes so much paper that he needs six in-boxes, occasionally using his closet as a seventh.
 
Asleep at a Rock Concert
On weekends and evenings he sometimes brings his three children into the office; his wife, Ann, says the brood has grown up helping him type memos. The hours sometimes catch up with him. He once took his son to a Michael Jackson concert and managed to sleep through it.
Disciplined? Raised in a studious, ordered Mormon household, where his mother read books to the children at the dinner table and his father taught them the art of arranging books neatly in a bookcase, the 43-year-old Utah native does not drink, smoke, swear, guzzle coffee, leave messes or lose his temper.
Mr. Porter says he never thought about rebelling as a teen-ager because he was ''too busy.'' His A average in high school and at Brigham Young University was marred by a handful of A-minuses, including one he says he didn't deserve in physics because the final exam was on the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and the teacher refused to postpone the exam.
Mr. Porter, who started college at 16, took two years off to work in England as a Mormon missionary. ''My family gave me a legacy of an approach to life that is structured but not rigid,'' he said.
 
Two Kinds of Advisers
Mr. Bush, who first met Mr. Porter in 1976 when President Gerald R. Ford asked him to join in a game of doubles, likes two kinds of advisers. His barbed wire side, developed in his years in Texas politics, likes realpolitik tough guys like Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. His more genteel side is attracted to moderate, progressive, noblesse oblige advisers like Mr. Porter and William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Asked to offer a list of public officials to call for a profile of his first year, Mr. Porter named as many Democrats as Republicans.
Mrs. Porter says that even when her husband chides the children about chores, he sets up a gentle ''win-win situation,'' adding: ''If a room needs to be cleaned, he might offer to clean it with them. He operates very much from a base of trust.''
In the days of sweeping influence exercised by predecessors in the domestic policy post like John D. Ehrlichman in the Nixon Administration and Stuart E. Eizenstat in the Carter Administration, gentle compromise was not a necessary building block for operations in that post. Nor is the office the petri dish for conservative ideological debate that it was in the Reagan years. Under Mr. Porter, the let's-cut-them-off-at-the-knees attitude that sometimes prevailed in the past has given way to a let-us-reason-together-without-spending-money attitude.
Once the domestic policy office could dictate terms to the Office of Management and Budget. Now Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, as brainy and strong-willed as his close ally Mr. Sununu, dictates the terms to the domestic policy office.
 
A Technician, Not a Strategist
''Porter becomes less a principal and more a staffer for Sununu,'' said one White House insider. ''He's more a technician than a strategist.'' But in George Bush's White House, the likes of Mr. Porter and Mr. Reilly can be comfortable - even when others seem to be dominating their fields.
''I do not sense a contest or competition there,'' Mr. Porter says of Mr. Darman, with whom he shared teaching duties a decade ago at Harvard's Kennedy School for courses like managing Federal policy development.
Mr. Darman had the brazen dash in the classroom, Mr. Porter the quiet charm. Those who know both men say their talents are still complementary.
Mr. Porter is skilled at taking the issue of the moment, finding out where everyone stands, clarifying and organizing their positions, and presenting them to the President in a fair way.
''He was born to process,'' a colleague said of Mr. Porter.
Mr. Darman has a rare ability for taking the issue of the moment and developing a strategy on how it will play three years hence.
 
Complaints Over Bush Policy
The Administration has astutely tried to co-opt some Democratic issues, like child care and the environment, but complaints are growing noisier that, on domestic policy, Mr. Bush speaks loudly but carries a small stick.
The Administration's transportation policy, in which the budget office removed or changed references to Federal spending, ''crystallizes why this Administration's domestic agenda is devoid of policy,'' Senator Mitchell said. ''Essentially, the transportation policy is a catalogue of what's wrong in the country, trying to dump the responsibility off on states and local government. It's the opposite of Federal policy.''
Mr. Porter demurs. ''It is wrong to equate Federal leadership with Federal spending,'' he said.
Mr. Porter played point for the Administration's at the February education summit conference, where the President and the governors agreed on objectives to improve results in education. But educators were dubious that the goals, including making American students the first in the world in mathematics and science by the turn of the century, could be achieved.
 
Compromise on Clean Air Law
As to the first revision of the nation's clean air laws since 1977, though environmentalists agree that Mr. Bush is more sensitive to their cause than Ronald Reagan was, they complain that the compromise catered too much to business interests.
But Administration officials were surprised and thrilled that Mr. Porter pulled a compromise together. Even Democrats like Senator Michell, who day by day is forced to beat off challenges to the compromise by fellow Democrats, came away praising the domestic policy adviser as even-tempered, open-minded and candid.
Mr. Porter says this patient style will work. ''As Gorbachev has learned, you can't turn around a country from the top,'' Mr. Porter said. ''It has to come from the bottom.''

HEADLINE: The Health Cost Explosion, Evaded

 BODY:
America's tattered health insurance system cries out for reform. Congress turned for guidance to a bipartisan commission that now offers some useful ideas. But it evades the central issue. The commission boldly proposes an $86 billion-a-year plan to provide universal health insurance. But it doesn't say where the Federal share, $66 billion, would come from. 
Worse, it doesn't say how to keep medical costs from continuing to skyrocket. Ducking the question of which taxes to raise is forgivable. Ducking how to contain the ruinous inflation of medical costs is not.
Millions of Americans, unable to afford basic medical insurance, are terrorized by the prospect of costly illness. Even people of means face bankruptcy should they need long-term nursing care. That's why in 1988 Congress created the 15-member commission, named in honor of the late Representative Claude Pepper and headed by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, to propose reform.
The commission has now released a set of recommendations, notably to extend health insurance, including coverage for long-term nursing care. Under the plan, large employers would offer affordable basic insurance to employees or else pay into a public health plan. The public insurance would cover people otherwise uninsured, with subsidized rates for the poor.
In general, these ideas are sound. Rather than creating a Federal behemoth, the commission would graft universal coverage onto the existing structure of employer-based insurance. But successful reform of medical insurance requires more than general outlines.
Medical costs are soaring in large part because the nation relies on fee-for-service plans, under which patients pick their own doctors and receive insurance reimbursement for most costs. Doctors, hospitals and patients don't much care how much treatment costs because an insurance company winds up paying most of the bill. The system encourages unnecessary tests and exotic procedures.
To control costs, the commission calls for modest deductibles and co-insurance. But health finance experts - most notably Alain Enthoven of Stanford University - have shown that deductibles and co-insurance are an insufficient brake. Among the many reforms they recommend, two are essential:
Consumers must be made aware of costs. This requires limiting tax deductions for health insurance premiums to a fixed amount, enough for adequate coverage. A consumer would be free to buy a more expensive plan, but at his own expense, not that of the taxpayer.
This one change would make consumers sensitive to costs and open up the market to fierce competition from Health Maintenance Organizations and other alternatives to fee-for-service plans.
Health insurance must be ''managed.'' Individuals lack the expertise or time to shop intelligently for medical insurance. Professor Enthoven would rely upon corporate sponsors - or a public sponsor for those without employer-based coverage - to formulate options and monitor quality.
By ignoring details like tax subsidies and managed care, the Pepper Commission renders many of its recommendations unenforceable. For example, the commission would require that private insurers enroll the sick as well as the healthy. But without careful scrutiny by knowledgeable corporate sponsors, this provision would be easily evaded.
Congress had the right to expect its commission, after a year of study, to face up to the complexities of health insurance. Instead, Congress got a wish list that skirts the central problem of cost control. America has lost a year.

HEADLINE: Retooling for Peace Will Take Some Planning;
No Windfall

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 8 and 9 editorials join the bandwagon for the ''peace dividend,'' determining its magnitude and suggesting where it can be spent. But the dividend comes from reducing the size of the armed forces and from cutting the procurement of weapons. Have you given serious thought to what these steps mean? 
Troops removed from Europe will have to be demobilized; there are not sufficient bases to house them domestically. What will be the effect of dumping several hundred thousand young men and women into the economy? These are reasonably well screened and motivated young people. They will shove the current population off the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. This will lead to increased welfare costs and more money into the war on drugs, which are the palliative of the forlorn and hopeless.
And what about the weapons programs? The money spent goes into the economy. It pays for engineers, scientists, mechanics and secretaries. What will these people do? If the last slowdown in the aerospace industry is any example, they too will push people off the bottom of the economic ladder. Aerospace engineers have demonstrated that they can drive taxicabs. The barely English-literate drivers who make up a great deal of the driver force will be consigned to the welfare rolls. So much for the ''peace dividend.'' It will be spent on the same people it is being spent on today, only less effectively and with a poorer outcome.
The oft-touted solution of converting defense industries to civilian industries is not an answer. If there were demand for civilian products that defense contractors could produce, they would be in the business already.
The reason there will be no peace dividend is that in the long run the money is being spent on people, and they will not go away. We may restructure our society, but we will not reap any windfall to squander on social excess.

HEADLINE: All Apartment Dwellers Would Feel Co-op Crash

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Dan Hurley may look forward to New York City's economic collapse (''Co-op Crash: Just Fine With Me,'' Op-Ed March 11), but he might not be so happy with the result.
The lawyers, dentists and financial analysts he derogates, along with nurses, police officers, teachers, auto mechanics and others, have invested hundreds of millions in co-op apartments. Building owners have spent some $250 million on improvements to buildings being converted.
No public funds were used to save and restore this housing. More minorities live in co-op buildings than were renters in those buildings before. While rent regulation helped destroy housing for the poor, co-op conversion salvaged buildings for working families.
The recent downturn in real estate values has many causes - the national economy and New York's overreliance on the financial services industry are just two. But Federal and local tax policies clearly make things worse. Real estate is not the favored investment it once was in America. Locally, increases in assessments and tax rates are squeezing all apartment owners, whether they own just their own apartment or an entire building. Renters are feeling pressure too, as taxes become a big factor in legal rent increases and some building owners have to defer maintenance expenses to pay tax bills.
If Mr. Hurley looks forward to a day when the co-op owners are forced out and he can find a nice home near the city cheap, I hope he likes living alone.

BYLINE: By Dave Durenberger; Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, is a member of the Senate Finance Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
''Adopt my plan to fix the budget deficit - or come up with a better one.'' That's the challenge issued by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, should be applauded for his courage in urging Washington to meet the budget deficit head on. But there are any number of ways to broaden the tax base and raise revenues that would be more equitable than his proposals. 
The gaping pothole standing in Mr. Rostenkowski's way is his proposal to increase Federal taxes by nearly $200 billion during the next five years. Not user fees, not ''loophole closers'' -just clean, straight, new taxes.
President Bush's 1988 ''no new taxes'' pledge has yet to be etched in marble on a monument overlooking the Potomac. So, if we're going to raise taxes, let's do it in an effective and fair way.
I don't think Mr. Rostenkowski does that. He discards several important principles while disposing of President Bush's pledge.
First, Mr. Rostenkowski would suspend indexing of the tax rates for individuals for one year - a $50 billion tax increase. This would be seriously misguided.
Taxpayers are protected from paying higher taxes when inflation drives them into higher tax brackets by the practice of indexing the personal exemption, the standard deduction and the dollar level of each bracket. Middle class and working-poor families benefit the most from the personal exemption and the standard deduction. Suspending indexing would hit these groups the hardest, not the high-income taxpayers who itemize deductions and cannot claim personal exemptions.
Second, Mr. Rostenkowski wants to increase excise taxes. These are the most regressive form of taxation.
Excise taxes are the third largest source of revenue for financing state and local government operations. With the hundreds of mandates passed to them from Washington over the past 10 years, states cannot afford to lose these revenues to the Federal Government. For example, the gasoline tax is used for construction and maintenance of highways. Increasing that tax to reduce the deficit deprives states of a potential source of revenue for expanding efforts to stop the deterioration of the highway system.
Third, Mr. Rostenkowski proposes to raise the top tax rate for individuals to 33 percent from 28 percent. This is as unnecessary as it is unfair. A top tax rate of 33 percent would in effect levy a higher tax on capital income than was levied when Jimmy Carter was President. In the past 10 years, Congress has striven to bring down tax rates while broadening the base of taxable income.
If we are going to open up the tax code to raise revenue, let's begin where we left off in the 1986 tax reform bill: taxing income that escapes all Federal taxation. For example, $33 billion in employer contributions to finance employee health benefits is tax free. And corporations are allowed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of employees' health insurance. If we taxed a small portion of employer-paid health insurance, we could raise almost $47 billion over five years.
There are other employer-paid fringe benefits that escape taxation: $50,000 worth of life insurance, assistance to care for dependents and educational assistance. If Congress imposed a 3 percent excise tax on the value of all nonretirement fringe benefits, including health insurance, it could raise more than $20 billion over five years.
And if Congress lowered the ceiling for tax-deductible contributions to private retirement plans, it could raise $16 billion over five years.
There are other options that ought to be considered before we raise income tax rates. For example, a 5 percent tax on the investment income of pension and other retirement plans would raise $37 billion. Taxing capital gains at death could raise $10 billion. A securities transfer tax of one-half of 1 percent would raise more than $57 billion over the next five years.
Yes, let's throw out the political timidity with which we handled the deficit in the 80's. But let's maintain some of the wise tax principles we established over the last decade.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The U.S. Intervenes

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Once again, and for the second time in a year, the United States has allowed Communist governments to dictate American foreign policy.
Both times Washington turned on its word and acted against the interests of an oppressed people seeking freedom. Soon that may not even be news.
Both times the Bush Administration justified its actions by arguing that the rulers had to be placated, helped and bolstered to avoid chaos. 
In China the Bush Administration promised that, as payoff for the secret missions and economic benefits, Beijing would loosen its tyranny.
The American desertion of the young people murdered in the streets of Beijing won their survivors nothing. The dictatorship is as stifling and brutal as ever.
At least now the United States is not promising the Lithuanian people that things will get better if they do not press for independence. They are spared that.
For a half-century, ever since the Hitler-Stalin pact turned the three Baltic nations over to Soviet imprisonment, the United States has proudly said it would never accept their captivity. George Bush ran as Vice President on Republican platforms saying that kind of thing.
So much for that. Now at the moment of decision, the United States is telling the Lithuanians, ''Sorry but something just came up: Our interests and the interests of the Soviet Government happen to coincide.''
Washington tells them that we do not want any threat to the power of Mikhail Gorbachev and that since he feels Lithuanian independence is a threat, obviously we have to back off from it - and so should you.
Other nationalities that feel trapped in the Soviet Union are meant to hear and take notice.
The argument that Mr. Gorbachev is important to the United States is true. But insisting he is so vital to us and the world that peace and progress will perish if he feels threatened in any way has made the Government of the United States his prisoner.
This is a position that diminishes honor and sacrifices logic.
The U.S. did not bring Mr. Gorbachev to power and cannot keep him in power. The Soviet Politburo brought Mr. Gorbachev to power. Its members were desperate for a man of change who could save their collapsing system from being wiped out entirely by internal explosion. Mr. Gorbachev stunned them and the world with his imagination and flexibility.
But if his hold is really so tenuous that he cannot deal with the Baltic independence movements without the force he already has used in Lithuania, and the plain threat of more in reserve, nothing can save him. Lithuania was the first to strike out for freedom; it will not be the last, despite Washington.
For all the years of its existence, the Soviet Union was for many of the nationalities not a country of their choice but a fence preventing their escape. Massive Soviet military power made the world forget that -until the whole society began cracking apart.
But if force and fear continue to be the only way Mr. Gorbachev can deal with the problem, built into the very structure of the Soviet Union, then the explosion will indeed come.
Even before that, the political and intellectual openness he has helped bring to his country will wither.
Already, in its first real test, glasnost was thrown out the Gorbachev window. Foreigners were ordered out of Lithuania. The Soviet press, radio and TV resumed submissive posi-tions as apologists and provocateurs for the Government.
This brought no loud protest from abroad. The Western world, particularly the United States, is once again making the mistake of putting all its hopes in one man. This over-personalization of politics blinds us to his weaknesses and often to his destiny - remember the Shah, Marcos, Khrushchev.
The United States should not damage Mr. Gorbachev if it decently can avoid doing so. But neither should we obediently follow him or intervene on his side against those dreaming of escaping the Soviet Union, individually or as a nationality.
And we are intervening. Going back on our word, keeping silence about the force and psychological warfare being used against the Lithuanians -that is intervention against Lithuania.
Once more Washington is depriving a struggling people of the one powerful asset they thought they had - the moral and political backing of the United States.
Once more American power reached to help Communist power. How long will that be news?

HEADLINE: Defendant Silent as Defense Rests in L.I. Slaying

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., March 28

 BODY:
The defense in the Robert Golub murder trial rested its case today without calling Mr. Golub to the stand, insuring that the jury's verdict will depend almost entirely on circumstantial evidence.
Mr. Golub, who is 22 years old and unemployed, is charged with killing Kelly Ann Tinyes, 13, a neighbor from Valley Stream. Kelly disappeared on March 3, 1989. Her beaten, slashed and strangled body was found the next day in a closet in the basement of the Golub family's house on Horton Road. 
There was no confession and no witnesses to the crime, so the prosecutor, Daniel Cotter, based his case on physical evidence, focusing on a bloody palm print and smears of blood found at the scene. The defense's burden, then, was to call experts to raise doubts about the prosecution's witnesses. And the jury will decide whose experts were more credible.
The defense lawyer, Salvatore Marinello, has said repeatedly that the law requires him only to raise reasonable doubt of guilt. ''This is a scientific case,'' he said today. ''And we did what the defense needed to do.''
The case was puzzling from the start because the defendent had no criminal record and no known history of violence. Nor did he know Kelly Tinyes except by sight; she was an acquaintance of his brother John, 14.
 
Prosecution Works Backwards
So Mr. Cotter, presenting the prosecution's case in Nassau County Court, worked backwards. First he established that the Golub house had limited access and that only Robert Golub, his parents, brother, and two of his brother's friends were known to have been there the afternoon Kelly disappeared.
Then, using experts in the analysis of blood, fingerprints, bite marks and hair, Mr. Cotter tried to show that physical evidence at the scene proved that only Robert Golub could have killed her.
Mr. Marinello's strongest rebuttal testimony came from dentists who said that wounds on Kelly's neck and left buttock were not bite marks inflicted by Mr. Golub, as the prosecution contended. Three witnesses, including the chief forensic dentist for the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, said the marks could not have been made by Mr. Golub's teeth.
Today, however, Dr. Neal R. Riesner, chief forensic dentist for Westchester County, testified on rebuttal for the prosecution that the buttock wound was a bite mark inflicted by Mr. Golub. Further, he said, one of the defense's witnesses, Dr. Norman D. Sperber, had misnumbered the teeth in testimony earlier this week.
Dr. Riesner's testimony left the impression that Dr. Sperber had based his conclusions on this misnumbering. But in testifying earlier on his analysis, Dr. Sperber did not make this mistake.
The crux of the prosecution's case is that stains on Kelly's clothing and on three attache cases in which the clothing was found showed genetic markers consistent with Mr. Golub's blood. One witness, Lorah McNally of the Lifecodes Corporation, a genetics-testing laboratory, said blood found smeared on the top of two of the cases matched the DNA ''fingerprint'' of Mr. Golub so closely that only one in 707 million people had such a pattern.

HEADLINE: State, or Labor Market, May Set Higher Minimum

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 28

 BODY:
Even before it goes into effect Sunday, the new national minimum wage of $3.80 an hour is out of date here.
California has already established state minimum wages of $4.25 an hour, as have Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon. In Alaska, the minimum wage will increase to $4.30 from $3.85 the same day the new Federal minimum wage takes effect. 
And in places where the economy is generally healthy and the demand for workers is strong, it does not matter what the statute says. Employers must offer a premium or they will not find anyone to hire.
When it hires janitors, the Atrium Club, a private social and fitness club in Manhattan, must pay $5 to $6 an hour, said Joseph Roland, the club's manager. He said the New York labor market was too tight for him to consider offering anyone the minimum wage.
 
Supply and Demand in New York
''It's just supply and demand,'' Mr. Roland said. ''If you have a qualified person, you're not going to be able to pay them minimum wage.''
At Urban Outfitters in Philadelphia, a store that sells clothing and housewares for younger people, the manager, Lara Goldstein, said she could not possibly offer any employee the minimum wage.
''Most retail stores in this area pay between $4 and $5 an hour,'' she said. ''If we only paid minimum wage, they would find a better job somewhere else.''
The same is true in Los Angeles. ''To work in a restaurant, I'd expect to earn at least $6 an hour,'' said Michelle Breslow, who lives in La Canada, an affluent suburb north of downtown Los Angeles, and works part time in the catering business.
A variety of economic and political factors explain why some states impose a minimum wage higher than the Federal one, as is their right, said Richard B. McKenzie, a University of Mississippi professor who has written extensively on the subject.
Generally, he said, the wage goes up, often beyond the official minimum, wherever the job market is tight, because of either economic expansion or a worker shortage.
 
'Market Ahead of Politicians'
''The labor market is ahead of the politicians in this issue here,'' said Jeff Hannum, an economist with Oregon's Employment Division of the State Department of Human Resources. ''In Oregon, anybody paying less than $4.50 an hour is probably having quite a bit of difficulty finding people.''
Jim Glasgow, vice president of operations at Trans Pacific Restaurants Inc. of Irvine, Calif., which operates 16 restaurants in the state, said his dishwashers earned $4.75 to $6.50 an hour.
In California, the Industrial Welfare Commission raised the state's minimum hourly wage to $4.25 from $3.35 in 1987 after studying economic data and holding public hearings. Employer groups opposed any increase because they said it would hurt the economy; citizen groups argued that a higher minimum was necessary to make a living.
In Oregon, the State Legislature raised the minimum wage in several steps to $4.25. Next January, it will increase again to $4.75.
The current mimimum rate is often too low. ''I can still hire some of the younger kids at $4.25,'' said David Butters, general manager of an El Pollo Loco fast food restaurant in Hillsboro, Ore., near Portland. ''But if I want to look for full-time or day help I have to pay anywhere form $4.50 to $6 to generate any interest.''

HEADLINE: Electronics: It's Not Home Without It

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
FOR generations of Americans, setting up a home meant buying furniture, bedspreads, china and cutlery. But to a generation raised on omnipresent audio and video gadgets, the hope chest is electronic.
Videocassette recorders, compact disk players, cordless telephones and other electronic equipment represent an increasing chunk of the budget, a good indicator of the priorities of the American family today.
Since 1980, personal spending on electronics has grown by 45 percent, from 1.1 percent annually to 1.6 percent, said Clint McCully, chief of the consumption branch of the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Department. In 1989, spending on electronics amounted to $54.6 billion. By comparison, spending on furniture did not change at all during the 80's; it remains at 5 percent of annual personal consumption. 
The money for electronics could be coming from a number of places. The percentage of the budget devoted to clothing and shoes has dropped from 6.3 percent to 5.7 percent; to food, from 20.2 percent to 17.1 percent; and to gasoline, from 4.8 percent to 2.4 percent.
Personal spending for entertainment outside the home - on movies, plays, concerts and spectator sports - also dropped during the decade, from four-tenths of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. Personal consumption data include all expenditures except taxes, interest payments and savings.
The last 10 years have brought a revolution in the relationship between Americans and home electronics. Much of what many Americans have come to regard as standard equipment for the home was virtually unavailable 10 years ago: the portable cassette player, the videocassette recorder, the telephone answering machine, the home computer, cordless phones, CD players. This was, after all, the decade that made the LP obsolete.
Witold Rybczynski, an architecture professor at McGill University in Montreal who wrote ''Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' said in an interview that electronics has taken over roles servants used to play. He cited the answering machine as an example. And electronic devices ''seem almost foolproof,'' he added.
''They almost never break down. It's a painless kind of ownership, compared to, say, a lawn mower.''
Whether they are passionate consumers who study the newest products or indifferent ones who buy only the basics, people no longer view electronic devices as luxuries. The equipment has become so familiar in just a decade that it has become unremarkable, like a stove or a refrigerator. Percy Quartey, who lives in Brooklyn in a two-bedroom apartment with his wife and two children, has two televisions, a VCR, two telephones, a stereo system with a tape deck and CD player, and an answering machine. ''This is like a necessity,'' he said.
Mitchell Blank, a 29-year-old New Yorker, lives with his wife in a one-bedroom apartment where they have two color television sets, two CD players, a tape recorder, three telephones and two VCR's. When it comes to more traditional home furnishings, though, he has ''just a couple of couches and a bedroom set.'' Even if he had a sudden windfall, he said he would not go out and buy furniture. ''It totally has to do with my value system,'' he said.
Mr. Blank, who went to law school and worked in commercial real estate before turning to selling baseball cards, said most consumers are looking for psychological benefits when they buy electronic equipment. ''People identify the technology with being up, being current with social change,'' he said.
Some, though, seem to have accumulated the equipment in spite of themselves. Alan Zweibel, a TV producer who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and three children, admitted, with chagrin, that they have five televisions, three VCR's and nine telephones. ''I don't know why,'' he said. ''I had a very happy childhood, and we never had a phone in the garage.''
Many people don't seem aware of how much equipment they have. Hughes Torres, who was shopping for computer software in New York earlier this week, at first said he did not have much electronic equipment. But on questioning, it turned out that he owned two TV sets, two VCR's, a video camera, a stereo and a computerized watch.
Gerry Gerrard, who was buying a second VCR for business reasons, said he did not have a lot of equipment in his home, just a VCR, two televisions and ''the usual CD and cassette.'' He and his wife, Olga, who run their business from their living room, don't even have a sofa.
''We sit on office chairs or on cushions on the floor,'' he said. Despite that, he thinks that the electronic devices make the quality of home entertainment so much better that ''we're more likely to stay home.''
Barbra Green, who lives in a studio apartment in New York, said she has a television, VCR, answering machine and stereo, but considers them her least important household possessions. But she said she uses the VCR every day to tape ''Days of Our Lives.'' By bringing work and entertainment into the home, the profusion of electronic devices has made the entire concept of home more fluid: it is a terminal, and a surprisingly mobile one. Danny Louie said that when he and his wife go out, their three children can reach them through his pager. Mr. Louie, who lives in Cranford, N.J., said he plans to buy a high-definition TV set when it becomes available.
The technology, he said, ''only gets better.'' When he updates, he puts the old equipment in the basement. ''After it's rusting,'' he said, ''you throw it out.''
The industry happily obliges such hunger. Indeed, the newer products experience the fastest rate of increase: sales of cellular telephones are expected to grow 37 percent this year, and those of compact disk players 15 percent.
Although richer households obviously spend more on electronics, this is not a yuppie phenomenon: even people who don't have projection TV's in their homes are buying a lot of electronic equipment. Sales of color TV's were a record 22 million sets last year, according to the Electronic Industries Association, a trade group based in Washington.
Many of those sets were the second and third in a household. More than 75 percent of color TV sets are still in use after 10 years, according to a 1985 study by Market Facts, a Chicago-based market research company that surveyed more than 12,000 households.
A Gallup Organization study in June 1988 for the Electronic Industries Association found that the presence of children in a household is the most likely indicator that electronic equipment will be purchased. ''Even households with income under $20,000 are buying camcorders,'' said Tom Lauterback, a spokesman for the association.
''People are willing to forego some of the other things to capture the baby's first steps on video.''
The products don't cost much more than they did 10 years ago, and in some cases less, so the dollars spent don't reflect their increasing importance. More telling are the numbers, which show that once-unusual devices are now common. For instance, 17 percent of households had VCR's in 1985, but now 68 percent do, the Electronic Industries Association says.
The American house has yet to catch up with the changes. Cords snake under rugs and along walls, getting tangled in one another. Remote control devices pile up on the coffee table.
With no startling new products in sight that promise to become mandatory in every household, the industry is focusing on ways to make existing products more useful. By the end of this year, the Electronic Industries Association expects to develop standards for manufacturers to make equipment that will tie together all the electronic devices in a household.
''I think the 90's is going to be the home automation decade,'' Mr. Lauterback said.

Weighing The Rights And Wrongs Of Welfare

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Tonight's edition of ''48 Hours,'' at 8 o'clock on CBS, digs into America's welfare system, which Dan Rather too accurately calls ''the helping hand that almost everyone hates.''
Concentrating on Wisconsin, where welfare payments are among the highest in the nation, the strongly reported hour focuses on a 35-year-old woman with five children and no husband; Caseworker No. 1479 in Milwaukee who has to handle 293 families; a young woman trying to earn a diploma; a 38-year-old family man, formerly on welfare, who works 100 hours a week at menial jobs to make sure he stays off it, and a cop assigned to hunting down fugitive fathers.
The reporting is sympathetic without being soppy. Learning from the first woman that her children all have different fathers, Bernard Goldberg exclaims, ''You picked all these guys!'' When she replies, yes, she made a mistake, he says, ''You made five mistakes.'' The issue, of course, is how much responsibility the state should bear for such mistakes. 
Even for those who seem better able to take advantage of what Wisconsin offers, the program shows, the difficulties are daunting. Under the state's ''learnfare'' program, which is being copied around the country, Wisconsin will help people get training and then pay medical insurance and child support for their first year on the job. But after that they are on their own, and as one 28-year-old single parent discovers, when that happens, even with a job, she will be in the red. Doug Tunnell, a correspondent, puts her predicament to Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who can provide little comfort. Indeed, the Governor is under pressure to toughen residency requirements to block the flow of jobless people drawn to Wisconsin by its relatively high benefits.
Untypically for television documentaries, the bureaucrats are seen to be as human as their clients. ''I wasn't hired to make moral judgments,'' says the case worker. But state officials have learned that the threat of a cut in benefits may be the only effective means of compelling a young mother to go to school.
The father-hunting cop is anything but punitive. He knows that putting feckless fathers in jail is politically popular, but he also knows that few of these men have any job skills.
The most heartening story here is also the most heart-rending. A father of seven, who holds down both a night job as a health aide and a day job helping a handicapped man, manages to attend classes and find time to play with his children. He catches naps along the way. Together, he and his wife earn $26,000 a year. ''I don't like feeling small,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Doubts Raised Over Bush's Tax Plan for Savings

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is counting on its proposed Family Savings Plan to generate more revenue than it would cost, but the Senate's chief tax writer is skeptical.
''That carries me back to 1981,'' when the Reagan Administration predicted that huge tax cuts would pay for themselves, Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Tuesday. ''Now we have these enormous deficits that in part were brought about by that 'magic,' '' the Texas Democrat said.
The Family Savings Plan is part of a package proposed by President Bush as an incentive to increase saving and investment. Under the plan, a person with an income of less than $60,000 could deposit up to $2,500 a year and pay no tax on the interest if the account was maintained for at least seven years. A couple earning less than $120,000 could deposit up to $5,000. 
 
Billions in Savings Seen
Sidney L. Jones, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for economic policy, told the Finance Committee that the proposal would generate $40 billion in new personal savings over the next five years.
He said the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the plan would increase saving and economic growth so much that it would lead ''to an increase in Government revenues as well as personal saving in the longer run.''
The Administration makes the same argument on behalf of the biggest part of the President's savings and investment package: a proposal to cut the tax on capital gains from sales of investments.
Some economists quarrel with the Administration's basic argument that a tax incentive will increase savings. They cite Individual Retirement Accounts as an example, saying that most of the money going into such accounts is simply transferred from existing accounts.
 
Conflicting Advice
The Finance Committee on Tuesday received conflicting advice on that point from two analysts associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group.
Jonathan Skinner of the University of Virginia said an I.R.A. - which provides a tax deduction for some taxpayers at the time a deposit is made - can increase savings by locking up an account until retirement. He predicted that Mr. Bush's plan, which would allow accounts to be cashed in after seven years, would lead to shuffling money between taxable and nontaxable accounts.
But Lawrence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University said, ''It is clear that saving policies of the last decade, such as expansion of I.R.A.'s, failed to promote national saving.'' He said a tax on consumption, like a national sales tax, would encourage saving.
The one point on which the economists, Administration witnesses and committee members agreed is that Americans save too little of their income, far less than Japanese and West Germans. The United States saving rate last year was 3.6 percent of net national income, compared with an average of 8.9 percent during the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's.
 
Benefits of Higher Savings
''Increased savings would lower the cost of capital for our nation's business, enhance the ability of American companies to compete in a global market and lower the cost of most goods and services we consume,'' said Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy.
The National Association of Counties complained that the savings plan would force up the cost of borrowing for highways, schools and other state and local building projects. Mary O. Boyle, a member of the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Commission, said the accounts would compete for the same savings dollars as the tax-exempt bonds on which states, cities and counties rely.
''Local governments would be forced to pay higher borrowing costs just to compete - an ultimate cost shift to all taxpayers,'' Ms. Boyle said. That would endanger the nation's system of highways, bridges and sewers, she said.
But Mr. Gideon said the new accounts ''will have at most a small impact on the tax-exempt bond market.''

HEADLINE: Company Profits Down; G.N.P. Growth at 1.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Profits of American companies fell by 3.2 percent in the final three months of 1989 mainly because of rising labor costs, the Commerce Department reported today.
For the full year, corporate profits from current production dropped by 8.3 percent; in 1988 they rose by 10 percent. The decline was the first significant drop since a 20.2 percent decrease in 1982, the most recent recession year.
While profits from current production are the purest gauge, the Commerce Department reports other measures of profits. Current-production cash flow - the internal funds available for investment - fell by three-tenths of 1 percent after rising by 1.9 percent in the third quarter. Profits before taxes eased by five-tenths of 1 percent after a 7.1 percent decline, and profits after taxes rose by 2.8 percent, the first quarterly gain in a year. 
 
Calculation of Growth
The profits report accompanied the department's latest calculation of the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter, now put at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 percent.
This suggested that the economy was slightly firmer than shown in last month's estimate of nine-tenths of 1 percent. The first estimate, in January, had said the gross national product expanded at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter.
The figures on corporate profits, although not unexpected, reinforced the worries of some analysts that corporations would not have the means or the incentive to invest in new plant and equipment during 1990.
 
Not a 'Painless Landing'
''This shows that a 'soft landing' is by no means synonymous with a painless landing,'' said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is now chief economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. ''One of the key questions now is whether this year is going to be dragged down by businesses responding to last year.''
A ''soft landing'' refers to the effort of policy makers, so far fairly successful, to restrain the economy enough to keep inflation under control without tipping the economy into a recession.
Profits are a principal source of money for expansion, the other being loans. Many lending institutions have, however, been tightening credit standards recently, with lending to smaller companies seeming to be the most seriously affected.
 
Higher Final Sales
The latest revision of the G.N.P. growth figure reflects higher final sales for most major components partly offset by a $4 billion downward adjustment in the growth of inventories. The gross national product measures the output of goods and services, and production adds to the G.N.P. even if the goods pile up on dealers' shelves. The latest data were considered something of a plus for the business outlook because it means inventories are under good control and production will not need to be scaled back to bring them into balance with sales.
The rise in the G.N.P. fixed-weighted price index, a measure of inflation, remained at 3.6 percent, up from 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
The 3.2 percent quarterly decline in profits reflected a fall-off of $9.5 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $285.7 billion. Profits would have been far worse had it not been for a sharp increase in earnings abroad.
The foreign component jumped $9.7 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This represents the amount by which dividends paid to United States residents and reinvested earnings of foreign affiliates of American companies exceed corresponding amounts paid to foreign residents.
 
Domestic Profits Down
Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations skidded by $13.9 billion, far more than the $3.8 billion decline in the preceding three months. Gross corporate product rose while profits per unit of real product fell; lower unit profits reflected difficulty in raising prices combined with higher costs.
Kenneth A. Petrick, a Commerce Department specialist, said much of the narrowing of profit margins reflected higher labor costs as companies appeared to hold on to workers in hopes that the economy would regain momentum.
Mr. Petrick also said the net interest costs of nonfinancial corporations seemed to have leveled off, suggesting diminishing pressure on profit margins this year. He acknowledged, however, that some of the interest reduction figure could be a reflection of defaults on debt.
Domestic profits of financial corporations fell by $5.2 billion during the quarter, less than half the third-quarter drop of $10.8 billion, which reflected large costs incurred by casualty insurers because of hurricane and earthquake damage. The fourth-quarter decline reflected the problems of banks and savings and loan associations.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1989 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rose by 3.1% In February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
High interest rates and declining consumer confidence depressed sales of new homes in February, although they bounced back slightly from steep declines in the previous two months, the Commerce Department said today.
New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000 units in February after plummeting by 6.8 percent in January and a revised 8 percent in December.
But the February rate, though rising by 3.1 percent from January, was still below the 649,000 homes sold in 1989 and, except for January, the lowest since 556,000 homes were sold on an annual basis last March. Sales totaled 589,000 in January. 
 
Risk of Higher Rates
''The housing industry has been adversely affected by the increase in mortgage rates in January and February,'' said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''I don't see much of a decline in rates in the months ahead, and there's a substantial risk that they will go higher in the second half.''
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, also pointed to weakness in the economy, including slower job growth, as contributing to a decline in consumer confidence and thus softer sales.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said interest on fixed-rate mortgages rose from 10.17 percent at the beginning of February to 10.31 percent, before falling to 10.23 percent at the end of the month.
 
Psychological Barrier
Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, called the 10 percent level a psychological barrier that was keeping the housing market a little weaker than at the end of 1989, when rates dropped into single digits.
John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, also blamed high mortgage rates for a 2.3 percent decline in the sales of existing homes last month. The association said the February pace was the slowest in seven months.
Many analysts had expected sales to surge with the unusually warm weather in January and February after the fourth-coldest December on record. But Mr. Obrinsky said the median time to find a house was about seven weeks, ''so that some that sat on the sidelines in December may still be looking but haven't found their house yet.'' He added, ''It's possible we could see some further increases in March and April.''
Sales were up 21.3 percent, to 256,000 units at an annual rate, in the South, more than rebounding from a 16.3 percent decline in January. But sales fell elsewhere in the nation.
They were down 18 percent, to 82,000 units, in the Northeast, 6.4 percent, to 88,000 units, in the Midwest, and 1.6 percent, to 181,000 units, in the West.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Post Slight Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were slightly higher for the week that ended yesterday.
Analysts at Donoghue's do not expect yields to change much until a clearer picture of the economy, free of the distortions in the winter statistics, emerges from economic data to come in the next few months.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund increased 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.98 percent, while the 30-day average yield increased a basis point, to 7.95 percent. 
 
Increase in Consumer Funds
Assets of taxable funds rose $821 million for the week, to a total of $385.2 billion, with institutional assets down $94 million, to $80.3 billion, and consumer assets up $915 million, to $304.9 billion. There was a noticeable increase in the flow of money into consumer funds this week.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased to 45 days, from 44. Fund managers are now holding securities in their portfolios longer than usual, because they are not concerned with the Federal Reserve's tightening of credit, which stands to raise short-term rates.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million surveyed by IBC/ Donoghue's, the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation of Garden City, L.I., had the highest yield for the sixth consecutive week. The fund reported a return of 8.86 percent, up from 8.83 percent last week.
 
Tax-Exempt Yields Rise
Yields of tax-exempt funds were also up for the week.
Assets decreased $41 million in the week, to $77.4 billion, with the average seven-day compounded yield up 6 basis points, to 5.48 percent. The increase was only half as large as that of a week before.
The taxable equivalent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is 7.61 percent, and about 8.18 percent for investors in a 33 percent bracket.
Donoghue's said the top spot among tax-free funds was shared by the Evergreen Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund, distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation of Boston, and the Calvert Tax-Free Reserves Money Market Fund, distributed by the Calvert Group of Washington. Each posted a 6.06 percent return, about 58 basis points points better than the seven-day average.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 30, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about money market funds misidentified the distributor of Evergreen Tax-Exempt Fund. It is the Evergreen Asset Management Corporation.

Allure of Spain's Phone Company

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher

 BODY:
THE national telephone monopoly of Spain, Telefonica de Espana S.A., is most popular with investors and stock analysts who use its services least.
American investors, who see growth potential in the earnings of the company and are not familiar with its poor service, have been buying the stock heavily for the last three years. Spanish investors, who use Telefonica's lines every time they pick up a phone, have been sellers. As a result, control over nearly $1.3 billion worth of Telefonica stock, or 17.4 percent, has crossed the Atlantic. The Spanish Government holds 35 percent of the shares. 
Buying stock when the locals are selling is always risky, and so far the Spanish seem to have had the best of the deal. American depository receipts, each representing three shares of Telefonica stock, have climbed modestly since they began trading at $20.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on June 12, 1987. They closed 12.5 cents higher yesterday, at $23.625.
Telefonica's shares have underperformed broader stock market indexes in both countries, and have done poorly compared with most large American long-distance and local telephone companies. Now some previously bullish American stock analysts are beginning to echo the concerns of European analysts.
But so far the trans-Atlantic flows of Telefonica stock continue to be westbound. Demand for the A.D.R.'s in New York has been so strong that American investment banks have been buying shares in Madrid and depositing them with the Banco de Santander and J. P. Morgan & Company to create new depository receipts for sale in New York. Since the initial sale of 18 million in 1987, 53.5 million more worth $1.264 billion have been created by this process, said Angel Garcia, a spokesman for Telefonica.
Several American analysts have recommended the stock because its price-earnings ratio is low using American accounting standards, the Spanish economy is growing and many Spaniards still need telephone service. Using American accounting standards, Telefonica trades at only five times earnings, the lowest ratio of any leading international telephone company.
Telefonica has been especially popular with American mutual fund managers. Fidelity Group mutual funds, led by Fidelity Equity Income, have accumulated eight million depository receipts worth $189 million.
Yet as fast as American institutions buy up the stock, more has come over from Spain. The 71.5 million depository receipts outstanding now represent a fifth of Telefonica's outstanding stock. Leonard S. Hyman, a foreign-telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, has recommended Telefonica's stock since it was first offered in New York and continues to do so.
Spanish and other European analysts have been less enthusiastic about Telefonica. The stock's price-earnings ratio is nearly 10 using Spanish accounting standards, which require much faster depreciation than American standards, and many other Spanish companies have comparable ratios.
More important, Telefonica has begun a huge investment program to bring its network, the ninth largest in the world, up to international standards. Last month the company predicted that it would increase its investment again this year, by 20 percent, to $6.2 billion. The spending will nearly equal Telefonica's entire 1989 sales.
Telefonica is borrowing almost half the cost of its investment program. Efforts by Spanish monetary authorities to curb growth in foreign borrowing have obliged Telefonica to raise money mostly in Spain, where the interest rate on one-year Spanish Treasury bills now stands at 13.5 percent.
High interest costs are likely to prevent Telefonica from showing appreciable growth in earnings per share or raise its dividend until 1993 at the earliest, said Ignacio Gomez Montejo, the research director at FG Inversiones Bursatiles S.A., a Madrid brokerage.
After-tax earnings grew 8.9 percent last year, to $628 million. ''The earnings just weren't coming through,'' said James M. McCabe, a telecommunications analyst in the New York office of Nomura Securities who downgraded Telefonica a month ago from a short-term buy to a neutral rating.
Yet the investment is badly needed, because Spain's rapid economic growth in the late 1980's outpaced the expansion of Telefonica's operations, and the waiting times for new lines in Spain stretched to a year and a half in rural areas. Telefonica says that new investment is improving service, but there has been a deluge of complaints.
Huge American purchases of Telef'onica may have actually become an additional drag on the company's stock. Unlike European institutions, American institutions have bought very few shares in Madrid, preferring the convenience and faster settlement periods of trading Telef'onica's depository receipts in New York.
Some Spanish money managers now fret that American investors may someday decide to reduce their Telefonica holdings and start buying other Spanish stocks, so that their results would more closely reflect the performance of the Spanish stock market as a whole, Mr. Gomez Montejo said. If that happens, he added, Telef'onica's share price would be likely to fall sharply.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 6.75 Points in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks went nowhere yesterday in slow trading, plodding ahead by 6.75 points, to 2,743.69, in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Heavy buying and selling in computerized program trading almost canceled each other out, traders said.
Volume rose to 142.3 million shares, from 131.6 million the previous day, with 724 issues advancing and 731 declining. 
The Dow rose for the third time this week, but traders said many people were waiting for March employment figures, due on April 6, before committing more money to the market.
Traders said they were also waiting for the new Japanese fiscal year, which starts on Sunday, to see how heavily the Japanese moved into the American bond market. Big Japanese bond buying would bring down interest rates here - and help American stocks.
Others said they were particularly concerned yesterday about what they called disappointing earnings by Oracle Systems, a high-flying computer company. Oracle headed the Nasdaq's most-active list, sliding by 7 7/8, to 17 1/2, with a record 20.61 million shares, or 16 percent of the company, changing hands.
Wall Street professionals contented themselves with what seemed to be a slow, steady return to takeover fever.
Apple Bancorp, the New York-based savings bank, jumped by 9 1/8, or 28.3 percent to 41 3/8, in the wake of a $38-a-share offer to shareholders from Stanley Stahl, a New York developer who is a large stockholder.
American General, the insurer, headed the Big Board's active list, soaring by 8 1/8, to 40 1/8, on 4.26 million shares after Torchmark, another insurer, offered $50 a share for half the stock and $50 in Torchmark stock for the rest. American called the offer ''unsolicited.''
Amax, the mining company, jumped by 2 5/8, to 28 5/8, on 2.18 million shares, on rumors that it would soon get an offer of $42 a share. The financial columnist Dan Dorfman had said in USA Today 10 days ago that a group headed by Peter Kiewit Sons and a Norwegian company were working on a deal.
Chemicals, utilities, paper, drugs, oil and metals were all strong, while computer issues were weak - except for I.B.M., which rose 1 3/8, to 105 7/8. The Nasdaq index fell 2.81 points, to 436.69, while the Amex market-value index fell 0.65 point, to 361.23, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.50 point, to 342.00.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cocoa Hits 7-Month Highs On Concern Over Exporters

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cocoa futures prices surged to seven-month highs yesterday amid fears that political and economic crises could disrupt exports from the Ivory Coast and Brazil, the world's two largest cocoa producers.
Uncertainty about Brazil's changing economic policies also supported gains in futures prices of sugar and coffee.
On other commodity markets, soybean futures tumbled, copper futures rose sharply, precious metals were mixed, petroleum futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures advanced. 
Cocoa futures settled $39 to $47 higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May at $1,164 a ton, the highest settlement price of a near-month contract since Aug. 18.
''It was an explosive move, one of the biggest moves I've seen in a long, long time,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
 
Producer Near Bankruptcy
Civil unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has kept the market on edge for the last six weeks after austerity measures aimed at saving the once-prosperous West African nation from bankruptcy were put into effect.
The market was further supported by rumors that the Brazilian Government had suspended all commodity exports while it untangled bureacratic problems created by economic changes announced two weeks ago.
After the markets closed, the Brazilian Government said that coffee and sugar exports were in effect suspended because of the abolition of two Government agencies that had been responsible for authorizing such shipments.
The Government said cocoa exports were not affected, but that cocoa shipments had been moving slowly because of seasonal factors.
Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy selling fueled by reports of ideal harvesting weather for the South American crop and forecasts for rain in the Midwest and northern Great Plains.
Copper futures soared on New York's Commodity Exchange, partly reflecting a resumption of Japanese buying in the physical market. Copper settled 1.9 cents to 4.25 cents higher, with April at $1.205 a pound. The March contract expired at $1.225.
In petroleum trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents lower to 12 cents higher, with May at $20.08 a barrel; heating oil was 0.50 cent lower to 0.40 cent higher, with April at 55.73 cents a gallon.
Strong cash markets and bullish chart signals helped raise livestock and meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Study Rejects View That Decontrol Cut Air Fares

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The first study of United States airline fares to account for changes in jet-fuel costs has found that contrary to the Government's recent findings, inflation-adjusted fares have risen since the industry was deregulated in 1979.
The study was released today by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit Washington research institution generally identified with liberals. It also found that airline service has declined since deregulation. 
The study, the latest of several completed in recent years by study groups and government agencies, is likely to fuel the debate on whether airline deregulation has fulfilled its promise of providing lower fares and better service.
 
'Nothing to Do With Deregulation'
Other studies have not taken into account that the price of jet fuel fell 50 percent during the 1980's and that airplanes became more fuel-efficient. ''These changes had nothing to do with deregulation,'' said the author of the new study, Paul Stephen Dempsey, a professor at the University of Denver. Recently, jet fuel prices have begun to rise again, and some airlines have raised fares as a result.
The new study challenges a comprehensive review by the Department of Transportation released in February. The Government study found that air fares were, on average, lower than in 1979, when the airlines' routes, fares and finances were deregulated. The studies of both the Transportation Department and the Economic Policy Institute adjusted their figures for inflation.
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner is expected to arm himself with the department's study in an effort to ward off attempts to re-regulate the industry.
The Economic Policy Institute found that prices for the average traveler, adjusted for fuel costs, had risen 2.6 percent per mile since deregulation. What is more, the study said that because deregulation has spawned a hub-and-spoke system that has led to more circuitous routing, the cost per trip had risen by 8 percent to 33 percent, depending on the route.
Mr. Dempsey, a former lawyer for the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board who once argued in favor of deregulation, proposed that airlines be limited to one domestic hub, that ceilings be set on fares and that a Federal commission be established to regulate transportation. ''The time has come to roll back deregulation,'' the study said.
The study pointed to the consolidation of the industry as a reason for higher fares. The number of large carriers has shrunk to 29 from 39 in 1984, and 8 carriers now control more than 90 percent of the traffic.
 
'Competing Vigorously'
But the airlines say competition is as fierce as ever. ''We may have fewer carriers but those carriers are competing vigorously,'' said David Swierenga, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group.
Officials at the Transportation Department had not yet reviewed the study, a spokesman said.
The Transportation Department study had found that consumers enjoy more service to more cities, at lower fares, than they did before deregulation. Between 1984 and 1988, fares fell 15 percent on average, that study found. But the Government study also found that in eight cities where one carrier controlled most of the traffic, fares were on average 18.7 percent higher than at other cities.
The new study added that deregulation had also resulted in more flight delays, poorer service and, in the case of some rural communities, no airline service at all.

HEADLINE: For a Comfortable Old Age, Plan for Care, Experts Advise

SERIES: CARE OF THE ELDERLY: PRIVATE BURDENS, PUBLIC CHOICES - LAST OF FOUR ARTICLES.

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
As the average cost of a nursing-home stay climbs to nearly $30,000 a year, experts agree on one main piece of advice for those concerned about preparing for their old age: plan early for long-term care.
The experts say people should not rely solely on their physicians for advice because doctors are often not familiar with the alternatives to nursing homes that are springing up and with the sometimes complicated financial planning that is necessary for a comfortable old age.
In general, the experts say, even people now middle-aged should begin to familiarize themselves with Government and private programs, like those providing at-home care for the elderly, and begin reading the consumer guides on long-term care that are increasingly available.
 
'Make Decisions Early'
''Often, people don't have access to enough information to make intelligent decisions about long-term care,'' said Monika White, associate director of the Senior Care Network of Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. The key, she said, ''is to make decisions early, before a crisis hits.'' 
Specialists in the field of long-term care say advice and guidance are widely available on the major points, from purchasing private long-term care insurance and determining Medicaid eligibility to coordinating care in the home. The problem is where to obtain the information.
More than a fifth of all elderly people require some form of long-term care at any given time, whether it is skilled attention in a nursing home or help at home with bathing and meals. Many receive assistance from their family members or friends but many need to rely on volunteers, community programs or paid help.
 
Savings Can Be Jeopardized
Only about one in seven 65-year-olds will ever spend a year or more in a nursing home, but lifetime savings can quickly disappear with the rising cost of those stays as well as the cost of professional care at home.
Typically, the elderly individual is forced to turn to Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for the poor and the only Government program covering long-term care. ''The common expression is that you almost have to go broke to get long-term care in this country,'' said Michio Suzuki, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Administration on Aging.
Being caught by the Medicaid safety net is usually a last resort, but gaining an understanding of the complex eligibility requirements can help impart a sense of control, social workers say. And that knowledge could aid in important decisions, like whether to buy private long-term care insurance or whether to pay off a mortgage early.
''There's a lot of planning a person can do, rich or poor,'' Dr. White said. ''There are programs and people you can turn to in most communities to help you make decisions for the future.''
That is not to say the choices are simple or easy. ''My friends always ask me what they should be doing,'' Mr. Suzuki said, ''and, frankly, it's a very hard question to answer.'' The Search Tenacity Pays Off In many parts of the country, support for the struggling elderly person living at home is just beyond the front door. Tenacity is the key to tracking it down.
''There's more to long-term care than stowing away money,'' said Jane A. Tilly, a senior analyst with the American Association of Retired Persons' Public Policy Institute in Washington. ''Are there volunteers out there? Are there public programs?''
This year, more than $1 billion allotted by Congress under the Older Americans Act will trickle down through state governments to the nation's 660 Area Agencies on Aging and, finally, to more than 10,000 centers for the elderly. Both the agencies, financed primarily by Federal funds, and the centers can be vital sources of information and aid.
Established in the early 1970's, the Area Agencies on Aging are charged with administering an array of non-medical services: home-delivered meals, health programs, adult day care, free transportation to doctors' offices, weekly trips to the supermarket and social activities.
The agencies use the ubiquitous senior center to reach the elderly in many towns and cities. Most services are free, but not necessarily widely offered because of constraints on staffing and local financing. ''Our primary goal is keeping the older person in the home and in the community for as long as possible,'' said Jonathan D. Linkous, the executive director of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging.
 
Specific Individual Plans
To coordinate the range of available health and support services, as well as helping individuals devise a way to pay for them, many agencies and organizations dealing with the elderly offer what they call case management, or service coordination. More than a third of the Area Agencies on Aging offer this service, as do many private home-care agencies, hospitals, insurance companies, senior centers and state and county offices, either free of charge or for a fee.
The Area Agencies on Aging can also steer an elderly person to companies that provide professional home care, with the cost usually ranging from $20 to $50 a day, depending on the number of hours the help is needed and the nature of the help.
One new source of money is available in some areas for the elderly who have significant equity in their homes. Some lenders are marketing what is known in the business as ''reverse mortgages'' in which the lender pays the homeowner. Under the terms of these mortgages, the homeowner is guaranteed monthly payments based on the equity they have in their homes until the day they die or move. When the house is sold, the lender is repaid through the proceeds. Government Help Sorting Out The Benefits Confusion abounds over the two major Government health care programs, Medicaid and Medicare, the Federal health insurance for the elderly, and their provisions for nursing home care.
Medicare pays for very limited long-term care. The plan pays for up to 100 days of skilled care in a nursing home after discharge from a hospital where the stay was at least three days, and in some cases it pays for skilled nursing care in the home for up to 38 days.
Medicaid covers long-term care, but only for those with relatively low assets or income. In many states it provides little support for home care. New York, a notable exception, will spend about $1.6 billion in state, Federal and local Medicaid funds this year to support about 80,000 people in their own homes. In addition, the state will spend $3.3 billion in Medicaid money to support an equal amount of patients in nursing homes.
By the Government's own admission, the system of requirements for Medicaid eligibility is bewildering. An outline of the requirements prepared by the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, the agency overseeing Medicaid, called it ''among the most complicated of any program administered by the Federal Government.''
One problem is that eligibility requirements vary greatly from state to state. Essentially, Medicaid requires that assets not exceed a certain level, usually about $2,000, for an individual, and that income be low or squeezed by medical bills. For elderly people with savings who are facing long-term care in an institution, this means they must spend nearly all of it on that care before they can qualify for Medicaid.
Once on Medicaid, the person must use all income on the nursing home costs, except for a monthly personal allowance, ranging from $30 to $50. Medicaid covers the remaining costs of care. The nursing home must be willing to accept Medicaid's relatively low rates, a requirement that serves to exclude the more expensive institutions.
 
Welcome Asset Change
A widely welcomed change in Medicaid came in 1988 with the passage of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act. Although Congress repealed most parts of that act last December, provisions protecting the spouse of a Medicaid patient in a nursing home from impoverishment were kept.
Before passage of the new provisions, the spouse at home in some states could keep no more than $2,250 in assets and monthly income of only a few hundred dollars a month. In other states, the spouse living outside the nursing home could keep whatever assets and income were in their names, a situation that was usually a boon to the husband but a burden to the wife.
Now, the wife or husband whose spouse enters a nursing home on Medicaid is allowed to keep at least $12,516 in assets or half of their combined assets, whichever is greater, as long as her half does not exceed $62,580. Some states have simply allowed the elderly to keep up to $62,580, eliminating the formula. In addition, states must allow the wife to retain a minimum monthly income of $856; states can raise that limit to $1,565.
 
Home and Auto Exempt
Because a home is often a person's largest investment, its fate is of particular interest to Medicaid recipients. The home is considered an exempt asset, along with automobile, furnishings and personal belongings, and the elderly person does not have to sell it and ''spend down'' the proceeds to qualify for Medicaid.
If the house was owned jointly and it is clear that the nursing home patient will never return home, most states will end the nursing home patient's Medicaid benefits once the spouse in the community dies. The patient would then have to sell the house and spend the proceeds on nursing home care until the assets were again below the eligibility ceiling.
But if the nursing home patient dies first or if the spouse in the community dies first, and the house had been tranferred to that spouse's name, the house is off-limits for calculating Medicaid benefits.
Out of pride or civic responsibility, some people would prefer to spend all of their own money on their care before going on Medicaid. Others want to protect as much of their assets and savings as possible and try to gain eligibility at the earliest moment.
 
Finding Loopholes in Law
That approach is a subject of controversy. The concern is that the middle-class are finding loopholes in the law, often with the help of lawyers specializing in laws affecting the elderly, and are able to get on Medicaid while retaining their money.
''In the extreme,'' said Nancy M. Coleman, the director of the American Bar Association's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, the question is, ''Why should people who have millions of dollars be able to give it away, go on the public dole, and have you and I pay for it?''
Lawyers specializing in the field maintain that their counsel is aboveboard. 'It's no different than a tax attorney suggesting to invest in tax-free municipal bonds,'' said Daniel G. Fish, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Freedman & Fish. ''What's unfair is that Medicare doesn't cover custodial care.''
The law was toughened in response to the practice of giving assets to heirs before applying for Medicaid. All states are now required to look at a Medicaid applicant's financial transactions over the past 30 months, and if money was given away or assets were tranferred at less than fair-market value, then eligibility is delayed until the individual has paid the nursing home roughly the same amount that had been given away. It is still legal, though, to pay off a home mortgage any time before applying for Medicaid. Also, a house may be transferred to the spouse and in some cases to a child or sibling any time before applying for Medicaid.
Many experts in long-term care caution that it is usually preferable to be a nursing home resident who pays privately than a resident on Medicaid.
''There is a grand illusion that if you get poor, you don't have to worry, that the Government will take care of you,'' said Lynn Goldis, the assistant director of the Senior Care Network in Pasadena. ''But what being on Medicaid means is that you have virtually no choices. You can't shop around, and Medicaid patients are placed in semiprivate rooms.'' Private Insurance Tips for Buying Protection In the mid-1980's, the insurance industry began offering policies to protect people from the potentially devastating financial impact of long-term care. These have been controversial, both because they are expensive and because many of them have provided very incomplete coverage.
Considering whether to buy a private policy ought to begin in people are in their 50's, the experts said. The younger the person, the less costly the premiums, and many companies will reject an applicant in ill health.
Consumer advocates have written reams about the practice in which an insurance agent fails to explore an applicant's medical history thoroughly, only to deny a later claim for nursing home coverage because of a ''newly discovered'' condition that existed at the time the policy was purchased, like heart disease or diabetes.
 
'Very Much Buyer Beware'
But the policies have improved, and some people who work with the elderly say that as long as there is no public insurance, private insurance is the best shield for assets for those who enter long-term care. ''It's very much buyer beware,'' said Mr. Linkous of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, ''but it's the only option until this country gets its act together.''
Other experts are opposed to private insurance for long-term care. Robert M. Ball, 75 years old, who was Social Security Commissioner under Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, said he would rather rely on his own resources. ''The risk is slight enough and the premiums are high,'' he said. ''If anything happened, I could sell my house.''
The policies are recommended primarily for those people who have a lot to protect. ''It's more for the person with some significant assets and an income of at least $20,000 a year,'' said Gary Claxton, a senior analyst with the American Association of Retired Persons.
 
'A Very Personal Choice'
Even the industry's representatives agree. ''It's a very personal choice,'' said Susan Van Gelder, the associate director for policy development and research at the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade organization.
''Married couples may feel they don't need it now that the spouse in the community can retain a much higher asset level,'' she said. ''Likewise, if Medicaid is within someone's reach, we wouldn't want that person wasting money on private insurance.''
To date, 1.5 million policies for long-term care have been sold, a vast majority of them to people over 65. About 120 companies now offer the policies. While institutional care is stressed, coverage of home care is increasingly available as well. In addition, a few companies are making long-term care insurance available to employees, usually through payroll deductions.
 
Insurers Want an Investigation
But only about 4 percent of elderly Americans now carry private insurance for long-term care. Insurance industry officials believe that far more elderly people would buy it if it were not for the bad publicity. In fact, the Health Insurance Association of America has joined consumer watchdog groups that have documented abuses of policy sellers in calling for a Federal investigation. ''We don't want this market ruined by a few bad apples,'' Ms. Van Gelder said.
The Health Insurance Association of America said a policy offering four years of coverage with a daily benefit of $80 for nursing home care, a 20-day deductible and no protection against inflation, has an average annual premium of $483, if purchased at the age of 50; $1,135 at 65 and $3,800 at 79.
The association said the same policy, but with inflation protection, has an average annual premium of $658 if purchased at 50; $1,400 at 65 and $4,200 at 79. ''Generally, the rate you come in on is the rate you pay for the rest of your life,'' Ms. Van Gelder said.
 
What Policies Should Include
Consumer experts say the best policies do not require prior hospitalization before covering nursing home care; cover both skilled and non-skilled nursing care; provide at least three to five years of coverage; pay for home care; guarantee protection against inflation, and include patients with Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative or dementing illnesses.
The answers on the application should be as detailed as possible to guard against later charges that a debilitating condition predated the signing of the policy.
''It's not for everyone,'' said Alan D. Bogutz, a partner in the law firm of Bogutz & Gordon in Tucson, Ariz., and the founder of the 650-member National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. ''The very poor are going to qualify for Medicaid and the very rich will foot their own long-term care bills. It's the people in the nebulous middle who need to protect what they have who should consider it.''

Survey in Moscow Sees a High Level of Anti-Jewish Feeling

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
A survey of tolerance in the Soviet Union has reported ''disturbingly high levels of anti-Jewish feeling,'' according to the American Jewish Committee, which helped finance the project.
Asked to rate whether they liked Jews, on a scale of one to 11, 18 percent said they disliked them. Another 18 percent said they liked Jews, and 65 percent said they were neutral.
Asked about the anti-Semitism of others, 17 percent said ''most people in the Soviet Union are anti-Jewish,'' 60 percent said ''only some people are anti-Jewish,'' and 19 per cent said ''very few people are anti-Jewish.'' 
The study, based on face-to-face interviews in the Moscow area with a random sample of 506 Soviet adults between Feb. 16 and March 4, found that 8 percent of those questioned agreed with the statement, ''More than any other group in society, it is the Jews who are responsible for the problems the Soviet Union is experiencing today.'' Seventy-nine per cent disagreed, and 13 percent were uncertain.
Thirty-three percent agreed that ''when it comes to choosing between people and money, Jews will choose money,'' and 23 cent agreed that ''Jews have too much influence over Russian culture.''
 
Negative Figures Seen as High
The study was financed by the American Jewish Committee, the National Science Foundation and the University of Houston, and conducted under the auspices of the Institute of Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The study directors were two political scientists from the University of Houston, Prof. James Gibson and Asst. Prof. Raymond Duch. Interviewed by telephone yesterday, Dr. Duch said the figures for anti-Semitism in the study were significantly higher than similar figures for the United States. ''Most research in this country indicates a level of hard-core anti-Semitism equal to about 5 percent of the population,'' he said.
He acknowledged that the Soviet study, which comes at the time of an increased Jewish exodus from the Soviet Union under the more liberal emigration policies of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was confined to Moscow. Attitudes toward Jews in the capital were expected to be relatively liberal compared with the rest of the Soviet Union. Jews make up only about 2.5 percent of Moscow's population, but there are more Jews in Moscow than in any other Soviet city, Dr. Duch said.
The survey questionnaire consisted of 350 questions, and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents said they were of Russian descent, 3 percent said they were Ukrainian, 2 percent said they were Armenian and 2 percent said they were Jewish.
The question of anti-Semitism was only a part of the overall survey, which had a broad theme of political tolerance in the Soviet Union.
 
Skepticism on Perestroika
On general issues, the survey found increasing skepticism about perestroika, Mr. Gorbachev's program of political and economic restructuring, and concern over insufficient glasnost, or the new increased openness in the press. It recorded a decline in Mr. Gorbachev's popularity and a serious lack of political tolerance.
The high number of negative responses to Jewish-related questions early in the survey prompted the directors to expand that part of their work. But not all the responses to Jewish-related questions were negative.
Of those queried, 91 percent said that ''Jews should be free to decide for themselves whether they want to remain in the Soviet Union or emigrate.'' Ninety percent agreed that ''the Government should make every effort to see that the rights of Jews to equal educational opportunity are respected.'' And 88 percent said the Government should see ''that the rights of Jews to equal employment opportunities are respected throughout the Soviet union.''

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects Plan on Aid to Miners

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Senate, upholding the President and its own leadership by the slenderest of margins, rejected a proposal today for special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs if clean air legislation was passed by Congress.
The $500 million special assistance package was rejected by a vote of 50 to 49.
At least two Senators who said they planned to vote for the proposal reversed themselves after they were told by the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, that President Bush would veto the clean air bill if the proposal was included.
A veto would have killed the compromise bill negotiated between the White House and Senate leaders and probably would have ended the prospects for clean air legislation this session. The White House said the provision for financial help for miners would make the clean air legislation too costly. 
 
Quick Action Seen on Bill
The defeat of the amendment, which was offered by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the former majority leader, removes the last major obstacle to Senate passage of the legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act of 1970. Final action in the Senate is expected by Tuesday.
The House is still drafting its clean air bill and has not yet addressed the acid rain issue and the problem of miners or other workers who might lose jobs. The miners' jobs would be in jeopardy because the provisions dealing with acid rain would encourage utilities to shift to a type of coal that would reduce pollution.
 
Biden Changes His Mind
At first, Mr. Byrd appeared to have the necessary votes to carry his amendment. But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. a Delaware Democrat who supported the proposal to assist the miners, voted against it after he left the floor during the vote to take a call from Mr. Sununu.
Mr. Biden reported after the vote that the White House chief of staff warned him that the amendment would break the compromise agreement between the White House and Senate leaders and ''guaranteed the President would veto the bill.''
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said in a telephone interview that he decided to vote against the amendment after Mr. Sununu had told him its passage would compel a Presidential veto. ''That wouldn't have been in the interest of my state, which is suffering from air pollution,'' Mr. D'Amato said.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, who Mr. Byrd said would have voted to help the miners, was attending a funeral and did not vote.
Thirty-seven Democrats and 12 Republicans voted for the amendment, while 16 Democrats and 34 Republicans voted against it.
The Byrd amendment was opposed by the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the minority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who both argued that providing special assistance to the coal miners would set a bad precedent and that workers in other industries would demand the same relief.
Mr. Byrd, who remains one of the most influential members of the Senate, made an extraordinary personal effort to win passage of his amendment. After he lost, he told reporters: ''I made the supreme effort. I did everything I could and, therefore, I don't feel badly about it.''
The Senate bill, as well as legislation being prepared in the House, would require require a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions of 10 million tons a year, which, along with nitrogen oxides, is the chief component of acid rain. All the reductions would be made by coal-fired power plants, most of whuch are in nine Midwestern states.
The reductions could be made by installing devices on smokestacks to remove sulfur. But a less expensive approach likely to be adopted by many utilities is to shift from coal with a high sulfur content to low-sulfur coal. Such a shift is expected to result in the closing of a number of high-sulfur coal mines, particularly in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.

HEADLINE: Veto of Idaho Abortion Bill Is Possible

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, March 29

 BODY:
Faced with one of the most difficult decisions in his long political career, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, today offered the first hint that he might veto a restrictive abortion bill passed by the Idaho Legislature last week.
Governor Andrus, a longtime opponent of abortion and a Democrat in a state dominated by Republicans, said he had not yet reached a final decision about the bill. But he said he was particularly troubled by provisions that could, in some instances, prevent a victim of rape or incest from obtaining an abortion in the state.
He insisted that he would not be influenced by aggressive lobbying campaigns by those on both sides of the abortion question that have taken aim at the heart of Idaho's economy: its potato industry and tourism. 
''I am concerned that this bill may narrow it to the point where a woman who has suffered rape, incest or a threat to her life might be unable to receive an abortion,'' he said. ''Basically, that's what I'm agonizing over.''
 
Decision Expected Soon
The Governor, who is expected to decide soon, has three options. He could sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature.
The last option is unlikely, said Marc Johnson, the Governor's press secretary. ''I know of only one instance where he's let something become law without his signature,'' he said. ''That's not his preferred way of doing business.''
The bill at the center of the battle was designed to give the Supreme Court of the United States a way to challenge its landmark decision in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion.
The Governor's office, normally a quiet reception center for schoolchildren and curious visitors, has received more than 2,000 phone calls a day on the measure. #10,000 Pounds of Potatoes Today, supporters of abortion rights, who have threatened to boycott Idaho's No. 1 crop, dumped 10,000 pounds of potatoes on the Capitol steps. On Wednesday abortion opponents were out in force at the same place, many of them carrying signs reading, ''Pro-life, pro-spud.''
Idaho produces 10 billion pounds of potatoes every year, worth $650 million to the state's farmers. That represents nearly one of every three potatoes grown in America.
''I can't ignore that threat, but it will not have anything to do with my decision,'' Governor Andrus has said. ''I will not be pressured by one group or another.''
Ever since Molly Yard, the president of the National Organization for Women, first raised the boycott threat earlier this week, groups favoring the bill have pledged to eat three times as many Idaho potatoes as before if the measure becomes law.
''We are calling for the massive increase of purchases of Idaho potatoes,'' said Beverly LaHaye, the president of the Concerned Women for America.
 
'I Had No Idea'
Mark Ricks, a state senator who opposes abortion and is also a potato farmer, said the boycott calls caught him by surprise.
''I had no idea these kinds of repercussions would result,'' he said. ''I think it's unjust and narrow minded.''
Business leaders, too, said they are dismayed by the events.
''It's inappropriate and unfortunate that the potato industry has become involved with abortion politics,'' said Fred Zerza, a spokesman for the J. R. Simplot Company, a concern that provides french fries for McDonald's Corporation.
Jim Hawkins, director of the Idaho Commerce Department, said the Governor's attempts to revive this state's economy could be threatened by the abortion issue.
''It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen in my life,'' said Mr. Hawkins. ''One minute somebody calls up with a big business order saying they'll cancel it if the Governor signs the bill. The next minute it's just the opposite.''
Abortion opponents say the bill passed by the Idaho Legislature was specifically designed to appeal to one Supreme Court Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, who is believed to hold a swing vote on abortion.
But some abortion opponents, among them Richard Wilkins, a law professor at Brigham Young University who conferred with Governor Andrus yesterday, say the Idaho bill is far too restrictive to pass a review by the Supreme Court.
 
Bill Provides Four Exceptions
The bill would ban all abortions except in cases of rape reported to police in seven days, incest if the victim is younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or threat to the physical health of the mother.
Under the language of the law, a woman who is raped could be refused an abortion if the alleged rapist wanted to challenge her claim.
''It puts the government into the business of finding out who's reponsible for a pregnancy,'' said State Senator John Peavey, the chairman of the Senate Democratic caucus. ''There are some serious constitutional flaws in that bill, and I think the governor is starting to pick up on that.''

HEADLINE: Black Enrollment in College Up After Long Decline, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
Reversing years of decline, enrollment of black students at colleges and universities in the United States increased from 1986 to 1988, particularly in private institutions, according to new figures compiled by the United States Department of Education.
Much of the rise is being attributed to an institutional trend toward being more creative and aggressive in recruiting minority students while offering them more financial aid, experts said yesterday.
''We frankly don't know all the reasons for this,'' said Richard Rosser, president of the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities, which on Wednesday made public its analysis of the Federal statistics. ''But clearly, we've seen a major increase in the effort.'' 
 
Modest Rise in Public Schools
Black enrollment rose 7.1 percent at private colleges and universities from the fall of 1986 to the fall of 1988, the data show. At public institutions in the same period, the rate of increase was much more modest, 0.2 percent.
Similar increases are also found in figures compiled by the United Negro College Fund and obtained yesterday. They show a 5 percent rise last year over the previous year in the entry of black students into the fund's 41 member institutions.
Minority students make up 19.9 percent of the student population at public institutions and 18.4 percent at independent schools.
Adrienne Rhodes, spokeswoman for the organization, said much of the increase was represented by college-bound black men, a dramatic reversal.
Throughout the 1980's, college enrollment by black men was on a steady decline, prompting educators and sociologists to voice concern about a socio-economic gap emerging between black men and women.
Last year the American Council on Education reported that the ratio of black women to black men in college was higher than any racial group. About 60 percent of black college students were women in 1986, according to the council.
 
Reagan Cuts Cited
Over all, black enrollment fell 5.4 percent at independent colleges and 4.6 percent at public institutions from 1982 to 1986, according to the Federal figures, which are compiled every two years. Some educators attribute that drop to sharp cuts by the Administration of President Ronald Reagan in Federal student grants and loans, which greatly affected minorities who disproportionately tend to come from families with low incomes.
But Dr. Rosser, who for 10 years was president of DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., said independent colleges and universities had doubled their financial assistance to students since 1980. From 1970 to 1980, he said, assistance rose only about 9 percent.
Gay Clyburn, a spokeswoman for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said public colleges, where most of the country's black students have enrolled because of the generally lower costs and more liberal admission requirements, had made a concerted effort to recruit blacks. Despite that, she said, for the last decade the association's figures showed black enrollment decreasing.
Mrs. Clyburn said the Federal figures showing black student gains ''were a surprise to us.''
 
Call to 'Focus on Retention'
But Ed Wiley, the assistant managing editor of Black Issues in Higher Education, a biweekly publication based in Fairfax, Va., said: ''We should not get too excited over these figures in isolation. We have to focus on retention as well.''
Some schools are reporting substantial results from programs that link public middle and high schools to colleges, such as use of mentors, college counsels, and tutors.
At Earlham College, a four-year liberal arts school in Richmond, Ind., administrators began offering black applicants from Indiana grants rather than loans, said Len Clark, the college provost.
He said black parents ''don't like to go into debt, and they worry about their ability to pay the loans back.
''We are pretty clear that this policy is having a positive impact on black applicants,'' he said.
Minority students make up 10 percent of the school's student body of 1,100, Dr. Clark said.
''We think the best liberal arts education is one that exposes students to the diversity of people in this country and exposes them to the world,'' he said. ''We are not doing this for blacks; we are doing it for students because we know they learn from their environment.''

HEADLINE: For Eastern Europe, Free Trade, Not Aid

BYLINE: By Phil Gramm; Phil Gramm of Texas is ranking Republican on the Senate Subcommittee on International Finance.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As Eastern Europe emerges from an economic dark age, America has a unique chance to create jobs, hope and opportunity there -not through aid but through free-trade agreements, like the one we're now discussing with Mexico.
To be sure, there should be strings attached: international trade requires convertible currencies, private property must be guaranteed and there must be free movement of labor and capital, including the right to emigrate and the free flow of foreign investment.
Poland is probably the closest to meeting these conditions, but other countries, such as Czechoslovakia, are not far behind and should be offered a free-trade agreement as they qualify. 
This is the only economic program for bringing Eastern Europe into the modern era that is almost guaranteed to succeed. Instead of reinforcing weaknesses, as foreign aid tends to do, increased trade draws on the strengths of our economy and the creativity of a new breed of European entrepreneurs.
Foreign aid as an instrument for promoting development in Eastern European has two drawbacks: it costs money, and there is no reasonable assurance that our money will buy any particular economic result, much less a desirable result.
Even the Philippine Government, which rode a wave of popularity to power, teeters because the economy remains in shambles, as it was under President Ferdinand E. Marcos. There is continued large-scale Government control, cronyism and interference in the marketplace.
Government domination of the economy failed in Eastern Europe, not simply because it reflected oppression but because it did not work. And it has not worked anywhere else, even when supported with our tax dollars and good intentions.
Trade is the only way we can help bring about social and economic modernization in Eastern Europe; it will also generate benefits for the U.S. instead of simply costing us money. By any measure, international trade dwarfs any foreign aid that we or the rest of the world can provide. The total of foreign aid from every source in 1988 was $65.7 billion; total world trade was $2.45 trillion.
Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and others that we call newly industrializing have received U.S. foreign aid, but they have relied primarily upon international markets to drive their economic development.
Economics aside, a free-trade agreement provides a political vision of where Eastern Europe (and the rest of the world) should be heading. The Eastern Europeans haven't been filling the streets merely for the right to vote: they have risen against government control of their lives.
A free-trade agreement with the Polish people - and other nations as they are ready - will do more to liberate them from the constraints of controlled economies and controlled politics than any other action the U.S. can take.
With total U.S.-Poland trade at about $1 billion, there is plenty of room for an embryonic trade relationship to grow. If our trade with Poland doubled as a result of a free-trade agreement, it would still be less in dollar value than our trade with Costa Rica.
Consequently, there should be few U.S. industries facing measurable dislocation from a U.S.-Poland pact, while many U.S. businesses would benefit. The same would be true of pacts with other countries that once were members of the Soviet bloc.
Eastern Europeans are ready to reject the tangle of protectionist practices that only shield special interests, foreign and domestic. We can sharpen their hope for freedom and economic opportunity. That hope springs from trade, not aid.

HEADLINE: Fire in the Bronx;
Social Clubs Quickly Turn Heavy Profits for Investors

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The economic ladder in the social club business spans the gap between street-smart entrepreneurs in New York City's poorest neighborhoods and wealthy, established real-estate operators - and along the way, everyone seems to make money.
Club operators - like the owner of the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx who died in a fire that killed 87 people - generally pay no taxes, buy and sell liquor illegally, take in up to thousands of dollars a night, and occasionally cut corners when it comes to health and safety.
Building owners, sometimes working through intermediaries who sublease the property, can take in far more rent from social clubs than they can from other legitimate tenants in low-income neighborhoods, making the risk worthwile, for some.
 
'Will Look the Other Way'
''If you rent a store for $2,500 a month that could get only $1,500 on the market, some owners will look the other way, figuring that nothing will happen,'' said Mark Engel, the president of the Bronx Board of Realtors.
Mr. Engel, like many other building owners, said he considered social clubs an often unavoidable nuisance that, despite an occasional crackdown, continue to be a way of life in growing immigrant neighborhoods. At present, he said, he manages only one building with a social club - a property owned by the city. 
A review of hundreds of building records from the last few years lists what the Police Department terms nuisances - mainly illegal clubs large and small - and shows that many are owned by long-established real-estate investors, with the City of New York the largest owner of all. Some of the clubs are believed by the police to have been shut or moved elsewhere since they were included on the list.
One of the largest individual owners on the list is Alex DiLorenzo 3d, who owns the Happy Land property. A check of Manhattan and Bronx properties on this list showed that he owned or managed 11 club sites, 3 of which, including Happy Land, had received vacate orders because of safety concerns.
Mr. DiLorenzo, who is an heir to part of what once was one of the largest real-estate concerns in the city, has purchased commercial property in several low-income neighborhoods. Records show that at each of the three locations ordered closed - at Happy Land, at a second club around the corner at 877 East Tremont Avenue and at 3650 Broadway, near 150th Street, in Manhattan - arrests for illegal sale of alcoholic beverages were made after the clubs had been ordred closed.
 
Others on List
Also on the list was one property owned by Seymour Durst, the Diplomat Hotel on West 43d Street, and one at 3825 Broadway, near 159th Street, which is listed in the name of Sol Goldman, who before his death had been a partner of Mr. DiLorenzo's father in the 1960's and 70's.
Mr. Durst, in an interview last night, said he could not explain why the hotel, which now houses a few long-term tenants, was put on the list. He said much of the building, which formerly had late-night clubs, is now shut down.
Also on the list is a building at 4000 White Plains Road in the Bronx listed in the name of Robert A. Mosbacher, the United States Secretary of Commerce. Stanley Stern, who works for the Mosbacher family, said Mr. Mosbacher was a trustee of a trust that owned the property and that no improper activity was carried out there.
Inspector Frank Biehler, the commander of the Social Club Task Force of the Police Department, said the Mosbacher site was put on the list at the request of the police precinct after complaints that a bar at the site was unlicensed. He said that subsequently the bar either obtained or produced a liquor license.
 
Indelible Part of Landscape
Both real-estate executives and anthropologists who have studied the situation have said social clubs have been an indelible part of the landscape in many communities, dating at least to early in this century when Italians and Jews, often from the same town or village, gathered in their own clubs.
Xavier Totti, an anthropologist and professor of Puerto Rican studies at Lehman College who has studied social clubs, said they often function as a network for jobs, housing, schools and a market for people who want to buy and sell posessions.
He said Happy Land, which catered to Hondurans, was typical of many of these clubs. It charged $5 for admission on weekends and $3 for a drink. Just down the street, he said, a large Puerto Rican club called Visions, which had live musicians, charged $110 per table for admission, a bottle and setups. The club closed down the day after the Happy Land fire.
While some social clubs are quite small, others like Happy Land accommodated hundreds of people a night. One Bronx real-estate executive noted that a club like Happy Land could earn its steep monthly rent on a weekend night. The monthly rent, originally $1,500, had since gone up to $1,950.
 
Big Profit on Drinks
''No one ever thinks about whether they're illegal or have a license,'' he said. ''Many people are used to thinking of licenses as something you get by bribery. Sometimes they apply for a liquor license for a one-night fund-raising event or party and continue to display it.''
Inspector Biehler said many clubs make their biggest profits on drinks. Bottles, bought for $7 or $8, sold by the drink for $2 or more a shot, can bring in $50. And bottles are routinely refilled with cheaper liquor.
''Anybody who thinks that because a bottle says Dewar's, he's getting Dewar's ought to go to the hospital for a mental examination,'' he said. ''There is no way in the world to know what's in those bottles.''
This has led to illegal cost-cutting. Karl Felsen, a spokesman for the State Taxation and Finance Department, said tax officials had uncovered a smuggling ring bringing in untaxed rum from the Dominican Republic, which was intended in part for the social club market.
Since social clubs are cash businesses, requiring little capital for a rudimentary establishment, the opportunities for profits are large, and the temptation for landlords willing to cut corners is great.
At Happy Land, the property owner, Mr. DiLorenzo, leased an entire block of stores to a second company, Little Peach Realty, for 30 years, which in turn leased a storefront to Elias Colon, the Happy Land operator. Mr. Colon died in the fire.
Bronx real-estate dealers said the net leasing of the property is often used by Mr. DiLorenzo and other property owners, who are speculating that a property will increase in value over decades, but do not want the hassles of finding tenants and collecting rent in poor neighborhoods.
 
Long-Term Lease
The company or individual taking a long-term lease to manage the property cannot make money on the appreciation of the assets and is under pressure to push up the rents to cover the cost of the long-term lease and assure a profit.
Mr. Engel said that, while he was not familiar with the Happy Land operation, he thought that most property owners tried to be responsible and to check out potential tenants carefully and look for and follow up on illegal uses of the property. But he said that evicting social clubs through the courts can be difficult.
A review of the city list shows that many social clubs have at one time or another found a home in city-owned buildings. A review of building records in Manhattan and the Bronx shows that at least 49 social clubs, including 36 in Manhattan, were identified in city-owned buildings.
 
Seized Over Taxes
Many appeared to be commercial buildings, seized for the nonpayment of taxes, that were managed by the city's Department of General Services. In a statement issued late yesterday, the department said it could not respond in detail until the list is reviewed.
''No illegal activity should be taking place within any of these buildings or establishments owned by the city of New York,'' the statement said.
Marilyn Sopher, whose husband, Morris, is listed as the owner of seven properties in the Bronx reported to have had social clubs, said the clubs grew in number gradually over time.
She said only ''one or two'' had been leased for the purpose of being a social club, while the others pretended they were leasing the building for another purpose. She said that when this happened, it was particularly difficult to evict the tenant.

HEADLINE: Fire in the Bronx;
Fire Survivor Tells Of 'All the Screams' He 'Can't Forget'

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
A doorman raced up the narrow back stairs of the Happy Land Social Club, a light wave of smoke trailing him. ''Fire! Fire!'' he shouted as he burst onto the dance floor, but the scores of revelers hesitated in fear.
The eyewitness account of how so many perished when the illegal club was set ablaze early Sunday was given yesterday in an interview by Felipe Figueroa, one of two people who were on the club's crowded second floor and survived.
Despite the smoke, Mr. Figueroa, who calls himself Phillip, said he managed to rush down a second staircase and find his way to safety, essentially unharmed. 
Lieut. James Malvey, a principal detective on the case, said he and others who questioned Mr. Figueroa believed his story. Mr. Figueroa's presence was also corroborated by a friend of his, Ruben Valladares, who was the club's disk jockey and the only other survivor, the detectives said.
Mr. Valladares remains in critical but stable condition at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx with burns over about 40 percent of his body. Doctors have given him slightly better than an even chance of survival.
 
'My Mind Can't Stop'
Mr. Figueroa, a part-time disk jockey who was dropping in at the club to help Mr. Valladares, described his own, less visible wounds.
''I can't sleep here anymore,'' he said, slapping the boiler outside his cramped, $60-a-week room in the basement of a South Bronx tenement. The boiler's muffled roar, he said, reminds him too much of the screams he heard.
''My mind can't stop,'' he said. ''All the screams, all the noise, and the moment when my friend came out of there screaming. I can't forget that.''
Fire Department officials estimate that 68 of the club's 87 victims were trapped and asphyxiated on the crowded second floor of Happy Land. The police and fire officials believe that four, and possibly six, people on the ground floor of the club also escaped.
None of the survivors have explained in detail how so many were killed.
Mr. Figueroa said he came to New York in May 1986 from the Honduran coastal city of Trujillo. He has worked mostly as a $200-a-week delivery man for a Washington Heights furniture company, saving what he can for the records and sound equipment that he hopes will allow him to earn a living as a disk jockey back home.
For more than a year before the fire, he said, he spun records at Happy Land or stopped by the club to help his friend Mr. Valladares, who grew up in the same Cristales neighborhood of Trujillo. Scattered around his tiny apartment, old fliers recalled parties he entertained at the Happy Land and other clubs and dance halls in the Bronx.
Last Saturday night he stopped by Happy Land, on Southern Boulevard just off East Tremont Avenue, with thoughts only of a good time, he said. Around midnight he was ushered in free of charge, as usual, but stayed only a short while before heading for another club in the East Tremont section.
Mr. Figueroa said he returned to Happy Land at about 2 A.M. on Sunday. He remembered passing the new coat-check woman, Lydia Feliciano. She was talking to a man who Mr. Figueroa now believes was Julio Gonzalez, the unemployed Cuban immigrant who the police say set the fire in a fit of jealousy.
The atmosphere on the second floor was ''pretty good,'' Mr. Figueroa said, but some people were already starting to leave. Mr. Valladares reached for a favorite Jamaican reggae song, ''Young Lover,'' by Coco Tea.
''The floor got so full that a lot of people couldn't dance,'' he said. ''Then you heard it coming up the stairs.''
 
'People Went Crazy'
The shouts were those of one of the club's two doormen. The other doorman, Mr. Figueroa said, was on the dance floor with a girlfriend.
''He was yelling, 'Fire! Fire!,'' Mr. Figueroa said, his voice rising. ''He came onto the floor and yelled, 'Fire! Fire!' Right away, people went crazy. ''Some ran this way and that way. Some people didn't make a big deal out of it. I could see a little smoke coming upstairs.''
The doorman waded onto the dance floor, he said, apparently sifting the crowd for his own girlfriend.
''He was yelling in English,'' Mr. Figueroa said, ''so I started yelling, 'Fuego! Fuego!' Ruben turned off the music and turned on the lights and yelled 'Fuego!' into the microphone.
''People were already desperate. Everybody was running around. I think that since so many came from families, they were all looking for their relatives.''
 
Oxygen Supply at Risk
It might already have been too late. A Fire Department spokesman, Efrain Padilla, said that under the club's low ceiling - so low that the 5-foot-6-inch Mr. Figueroa, standing flat-footed, could touch the mirrored globe revolving above the dance floor - the fire could have sucked out all oxygen in minutes.
A spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove, said the second-floor victims were believed to have died of smoke inhalation. But Mr. Padilla said the lack of oxygen could have caused them to lose consciousness in seconds.
''I looked downstairs, and all you could see was smoke,'' Mr. Figueroa said of his vantage point at the disk jockey's booth, just next to an alternate staircase at the front of the club.
He rushed down the steep stairs anyway.
 
'Down, Let's Go!'
''Everyone saw me go for it,'' he said. ''I yelled, 'Down, let's go!' There were a lot of people around those stairs, but nobody followed me. I could hear all the cries, lots of people saying, 'Mama!' I heard something explode, like a light.''
Downstairs, Mr. Figueroa said, he could barely see. By mistake, he burst into a storage room filled with coats. But knowing the club well, he quickly found the northern exit door, through which Elena Colon, the wife of the club owner, Ms. Feliciano and at least two young patrons had already scurried. Mr. Figueroa hit the crash bar on the door and suddenly found himself on the street.
Perhaps a minute later, Mr. Valladares stumbled through the other door, wrapped in flames.
''He let out some screams that I remember too much,'' Mr. Figueroa said. ''I didn't even know who he was - he was so burned, all deformed. But he wears a lot of chains, and I recognized him by the chains.I ripped off his shirt, which was still on fire. His whole body was shaking.''
 
'I Couldn't Let Go'
In what seemed like seconds, Mr. Figueroa said, his friend was gone in an ambulance.
''I couldn't let go of his clothing,'' he said. ''When I got to the house of his sister, to tell her, I was still holding it.''
Mr. Figueroa ran a thumb and forefinger along the border of a prized snapshot taken during a party at the sister's house last summer. It shows Mr. Figueroa on one knee, toasting the camera, with Mr. Valladares flashing a broad smile over his shoulder.
''He's never going to have that smile again,'' Mr. Figueroa said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Reveals List of Big Cuts In Budget Pact

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29

 BODY:
To goad members of the Republican-led State Senate to drop their insistence that the state's budget gap be made up through spending cuts alone, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today made public the list of cuts that he and legislative leaders had agreed on privately.
The cuts, totaling $500 million, would significantly reduce state aid to higher education, mental health and local governments. Some state agencies - the New York State Commission on Cable Television, for example - would be eliminated and 600 employees throughout state government would be laid off.
New York City, which is suffering from its own budget problems, would lose about $100 million in aid that it had been expecting. The cuts are subject to approval by members of the State Legislature. 
 
'Study This List'
Mr. Cuomo said that by releasing the list he hoped to demonstrate that the Republicans' demands for deeper spending cuts were unrealistic and destructive.
''Study this list, ladies and gentlemen of the State of New York, and tell me whether you think we should do more,'' he said.
The Governor and the Assembly Speaker, both Democrats, say that the most judicious way to close the gap is through a combination of cuts and taxes. The new taxes Mr. Cuomo has proposed include an expansion of the state sales tax to cover new items like non-prescription drugs and an increase in the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. The Governor and legislative leaders from both parties agreed to the $500 million in cuts in meetings this week after Standard & Poor's reduced the state's credit rating on Monday.
The list being circulated is expected to provoke a fierce round of lobbying by groups, like public employee unions, that would be affected by the cuts. And with only two days left before a new state budget is supposed to be in place, many officials said today that they were fearful that the release of the list could further delay an agreement. $1.5 Billion Budget Gap Explaining his action, Mr. Cuomo said, ''At one point the public has to be allowed into the process.''
The spending cuts enumerated by the Governor today are intended to help close a budget gap that is now estimated at $1.5 billion.
This gap represents the difference between the spending proposed by the Governor for the upcoming fiscal year, which starts on Sunday, and the revenues that the state now expects to collect during the year. Cuomo aides have attributed the gap in the $51 billion proposed budget to an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the economy.
Senate Republicans have maintained that the entire gap should be made up through spending cuts, though privately many concede that new taxes will be needed.
Today, the Senate Republicans appeared nonplused by the release of the list of cuts, but said that it would not affect their stance.
''Clearly it was a political move to put pressure on us, and I'm sure it will,'' said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I. ''But it's just one of the moves in the budget battle. And I don't think the Governor got a lot out of it.''
 
Reducing Existing Services
''We're realistic,'' Mr. Marino said. ''We realize there's a limit to the cuts. But we're trying to make a very important point, and that is we've been overspending all these years.''
Some of the spending cuts outlined today would necessitate reductions of existing state services. Other cuts would reduce the amount that was supposed to be spent to start new programs or expand services.
Of the proposed cuts, these would be the most substantial:
* A 2 percent reduction in state aid to the City University of New York, totaling $15 million, and a 2 percent cut in the State University of New York, totaling $21 million.
* An $85 million decrease in new state aid to local school districts.
* A $67 million reduction in spending on social programs, including Medicaid and foster care.
* An $18 million cut in state spending on mental health programs.
The administrative budgets for the Governor's office, the Legislature and the judiciary branches would all be cut by 2 percent, for a total savings of $26 million.
Dozens of smaller programs would also be cut. Advertising for the state's lottery, for example, would be reduced by $2 million. One of Mr. Cuomo's favorite programs, the Liberty Scholarship program for poor students, would be cut by $700,000. And the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Commission, headed by Mr. Cuomo's wife, Matilda, would have its budget cut by $100,000, or 66 percent.
The cuts include a reduction of about 1 percent in aid to local governments across the state. Officials in New York City, who expected to receive about $10 billion from the state this year, said the decrease in aid would be painful.
''They're trying to shift a lot of the state burden to us,'' sad the New York City Budget Director, Philip R. Michael. ''We'll balance our budget, but it's certainly not going to be pretty.''
The Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, called the cuts ''a very painful list, if you really take a look at it.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Up Slight 0.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Consumer spending narrowed to a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in February, the Government said today.
Analysts blamed weak car sales for the slowdown, but some said buying momentum was building in other areas of the economy. 
The Commerce Department said personal consumption totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.63 trillion, the smallest increase since a three-tenths of 1 percent gain in October.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, jumped 1 percent in December and January. The January increase was even stronger than the six-tenths of 1 percent originally reported.
Personal income rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.64 trillion, after a seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in January, which was revised down slightly from the eight-tenths of 1 percent first reported. The February income gain matched a nine-tenths of 1 percent advance in November.
''The spread between income and consumption growth in the near term is a negative, because consumers have buying power but are not unleashing it,'' said Michael P. Niemira, an economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
The increase in personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, totaled $15.9 billion.
Spending on durable goods - expensive items expected to last more than three years - dropped $14.6 billion, due in part to weak car sales.
''Autos were still a depressant going into March,'' Mr. Niemira said. ''But, on the other hand, department store sales were doing quite well in March.
Purchases of nondurable goods gained $10.9 billion, while spending on services rose $19.6 billion.
The report said individual incomes after taxes rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in February, up from eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

Temporary-Job Pioneer Giving Up Olsten Title

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
William Olsten, a pioneer in the temporary-employment business, is stepping down as chief executive of the Olsten Corporation at age 70, but plans to remain active as chairman.
Mr. Olsten will be succeeded by Frank N. Liguori, 43,, who is currently president and chief operating officer. His titles will now be vice chairman and chief executive. 
Mr. Olsten's son, Stuart, 37, has been named president and chief operating officer. The Olsten family owns 38 percent of the company's stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange.
William Olsten started the business 40 years ago in New York City. Today, with revenue of $761 million and 535 offices, the company, based in Westbury, L.I., is the third largest in the temporary-employment industry.
As World War II started, Mr. Olsten, who grew up in Yonkers, began working in the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., which had converted from making Chevrolets to assembling Avenger torpedo bombers. Mr. Olsten was in charge of the left wing, and his workers were mostly women, whom he trained.
He was soon drafted, and ended up with the Third Army in Europe. After the war, Mr. Olsten began working in sales and marketing for a company that made caps for milk containers, but he decided to go on his own. ''I'd heard about this industry,'' he said of the temporary-help business. ''It wasn't an industry then, it was just getting off the ground.''
Mr. Olsten's one-man office grew and he opened offices in other cities. Today, Olsten is in all states. The business is sensitive to economic downturns, Mr. Olsten said. ''We feel it first, but we get out of it first,'' he said, explaining that toward the end of a recession, as business picked up, the temporary industry benefited as employers remained wary of hiring permanent workers.
The new chief executive, Mr. Liguori, is a graduate of St. Francis College and worked for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand before he joined Olsten in 1971. Stuart Olsten, the new president, is a graduate of Syracuse University and joined Olsten in 1975.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dealers Don't See a Trend In Sharp Drop of the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar dropped sharply yesterday against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies, but dealers argued that the decline did not signal an end to the recent upward trend.
''This is not a change,'' said Richard E. Witten, vice president for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. ''The trend is intact, and that is for a higher dollar.'' 
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 156.26 yen, down from 158.60 on Wednesday. Against the mark, the dollar stood at 1.6930, down from 1.7110. The dollar also fell against the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc.
The fall of the dollar against the yen began in Tokyo, spurred by a newspaper report that the Ministry of Finance, in an effort to support the sagging yen, had asked big institutional investors to curtail their buying of dollar-denominated securities. Although the report was officially denied, it drove the dollar down.
Still, traders wrote off the decline as an ''expected correction'' that always occurs after a currency moves quickly in one direction or another. The dollar had moved almost 5 yen, or 3 percent, higher in just four days, and more than 6 percent since the start of the month. The fall against the West German mark also came after a recent, but much less dramatic, upward move of the dollar.
While the upward trend might not be over, yesterday's decline may have reined in the dollar at least until traders hear the results of a meeting of the Group of Seven nations in Paris on April 7. The dollar's strength, particularly against the yen, is expected to be a central topic.
At the last several meetings of the Group of Seven, comprising the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, the finance officials have initiated moves, backed by coordinated selling of dollars, to bring the dollar down. But then the dollar was considered to be too strong against both the yen and the West German mark.
Now the dollar is far stronger against the yen, even at the 156-yen level of yesterday. It is far outside the range of 120 yen to 140 yen that the Group of Seven is believed to prefer.
But the dollar, at 1.6930 marks, is below the Group of Seven's preferred range of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks. Still, both the West Germans and American Treasury officials have indicated they would like the dollar to move a little lower.
This dichotomy reduces the likelihood of major action. Neither the West Germans nor the Americans seem to be in a position to lower interest rates, which would weaken their currencies.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cocoa Soars to Highs Again On Concerns Over Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The price of cocoa futures surged to seven-month highs yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York on speculation that economic turmoil in Brazil and the Ivory Coast could disrupt supplies.
No disturbances were reported yesterday in the Ivory Coast, the leading cocoa grower, after a violent confrontation on Wednesday between the police and demonstrators in Abidjan, the capital of the West African nation.
On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower, grains and soybeans advanced, precious metals gained and energy futures finished mixed. 
In New York, cocoa futures settled $21 to $27 higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $1,190 a ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contract since Aug. 16. The rally followed a $47 increase in the May contract on Wednesday.
Harry Schwartz, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in New York, said most of the buying was again by speculators.
The collapse of cocoa prices last year to 14-year lows was disastrous for the Ivory Coast. Its citizens have recently been calling for the resignation of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who has ordered strict austerity measures to save the country from bankruptcy.
In Brazil, cocoa movement out of the country remained extremely slow amid continuing confusion about economic reform measures introduced two weeks ago to fight inflation. ''In the fullness of time, Brazil will get its house in order and start exporting again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, precious metals edged higher, as the dollar weakened against most primary foreign currencies.
Gold settled $1.70 to $1.90 higher, with April at $370.80 an ounce, while silver finished 2.9 cents to 3.1 cents higher, with April at $4.946 an ounce.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures fell. The selling came before the Agriculture Department's quarterly report of hog-and-pig inventories, scheduled to be released today. The report is expected to show a 2.6 percent decline in the American hog herd.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, settled 5 cents lower to 13 cents higher, with May at $20.03 a barrel, while heating oil finished 0.06 cent to 0.44 cent higher, with April at 56.17 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was 0.22 cent to 0.60 cent higher, with April at 57.67 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Prices Tumble

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, pushed lower by overnight selling in Japan and end-of-quarter liquidations by American dealers.
Market participants said the urge to unload securities in Japan was stimulated by reports that the Ministry of Finance was advising big institutions against taking large positions in dollar-denominated assets in the coming fiscal year, which begins on Monday.
In addition, dealers said banks and other market participants were unloading securities to tidy up first-quarter balance sheets.
''For reporting purposes, a lot of banks and other players don't want to have a lot of longs and shorts on their books at the end of the quarter, so they sell them out,'' one government bond trader said. 
But Edward J. Sawicz, chairman of the Discount Corporation of New York, a primary dealer in government securities, said the bulk of the selling was related to the reports from Japan.
''I don't know if these reports are true or not, but people are treating this as if it were fact,'' he said. ''The reports have been weighing on the market all day.''
 
Sharp Drop in Prices
The sharp drop in prices, which amounted to nearly 1 1/4 points for some issues, or almost $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, nevertheless left yields inside the trading range they have occupied for the last few weeks.
''The recent yield range on the 8 1/2 percent five-year Treasury notes, which I like to watch, has been between 8.73 percent and 8.44 percent,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''At a yield of around 8.60 percent, where they are now, they are moving toward being on the cheap side.''
An announcement from the Resolution Funding Corporation that it will sell an unspecified amount of 40-year bonds on April 10 provided further incentive to sell longer-dated securities.
Refcorp, created by Congress to finance the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry, said it would announce the size of the auction on Wednesday. Most analysts expect that $5 billion of securities will be sold.
 
Refcorp Auction
The Refcorp auction will be followed in subsequent weeks by Treasury auctions of 7- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
''A good part of what is happening in the long end of the market is in anticipation of future supply,'' Mr. Brachfeld said.
Reflecting that concern, prices of the Treasury's bellwether 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 99 2/32, down 1 7/ 32 points, to yield 8.58 percent.
Among note issues, yields on the two-year and four-year notes that were auctioned earlier this week rose sharply.
The 8 1/2 percent two-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.64 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent four-year notes, which received an enthusiastic reception at Wednesday's auction, were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 8.65 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills moved modestly higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.82 percent, up two basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose by the same amount, to a late offered rate of 7.82 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by four basis points, to 7.75 percent.
Yesterday the Treasury sold $13 billion of 16-day cash management bills at an average discount rate of 8.15 percent.
The plunge in Treasury prices spilled over into the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds.
Traders said prices of actively traded long-term securities fell by as much as 1 1/4 points. Intermediate-term issues dipped by 1/2 of a point to 5/8 of a point.
By comparison, the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds emerged relatively unscathed.
Market participants said bids on some issues fell by 1/4 to 3/8 of a point in thin trading.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board said two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended March 19. The nation's basic money supply measure, M1, was unchanged.
Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it had named SBC Government Securities Inc., a subsidiary of the Swiss Bank Corporation, as a primary dealer of government securities. The New York Fed also said Drexel Burnham Lambert Government Securities is no longer a primary dealer.
The addition and deletion keeps the number of primary dealers at 44. Primary dealers are the designated securities firms that deal directly with the New York Fed.

HEADLINE: Public Found More Hopeful

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumers feel more optimistic about future business prospects than they did last month but less positive about current business conditions, a survey released on Wednesday has found.
The Conference Board, the business research group, said its consumer confidence index for March rose by 3.5 points from February, to 110.2, the best improvement in five months. The survey, conducted by National Family Opinion Inc., covers 5,000 households in the United States.
About 20 percent of the respondents said they thought that current business conditions were ''bad,'' the survey found. That is an increase of 2 percent from last month. But looking ahead six months, people were significantly more optimistic about job prospects and business conditions than they were in the first two months of the year.
More people said they planned to buy a car, although fewer reported planning to buy a house. Interest in buying major appliances also fell.

HEADLINE: Idaho Governor Vetoes Measure Intended to Test Abortion Ruling 26

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, March 30

 BODY:
After a week of intense lobbying and threats to the economy of his state, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho tonight broke ranks with some supporters and vetoed a bill that would have given Idaho the most restrictive abortion law in the country.
''The bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and without compassion further harm an Idaho woman who may find herself in the horrible, unthinkable position of confronting a pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest,'' Governor Andrus said.
Mr. Andrus said his decision was not influenced by the threat to boycott Idaho products, issued this week by groups that support abortion rights.
 
No Chance for an Override
He also lashed out at anti-abortion groups outside of Idaho that wrote the legislation in an effort to bring a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. ''Somebody thought Idaho looks like a patsy,'' he said. ''I submit to you: Idaho is not a patsy.'' 
The bill, which passed the Idaho Legislature last week, would have outlawed about 95 percent of all abortions in the state. A woman would have been able to obtain a legal abortion only in cases of rape reported to police in seven days, incest if the victim were younger than 18, severe fetal deformity or a threat to the physical health of the woman.
The Legislature recessed for the year shortly before Mr. Andrus announced his decision, meaning that it will not have an opportunity to try to override the veto.
In any case, supporters of the bill said they did not have the votes to override a veto, which would require a two-thirds majority. The original votes on the bill were 26 to 17 in the Senate and 47 to 36 in the House. In addition, backers of the bill said they had no plans to place the measure on the November ballot as a citizens' initiative.
Mr. Andrus's veto ended what many opponents of abortion had said was their best chance to enact a state law that could be used to challenge Roe v. Wade.
 
Abortion Opponents Criticize Andrus
But Guam, an American territory in the Pacific, enacted a law banning most abortions and making it a crime for a doctor to provide one. A Federal judge has blocked enforcement of the law until a trial of a lawsuit challenging it, which is scheduled to begin on May 8. That case could also be used as a challenge to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling.
Given the past statements of Mr. Andrus, supporters of the bill had said they thought they had an ally in the three-term Governor, who has said he will seek a fourth term this fall.
Abortion opponents booed and made catcalls at the Governor's announcement and said they no longer considered Mr. Andrus an ally, who had long been supportive of opponents of abortion.
''The Governor has no right to call himself pro-life,'' said Brian Johnston, the western director of the National Right to Life Movement.
Mr. Andrus, a Democrat in a state dominated by Republicans, said his decision was not a change of views on abortion, but rather a reaction to what he called objectionable portions of the bill. He had hinted at his decision on Thursday when he voiced many of the same objections he gave today as the reasons for his veto.
 
'Compound the Tragedy of Rape'
''This law would force the woman to compound the tragedy of rape,'' Mr. Andrus said. Referring to the seven-day reporting requirement for victims of rape, he said, ''On the eighth day, she ceases to be the victim and becomes a criminal.''
The Idaho bill, which followed language advocated by the National Right to Life Committee, was aimed at the perceived objections of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is considered the swing vote on a divided Supreme Court.
While Justice O'Connor has voted to uphold abortion restrictions in every case she has heard on the Supreme Court, her written opinions have stopped short of an unambiguous declaration that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
By putting the onus on doctors to decide who meets the requirements of the Idaho law, abortion opponents say they hope to satisfy what they see as Justice O'Connor's main objection to abortion restrictions: making a woman criminally liable if she has an abortion. In essence, the Idaho legislation shifts that burden entirely to doctors.
Mr. Andrus said he was upset by the the legislation's being directed at one Justice. The bill, he said, ''was conceived outside our state for the sole purpose of getting this issue back before the Supreme Court. I believe, and am confident the people of Idaho believe, that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue.''
 
One of Several Efforts
The Idaho bill was one attempt to ban abortions in several state legislatures after the Supreme Court ruling last July in the Missouri case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, in which the Court supported state limitations on abortion and which many saw as opening the way for states to take more authority in regulating access to abortion.
Mr. Andrus said anti-abortion legal advisors told him ''there is not the remotest chance of this legislation being found constitutional by the Supreme Court.
Even some strong anti-abortion scholars and political leaders believed that the Idaho bill went too far to gain acceptance by the Court or the Governor.
Among other things, critics noted that under some circumstances the bill would have made it illegal for a victim of rape to obtain an abortion. Only incest victims under age 18 would have been able to terminate a pregnancy. And while the bill contains a provision allowing abortion if the physical health of the woman is threatened, no exception is made for mental health.
Some abortion opponents say a pregnancy can never be terminated, regardless of who fathered the child. Those who draw a line at incest or rape or physical impairments are often accused of being in favor of limited abortion.
Such questions posed problems here and are likely to continue to divide the ranks of abortion opponents nationwide.
As the Idaho measure made its way through the state Legislature, some suppporters urged amending the bill to give it a better chance of gaining approval from Mr. Andrus and the Supreme Court.
But leaders with the National Right to Life Committee said they would withdraw support for the bill if it was was significantly altered.
Even before the Legislature passed the bill, abortion rights advocates here had gathered nearly half the 39,000 signatures needed to put an initiative on the ballot in November. That measure, if passed by voters, would make abortion legal in Idaho through the first 26 weeks of a pregnancy.
For the past week, Mr. Andrus has been saying that his decision would be based on ''what is best for Idaho,'' and today he said the lobbying and the threats were the major reasons for his decision.
Idaho provides about a third of the nation's potatoes, and advocates of abortion rights have threatened a boycott of the state's potatoes. It is unclear exactly how much a nationwide boycott could hurt this state, which is enjoying record prosperity after years of a faltering economy. But in the last week, food and tourism business had reported cancelled orders and trips.
Tourism, which is worth $1.5 billion annually, is the fastest growing segment of the state's economy.

HEADLINE: 81 Nations Seeking More Food Aid for Africa

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, March 30

 BODY:
The United States and the representatives of more than 80 other countries appealed today for additional donations of food and money for Ethiopia, Angola, Mozambique and the Sudan. They called existing pledges inadequate and said that without further aid hundreds of thousands of people could die of starvation this year.
The appeal was made at the end of a weeklong meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Security Committee. It expressed concern that world cereal production had fallen behind consumption for the third straight year, reducing stocks, forcing up prices and curbing donations of food to famine-stricken countries. 
The committee noted that food was becoming increasingly scarce in those African countries because of drought and long-running civil wars. It also called for a new international agreement guaranteeing safe passage for relief supplies to ''those in need.'' Such an accord would work to stop governments locked in civil wars from trying to starve their opponents into surrender by cutting off outside aid, as has happened in Ethiopia and the Sudan.
 
'Further Human Suffering'
In a communique, the committee appealed for ''further bilateral and international assistance to meet the substantial uncovered emergency relief needs of Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Sudan,'' saying that without such additional food supplies, these countries faced ''further human suffering and loss of life.''
Rough calculations by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program, which distributes much of the free food nations provide to countries threatened by famine, suggest that at least 1 million more tons of food are needed by these countries, on top of the 1.3 million tons already promised, to avoid famine.
''Without a further substantial increase in food-aid pledges, we will be risking serious famine and many deaths in these worst-affected African countries,'' the organization's Assistant Director General for Economic and Social Policy, B. P. Dutia, said.
Strife-torn Ethiopia, according to the organization's calculations, faces a food-aid ''gap'' of around 600,000 tons this year, with needs of about 1.1 million tons, but has pledges of only about 500,000 tons so far, including 175,000 tons from the United States.
 
Another Critical Problem
Getting the food to needy people is also proving to be a critical problem, said Bronek Szynalski, the World Food Program's Director of Relief Services. The Ethiopian Government is allowing relief agencies to truck about 3,000 to 4,000 tons a month from Assab to needy people in rebel-held areas in Northern Wallo on the border of Tigre province.
The Food and Agriculture Organization puts Mozambique's unmet needs for food aid at 233,000 tons this year, with a total requirement of 755,000 tons and pledges so far of about 522,000 tons. But the World Food Program has just raised its estimate of the country's food-aid gap to 436,000 tons.
In Angola, the F.A.O. estimates that current pledges for food aid fall about 127,000 tons short of the country's needs of about 282,000 tons this year. But the World Food Program has just raised its estimate of the country's deficit to 435,000 tons.
Officials of the Food and Agriculture Organization say that in the Sudan, adequate supplies are available now for dispatch to needy people in the civil-war torn southern half of the country, following the Government's recent decision to allow relief operations to start up again. But money is still needed to pay for transportation.

Kohl Emerging as Europe's Top Leader

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 30

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany is becoming the dominant leader of the 12-nation European Community, something that seemed evident today in his confident mood and manner after two days of talks with the community's biggest skeptic, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
At a joint news conference, the leaders said they agreed that a united Germany should remain part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with all of its territory under the protection of NATO's nuclear umbrella. But when Mrs. Thatcher said she disagreed with Mr. Kohl that German unification should speed up European political and economic union, he just smiled.
He also made no attempt to conceal amusement over Mrs. Thatcher's growing domestic political troubles, chortling when she made what amounted to a retraction of critical comments about him in an interview published in the West German newsmagazine Der Spiegel last Monday. 
 
'A Great Lady'
''Margaret Thatcher is a great lady - a very strong-minded lady,'' he said afterward. ''I have my own ideas, too; my opponents have been underestimating me for years, and I've made a good living out of it.''
Mrs. Thatcher has never liked him, her aides say, and a year ago she barely concealed her contempt for Mr. Kohl's refusal to agree then to proceed with modernizing and increasing the number of American short-range nuclear missiles stationed in West Germany. In the much different world of today, Mrs. Thatcher conceded on Thursday night, NATO could probably reduce its short-range weapons in Germany, and today no obvious difference existed between her position and his.
The new respect Mrs. Thatcher and the other European leaders have shown for Mr. Kohl reflects several facts. First, Mr. Kohl led his Christian Democratic allies in East Germany to a spectacular election victory on March 18, increasing his chances of re-election as Chancellor in the West German vote in December.
Second, after agreeing with Britain and France in December that Mr. Kohl was pushing too fast for unification, the Bush Administration switched in February and came down on his side, helping to create the four-power negotiating framework between the two Germanys and the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union.
Finally, after months of refusal to acknowledge that reunification could not mean regaining lost German territory in Poland, Mr. Kohl bowed to pressure from Warsaw, Paris, Washington and London and agreed to say that the existing borders were inviolable.
When the East German elections came, Mr. Kohl's political stature was rising, while Mrs. Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand of France were mired in political troubles.
But during the uncertainty of last winter, the momentum toward greater European political and economic unity after the realization of a single European market at the end of 1992 faltered. Mr. Kohl said today that the prospect of elections for a united German Parliament as early as the second half of next year ought to get it moving again.
''Those who want a united Germany to be firmly integrated into European structures must logically support further progress in European unification,'' Mr. Kohl said, and when the 12 European Community leaders meet in Dublin on April 28 to discuss the German question, he said he would press not only for economic and monetary union but political union, too. ''For me, the goal is the political unification of Europe,'' he affirmed today.
 
Words 'Mean Different Things'
Mrs. Thatcher said: ''I think sometimes that words are used which mean different things to different people. We already have extensive political cooperation.''
Asked whether she agreed with Mr. Kohl that the powers of the European Parliament should be strengthened, she replied coolly, ''At the moment, I see no need for any further increase.''
Mr. Kohl spent considerable time during his visit repeating his support for a joint pledge by the East and West German Parliaments on the German borders. In Der Spiegel's interview, conducted last Friday, Mrs. Thatcher had dug up the hatchet:
''I heard Helmut saying, 'No, I will not guarantee, I will not accept the present border' - I heard him say it at Strasbourg after dinner,'' she said in the interview, referring to the French city where the European Community leaders met in December.
Mr. Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said today that Mrs. Thatcher's remark must have been discussed privately by the leaders at 10 Downing Street this morning. Asked about it today, she said she had sent messages of congratulations to Mr. Kohl after he changed his mind three weeks ago ''and I congratulate him on it now.''
Turning to him, she asked, ''Do you want to add anything?'' Mr. Kohl, a smile as wide as the Rhine on his face, said, ''I am very, very satisfied with this answer.''
Mrs. Thatcher continues to be skeptical about Britain's prospects of joining the European exchange-rate mechanism, the first stage of European monetary union, soon. She insists that the other countries must allow full freedom of capital movements throughout the community and that Britain must reduce its inflation rate -now at 7.5 percent, and expected to rise soon - before it can join.
But a remark Mrs. Thatcher made to Der Spiegel best sums up the change in the European chemistry. ''We have to get used to having one country in Europe that is far stronger than the rest,'' she said. ''Everyone has to accept that there is a bigger Germany.''

HEADLINE: Harry Bridges, Docks Leader, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Harry Bridges, a leading figure in America's 20th-century labor movement who organized the West Coast longshoremen in the 1930's, died of emphysema yesterday at his home in San Francisco, the longshoremen's union reported. He was 88 years old.
The Australian-born Mr. Bridges, who entered this country by jumping ship in 1920, was an unyielding unionist at a time when dock strikes could still cripple segments of the economy. He was labeled a Communist by Congress, which sought to deport him as an ''undesirable alien.'' 
He was a dapper, hawk-faced man with a disarming smile who mellowed with age. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, which he headed until 1977, has lost much of its membership and influence to technology.
 
A Salute From San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco ordered city flags to be flown at half-staff in his honor. ''Harry Bridges' death leaves a void that can never be filled,'' the Mayor said. ''He was a legendary figure in the labor movement whose courage and devotion to principle will never be forgotten. All of San Francisco mourns this loss.''
Alfred Renton Bryant Bridges was born July 28, 1901, in Kensington, a suburb of Melbourne. He began his working life as a store clerk, but the novels of Jack London lured him to sea when he was 16. He was shipwrecked twice, once staying afloat on his mandolin.
In 1920, he entered the United States aboard the barkentine Ysabel, but left the crew after arguing with the skipper about the treatment of seamen. He drifted from San Francisco to Mexico, working in the oil fields and as a rigger, and later returned to sea on American merchantmen.
He was in the crew of a ship that arrived in New Orleans in 1921 during a strike. He reported for picket duty and was in charge of a picket squad when the walkout ended. But first he was arrested and jailed overnight, an experience that prompted him to join the Industrial Workers of the World, who were called ''Wobblies.'' He thought the moderate American Federation of Labor had betrayed the strikers.
 
Toll of the Hard, Hard Work
Years later, he recalled that he left the Wobblies after three years because he lost faith in them - ''I forget why.''
Mr. Bridges, who never lost his Australian accent, came to the San Francisco docks in 1922, when stevedores reported for the ''shape-up'' before sunrise to be picked for work or sent away. Continuous hefting of cases and the steady pull of the longshoreman's hook left one hand like a claw for the rest of his life.
His passion for union organization and growing militancy came to the fore in 1933 when he led a group of organizers to establish a longshoremen's local on the San Francisco docks. In six weeks, most dock workers had signed up for the new International Longshoremen's Association local, which demanded wages higher than the prevailing $10.45 a week, coast-wide recognition and a 30-hour week.
Mediation failed and the I.L.A. struck in May 1934. On July 5, the police charged a picket line in which two people were killed and a hundred injured. Martial law was declared. A general strike followed, stopping most industries for three days. The Pullout From the Old A.F.L. Mr. Bridges pulled his I.L.A. local out of the American Federation of Labor in 1937 and took it into what was to become John L. Lewis's militant Congress of Industrial Organizations, He also reorganized his own union, renamed the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, independent of I.L.A.
Antagonism between the rival organizations persisted for years, with Mr. Bridges denouncing the I.L.A. for ''corrupt'' dock-work practices and the I.L.A. shunning him as a ''Communist,'' though he denied ever having joined the Communist Party.
As president of the I.L.W.U., Mr. Bridges enjoyed strong support from his men when Congress tried to deport him in the 1940's. The House of Representatives voted 330 to 42 to deport him, to be oveturned later by the Unites States Supreme Court. In fact, the Court twice ruled in his favor against charges that he was a Communist and had lied about never having been a party member.
 
The Support From the Reds
Mr. Bridges insisted that it was the rank and file that built his union. ''I just got the credit for a lot of it,'' he told an interviewer in 1985. ''I happened to be around at the right time.''
About his acceptance of Communist support, he was not apologetic. Without a treasury to speak of, he explained, the union needed all the help it could get. ''Some of my ideas I had before I knew anything about Communists,'' he said.
Despite his radical reputation, Mr. Bridges also was proud of the ''mechanization and modernization'' agreement he worked out with management in the 1960's to reduce labor costs through improved productivity. In return for higher wages and pension guarantees, the agreement allowed cargo to be handled with mechanical loaders and shipped in prepacked containers.
At the time, the agreement prompted a rising by militants who charged that the former labor revolutionary had become ''a partner of the bosses.''
Mr. Bridges is survived by his wife, Noriko; four children, Julie Fales, Robert Bridges, Jackie Jourdan and Katherine Bridges, all residents of the Bay area; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
The union said his ashes would be scattered in San Francisco Bay. A memorial will be held by the LOcal 10 of the I.L.W.U. at Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco Saturday, April 14.

HEADLINE: Barbara Baer Capitman, 69, Dies; Created Miami Art Deco District

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.
Ms. Capitman, who had lived in Miami since 1973, applied her talents to arouse renewed interest in 1920's and 1930's buildings throughout the country. Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building are among the best examples of Art Deco. 
''My whole life had been Art Deco,'' she once said. ''I was born at the beginning of the period and grew up during the height of it. It's a thing of fate.''
 
Headed a Preservation League
In 1976 she helped to found the Miami Design Preservation League, which in 1979 won Federal historic designation for the South Beach district of Miami Beach. Her outspoken, unorthodox manner later led to her ouster from the group.
''She would push and agitate and cause trouble until people wouldn't speak to her,'' said Michael Kinerk, chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival. ''She was interested in results, not social sensitivities.''
The South Beach district is now on the National Register of Historic Places, the only 20th-century district on the register. That status brought Federal tax relief to what had been a depressed area. It is now enjoying an economic and cultural rebirth.
 
Chapters in Other Towns
Mrs. Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of America, helped found chapters of the society in several cities, including New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. She was the author of ''Deco Delights'' (1989; E. P. Dutton).
She was born in Chicago and attended New York University. She later wrote advertising copy and was a reporter for The Atlantic City Daily World, which has ceased publication.
Her husband, William Capitman, died in 1975. He was a market researcher and economist and in later years a teacher at Florida International University.
Mrs. Capitman leaves two sons, Andrew W., who lives in London, and John A., who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: For Mexico, It's No Fad

 BODY:
This week's announcement that Mexico and the United States would seek to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement appears to be part of a trend. Last year the United States and Canada signed such a pact, and now Senator Phil Gramm has called for offering similar agreements to the struggling countries of Eastern Europe if they create market-based economies.
Are bilateral free trade pacts a sound policy -or a dangerous fad? In the case of Mexico, a close neighbor and large trade partner, the answer is sound policy. In the case of more distant nations, the answer is dangerous fad. A proliferation of bilateral pacts would undermine current U.S. efforts to negotiate multilateral, non-discriminatory trade agreements. 
There is obvious appeal to the idea of a free trade pact between the U.S. and Mexico. U.S. capital and high-tech exports would flow into Mexico, directly helping consumers and forcing Mexican businesses to produce better and cheaper goods. And the mere fact of such an agreement would mark an end to Mexico's 80-year policy of economic protectionism; foreign investors around the globe would be likely to respond favorably.
The U.S. will also benefit - from inexpensive Mexican oil, textiles and manufactured goods. And a more prosperous Mexican economy should ease the flow of illegal immigrants, alleviating a serious source of friction between the two countries. Yet bilateral free trade pacts may also victimize innocent allies. If Mexico, or Eastern Europe, for that matter, gains privileged access to the U.S., exports from Central and South America of items like textiles will suffer. Michael Aho, Director of Economic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, predicts that the politics could become ferocious and might subjugate important trade policy to legislative whim.
Furthermore, bilateral pacts can damage the U.S. economy by diverting trade from low-cost foreign suppliers. For example, Brazil may sell dresses to the United States for less than Mexico. But if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Brazil but not Mexico, U.S. consumers will buy from Mexico anyway. As a result the American economy will have to spend more of its output on dresses than it needs to.
Still, in the case of Mexico, these possible drawbacks are far outweighed by the potential benefits to both countries. Where economies are so entwined and negotiations are possible, governments have an obligation to explore the possibilities.
Extending the same offer to more distant nations makes much less sense. Negotiations over a new international trade agreement are at a delicate stage and are scheduled to conclude by the end of the year. A rush to sign new bilateral pacts would signal a weakened U.S. resolve to establish fair rules that apply equally to everyone. Now is not the time to send such a message.

HEADLINE: The Case for the Mentally Ill

SERIES: Help the Homeless Off the Street - New Calcutta: An occasional series

 BODY:
Under the budget cuts, whole mental health clinics would be closed. What will happen to the people who depend on them for therapy? The suicidal will become more suicidal. Some will die. The extremely irrational will become more irrational and even less able to cope. 
Those fears come in a letter from a New York mental patient anguished by news of proposed cuts in the mental health budget. He raises a compelling point. As the state's bureaucrats and legislators struggle with New York's fiscal crisis, there are some consequences they dare not ignore.
With the Governor and lawmakers now agreed on a budget gap of $1.5 billion, no spending category can be immune. But mental health stands out because even modest cuts could have devastating effect, both on mental patients and their communities.
Cities around the state are struggling to help thousands of troubled mental patients. New York officials have recently become willing to acknowledge the failure of past state policies and to try to help. The cuts announced so far would suspend, if not reverse, that effort.
State officials argue that cuts to mental health aren't out of line. Mental health administrators were counting on $509 million next year to keep up with inflation and sustain existing programs. Budget makers reduced that by $46.9 million but allowed about $26 million in new programs. The list of additional cuts released on Thursday would deduct an additional $22.5 million. Why all the fuss about the net loss of $42.5 million?
Because the cuts fall heavily on programs that keep the mentally ill off the street. In Suffolk County, cutbacks would strand some 700 patients who now rely on three programs for daily support. New York City would lose 674 workers in mental health clinics, along with money for psychiatric emergency rooms and single-room-occupancy housing. Services to more than 5,000 patients would be curtailed. The city's new mental health commissioner, Billy Jones, fears ''a permanent dismantling of the community-based mental health system.''
A budget crisis is no excuse for such an abandonment of basic decency, especially when past state mental health and housing policies did much to create the problem of the homeless mentally ill.
Beyond that, the proposed cutbacks mean that millions of New Yorkers will be forced into more daily confrontations with the bizarre, even grossly offensive behavior of mentally ill people who manifestly deserve supervision and care. A budget crisis is no excuse for that either.

HEADLINE: Will Albany Save Our Heritage?

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes is former Editorial Page Editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It will be a tragic failure of vision and leadership if, because of the New York State budget crisis or other reasons, the single most important initiative of the Cuomo administration is permitted to founder.
The $1.9 billion Environmental Bond Act of 1990 was proposed earlier this year by Gov. Mario Cuomo for submission to the voters in November. Its most important provision now stands in danger of being compromised away or sabotaged altogether. For the sake of the future, this must not be allowed to hap-pen. 
New York State is facing an environmental emergency. Unlike global warming or ozone depletion, this is one that can be solved only by New Yorkers acting alone.
This is an emergency that says: if we do not take strong action to protect and preserve the best of what is left of our environmental heritage -scenic landscapes, wild forest and wilderness areas, pristine lakes and streams, natural habitats, underground water reserves - we and our descendants will never have the opportunity again.
For this reason, exactly half the bond act as the Governor originally proposed it - $950 million, to be expended over a 10-year period - is to be allocated to the state's most pressing environmental need: land acquisition.
Under the Governor's plan, $175 million more was designated for municipal parks and historic preservation. The remainder was to be divided among other environmentally related activities, including $230 million for closing of landfills and recycling of solid wastes.
Of those items, preservation of open land is far and away the most urgent. Every day, top-quality open space is going down in quantity and up in price.
Even during a temporary economic slowdown, as at present, the continuous pressures of speculative real-estate development on such land -whether along the Hudson Valley ''greenway,'' in the pine barrens of eastern Long Island, the Finger Lakes, the Adirondacks, the Catskills or on the Ontario lake shore - are irresistible. The consequent destruction of natural values is irremediable.
Because of lethargy, bureaucracy and inadequate funding, much that should have been protected for the future in these and other particularly vulnerable areas has already been lost.
The state has totally exhausted its resources for direct acquisition of land. Not a dollar is left. The floating of long-term bonds is the most conservative, fiscally responsible and traditional way of funding the purchase of land or easements. New funding is essential now, while the opportunity to buy from willing sellers at relatively manageable prices still exists.
The annual budget crisis provides no excuse for sabotaging the bond act, which is a long-range program that the state can well afford. It will average out in cost to the taxpayer in debt service less than $130 million annually over a 30-year term. This is peanuts in a $51 billion annual budget. There will be no cost at all next year.
The $950 million allocated by Governor Cuomo to land acquisition will yield only $100 million annually, which is no more than what was spent last year. This is barely minimal, considering that at least $2.5 billion needs to be spent for such projects, to be acquired by the public for permanent protection.
The strongest push for re-slicing the bond-act pie comes from politicians with their eyes on fat contracts for their constituents in the construction business. They want more than the $230 million already provided to municipalities for solid-waste management - and want to take it from land-acquisition funds.
The mandatory closing of municipal landfills as well as the start-up of recycling programs and other public works indeed present municipalities with tough financial problems. But they furnish no justification for robbing the state of funds to insure the most fundamental aspect of its environmental future: the protection of sensitive natural areas.
The political maneuverings over the budget and the bond act must not be allowed to shrink the present land-acquisition allotment so much that an environmentally enthusiastic public will come to look on the Environmental Quality Bond Act of 1990 as a fraud.

HEADLINE: Legislators Say Rises in Tuition Are on the Table

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 30

 BODY:
For months, lawmakers here had vowed that raising tuition at the state's public universities would be unmentionable when this year's budget negotiations came around. That's because they tried it last spring, but were humiliated when students seized campus buildings in protest and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vetoed the increases anyway.
Now, in what many Albany officials are rationalizing as a sign of the dire nature of their budget problems, tuition increases are not only being mentioned, they are also being actively promoted by legislative leaders.
But this time, still clearly stung by the debacle they suffered last year, the legislators insist that they will take no action unless the Governor assures them beforehand that he will go along. 
''Sure, you can say the idea is out there, it's on the table,'' one lawmaker said today. ''But you also better say the Governor has got to push for it.''
Tuition at both the City University of New York and the State University of New York has remained constant since 1983. At SUNY it is $1,350 a year, and at CUNY it is $1,250. Both figures are well below the national average for public universities, according to the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based research group.
 
Not Ruling Out Increases
Mr. Cuomo maintains that he is opposed to increases, preferring other ways to raise revenue, but will not rule them out.
''I don't think the Governor would ever be so unwise as to say that higher tuition is absolutely, positively, unequivocally out of the question,'' his spokesman, Gary G. Fryer, said today. When asked about raising tuition at a news conference earlier this month, Mr. Cuomo said, ''At one point, if common sense and logic overwhelm you, then you do it.''
Whether it will be done remains unclear, as the budget is still being pieced together, and the decision now appears to be entirely in Mr. Cuomo's hands. Aides to both the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said they would support tuition increases if Mr. Cuomo does.
The increase vetoed by the Governor last spring was $200 a year for both systems. That amount, minus the extra tuition assistance that the universities would be obligated to pay, would bring in about $26 million in added revenue from SUNY students and $15 million from those attending CUNY. These would go into the state's general fund, thus reducing the present budget gap.
A $200-a-year tuition increase has been most often cited by lawmakers this week, but some have suggested that the increase should be even higher. The national average for tuition at public universities is almost $2,000 a year.
 
No Effect on Poor Students
Last year's tuition increase set off protests by students that included the seizing of buildings at eight CUNY campuses. At a news conference on Thursday in New York City, CUNY student leaders said they would again oppose any increases but stopped short of promising another round of takeovers at campuses.
The president of the student association at SUNY, Judith Krebs, who is also a member of the SUNY board of trustees, said she was strongly opposed to higher tuition, which she maintained would drive away some students. SUNY officials said higher tuition would have no effect on poor students because financial assistance for them would be increased.
Meanwhile, Dr. D. Bruce Johnstone, the SUNY Chancellor, suggested this week that public university tuition be raised annually at a rate tied to inflation, which he said would be more intelligent than sharply raising tuition every few years.
Many other university officials have lobbied behind the scenes for tuition increases, though they have publicly emphasized that a final decision was up to Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature.
Lawmakers were furious with SUNY officials over last spring's tuition drama. The officials lobbied them vigorously and successfully for authorization to raise tuition for in-state students. Then, instead of criticizing Mr. Cuomo for his veto, the SUNY officials worked with him to restore new funds and in the process used at least $5 million from a rainy day fund that some lawmakers said they had known nothing about.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Underwriting Fees Are Staying at a Low Level

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Corporate America kept to a steady pace in raising money from the securities markets in the year's first quarter, but that trend brought little joy to Wall Street, since underwriting fees remained low.
A respectable total of $77.7 billion in securities was issued in the quarter, which ended yesterday, according to the Securities Data Company. The total was up 6 percent from the $73.3 billion issued by corporations in the first quarter of last year. But it is down substantially from the record $91.3 billion that was raised in the fourth quarter of 1989, according to Securities Data. 
In a sign of how difficult business has become on Wall Street, the total fees reported by the firms remained at a level considered low - $592 million in the quarter, up about 5 percent from $564.1 million in fees in the first quarter of 1989, which was one of the poorest quarters since 1984.
The results are, in large part, the result of the collapse of the ''junk bond'' market, in which firms earned huge sums for underwriting the high-risk securities. The demand for many types of debt offerings slackened, leaving firms to concentrate on stock issues, which produce comparatively little in fees.
Wall Street executives said there were widespread expectations early in the quarter that interest rates would head lower, causing many issuers to postpone financings.
But ''there has been a general sentiment that the economy has bottomed out and that rates might go higher,'' said Mark Seigel, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''And so, we have seen an increasing sentiment among issuers to consider accelerating their financial plans.''
Accordingly, Wall Street executives said they think they have come through the worst for the year. ''We expect an active second and third quarter,'' said Edson Mitchell, head of global debt financing desk at Merrill Lynch & Company.
People on Wall Street were most surprised about the signs of life in the market for new equity issues, an area that has been fragile since the market collapse in October 1987. ''There was finally some signs of a turn in equity issuance in the first quarter,'' said Kevin Kennedy, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
More than $7 billion was raised through stock issues in the first three months of 1990, an 82 percent increase over the comparable period in 1989.
Initial public offerings totaled about $4.3 billion in the quarter, compared with $3.1 billion in 1989 period.
But issuance of debt securities slid during the quarter. The fixed-income market raised $25.6 billion, down 33 percent from the $38.4 billion raised in the 1989 quarter. The rest of the offerings the quarter included an array of securities like mortgage-backed securities.
The turmoil on Wall Street led to some significant shifts in the underwriting ranking of the securities firms. While Merill Lynch, which has led the ranking for years, kept the top spot, its share of the market fell to 16 percent, from 18.9 percent in the 1989 quarter, according to Securities Data.
Other firms, which have announced large layoffs or have had significant losses from investment banking activities, slipped in the ranking. For example, the First Boston Corporation, fell from third to sixth, as its market share plummeted from 14.4 percent to 6.5 percent. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fell from sixth to eighth.
The beneficiaries of this turmoil were a diverse group of Wall Street firms.
Goldman, Sachs had the best performance after Merrill, and had a slight increase in market share, from 14.8 percent in the first quarter last year to 14.9 percent.
Morgan Stanley had a big gain in its share, taking 13.1 percent of the market, compared with 7.2 percent in the 1989 period. This year it ranked third, up from fifth.

HEADLINE: Japan Sobered by Recent Stock Slide

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 30

 BODY:
As prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange shuddered and plunged last week, the switchboards at the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation lighted up with shareholders expressing amazement, shock and disbelief: This was not supposed to happen, they all said.
For millions of Japanese who began investing in stocks for the first time in the last few years, the continuing slide in the Tokyo market -down nearly 25 percent since the start of the year - is the first reversal they have experienced, after years of steady gains.
''In a way, we think it's natural for them to get angry,'' said Hiroyuki Ishihara, chief of the stock division of Nippon Telegraph, the world's largest company as measured by the value of its equity. ''We're feeling very regretful.'' 
Japanese investors may be disillusioned but, by most accounts, they are not yet pulling out of the stock market altogether. Moreover, analysts here expect only a modest spillover from the stock market drop to the Japanese economy.
In the United States after the October 1987 market crash, there was deep anxiety about whether Wall Street's troubles would spread to Main Street, which eventually proved unfounded. In Japan today, similar worries have been expressed, but there appears to be even less cause for concern.
To be sure, Japanese analysts are beginning to scale back their sales forecasts for big-ticket items like luxury cars and expensive television sets - the kind of goods typically purchased by wealthier people who own shares. Still, retail sales rose 10 percent in February and the Japanese economy remains vibrant.
One reason the effect of the market's slide is likely to be modest is that stocks are held by a comparatively small proportion of the population, despite the many individuals who have become first-time investors in recent years. The Tokyo Stock Exchange estimates the number of individual shareholders in Japan to be about 10 million, or only 8 percent of the population.
By contrast, the most recent estimates of individual shareholders in the United States, which has twice the population of Japan, is more than 40 million. The weight of individual investors in the stock market is also much greater in the United States than in Japan. Though their percentage of all stock holdings has declined for a quarter of a century, American individuals own about 55 percent of the value of all shares, according to the Securities Industry Association. In Japan, individuals hold roughly 22 percent.
Japanese stock traders and analysts agree that the recent market downturn has altered the psychological climate for stocks and investments in Japan, but not scared them away from the market completely.
 
'Many Wonderful Moments'
 That seemed to be the sentiment this week of most of the office workers and shoppers who came to a downtown branch of the Nomura Securities Company, the nation's largest borker, to stare at an electronic board listing the latest stock prices.
''I can't quit because I've had so many wonderful moments in the last few years,'' said Hideki Saito, a 36-year-old advertising executive. ''It's like horse racing, I guess. Even if the odds are bad, you feel so good when you make money.''
Many shareholders consider that they have not lost on their original investment, given the tripling of the exchange's value in the last half of the 1980's, so the recent dip has not been devastatingfor most of them.
''Before the last few months, people began to think that the stock market is a one-way street, and that it can only go up,'' said Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni & Company, a credit-rating service. ''It's been a shock to many people.''
Indeed, until the recent drop, Japan has ridden the crest of one of the most extraordinary stock booms on record, drawing housewives, farmers, small-business men and salaried workers into the market.
 
Many Types of Investors
 Typical of the new class of investors is the 35-year-old housewife who wrote an anonymous column in the Asahi newspaper last month entitled ''My Stock Experience.'' She said she had invested her husband's bonuses and savings and earned $13,000 on a $32,000 investment since 1988.
''But since the start of this year, it's been no good,'' she wrote, explaining that four of the five companies, many of them retail chains, in which she owned shares had gone down. ''Since they are strong industries, I think prices will go back up, so I am waiting.''
At a small branch office of Nikko Securities in a town outside Kyoto in western Japan, the deputy chief for sales said in a telephone interview that he and his colleagues had spent much of the week reassuring wary investors.
''Thank God, we did not have much trouble with our customers,'' said Tatsuya Nakajima, the deputy chief. ''We've had complaints from people who said we had promised the market would rebound. But at least we haven't heard of anyone committing suicide, which we heard about many years ago.''
At the Nomura offices in Ginza, investors repeatedly said that they would not drop out of the stock market.
''A few people might have been shocked at this drop, and they sold their stocks,'' said Teiji Kishi, a bank manager, as his friend nodded. ''But if it keeps recovering, this might be a good time to put more money in.''
 
View of the Have-Nots
 Many economists say that the soaring prices of stocks and land in Japan over the last several years have created resentment among many Japanese who have not participated in the boom. Indeed, there was some evidence that the have-nots of Japanese society may have taken a bit of pleasure in the misery of others who suffered losses in stocks recently.
''I'm a student and I don't have any funds of my own,'' said Yuichiro Kuwamura, a 21-year-old in faded jeans and leather jacket who was inspecting an automobile showroom near the Nomura offices. ''If too many people start to get easy money from the stock market, the basis of our economy could be lost.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Lists Barriers To Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The Bush Administration published an inventory of global trade barriers today, listing 35 countries and 2 regional trading blocs that it said maintained the ''most important'' obstacles to American exports.
As expected, Japan, which accounted for nearly half of the $109 billion American trade deficit last year, was accused of maintaining the most barriers, followed by the European Community, Canada, South Korea, India and Brazil. In the 216-page volume, Japanese restrictions took up 19 pages.
Pressure has been building in Congress and in the Administration to get the Japanese to relax trade barriers, and intensive negotiations have been under way regarding satellites, supercomputers and wood products. 
 
'Must Keep Up the Pressure'
 ''Until the long list of barriers that U.S. business faces in Japan is cut down substantially, the U.S. must keep up the pressure on Japan to open its market,'' said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee.
The Japanese Embassy declined to comment. Hideaki Ueda, press counselor at the embassy, said Japanese officials had not yet had a chance to study the document.
The list, mandated by Congress, has been released annually for the last five years. But under the so-called Super 301 provision of 1988 trade legislation it has assumed greater importance as part of a process by which the United States designates ''priority'' countries and trade practices for intensive negotiations and possible retaliation. Under the statute, the Administration has until April 30 to designate the countries and practices that will be given priority in its trade policy this year.
 
Countries Facing Retaliation
 Japan, Brazil and India were designated as priority countries last year and face retaliation if barriers are not lifted by June 16. The retaliatory measures can include tariffs that would double the price of selected imports from the offending country.
Most of the restrictions cited today have appeared in earlier listings. Progress was reported in a few areas, as in quotas on beef imports by South Korea, which have been progressively reduced.
This year's report identifies some new impediments, like shipbuilding subsidies in Finland, Japan, Korea and Norway. Under pressure from its domestic shipbuilders, the United States has been fighting such subsidies within the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Today's report suggests escalation of the anti-subsidy campaign.
The new listing of a Japanese barrier involving amorphous metals, which are used in electrical transformers, could be a sign that it will be designated a priority matter next month.
 
Complaint by Allied-Signal
 Unlike conventional metals, amorphous metals have no crystalline structure, making them highly effective converters of electrical energy. The metals are made by Allied-Signal Inc. of Morristown, N.J. The company has filed a complaint about the Japanese restriction under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, The trade office has until April 19 to decide whether to retaliate.
Today's report cites the Allied-Signal complaint, which was taken as a sign that the Government is seriously considering pressing the case with the Japanese. David C. Hill, senior vice president of Allied, said the company believes it could get an additional $100 million of business in Japan if the barrier was lifted.
Israel was named for the first time among the countries with significant trade barriers. Joshua Bolten, general counsel of the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said no adverse inferences about American-Israeli relations should be drawn. ''No broader political interests are brought into play here,'' he stressed. The report is prepared by the trade representative's office, but goes through an interagency process involving the State, Treasury and Defense Departments.
 
No Dramatic Growth
 The United States has a five-year-old free-trade agreement with Israel that American officials say is operating reasonably well, although it has not led to the dramatic expansion of trade that both Governments had expected. The two-way trade was $6 billion last year, with the United States in deficit by $400 million.
The report took issue with what it termed Israel's ''extensive'' agricultural import restrictions and with taxation, standards and import-licensing procedures that it said generally discriminated against imports.
In discussing barriers in the 12-nation European Community, the report said that the subsidies from four members - Germany, France, Britain and Spain - for Airbus Industrie remained a concern. The subsidies are viewed as giving the European commercial aircraft builder unfair advantages over American companies like Boeing and Lockheed.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rebound With 1.8% February Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Orders to factories for manufactured goods in February bounced back 1.8 percent from January, when they had their steepest plunge in 16 years, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $231.6 billion in February. Factory orders plummeted 5.5 percent in January, the steepest drop since a 7 percent decline in December 1974, the department said in revising the January figure downward. The department had initially said orders dropped 5.4 percent in January. 
Analysts said the February report was more evidence of sluggishness in the industrial sector of the economy, but they also found signs indicating improvement.
 
'On a Plateau'
 ''Manufacturing is aimlessly drifting along on a plateau,'' said Robert G. Dederick, the chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''The mini-recession in manufacturing is still there.''
Evalina Tainer, a senior economist for the First National Bank of Chicago, agreed, but added that the report suggested ''the manufacturing sector has bottomed out and we could be a little bit on the mend.''
Both Mr. Dederick and Ms. Tainer saw signs of optimism in a category often used in measuring future business investment.
''Capital-goods orders, less aircraft, are looking a little firmer than they did before,'' Mr. Dederick said. ''They're showing some signs of underlying support to the expansion. I'm not saying strength, but weakness is not developing.''
The Commerce Department said nonmilitary capital-goods orders, less aircraft, rose 2.2 percent in February. While they declined in January, the drop was revised today to 4.1 percent from the 4.4 percent decrease originally reported.
Orders for durable goods, expensive products expected to last at least three years, advanced 2.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $120.9 billion, after sinking 10.5 percent in January, the biggest drop in the 32 years of record-keeping. The January decline broke the previous record of 9.2 percent set during the last recession in February 1982.
Durable-goods orders have been affected most by the Federal Reserve's high-interest policies because they are often financed by loans or credit cards.
The department said durable-goods orders were concentrated in transportation equipment, up 10.4 percent, to $29.9 billion. Transportation orders had led the overall January decline with a drop of 29.4 percent. Excluding transportation, orders were up six-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders for nondurable goods rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $110.7 billion, after a January gain of six-tenths of 1 percent. The largest increases were in food and printing and publishing.
 
Military Orders Climb
 Military orders, which are often volatile, advanced 21.7 percent, to $7.9 billion, after falling 33.6 percent the previous month.
The Commerce Department also reported shipments rose 3.3 percent, to $234.2 billion, after a 1.8 percent decline in January. Inventories eased one-tenth of 1 percent, to $373.9 billion, after a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.
Analysts watch inventories closely because if they increase without a corresponding gain in new orders, production cutbacks and job losses could occur as factories try to get rid of goods stored on shelves and back lots.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid to Farmers Post 1.3% Increase

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Prices farmers received for raw products increased 1.3 percent from February to March, raising the overall commodity index 2.7 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.
Higher prices for hogs, eggs, cattle and potatoes were mostly responsible for the increase from February, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
 
Milk Tumbles
 But the report said lower prices for tomatoes, milk and wheat partly offset the gains for the other commodities. Most prices are mid-March averages, which will be revised next month. 
''Hog and cattle prices moved up sharply from February, while the all-milk price declined for the second consecutive month,'' the report said. ''Tomatoes declined sharply from February, but continuing short supplies kept prices well above normal for this time of year.''
Milk prices had risen to record levels until they tumbled sharply in February, reflecting production increases.
''Prices of feed grain, food grains and oilseeds were mixed,'' the report said. ''Corn and soybean prices increased slightly, while the wheat price was down. Hay prices showed a moderate increase from February.''
Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 may be in the range of $54 billion to $58 billion, compared with about $53 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
Consumer food prices are forecast by department economists to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year after gaining 5.7 percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
 
Livestock and Poultry Up
 Based on the preliminary figures, the March price index for livestock and poultry was up 2.4 percent from February and averaged 7.5 percent more than a year ago.
Milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in March to an average of $13.80 for each l00 pounds. Even so, the preliminary March price was up $1.10 from March 1989.
Over all, crop prices rose eight-tenths of 1 percent from February but were 2.9 percent below the level a year earlier. Fruit prices, led by grapefruit and oranges, were up 7 percent from February and averaged 6.4 percent more than a year ago.
The index for commercial vegetables dropped 4.9 percent from February but still averaged 39 percent more than in March 1989.
The report said that cattle averaged $75.40 for each 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $74.60 in February and $72 in March 1989. Hogs averaged $52 for each 100 pounds, compared with $48.20 in February and $39.30 a year earlier. Eggs were 79.3 cents a dozen, compared with 70.4 cents in February and 80.1 cents in March 1989.

HEADLINE: Fed Stayed With Policy In February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided at their February meeting to continue the policy aimed at maintaining high interest rates to keep inflationary pressures under control, according to minutes released today.
The Federal funds rate has been steady at 8.25 percent since the Fed let it drop from 8.5 percent on Dec. 21, after the previous Fed policy meeting on Dec. 18-19. The Federal funds rate is the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans and is the primary lever the Fed uses to control short-term rates. 
The policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, met again on Tuesday and analysts said they believed it voted to continue the current policies. Minutes of that meeting will be released in May.
 
Meetings Eight Times a Year
 The committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed. It consists of the seven Federal Reserve Board members and 5 of the 12 presidents of the Fed's district banks.
At the conclusion of the Feb. 6-7 meeting, the committee voted by 8 to 3 not to change policies, although they agreed some firming or easing of credit would be acceptable, depending on economic developments.
The session was marked by an usually high number of dissenting votes. Three members objected to the directive - W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland because he wanted ''some firming'' of policy, Robert H. Boykin of Dallas because he wanted a directive ''tilted'' toward tightness if conditions warranted and Martha R. Seger, a board member, because of a preference for ''some easing.''
 
Three Dissents on Targets
 The minutes also showed three dissents in adopting monetary targets for 1990, the substance of which was disclosed before Congress shortly after the meeting. On this, the no votes came from Mr. Hoskins, Ms. Seger and Gary H. Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
At the meeting, the information on economic conditions ''suggested continued but sluggish expansion in overall economic activity, with conditions uneven across sectors,'' the minutes read.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
A.T.&T. Card Offers New Connection

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Millions of Americans are being asked to try yet another credit card, this time the American Telephone & Telegraph Company's new calling and general-purpose card. The first word is that it seems to be a good deal for many consumers.
''This is a tremendous potential boon for the 35 percent of card holders who pay off their entire credit card bill each month,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group. ''Secondly, it is good news for those people who make a great number of long-distance A.T.&T. calls and want the convenience of a combination card with a 10 percent discount.'' 
 
Variable Interest Rate
 The interest rate on the combination card - the A.T.&T. Universal card - will be variable and has been initially set at 18.9 percent, just slightly below the 19.2 percent average rate of the top 10 issuers of bank cards. Since the A.T.&T. rate will move in tandem with the prime rate, it could rise substantially in the years ahead. But if it does and consumers are unhappy, they can cancel the card at any time.
A.T.&T. is trying to emphasize how its card is different from the bewildering array of offerings in the credit-card market. While other large card issuers have previously offered other amenities like discounts on merchandise to lure cardholders, the battleground seems to be shifting to widely used services like telephone calls.
Basically, the new card is another version of a Mastercard or Visa issued by a bank, in this case, the Universal Bank of Columbus, Ga., and has many of the same attributes of other bank cards. But there are major differences that could tip the scales in its favor.
For example, there will never be an annual fee for those who become members in 1990 and make at least one purchase a year using the card. In addition, members will get a 10 percent discount on all A.T.&T. long-distance charges for calls made with the card.
With A.T.&T.'s resources, marketing clout and brand name behind it, there is no question that the all-in-one card will be a major contender in the multi-billion-dollar credit-card sweepstakes. Cardholders will be able to buy goods and services at seven million locations and get cash at 300,000 banks and automatic teller machines.
Mailings to A.T.&T. customers and holders of its existing calling cards are under way and applications can be requested by calling 800-66-APPLY; the entire application procedure can be handled on the phone. If applicants do not specifically request a Visa or Mastercard version, they will be allocated one or the other. Those whose income, credit references and other characteristics qualify them for a gold card will automatically receive a gold Visa.
''The combination of a calling card with a credit card is a logical expansion of services to A.T.&T.'s existing clientele,'' said H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a credit-card newsletter.
A.T.&T. is betting on two things: First, that millions of consumers will apply for the card. Second, that a large percentage of those who get the new card will throw away their other Visas and Mastercards, as well as some or all of their department store, oil company and other single-purpose charge cards, and send that business A.T.&T.'s way. The more credit cards a person has, the larger the potential amount that can be borrowed - a situation that some lenders consider a negative factor in deciding whether to to grant more credit.
 
Some Are Skeptical
 Despite A.T.&T.'s muscle, other telecommunications corporations have already staked out a share of the multi-purpose credit card field.
The MCI Communications Corporation has signed up 13 banks that will bill its long-distance calls on Visa cards, and the U S Sprint Communications Company is marketing a combination long-distance calling card and Visa card. Even one of the local telephone operating companies, the Southern New England Telephone Company, offers a combined calling and credit card.
Paul Kahn, president of A.T.&T.'s Jacksonville, Fla.,-based A.T.&T. Universal Card Services unit, explained its entry into the competitive market by observing that people ''want to carry fewer cards and have those cards do more.''
Just by announcing its plans, A.T.&T. has become the talk of the credit-card industry. This week at a regional conference held in New Orleans by the American Bankers Association, experts presented a panel that analyzed A.T.&T.'s card and other credit cards that compete with the traditional bank cards.
One panelist, Allen R. DeCotiis, president of Payment Systems Inc., a Tampa, Fla., consulting concern, thinks that A.T.&T. was much too late entering the market. ''They're 18 to 24 months late at a minimum,'' he said. ''The market growth now is less than in the early to mid-1980's.''
But other financial-services consultants see the A.T.&T. card as a definite plus for the consumer. ''You're going to get no annual fee and a lower interest rate for those balances that do roll over,'' said Bruce Brittain, president of Brittain Associates of Atlanta, another panelist. ''This will give consumers an opportunity to vote with their dollars.''
 
 
 
WHEN USING A PAY PHONE
 The new A.T.& T. Universal card can be used at any pay telephone. There is a 10 percent discount from the regular price, but procedures vary depending on the type of phone used:
 With a ''swipe'' phone that reads the magnetic strip on the back of the card when it is run through a slot on the phone, dial the area code and phone number, followed by an assigned four-digit personal identification number, or PIN. Then a caller will hear a recording that says, ''Thank you for using A.T.& T.,'' and the ringing will begin.
 With a regular push-button phone, punch in 0, the area code and phone number, the 10-digit calling card number printed at the bottom of the card (not the large-type number in the center of the card) and the PIN. Again there will be an A.T.& T. recording before the ringing starts.
 A warning: If the pay phone is not presubscribed to A.T.& T., the call will be sent along the lines of another long-distance carrier and there will not be a 10 percent discount. The indication that it is not an A.T.& T. phone is that there will be no A.T.& T. recording after punching in the required 25 numbers. At that point, hang up before someone answers. Then, start all over again by dialing an access code - 10 - ATT - and begin the same dialing procedure.
