Fund for Colleges Loses $128 Million
The Common Fund, which oversees almost $20 billion for colleges and other educational institutions, said it lost about $128 million after a rogue trader at First Capital Strategists, which manages securities owned by the fund, failed to hedge investments.
The loss was discovered late on Thursday, and it was still not clear which of the fund's investors would suffer. The fund organizes investment programs for 1,421 colleges, including the University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University and the University of Southern California. [Page 1.]
 
Filibuster Blocks Budget Bill

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Casino Plan Excludes New York

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vowed yesterday to oppose a ballot referendum that would permit casino gambling in New York State unless legislators change the measure to permit gambling in New York City.
 Late Thursday, the State Legislature approved a resolution that would allow casinos in certain areas of the state, including Niagara Falls, Lake George, and the Catskills -- but not in New York City or on Long Island. To become law, the constitutional amendment must be approved again by the Legislature in 1997 and would then go before voters late that year or in 1998. 
 The Mayor said it was strange that New York City legislators, including Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker from Manhattan, had voted for an amendment that he said would hurt the city by driving revenues upstate. The city, he said, should be treated the same as other areas of the state.
 "If it were on the ballot as a referendum in its present form, I would oppose it," he said at a news conference. "And I would urge people in New York City to all vote against it."
 He suggested that the decision to leave out the city might have been a deliberate ploy by anti-casino forces who hope the matter can be defeated. Because city voters are the ones most likely to support gambling, he said, it made no sense to alienate them by restricting gambling to rural areas.
 The Mayor's comments added another layer of opposition to the gambling amendment, already under fire from religious groups on moral grounds and from those who believe that gambling is an improper way for governments to collect revenue. The amendment had been considered dead, but was revived in the State Senate at the last minute Thursday night by the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. Hotel and resort executives, as well as the casino industry, had been lobbying for passage.
 Patricia Lynch, the spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said the Mayor's comments were premature, because the city could still be added to the amendment in the next session. New York City was left out, she said, because the intent of the amendment was to provide relief for economically depressed tourist areas of the state, which she said did not include the city. In addition, she said, many legislators were concerned that the social ills that have been known to accompany casino gambling in urban areas such as Atlantic City should not be encouraged in New York City.
 Mr. Giuliani said the decision on how and where gambling should be implemented in the city is one that he and the City Council should make. Tying the city's hands, he added, eliminates those options and all but insures that there will be no gambling anywhere in the state.
 "If you think about the votes on how you get a referendum through on gambling, you'd need New York City, and you'd need New York City big," he said. "Because you're going to probably have the most support for gambling in New York City, you're going to have the least amount of support for gambling in upstate New York, and you're going to have kind of a swing in the suburbs. It seems to me if you really want to have casino gambling, you're going to want to get a big vote in New York City for it."
 Several legislators complained privately that Mayor Giuliani never spoke to them before the vote or made his feelings known on the subject. The complaints were similar to those made after the Legislature passed a state budget that fell far short of meeting the city's request. Democratic legislators said the Mayor never made any attempt to lobby them.
 Aides to the Mayor said the city's inclusion was likely to be a higher legislative priority when the matter is taken up again in the next session.
 Gov. George E. Pataki seemed to agree, saying the city's inclusion was something that could be looked at next year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lifting Trade Penalties On Taiwan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
President Clinton announced today that the United States was lifting trade sanctions imposed against Taiwan last year for refusing to stop the sale of tiger bones and rhinoceros parts.
The move, which ends a ban on imports of Taiwanese sea and wildlife products like coral jewelry and lizard boots, was in response to Taiwan's recent actions to raise penalties for trafficking in tiger and rhino parts and to increase police efforts to crack down on such sales. 
 Administration officials said the announcement was not related to Washington's soured relations with Beijing, although several analysts said China was likely to react unfavorably to the move on the grounds that it is yet another kind gesture to Taiwan. American relations with Beijing, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, took a sharp turn for the worse last month when the Administration agreed to allow President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to attend an alumni reunion at Cornell University.
"I would not read anything into the timing as to wider issues of U.S.-Taiwan relations or U.S.-China relations," a State Department official said. "We made this decision now because Taiwan did everything we asked it to do to stop the trade in animal parts."
When Mr. Clinton imposed the sanctions in April 1994, it was the first time a President had used such penalties to protect endangered species. The Administration moved against Taiwan because it was doing less than some other nations to discourage its citizens from using tiger and rhino parts and to crack down on smugglers.
Many people in Asia use tiger and rhinoceros parts as medicines and aphrodisiacs. Rhino horn is often used as a fever-reducing compound, and tiger bone is often prescribed for arthritis and rheumatism.
While trade sanctions often have little effect, Administration officials said they had worked well in this case because Taiwan's leaders were embarrassed by the displeasure of a longtime ally. The sanctions affected only about $25 million of Taiwan's exports to the United States, which totaled $24.4 billion last year.
Mr. Clinton imposed the sanctions after wildlife groups had pressed him to protect the fast-diminishing tiger and rhino population.

HEADLINE: President Weighing Risks of Rejecting Base-Closings List

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Facing outrage in California, the White House and Pentagon are weighing the political costs of rejecting, for the first time, the recommendations of an independent commission on the closing of military bases.
A tug-of-war centered on McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento has developed between White House political operatives, who view California's 54 electoral votes as crucial to President Clinton's 1996 campaign hopes, and commission members, who are vowing to stick to their guns to close it and eliminate nearly 11,000 military and civilian jobs. 
 The Administration is considering a complicated political calculus: what does Mr. Clinton gain with California voters if he rejects recommendations that the commission will likely return to him unchanged? And what might he lose if members of Congress accuse him of politicizing a process that has successfully worked in 1988, 1991 and 1993 to save billions of dollars?
The President has the opportunity to suggest changes in the panel's decisions, but ultimately, both he and the Congress must accept or reject the findings in their entirety.
"The leanings here are toward rejection, but we're waiting to see if the Pentagon has a credible enough reason to do that," said one White House official, who emphasized that no final decision had been made.
Pentagon analysts have been reviewing the commission's recommendations, which will be formally submitted to the White House on Saturday, looking for reasons of military value, cost and economic impact on California to justify rejecting the eight-member commission's work.
"Obviously, we have serious heartburn with this, but we have to look at the full package before making any final recommendation," Deputy Defense Secretary John White said in an interview.
Senior Pentagon officials are waiting for Defense Secretary William J. Perry to return on Sunday from a weeklong trip to Europe to decide what to recommend to the White House. The Pentagon is not expected to send its findings to the White House until after the July 4 holiday, military officials said.
Meanwhile, a growing number of Senate and House Republicans, including some conservatives from Southern California, are warning Mr. Clinton not to disrupt a process that Congress established specifically to shield lawmakers from the painful task of closing bases in their districts.
"Rejection of the commission's recommendations for overt political reasons will raise serious questions about the integrity of the entire process," the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, and Representative Floyd Spence, a South Carolina Republican who heads the House National Security Committee, said today in a letter to Mr. Clinton.
Commission members, who last week voted 6 to 2 to close McClellan, say reversing that decision is unlikely. "There's a good chance the President will send it back," said Joe Robles Jr., a retired Army major general who voted against McClellan. "But if I had to vote again I'd close it."
General Robles said that he and other commissioners were suspicious of Air Force claims that closing McClellan and another large maintenance depot, Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, would hurt military readiness. Commissioners also said the Air Force overestimated costs and underestimated savings.
The panel's chairman, Alan Dixon, a former Democratic Senator from Illinois, left little doubt that the panel would be wary to alter the results of four months of analysis. "It's a prudent, sensible list, arrived at openly and fairly, and we're proud of our work," Mr. Dixon told reporters today.
Indeed, for the first time in the base-closing process, the panel proposed saving more money than the President recommended. The Administration's suggestions would save $19 billion over 20 years and the commission's list would save $19.3 billion. The panel's list would also eliminate about 50,000 additional civilian and military jobs that are directly or indirectly tied to the bases.
The President has until July 15 to accept the panel's recommendations or return the list to the panel citing his objections. If the White House were to reject the list, which has never happened before, the commission would have until Aug. 15 to make any changes.
Mr. Clinton would then have to accept or reject the entire package. But few Congressional or military officials expect Mr. Clinton to veto the recommendations from the last scheduled round of base closings. The Pentagon is counting on the savings to help buy new weapons and pay other bills. The panel did recommend another round of closings in 2001.
Aside from McClellan, the commission altered the Pentagon's list in several other ways, including closing Kelly and keeping open the Rome Laboratory in New York. But the California changes have stirred the loudest cries.
"This commission went bonkers," Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said in a telephone interview. "They were arrogant and not mindful of their obligation to look at cumulative economic impact."
As a result of the three earlier rounds of base closings, California has lost 22 bases and more than 200,000 jobs. As the largest state on the West Coast and beneficiary of the military buildup during World War II, California also had the most to give up.
But Mr. Dixon took issue that California was suffering more than any other state. In fact, he said, Alabama and Alaska had lost 0.4 percent of total jobs in the state through base closings. California, along with Texas, North Dakota and Connecticut, lost 0.3 percent of their jobs.

New Term for Shalikashvili
 CHICAGO, June 30 (Reuters) -- President Clinton today nominated Gen. John Shalikashvili to serve a second two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, calling him a "shining symbol" of the United States armed forces.
The President said in a statement released during a visit here that General Shalikashvili, who became chairman in 1993, had provided "wise and reasoned counsel" and the "sound leadership needed to keep our military strong while shaping the armed forces for the 21st century."

HEADLINE: Mayor Loses Political Fray In Legislature

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 30

 BODY:
The 1995 legislative session ended shortly before dawn today after several demonstrations of the kind of hardball politics that have come to typify the arm-twisting, back-scratching and retaliation of Albany's annual race to recess. And the primary victim of this year's last-minute wrangling may be the Giuliani administration.
 In the final hours of the session, the Legislature passed bills, which Mr. Giuliani opposed, that would tie the city's hands in managing its Police Department while killing legislation coveted by the Mayor that would have provided property tax incentives for development in lower Manhattan. 
 The tax abatement bill died last night when the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, declined to submit it for a vote after the Democratic-led Assembly had passed it. Mr. Giuliani proposed the measure with great fanfare late last year in an effort to encourage development in lower Manhattan, an area beleaguered by aging buildings, declining rents and high vacancy rates.
 Legislators and lobbyists said today that the Manhattan development bill died not because of its merits -- it has broad bipartisan support -- but because of a bit of terrible political timing. It came to the Senate floor on a day when its chief sponsor, minority leader Martin Connor, a Democrat who represents sections of Brooklyn and lower Manhattan, had infuriated Mr. Bruno.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Connor had informed Mr. Bruno that he would not deliver expected Democratic votes to help pass a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment on casino gambling. That sent Mr. Bruno scurrying in search of votes from his Republican colleagues, many of whom do not support casino gambling and voted for the resolution only to save Mr. Bruno from deep political embarrassment.
 The casino resolution passed, but Mr. Connor's audacity seemed to seal the fate of the lower Manhattan legislation. Mr. Connor said that when he called Mr. Bruno to tell him that he would not provide Democratic votes for casino gambling, Mr. Bruno snapped, "Well then, I'm not going to do lower Manhattan."
 Mr. Bruno denied making that comment. "It was in no way tied to the casinos," Mr. Bruno said in an interview. "We just need some time. We need more input. We need to take a closer look at the ramifications. I didn't really get a chance to talk to the Mayor about it."
 Mr. Bruno showed no such hesitation in allowing a vote on the police bills, which were pushed aggressively by politically influential police officers' unions, though he suggested he had not studied them in detail.
"You know, I'm not familiar that specifically with them," Mr. Bruno said. "I knew we were doing some things, but I can't tell you really what they were. It just seemed that some things should go on."
 One of the police bills would require the city to promote sergeants and lieutenants who have held investigative or organized crime assignments for at least 18 months. More than 600 officers would be promoted immediately at a cost of $1.4 million in the 1996 fiscal year and $4.2 million by 1999, according to city estimates.
 Another bill would specify that the detective bureau must consist of 70 percent third-grade detectives, the lowest level, 20 percent second-grade detectives and 10 percent first-grade detectives. The bill would require wholesale promotions of detectives at a cost of nearly $10 million in 1996.
 Yet another police bill that the Legislature passed earlier this week would remove the police commissioner from the final disposition of discipline cases, giving that authority to an independent arbitrator. Mr. Giuliani opposes all the police bills on the ground that they impose costs on the city without compensation and that they substitute the Legislature's judgment for the Police Department's. The Mayor called on Gov. George E. Pataki today to veto the bills, but the Governor said he had not yet decided what he would do.
 Business leaders in lower Manhattan said they still hoped that the Senate would enact the property tax abatements during an expected special session this fall. But they said the bill's failure last night could delay a number of significant development projects, including the Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street that Mr. Giuliani announced earlier this month.
 Developers, legislators and lobbyists said they found great irony in Mr. Bruno's decision to kill the bill. Few initiatives, they said, could be more Republican in philosophy than providing tax abatements for business development. Furthermore, they said, many of the developers who would have benefitted from the bill are significant contributors to Republican candidates.
 "I think it's unfortunate," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who also represents lower Manhattan. "I think it was pure politics by the Senate side." Mr. Silver said the bill may have died because "Senator Bruno thought he was going to punish Marty Connor."

HEADLINE: Zhuzhou Journal;
On China's Overburdened Highway System, It's the Big Stall

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: ZHUZHOU, China

 BODY:
New York commuters who get steamed over traffic snarls might consider the plight of 24-year-old Zhou Hui and his two companions, who have been in traffic jams that last as long as three days.
Hanging out of the cab of his 10-ton truck, which was straining under the 14 tons of lumber draped over its backside, Mr. Zhou gazed up the line of traffic that stretched to the horizon in front of him and shook his head. 
 "From 12 o'clock last night until 8 o'clock this morning, we have not moved," Mr. Zhou said. "Look at us, our shirts are filthy, and we have no opportunity to wash. This is the pits."
With its enormous economic surge, China is straining the foundations of its 19th-century transportation system. Though road building is a national frenzy, China has fewer paved roads than Depression-era America. A national highway network remains a distant dream. It is faster to move cargo along the river system or ancient canals than to use the roads.
The burden on the highways is most apparent here, along the central highway of Hunan Province, which has become an extraordinary corridor of commerce that is opening southern China's internal market to Guangzhou, Hong Kong and the world.
Traffic on this stretch of the highway has been backed up more than 10 miles in both directions for weeks as the Hunan Province highway authority tries to put a new surface on a treacherous stretch of potholes, dips, cuts and trenches.
Mr. Zhou is one of three drivers who rotate shifts behind the wheel of the creaking lumber carrier. It will take them more than two days to cover the 240 miles from Jianghua in southern Hunan to the lumber mill in Changsha, the provincial capital.
That works out to less than five miles per hour. And they have to make the trip five to six times a month.
The long, tedious hours are punctuated by horrific collisions or furious fistfights.
Li Xinhua, 19, is one of the traffic policemen who is supposed to bring discipline to the chaos, where tempers can flare over the loss of time and money out there on the steaming pavement.
"The worst is when some of the drivers get so mad they come down out of their trucks and try to beat us," Officer Li said.
He talked as he commandeered the car of foreign travelers only too willing to use his authority to jump to the front of the line. It was Mr. Li's job to tell a policeman five miles ahead to stop the single lane of traffic that was moving south so the opposite lane could have a chance to start moving north again.
This method of alternating lanes was supposed to happen every 20 minutes, but the police have no walkie-talkies, so everything depends on word of mouth passed up the line, or on couriers like Officer Li.
Complicating matters this afternoon is that a truck carrying crushed rock has plowed into a cargo truck, igniting one vehicle's gasoline tank and creating a fire that has blocked both lanes, the one standing still and the one that was supposed to be moving.
One of the drivers did not survive the inferno and lay on the pavement, a charred corpse. Several hundred drivers had abandoned their vehicles and their torpor to observe the grisly diversion as firefighters and policemen scurried about their work.
The thousands of truck drivers sitting in line have created a captive market for entrepreneurial Chinese villagers who live along the highway. They have opened soda and ice cream stands, fast food shops, even brothels, to profit from the gridlock.
Young Chinese women in frilly dresses and bows in their hair decorate the doorways of every roadside restaurant, beckoning unshaven drivers to climb down and sample their home cooking.
But it can be risky to leave a truck unattended.
"The thieves come at night," Officer Li said. "We have caught them stealing pigs from the pig carriers and watermelons from the melon trucks. They will even try to take money out of the pockets of sleeping drivers."
Li Shaoyun, 22, has a boring factory job in Changsha, so four times a month he has been "borrowing" a truck from a state-owned company for the run to Guangzhou, where he can buy eight tons of watermelons for a third of a cent each and sell them in the Changsha market for nearly a penny each.
"Last year this road was so bad, you could only make a few miles a day," he said. His personal record for worst traffic jam is also three days.
He keeps his melon cargo covered or padlocked behind a grillwork that covers the rear bed, but still the thieves manage to pull a few free.
A thief who gets away in the middle of the night with a melon or two is likely to be seen the next morning peddling fresh watermelon slices from a bicycle to hungry truck drivers.
Echoing the lumber carrier, Mr. Li said, "This is the pits."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices in Rebound In Light Pre-Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices ended moderately higher yesterday, partly recovering from a plunge on Thursday, as traders unwound speculative investments ahead of the holiday weekend.
 Analysts tied little significance to the modest advance, which came after an early slide in prices. 
 Bond department desks were thinly staffed ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, even though it was the last full trading day before Federal Reserve officials meet Wednesday to set monetary policy, ending weeks of speculation over whether they will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.
 The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, down in early trading, ended up 9/32 point, or $2.81 for $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, eased to 6.62 percent, from 6.64 percent late Thursday.
 On Thursday, the bond's price dropped by 127/32 points, its biggest daily decline since May 1994, after the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes surged almost 20 percent in May. The news dashed hopes for an imminent cut in interest rates.
 Those hopes were further eroded yesterday. Factory orders rebounded 1.4 percent in May after three straight declines, the Government said. And the June consumer sentiment index as measured by the University of Michigan increased to 92.7, from 92.3.
 But other news yesterday seemed to conflict with the notion of an improving economy. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1995, barely more than half the pace of the previous quarter. The first-quarter rate was unchanged from a month-old estimate.
 Market participants tied the late-day advance in bond prices to a reversal of speculative positions by traders who had bet on a decline in bond prices.
 The speculative trades exaggerated the price action in a lightly traded market. Activity ends early on Monday, the day before the holiday.
 Short-term Treasury securities ranged from 1/8 to 3/16 point higher and intermediate maturities ranged from 9/32 to 5/16 higher.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 5.54 as Selling At Last Minute Cuts Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks ended yesterday's session with modest gains as a flurry of last-minute selling erased most of the day's advance.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.54 at 4,556.10 after a late afternoon selloff pared gains of more than 30 points. 
 "They've had a great run," Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn., said of the blue-chip stocks. "Some portfolio managers are locking in some profits to start the new quarter."
 Advancing issues led decliners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 311.7 million shares, with a large portion changing hands in the last hour. That was just below the volume of 315.6 million shares that traded on Thursday.
 The American Stock Exchange's market value index climbed to a new high and closed for the first time above 500, gaining 3.81, to 500.19. The Amex reported the highest weekly trading volume for 1995 at 147.5 million shares and the highest-ever monthly volume at 539.3 million shares.
 Other market indexes posted gains as well, with the New York Stock Exchange composite index up 0.58, to 291.84, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 0.88, to 544.75, and the Nasdaq composite index up 6.64, to 933.45.
 Stocks headed higher in the morning as a series of mixed economic reports kept alive investors' hopes that the economy could continue to grow enough to support corporate earnings.
 The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product, the sum of all the goods and services produced, grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1995.
 That was unchanged from earlier estimates, but barely more than half the pace of expansion in the previous quarter, and the weakest performance in a year and a half.
 But, the department also reported that orders to factories rose 1.4 percent in May, recovering from three straight declines. The University of Michigan reported to clients that its consumer sentiment index rose to 92.7 in June from its 92.3 preliminary reading at midmonth.
 An index of economic activity by Chicago purchasing managers fell to 47.6 percent in May from 53.5 percent, but that was not enough to dissuade investors from the notion that the economy was in good shape. Investors also factored in a nearly 20 percent jump in new-home sales reported on Thursday.
 "Over the past two to three days, the economic data has suggested that while the economy has slowed, a recession is not likely," said Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Goldman, Sachs. "The fundamentals are still constructive."
 Technology stocks started the day barreling higher but then backed off as investors took profits. On the Big Board, I.B.M. fell 1, to 96; Compaq rose 3/4, to 45 1/4, but Micron Technologies fell 1/8, to 55.
 In Nasdaq trading, Intel fell 1/2, to 635/16 , and Apple fell 13/16 , to 467/16 .
 The Dow industrials were buoyed by a good performance in cyclical stocks, which could be expected to continue performing well as long as the economy was still growing, Ms. Cohen said.
 Leading the 30 industrials higher were International Paper, up 2 1/2, to 85 3/4; Caterpillar, up 2, to 64 1/4; Allied Signal, up 1 7/8, to 44 1/2; Alcoa, up 1 5/8, to 50 1/8, and Sears, Roebuck, up 3/4, to 59 1/2.
 Bringing up the rear in the Dow 30 index were Boeing, which fell 1 7/8, to 62 5/8, after the aircraft maker announced that it would cut production on its 737 and 757 jets, and Exxon, which fell 1 3/8, to 70 5/8, as petroleum stocks gave up gains made earlier this week.
 Overseas stock markets ended mixed. In Tokyo the Nikkei average, overcoming four days of declines, added 10.23 points to close at 14,517.40. It was still down 747.78 from a week ago.

HEADLINE: After 114 Years, It's Payday;
Patience Is Rewarded Meagerly As Inflation Erodes 1881 Bonds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It's been 114 years in coming, but there is good news for those who lent money to the Santa Fe railroad in 1881. They are about to be paid back. Checks for part of the loan will go out today. Lenders will have to be patient a little while longer, though, until October, to get the rest.
 The seemingly endless Santa Fe story illustrates almost everything that can go wrong for a lender, short of a complete failure to pay. Those who lent the money -- or perhaps their great-grandchildren -- are about to get dollars that are each worth less than seven 1881 cents. Along the way, the lenders have suffered through corporate reorganizations, fraudulent accounting and foolish business plans. They have been buffeted by volatile interest rates and by worries over credit quality. And they even lost their protection against inflation when Congress and the Supreme Court teamed up against them in the 1930's. 
 In short, the tale is a cautionary one for anyone thinking of lending money for the really long haul, as some modern-day investors did not long ago when they bought 100-year bonds from the Walt Disney Company. But it is also an affirmation of the longevity and stability of the American financial system that payment was made, even in watered-down form, so many years after a promise was given.
 The money being paid back now is for a debt dating to 1881 that ultimately was turned into two issues of 100-year bonds during the railway's 1895 reorganization. The first of those bonds, the one maturing today, was intended to be of lower quality, and the history of the prices it has fetched -- ranging from $285 to more than $1,300 for bonds with a face value of $1,000 -- provides a graphic description of the financial history of the last century. As it happens, the bonds are maturing after the company, now known as the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, has agreed to be acquired by Burlington Northern Inc., ending its long tradition of independence.
 In 1881, it looked as if the bad days were behind the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Company. It had seen some trying times in building its system in the sparsely settled Southwest, what with train robbers and gun battles between crews from the Santa Fe and a rival line trying to build in the same area. (The Santa Fe won the route thanks in part to its gunmen, led by Bat Masterson.) By 1881 the Santa Fe was earning good money. Further expansion seemed likely to bring in even higher profits.
 The public agreed by buying bonds that promised to pay 6 percent interest for 30 years. "We recommend these bonds as a first-class investment," wrote the two Boston investment houses pushing the bonds, Kidder, Peabody and Lee Higginson & Company. For a time, it looked as if they were right. Two years later, Charles Francis Adams, the Boston business leader and president of the Union Pacific Railroad, hailed the Santa Fe as "one of the most brilliantly successful" enterprises in the nation's history.
 But in only a few years, the Western railroad business looked very different. Building new lines cost more, and they brought in less new business, than had been expected. And as more roads were built, competition sometimes became ruinous. The average rate for hauling freight on the Santa Fe system fell 48 percent between 1880 and 1888. And passenger fares fell even further. A fare war in 1886 cut the cost of a ticket from Kansas City to San Francisco to $1, from $21.
 In 1889 came the first reorganization, converting a 30-year bond paying 6 percent interest into a 100-year bond, due in 1990, paying 4 percent. But that fix would not last. When depression came in 1893, the Santa Fe went into receivership, and quickly into scandal.
 Committees of bondholders in New York, Boston, London and Amsterdam -- Baring Securities had sold lots of Santa Fe paper in Europe -- hired an accountant to figure out what happened. He concluded that the railroad had lied in its financial statements, grossly overstating profits and the value of some assets. Not only had it paid millions in illegal rebates to shippers, which was bad enough, but it had treated those payments as an asset. And it had bought other lines that could not hope to earn enough to justify the purchase. Some of those lines had to be jettisoned, amid muttering that at least one was bought largely to bail out bad investments by Baring, which played a powerful role in running the road from 1889 to 1893.
 It was not until 1895 that new management came up with the second reorganization plan, and once again the bondholders suffered. Holders of the 100-year bond due in 1990 got $96.5 million, part of what they were owed, in a new 100-year bond, paying 4 percent and secured by a new first mortgage on the line; those bonds would mature on Oct. 1, 1995. And the rest of what was owed, $51.7 million, was put into a security called an adjustment bond. It is that bond that matures today.
 That bond, which was essentially crammed down the throats of the holders, also had a 4 percent coupon, but with a twist, since the architects of the reorganization were a lot more worried about the financial strength of the railroad than about the financial well-being of the investors. For the first five years, until 1900, the railroad was to pay the interest only if it felt it had sufficient earnings to make the payments. After that, it could not just forget about payments, but it could defer them, indefinitely if need be. The bond was issued in denominations of $500 and $1,000.
 When the new bond began trading in 1896, it rapidly became clear that the Santa Fe would not soon be able to pay any interest. The $1,000 bonds began trading at $425 and soon sold down to $285 amid fears that yet another reorganization was coming. In bond market lingo of a century later, it was viewed as a very low- quality junk bond.
 In fact, no interest was paid in 1896, but 3 percent was paid in 1897 and the full 4 percent was paid thereafter.
 The Santa Fe would survive every future financial panic, albeit not without scaring investors. After the stock market crashed in 1929, investors viewed the Santa Fe as quite a safe investment -- an earlier generation's junk was now viewed as among the bluest chips available.
 The bonds rose in value until 1931, when the adjustment bond almost sold for its full $1,000 face value. But then in 1932 the railroad saw profits plunge so far that it eliminated dividends on its common stock. It kept paying the bond interest, but the price sagged as low as $630, as investors decided that maybe the Santa Fe was a junk borrower after all. But business recovered, and with interest rates low, the bond sold for as much as $1,110 in 1936.
 Then, when recession came in 1938, the Santa Fe briefly appeared again to be in danger of going under. It deferred interest for four months on the bond, and the price plunged again, to $755.
 The 1896 low of $285 would endure as the all-time low for the bond, but it came close to being eclipsed 85 years later. In 1981 there was no worry that the Santa Fe would not meet its obligations, but a 4 percent coupon seemed very low. With interest rates soaring, the Santa Fe bond sagged to as little as $305. That was more than $1,000 below its highest price: $1,312.50 in 1946, the year when things looked rosiest. Rail profits then were pouring in after World War II, and interest rates were extraordinarily low. No one knew it at the time, but a 35-year bear market in bonds was beginning.
 Now, as the bond approaches payment at face value, or par, bondholders can think of what might have been. Had one Supreme Court justice gone the other way in 1935, the bond might be worth many times its face value.
 That is because these bonds, like virtually all others issued at the time, were gold bonds, payable in "gold coin of the United States of the present standard of weight and fineness, or its equivalent." The "present standard" in 1895 valued gold at $20.67 an ounce. At $385 an ounce, about the current price, that would make the bond worth $18,626.
 But in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress declared such contracts invalid, in an effort to stimulate the economy by devaluing the currency. In 1935, the Supreme Court, voting 5 to 4, upheld that decision. The logic was that since a new law required Americans to turn in gold coins for paper money, paying them in gold coin would be meaningless, since they would have to surrender the coins immediately.
 Court fights would erupt over Santa Fe bonds in the 1980's, seeking to reverse that ruling on the ground that Americans had been allowed since the 1970's to own gold coins, but those fights were futile.
 Those who bought bonds in the 19th century had no idea that the gold clause would be invalidated. Nor could they foresee the inflation that was to become commonplace in this century. Consumer prices in 1895 were half what they were in 1800, according to Government estimates. A long-term chart of consumer prices showed increases in times of boom or war, followed by decreases during times of depression or moderate growth. Now a substantial decline in consumer prices is unthinkable.
 Given that, it is easy to understand why bondholders made what turned out to be a very bad bargain. It is less easy to understand why such confidence in the future returned, albeit briefly, in 1993, when several loans of longer than 30 years were made. Walt Disney, for example, sold 100-year bonds with a coupon of 7.55 percent. The company can pay back the bonds as early as 2023 if it thinks that rate is then too high. But if Disney does not want to buy back the bonds, the investors will have to hold on for the full 100 years or trade, of course, in the open market.
 It is doubtful that anyone who has owned the Santa Fe bonds for the past half-century or so would think the Disney bond was worth the risk. They have painfully learned that a dollar can lose most of its value over time, and that interest rates can fluctuate wildly. And earlier in their history, those bonds illustrated how credit quality can go from blue chip to disreputable junk, over and over.
 Those are lessons that seem obvious now. Perhaps Disney will be as solid a company in 2093 as it is now, just as the Santa Fe proved to be a longtime success in the railroad business. But will the dollar hold its value in the next century, as it did not in the last? The Disney bondholders can only hope.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up a Bit in Thin Trading Ahead of Weekend and Holiday

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar gained slightly yesterday as dealers sought to temper Thursday's selloff and cover their positions ahead of the pre-holiday weekend.
 The upward move served to correct the whipsaw action of previous days, when the currency market first drove the dollar skyward on Wednesday on news of the United States-Japan trade deal and then let it plunge Thursday on disappointment with the pact. 
 "It's just a modest correction," said Robert Lynch, currency analyst at MMS International. "The markets overshoot. You had an overshoot on the upside on Wednesday and an overshoot on the downside on Thursday."
 Caution was the predominant mood as dealers sought to cover their positions heading into the weekend. Many market participants will be taking Monday off as well as the July 4 holiday Tuesday.
 Trading was primarily by corporations needing to conduct currency transactions on the last day of the second quarter of 1995.
 "The number of participants was just tiny," said David Glowacki, senior trader at National Bank of Detroit. "Any movement was caused by whatever orders people had to do."
 In late New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.3815 German marks, from 1.3800 late Thursday, and to 84.69 Japanese yen from 84.47 yen.
 By the end of a turbulent week, the dollar held to a narrow range, with the market focused on the major event ahead, the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making board on Wednesday and Thursday.
 Some analysts expected the Federal Open Market Committee to lower short-term interest rates to stimulate a slowing economy. In theory, such a move could weigh on the dollar by making American assets less attractive to overseas investors who buy large amounts of bonds.
 Other dealers speculated that a Fed move would not have a deleterious effect on the dollar.
 The dollar received a mild lift after a University of Michigan study showing consumer sentiment to be much higher than expected. That news, along with a report from purchasing mangers that suggested an economic slowdown, served to further cloud the outlook on interest rates.
 Dealers were also concerned about the prospects of central bank intervention in the event the dollar fell too quickly. On May 31, the Fed led a concerted effort that succeeded in driving the dollar higher by catching the market off guard.
 "The market should be very cautious about extending the dollar's move on the downside," said Steven Jury, dealer at the Union Bank of Switzerland.
 In other trade, the dollar slipped to 1.1495 Swiss francs, from 1.1460 late Thursday, and to $1.5945 to the British pound from $1.5755.
 The dollar also traded at $1.3725 to the Canadian dollar, down from $1.3757 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico to Get 2d Half of Its I.M.F. Aid Package

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 30

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund released the second half of its Mexican aid package today, saying that the Government's emergency stabilization effort had significantly improved the country's economic condition.
 About $2 billion of the remaining $10.7 billion in the international organization's assistance will be immediately available to Mexico. The rest will be set aside in five equal installments of about $1.7 billion from this August through August 1996. Mexico's situation will be under continuous review as the future payments are made. 
 The fund has already lent Mexico almost $8 billion.
 On Thursday, the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said that Mexico's efforts at change since the peso was devalued in December had stabilized the economy considerably and that a second installment of $10 billion from the United States would be available, starting on Saturday.
 For weeks, Mexican officials have been stating their confidence that the additional money would be released because they were complying with all conditions of the $50 billion international bailout organized by the United States in March.
 Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the money was being released because the peso had recovered, foreign reserves had risen, interest rates had fallen, the Mexican stock market had bounced back and the Government budget surplus had surpassed expectations.
 "There should be a return to economic growth in 1996 and beyond and a reduction in inflation to international levels," Mr. Camdessus said in a statement.
 Mr. Rubin said in Washington on Thursday that "Mexico's economic reform efforts have borne fruit."
 By raising taxes, cutting the federal budget and promptly paying all its obligations, the Mexican Government has eased fears that it would default on at least some of its debt.
 Nevertheless, the realignment of Mexico's economy has come at great cost to the Mexican people. Independent economists estimate that up to one million workers have lost their jobs since January. Inflation this year is expected to exceed 50 percent and even though interest rates on consumer credit have dropped to about 45 percent in recent weeks, the number of people who cannot pay back their loans continues to increase.
 Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, told business executives on Thursday that the economy probably shrank by 5 percent in the second quarter and that workers would not start to recover from the crisis until next year.

HEADLINE: Final U.S. Revision Confirms Growth Was Slow in Early '95

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Economic growth during the first quarter was the slowest in one and a half years, the Commerce Department said today in issuing a final revision of the data, but a rebound in factory orders during May pointed to a modest recovery.
 The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in 1995's first three months, well below the pace of 5.1 percent in 1994's fourth quarter. The department's final revision of the first-quarter rate was unchanged from its initial revision a month ago. 
 In a separate report, the department said factory orders rose 1.4 percent in May after three consecutive monthly declines, including a 2.2 percent drop in April.
 Analysts said the second quarter, which ended today, would probably prove far more sluggish than the first three months. The economy may even have contracted, they said. Still, most of them said they did not see a recession on the horizon and expected at least a modest rebound by the end of the year.
 "Over all, we have sluggish growth," said Robert Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "We're getting extremely ambiguous data. The economy is not falling on its face, but it's been limping."
 The recent conflicting economic signals may pose a quandary for the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, which will meet for two days next week to discuss interest rate policy. Seeking to slow economic growth to a pace that could be sustained without inflation, the Fed engineered seven interest rate increases over a 12-month period that ended on Feb. 1. It has left rates unchanged since then.
 In today's report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending in the first quarter was a little weaker than previously estimated. But the downward revision was offset by higher net exports and business investment in durable goods.
 Inflation during the first quarter was slightly faster but still well within the moderate range. One measure of inflation tied to gross domestic product rose at a 3 percent rate in the first three months, compared with 2.6 percent in last year's fourth quarter.
 After-tax corporate profits increased 3.8 percent in the first quarter, up from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of total economic output, tailed off sharply in the winter. It rose at a $14.3 billion rate in the first quarter, less than one-third as quickly as in 1994's final three months.
 Businesses increased inventories at a $51.1 billion annual rate in the first quarter compared with a $49.4 billion rise in the previous three months. Analysts have been debating whether a big buildup in inventories has led to a temporary economic lull or will continue to be a drag on the economy.
 Even though analysts believe economic growth slowed considerably in the second quarter, there have been hints of a recovery recently. On Thursday, the Government reported that sales of new homes in May rose by the biggest amount, 19.9 percent, in more than three years, while first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell by 28,000 in the latest reporting week, the biggest drop in nearly a year.
 Today, the Commerce Department said that May's 1.4 percent increase in orders to factories was the largest since orders rose 2 percent in December.
 Analysts had predicted the rebound after three consecutive months of decline, the first such decline since mid-1993.
 Excluding the volatile transportation component, factory orders were up 1.1 percent in May. By that measure, orders fell 1 percent in April.
 The backlog of unfilled orders was unchanged in May at $462.1 billion. The backlog is viewed as a measure of whether plants and the labor force are able to keep up with demand. Inventories in May rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to $408.2 billion.

Accord for Hong Kong's New Airport

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 30

 BODY:
Ending a four-year dispute, Britain and China agreed today on a financing plan for Hong Kong's new airport, clearing the last major hurdle for the $20.3 billion (United States) project.
 Officials also confirmed what had been widely expected for months, that the airport would not open on time two years from today, but rather in April 1998. 
 The bilateral dispute had been over financing plans for the new Chek Lap Kok Airport and a connecting rail line. Today's accord will enable two Hong Kong entities to borrow billions of dollars from banks or in the international bond market.
 "We've suffered like Job waiting for this," said C. Roger Moss, finance director of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, which will now begin selling bonds to finance the project. "It will take us all of two and a half minutes to start issuing bonds."
 Borrowing may take longer for the Provisional Airport Authority. A bill that would turn it into a permanent public entity is still before Hong Kong's legislature and will require Chinese approval. Until that happens, the authority cannot borrow.
 Regarding China's remaining role in the process, Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary, said, "I can't give a precise answer."
 Chek Lap Kok, being built on reclaimed land off Lantau Island, to the west of Hong Kong Island, is one of the world's largest infrastructure projects. It had faced a cash crisis because of delays over the financing agreement.
 "Both sides have expressed their determination and confidence that the new airport and airport railway will proceed with all due speed to full completion as soon as possible," said the document agreed to by Britain and China. Britain will return Hong Kong to China in mid-1997.
 "The new airport will be substantially complete by mid-1997," Mr. Macleod said. Trial runs will be held and minor additions made until April 1998, he added. The airport railway will not be finished until June 1998, Mr. Macleod said.
 The financing agreement paves the way for the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway, which operates Hong Kong's subway system, to borrow $23 billion (Hong Kong), or $2.97 billion (United States) for part of the airport and related infrastructure projects.
 Under the agreement, the Hong Kong Government will be able to inject equity into the railway company and the airport authority to offset cost overruns resulting from uncontrollable events. The Chinese negotiators also agreed to allow additional equity to be provided if exchange rates and interest rates fluctuate.
 Without such assurances, the borrowers would be forced to pay higher interest rates on their bonds or loans.
 The latest agreement is part of a broader accord reached in November under which the British and Chinese Governments set debt and equity levels for the airport project.
 Hong Kong has committed a total of $60.3 billion (Hong Kong) to the railway company and the airport authority. Last November, the countries agreed on how much each of the two entities would be allowed to borrow, but the actual authorization to issue bonds or arrange bank lending depended on the latest agreements.
 The negotiating teams also agreed today to grant franchises for Chek Lap Kok's air cargo services to Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal Ltd. and Hong Kong Airport Services. Hong Kong Air Cargo is owned 25 percent by Jardine Matheson Holdings, a giant Hong Kong trading company whose support for political reform in Hong Kong has drawn criticism from China.

HEADLINE: The Irresponsible Superpower

BYLINE: By Patrick Smith; Patrick Smith, a former correspondent in Tokyo for the International Herald Tribune and The New Yorker, is writing a book about Japan.

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Conn.

 BODY:
The United States-Japan trade negotiations: The crisis builds. The brink is glimpsed. No, we're headed over the brink! But within hours of the deadline we're saved!
Trade representative Mickey Kantor exits with an exhausted but satisfied smile. The Japanese negotiator, Ryutaro Hashimoto, does not smile. 
 Correspondents covering the deal must work fast, for there are two full agreements to report. The American agreement is formidable: a turning point, a milestone, a breakthrough. The Japanese agreement suggests vaguely that "we will do our best."
This was the scene in Geneva last week when Washington and Tokyo averted a mess worth $6 billion in tariffs on Japanese automobile imports. But the whole business had a disheartening echo. Who agreed to what? Rarely has Japan demonstrated that it takes any such agreement seriously.
"All we can say at this moment is that the administration and the governing party will try to live up to the intentions announced in this agreement," said a Japanese official. What distinguishes his remark is its marvelous punch line: "Of course, in any democratic country intentions are not always realized."
That comment was made not last week but in 1990, when Washington and Tokyo concluded something called the Structural Impediments Initiative. This accord followed talks on textiles, steel, cars (of course), rice, baseball bats and construction projects. It coincided with negotiations over telephone equipment, beef, citrus, toy stores, computer chips and (of course) cars.
America registered some successes in these earlier agreements. The Japanese eat a little imported steak now, though they worry (as they should) about all the hormones. Perhaps a year from now Washington will be able to point to quantifiable improvements based on the accord just reached in Geneva. If American goals are met, our $36 billion deficit in automotive trade will be down to a mere $27 billion in three years -- in the absence of any increase in this deficit in the interim.
The larger point is missed. It's time for us to step back from a complicated 50-year friendship with Japan and to recognize that there is no short-term solution to the trade problem. We are stuck with huge export deficits for years to come. And to remain preoccupied with the statistics is to treat only a measure of our skewed relationship.
It is remarkable how easily Americans forget everything this country has done to create the Japan that befuddles us. We speak of Japan as if it intruded upon us out of nowhere -- as if it has acted quite independently of us since 1945.
This is part of the fog that rolled in with the cold war. Every important component of the Japanese economic machine was put in place by the end of the American occupation in 1952 -- often with the encouragement of the occupation authorities.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry? Up and running precisely one day before American troops reached Tokyo after the surrender. Targeted industries: ships, steel, cars? The policy of singling these out for development began in 1947. It was called "priority production" then. We encouraged the Japanese to win by diplomacy and industrial clout what it had lost in its nationalist adventure. The rest -- security, foreign policy -- would be left to us. This arrangement was cobbled together by Shigeru Yoshida, the Prime Minister who led the prewar political elite back to power in 1948, and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who led the occupation.
Japan today is an irresponsible nation. It possesses power without knowing what to do with it. The cult of irresponsibility grew from the model by which Japan chose to modernize. But the Yoshida arrangement prolonged the problem by blocking the process by which Japan could have grown into the world citizen we now wish it was.
MacArthur made his best-known remark about the Japanese before the Senate in 1951. "They would be like a boy of 12," he said, "as compared with our development of 45 years." The comment stung, because it was true -- then. But we persist in our nation-of-12-year-olds attitude even now, as the Geneva agreement demonstrates. We try to order the Japanese about in a way that we never would with European allies, and they cooperate only with reluctance.
To solve our problems with the Japanese we must put a healthy distance between us. We gave Japan much after the war besides the time to work their economic miracle, which is no miracle at all. We imposed on them a democratic Constitution that barred them from war and a security treaty that put them under our protection. These are the pillars of our relationship. The truth we refuse to face is that these things will eventually have to change, for Japan must learn to act autonomously.
The Japanese are beginning to understand this. Last November, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the most conservative of the national dailies, published a draft of a new constitution "in hope of stirring national debate," as the headline read. Clearly, the country is restless within a set of constraints that made sense 50 years ago but is long outdated now.
These are daunting matters, but neither side can flinch from them much longer. Today the security treaty is good so long as it is not carried out. If it ever was -- if Americans began dying for Japan's protection in, say, North Korea -- this nation would be outraged and relations would be threatened. Has the treaty not become a dangerous anachronism?
When Mickey Kantor and Ryutaro Hashimoto stumbled into the light after their 11th-hour talks in Geneva, Mr. Kantor called the agreement "a significant step to fundamental change." In Tokyo, the line was different. "We didn't cave in," a trade official said, apparently gleeful.
The Japanese trade surplus is indefensible. Yet, paradoxically, Japan's ability to say no to its condescending big brother deserves applause. It is a small step on a long road toward a more realistic relationship that eventually will benefit both sides.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Supported Arts From the Start

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bruce Ellis Fein (letter, June 25), in his rush to rebut Hillary Rodham Clinton's "Arts for Our Sake" (Op-Ed, June 21), forgot -- or was oblivious to -- the long history of United States Government support for art and artists, beginning nearly two centuries before the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
 Has he never walked through the majestic Capitol Rotunda and seen the huge paintings commissioned by Congress? Has he never seen the magnificent Capitol ceilings and wall paintings by the first full-time artist hired for life by the United States, Constantino Brumidi?
Has he never explored the basement of the Smithsonian Institution building containing a sculptured monstrosity ordered by Congress of a toga-clad but half-nude George Washington -- so inappropriate Congress wouldn't let it stay on the Capitol grounds?
Mr. Fein may not have visited many Federal courtrooms to see the murals paid for by the judiciary. Yes, a lot of people (mostly nonartists) mentioned in his letter "helped make our country great," but so did Thomas Hart Benton and Howard Chandler Christy and other creators of art works paid for by taxpayers long before the endowment.
Mr. Fein implied that our crime rate was lower and our economy healthier before the endowment. Was he around in the 1930's when the economy was so unhealthy that the Works Progress Administration could hire fine artists for the equivalent of beans and coffee to create some of our national art treasures?

Bolivia Sells Utility to U.S. Companies

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, June 30

 BODY:
Bolivia announced the sale of a controlling interest in its state electricity company to three American companies for $139.8 million, the first step of an ambitious program to transfer ownership of key industries to private hands.
 The Government agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in Empresa Nacional de Electricidad to Dominion Energy Inc., a unit of Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond; Energy Initiative Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., and Constellation Energy, a unit of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. 
 Although the transaction was small by international standards, it was closely watched by investors because the utility was the first of six major Bolivian industries that will be put on the auction block this year and because of the novel way in which the deal was structured.
 Unlike traditional privatizations, in which a government sells full ownership of a company, Bolivia has devised a "capitalization" program in which investors agree to invest a specified sum of new capital. In return, they get a 50 percent share and management control. The other 50 percent of the company is put into a fund to provide a guaranteed pension for all Bolivians.
The idea is to encourage economic activity and create desperately needed jobs while building up a national retirement system.
 Although Bolivia adopted an economic stabilization plan in the mid-1980's that revamped its economy and reduced inflation to 8.5 percent from 24,000 percent, it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with 30 percent unemployment.
 The American companies submitted the highest of seven bids for the electric company, known as Ende. The selling price was substantially higher than the minimum of $99.1 million set by the Government, but far less than the $250 million that some analysts and Government officials had estimated the company to be worth.
 Even so, David R. Evert, a spokesman for the Ministry of Capitalization, which is overseeing the sale of state companies, said the Government was delighted. "The success of the electric company bodes very well for future capitalizations," he said. "I think this sends a message to the investment community that Bolivia is serious."
 Bolivia plans to sell shares in five other state companies this year involved in oil, telecommunications, railroads, airlines and smelting. Altogether, the transactions are expected to generate as much as $2 billion in investment capital.
 The capitalization program is the brainchild of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a mining entrepreneur who was raised in the United States and became President two years ago. He devised the plan after opinion polls showed that Bolivians were generally opposed to traditional privatizations, which they equate with the loss of national independence and with corruption.
 "I would have preferred to sell all these companies through conventional privatizations and use the proceeds to balance the budget and finance social programs, but we were convinced that public opposition would have been too strong to allow us to go that route," Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said.
 Investment bankers and economists say the Bolivian program is attractive to investors because it not only gives them complete management control of the company but also lets them use all the money they invest to expand and modernize a company.
 But there are risks associated with capitalization. Not only is it an untested formula in an economically depressed nation of just seven million people, but also opposition to it has been growing from labor unions and opposition politicians.
 Some critics contend that it will destroy, not create, jobs, while others complain that the state could raise more money through conventional privatizations.
 The American buyers said they were attracted by Bolivia's internal demand for electricity, which is growing by 7 percent a year, and the potential to export gas and electricity to surrounding countries.
 "One of the big problems that companies face after they buy into a privatization is coming up with the money to expand and improve operations," said Ed Geehan, Constellation's manager of international projects. "This is not something we have to worry about."
 The capitalization program fell behind schedule recently as the Government struggled to approve new laws governing the newly capitalized industries and pension fund.
 Ende will be split into three power-generating units that will be operated separately, each by one of the three American buyers.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on July 1 about the announced sale of a 50 percent stake in Bolivia's state-owned electricity company to three United States companies referred incorrectly to the ownership of one company, Energy Initiatives Inc. It is a subsidiary of the General Public Utilities Corporation, not independent.

A Woman of a Certain Age

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
HOW OLD IS A woman of a certain age?
Only a Nosy Parker would try to find out. But the expression is becoming androgynous, and the age seems to be creeping upward. 
 Sidney Wade, a woman who lives in Gainesville, Fla., reports that she was complaining to a friend, Debora Greger, about a loss of hair: "My friend remarked that we, as women of a certain age, were prone to a number of peculiar developments. At first I was surprised by her use of the phrase to describe us (we are mildly ripening), remembering it from my more youthful days in France as an insulting kind of polite elocution but one that remains rather wonderful and precise."
Then Ms. Wade was stunned to see a headline in The New York Times "3 Explorers of a Certain Age, Scaling Mountains and More" about three men in their 80's. "Reeling, I reported this to Debora, who supposes that the phrase itself seems to have developed a pronounced middle-aged spread. Is this so? I hope not."
The phrase, in English, can be cited to 1754: "I could not help wishing," wrote an anonymous essayist in Connoisseur magazine, "that some middle term was invented between Miss and Mrs. to be adopted, at a certain age, by all females not inclined to matrimony." (This was two centuries pre-Ms.)
The certain age suggested spinsterhood; the poet Byron in 1817 wrote, "She was not old, nor young, nor at the years/Which certain people call a certain age,/Which yet the most uncertain age appears." Five years later, in a grumpier mood, he returned to the phrase: "A lady of a 'certain age,' which means Certainly aged." Charles Dickens picked it up in "Barnaby Rudge": "A very old house, perhaps as old as it claimed to be, and perhaps older, which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain, as with ladies of a certain, age."
The Oxford English Dictionary defined that sense of certain as "which it is not polite or necessary further to define." That was the sense meant by William Dean Howells when he wrote of "gentlemen approaching a certain weight." The special sense reverses the literal meaning of the word certain, which is "fixed, definite" (much as "I could care less" means "I could not care less").
The phrase was repopularized in a 1979 book by the psychotherapist Lillian B. Rubin, "Women of a Certain Age: The Midlife Search for Self," in which midlife spanned 35 to 54.
Reached in San Francisco, Dr. Rubin, whose book indicates she is now in her early 70's, was surprised to learn of the long English history of the phase because "it has a long history in French, where it refers to women of fortyish and thereabouts who are able to initiate boys and young men into the beauties of sexual encounters. The early use in English seems to be about spinsterhood, but the French meaning has nothing to do with marriage."
In French, the phrase has erotically or sexually charged overtones. "It comes from a society where sexuality is freer," Dr. Rubin notes, "and more understood as an important part of human life."
The phrase in French is femmes d'une certaine age. The term, however, can apply to either sex. Without the certain, the phrase un homme d'un age translates literally as "a man of an age" and is defined in the Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary as "a man of advanced years."
And now to the point: is that certain age getting older?
"When I wrote the book in 1979," Dr. Rubin says, "the 'women of a certain age' were in their late 30's and early 40's. I think that has changed with the baby boomers and the lengthening of the life span. I'd say the 'certain age' has now moved to the age of 50 or 55."
Look at it this way: late 30's or early 40's is no longer that "certain" age; it's moved up a decade. The good news is that 40 is still young, at least linguistically. That's how it seems to a language maven of a certain weight and getting long in the tooth.
Which brings us to long in the tooth, which I used in a political column in an unkind reference to vigorous Senator Bob Dole. (The first user was William Makepeace Thackeray in an 1852 novel: "She was lean, and yellow, and long in the tooth; all the red and white in all the toyshops of London could not make a beauty of her.") In my piece, I was impelled by wordmavenhood to give the derivation of the expression: "As horses age, their gums recede, making their teeth appear longer." My source was the Oxford English Dictionary: "displaying the roots of the teeth owing to the recession of the gums with increasing age; hence gen., old."
This folk wisdom about the illusion of tooth-lengthening was promptly challenged by Michael Brisbane McCrary, former Hong Kong polo player and now a squire in Hunter, N.Y.: "Horses actually do get 'long in the tooth.' It is not receding gums; their teeth continue to grow out (like beavers, and there is a word for it beginning with 'ex-') throughout their lives until the teeth actually fall out."
Mr. McCrary (his wife is Jane Buckle; her long-panted-for book, "How to Massage Your Dog," is scheduled for publication this fall) continues: "The growth of the horses' teeth is required because they would wear down in the process of eating in a natural setting. As the teeth grow out, lines show; this is how one usually tells the age of a horse. And this is the background to the phrase 'Don't look a gift horse in the mouth'; i.e., if it is a gift, don't ask how old it is."
That moved me to call the National Zoo. I don't call the Bronx Zoo anymore; any zoo that calls itself a "wildlife center" cannot be trusted. (A spokesman at our national zoological park, Mike Morgan, remembered me as the one who revealed the reason that pandas have reduplicating names like Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing they can't hear well and zoo keepers have to call them twice.)
It seems that Mr. McCrary could be right and all of us lexicographers could be wrong. "As horses age," noted Dr. Richard Montali, one of the National Zoo's veterinarians, "their teeth actually do continue to grow for some time. The incisors appear to look longer, but it's mainly because the angle of the teeth changes. Instead of perpendicular growth, the teeth angle out as they grow and wear."
Maybe the gums recede a little as the growing teeth angle out; that's why horses' teeth reveal their age. As a result of receiving this new information, and with deference to animal rights groups, I will no longer refer to old horses as being long in the tooth. They are horses of a certain age.

HEADLINE: Coloring History Our Way

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger; David E. Sanger, formerly chief of The Times's Tokyo bureau, now covers economic policy from Washington.

 BODY:
A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT SEEMED THAT JAPAN AND AMERICA had finally figured out how to finesse the politics of this summer's anniversaries. For years, officials in Washington and Tokyo had puzzled over how to mark the atom bombing of Hiroshima and end of World War II without stirring the wrath of veterans in Nebraska or nationalists in Nagoya. After endless meetings, Japanese and American diplomats agreed on a strategy: No big V-J Day events, just an acknowledgment of the sacrifices on both sides. Then the focus should turn to the "global partnership" that diplomats like to talk about as a counterpoint to the constant bickering between the world's two largest economies.
Like most agreements between Japan and America these days, the details were left a little hazy. And, like most accords, this one is failing. 
 The United States turned out a postage stamp showing a mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, then withdrew it. Next, the two countries stumbled into their most vituperative economic dispute in decades. As Washington threatened an embargo on Japanese luxury cars, many in Tokyo recalled America's economic isolation of Japan in the 1930's -- which every Japanese schoolchild is still taught made Pearl Harbor inevitable. Meanwhile, Tokyo's effort to get Parliament to issue a vaguely worded apology for the terror Japan spread throughout Asia during the war turned into a fiasco. Right-wingers used the debate to repeat their claims that Japan had fought a "war of liberation" to free Asians from the yoke of Western rule.
After six years in Japan, I found none of this surprising: Japan's gyrations to avoid real discussion of its responsibility for the deaths of 20 million people is the stuff of innumerable stories for foreign correspondents. But I was unprepared for the treatment of history in my own country, at the Smithsonian Institution's just-opened exhibit of the Enola Gay, the bomber whose work was shown on the stamp. The lengthy and public arguments with American veterans groups over the exhibit's tone and content ended with a classically Japanese solution. Like similar displays in Japan's own war museums, the Smithsonian exhibit seems oddly suspended in a historical vacuum, long on hardware and short on explanations.
The Enola Gay is flying solo on the Mall in Washington, without any serious examination of whether the bomb was needed to force Japan to surrender, a question that is debated more seriously today, and with more compelling evidence, than at any time in postwar history. There is only a glimpse of the devastation and human suffering that the bomb left in its wake.
Any other approach, American veterans groups insist, would create a "moral equivalence" between Japan's expansionary horrors and America's efforts to stop them. The Smithsonian, declaring that it was impossible to honor those Americans who sacrificed so much while simultaneously conducting a dispassionate examination of the war's end, abandoned the chance to cast new light on a dark corner of history.
This is the real moral equivalence: We are matching the Japanese in historical amnesia, claiming, as they do, that the issues remain too divisive to explore, even 50 years later. The explanation is no more convincing coming from American museum curators than it is coming from Japanese politicians.
To be fair, the Smithsonian's first instinct was to examine the historical record. When organizers went to Japan several years ago to enlist Japanese help, they offered assurances that the exhibit would not celebrate Japan's devastation. They asked to borrow the eerie artifacts from the city's famed A-bomb museum: the stone steps of a bank building forever imprinted with the shadow of the poor soul who was sitting there at the moment of detonation, the watches that stopped as the atomic flash froze the moment of horror. And -- this is where the trouble began -- they asked the same questions Japanese themselves raise every year as the Aug. 6 anniversary approaches: Was the bomb truly dropped to save American lives that would have been lost in a bloody invasion? Or was the decision, as the Japanese insist, tinged with racism, or was it simply a desire to send a signal to the Soviet Union or -- as many Japanese believe -- to justify the billions spent building the bomb?
That exhibit, of course, never got off the computer screen. Veterans argued, with some merit, that the Smithsonian's scripts swallowed Tokyo's revisionist mythology, portraying Japan more as the victim than the aggressor. Repeated efforts to fix the tone only worsened the offenses. As pressures mounted, museum officials panicked. The exhibit was revised, then revised again. Congress held hearings. Martin Harwit, the museum's director, was forced to resign. Hiroshima officials, watching the winds shift so dramatically, said they would mount their own traveling counterexhibit in the United States, led by Hiroshima's Mayor.
A Smithsonian official put the museum's quandary succinctly: "The veterans want the exhibit to stop when the doors to the bomb bay opened. And that's where the Japanese want it to begin."
This is history by consensus, which is troubling enough. But the rationale for the final product is even more disturbing, because it echoes Japan's own justifications for its refusal to teach a new generation of Japanese the lessons of their country's disastrous past.
The originator of the "we must not dishonor the veterans" argument is Japan's Ministry of Education. Time and again, its officials have invoked this logic to explain why textbooks gloss over Japan's brutal, 35-year colonization of Korea or the Rape of Nanking. When a former Education Minister, Mayumi Moriyama, was asked why the country has battled in court for 30 years to keep a seemingly forthright textbook out of schoolchildren's hands, her description of the author was telling. "His interpretation is not a popular one," she said, as if that were the test of accuracy. "He is very isolated now. Few people are supporting him."
The Smithsonian's arguments also reminded me of those made by officials in the Shinjuku ward in Tokyo after some construction workers discovered a collection of human bones. The workers had stumbled on the site of the headquarters of the infamous Unit 731, which had conducted vivisection experiments on Chinese prisoners of war. The bones offered a rare window on the unit's activities -- exactly what the city was desperate to avoid. "There are many veterans who still live in this area," a ward official said to me, explaining the city's sudden lack of curiosity. "How will they feel if this is how we remember the war?"
Wars are ugly affairs, and it is no surprise that countries want to think that they fought with justice on their side. But does it honor American veterans to recall the decision to drop the bomb with the same absence of introspection that taints Japan's museum exhibits? Shown in historical isolation, the Enola Gay looks a bit like the kamikaze plane on display at the famed Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The tiny craft is surrounded by the uniforms and letters left by hundreds of young kamikaze pilots, but there is no discussion of why they flew off to their deaths, no rationale offered other than loyalty to the Emperor.
It is museums like that one -- and there are many all over Japan -- that help explain the queasy feeling you get when you talk to Japanese university students about World War II, or the Persian Gulf war, or any other conflict. All war is bad, they are likely to tell you. But scratch beneath the platitudes, and you will quickly discover that the studied avoidance of discussion about the Government's decisions in the 1930's and 1940's has left a whole generation of Japanese incapable of having a debate about when it makes sense for a nation to use its military power. To defend its shores? To preserve its oil supplies? To assure the spread of democratic values? Only the rare student will engage in the discussion.
So perhaps the best argument for asking the obvious parallel questions about the bomb at the Smithsonian is that raising the issue in Washington is the only way to force the same question in Tokyo. "Gaiatsu," or foreign pressure, is often used to open up the Japanese market for citrus fruits or car parts, but it is even more effective at opening the market forunvarnished history. When the American media seized on the long illness, and death in 1989, of Emperor Hirohito to explore the question of whether he was a willing participant or a helpless bystander in the war effort, it freed Japanese television producers and newspaper editors to do the same.
The savviest Japanese historians manipulate this national trait to their advantage. The Government is still reeling from the exquisite work of Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a little-known history professor who cut through brazen official denials that the Japanese Imperial Army had kidnapped Korean women and forced them to provide sexual services to the front-line troops. He dug up documents in the military's own archives proving that the Army had ordered the stocking of the "comfort stations," as they were called, and released them just before Japan's Prime Minister traveled to South Korea in January 1993. There was a predictable outcry in Seoul and, eventually, a reluctant admission of the truth in Tokyo.
By the time I left Japan last summer, I saw a glimmer of hope that, despite the Government's best efforts, Yoshimi and a band of rebels like him were beginning to score broader victories. Last year, just as the Smithsonian debate was beginning, a new Mayor of Hiroshima, Takashi Hiraoka, opened a second museum, one that documented the city's role as a major military center and did not pretend that the war started on Aug. 6, 1945. "Some of us believe that when we think about the bomb, we should think about the war, too," he told me as we watched middle-aged Japanese drop in and look at the pictures in wonderment. "I had no idea," one woman said as she suddenly discovered why Hiroshima was a target.
As the Smithsonian debate proved, neither exhibits in museums nor hollow celebrations of the "global partnership" will convince Japan or America to see the war in anything close to the same light. But the anniversary is a rare and much-needed chance for Americans and Japanese to confront some of the suspicion and bitterness that still lurk beneath the surface of every trade dispute, every argument over Japan's responsibility to take a greater role in the world and every debate over whether the two largest economies will ever understand each other. Doing what Japan has done for too long -- reducing the war to a few Government-approved sound bites -- will make an ailing relationship only worse.

HEADLINE: Americans in a Land of Opportunity: Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FOR GENERATIONS, AMERICAN ARTISTS heeded the call of Paris. First came the painters, Mary Cassatt and Winslow Homer among them, lured by the Impressionist movement of the late 19th century. Then it was the turn of writers, with Edith Wharton leading the way in the 1910's and Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Scott Fitzgerald soon following.
By the 1930's, Josephine Baker was the toast of le tout Paris, and black American performers had found a home here. After World War II, Paris was where Henry Miller could get published, where James Baldwin felt free to live and write. Then, it seems, Paris stopped being an important port of call for American creators. 
 Today, the suggestion that France, or indeed anywhere in Europe, serves as a font of inspiration for American culture would prompt sniffs of contempt in the United States. Rather, the contrary is probably true. It is made-in-America popular culture that increasingly dominates the world. And, at least in film, European actors and directors covet the chance to seek fame and fortune in the United States.
Yet, for all that, Europe has not lost its attraction to American artists. It is just that today's pilgrims are less visible. In place of painters or writers looking for inspiration or romance, now it is those in the performing arts who trek here in search of work. The reason is simple. Painting and writing are solitary tasks, but music, opera, dance and theater all need support structures. And, thanks to generous state financing of the arts (as well as entrenched cultural traditions), Europe offers opportunities that simply can't be found in the United States.
In some cases, recognition back home has followed success overseas. William Christie, who has helped revive interest in Baroque music in the United States, was an unknown musician when he arrived in France two decades ago. Robert Wilson's work as a theater director was first acclaimed in France. William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet company has earned him a prominent place in dance. But many American performers in Europe no longer aspire to an American career. They have come to terms with "exile" in Europe because this is where a career is possible.
There is no American artistic community as such in Europe today, but the careers of four creative artists are in many ways fairly typical. Thomas Moser, 50, is an opera singer who lives in Vienna. Dee Dee Bridgewater, 45, is a jazz singer who has settled in Paris. Andy de Groat, 47, is a choreographer in residence in a Paris suburban theater. Joseph Mydell, 50, is an actor whose home is London. None is a household name in the United States. But all have flourishing European careers. And all feel vindicated by their decision to leave their native land to go in search of recognition and appreciation in Europe.
 
The Tenor
A Gamble That Paid Off
 Thomas Moser, a tenor, had good reason to feel satisfied earlier this year after the opening of the Theatre du Chatelet's production of Benjamin Britten's opera "Peter Grimes." The audience had acclaimed his performance in the title role, and Paris critics had singled him out for special praise. "He can be boorish and moving, sensitive and disturbing, brutal and dreamy, all with infinite talent," Le Figaro's critic wrote.
It was not Mr. Moser's first appearance on a Paris stage. But he had finally made his mark here. A physically imposing man with a gentle manner, he would probably be the first to describe his career as successful rather than spectacular. After early emphasis on Mozart and Rossini, though, he is being increasingly noticed as major European theaters ask him to diversify his repertory, not only to Britten but also to Berlioz and Wagner.
"At least 90 percent of what is interesting to me now is happening in Europe and not the United States," he said during a visit to Paris for "Peter Grimes."
The gamble of coming here 20 years ago has paid off. Having spent four years attached to a Navy band (and performing frequently in the Nixon White House), Mr. Moser, a former choir boy from Richmond, was almost 30 by the time he went professional.
"As an American," he recalled, "I had the dream that I was the one who would make a so-called American career." But reality soon intervened. He struggled to get auditions and, when he succeeded, "you had 250 people auditioning and 249 going home without work."
From Germany, though, friends kept telling him that good tenors were in demand. And after his teacher also urged him to try his luck in Europe, he found himself in Vienna in 1974. By the following year, he had a permanent job in the opera house at Graz, Austria, singing one opera after another. Two years later, he was taken on as a permanent member of the State Opera of Vienna.
"I went from a house where I was a star to a house where I was part of the inventory," he said with a laugh.
But his European career was well on its way. Fluent in German and French, he was soon singing on other European stages, often in Germany ("where every city of a certain size has an opera house," he noted) but also in France and Britain. For a while, though, he still yearned to "make it" in the United States. He made his American debut at the New York City Opera in 1979. But now, he said, "I feel absolutely at home here and rather strange in the United States."
In the future, he conceded, the trimming of many government arts budgets in Europe may reduce job openings in opera, but he is already firmly ensconced in Vienna, and he feels comfortable because his work is accepted.
"It's like when you go to a cocktail party and people say, 'What do you do?' and you say, 'I sing,' " he explained. "In America, you will find people saying, 'Yes, but how do you earn your money?' In Europe, it is a respected profession. Here they understand there really are people who earn their money singing."
 
The Club Singer
An Audience To Sing To
 Sitting cross-legged on the floor of her dressing room as she painted her fingernails green, Dee Dee Bridgewater recounted with glee how she came to be starring in "Cabaret" at the Mogador Theater in Paris.
"The director, Jerome Savary, called me last May and said, 'Cherie, I'd love you to play Sally Bowles,' " she recalled. "I said, 'You've got to be kidding! A black Sally Bowles?' He said it would make it more interesting. So I said, 'O.K., let's do it.' "
As it happens, a black, French-speaking Sally Bowles surprised no one in this city. Rather, it was seen as just another example of Ms. Bridgewater's versatility. Since she moved to France nine years ago, she has had her own radio and television shows, appeared on stage and sung at innumerable jazz festivals. But, perhaps most of all, she said, she has been able to capitalize on the French "fascination" with black entertainers and "on the Josephine Bakers and Sidney Bechets who came before me."
Moving to France, however, has meant more than commercial success. Ms. Bridgewater began singing professionally in the United States when she was an 18-year-old student at Michigan State University. Within a few years she concluded that her first love, jazz, was "not going to pay my bills." So, between playing small television, movie and theater roles, she turned to pop music. In 1986, while touring with a musical here, she discovered there was an audience for jazz in Europe, and so she decided to stay.
"Now I can live off my jazz," she said with satisfaction.
One reason is that cities and regions across Europe finance jazz festivals, while in France Ms. Bridgewater often performs in municipal "cultural houses" that also live off state subsidies.
"There are lots of grants for artists," she said. "I make enough money not to need one, but I might if I wanted to create a special work. So, yes, it's easier to work in Europe."
And is Europe also easier for black performers?
"I feel respected here," she said. "When I think of the States, I think black artist. When I think of Europe, I think artist; I don't think color."
As a jazz singer, though, she feels a special responsibility to her art form. "Without trying to sound presumptuous, I feel I am one of the better jazz singers," she said, "and I'm trying very hard to keep traditional jazz singing going, like Ella Fitzgerald, with the scatting and so on. This is our musical culture. It's our original music."
So this summer she is singing in clubs and jazz festivals in several American cities (today she is scheduled to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) Would she like to go home for good? She held up a finger now decorated with green nail polish and wagged it furiously.
"No, no, no," she said.
 
The Choreographer
Putting New York Far Behind
 It was not really Andy de Groat's decision to start coming to France, but in the end it was almost natural that he should stay here. Born in Paterson, N.J., he attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, and, in 1967 at the age of 20, he joined Robert Wilson's troupe as a "moving actor." Starting in 1971, when Mr. Wilson triumphed at the Nancy Festival with its production of "Deaf Man's Glance," the troupe began returning to France every year. "By the time I left Wilson in 1976, my entire professional life had involved France," Mr. de Groat recalled.
He formed his own company, Andy de Groat and Dancers, and became its choreographer. While he struggled to make ends meet in New York, his troupe often found work at dance festivals in France. By the early 1980's, however, the trans-Atlantic commuting was getting him down.
"I was only going back to New York to collect unemployment," he said. "So I made the change."
He formed a new troupe, Red Notes, and effectively went native. "I asked for a grant from the French Government to make a new piece," he said, "and I've been getting grants from them every year since then."
Not surprisingly, he, like many other cultural exiles, is a great believer in government aid for the arts. His company's residence at the new opera house at Massy, just south of Paris, is backed by $200,000 per year in subsidies. In exchange, it performs regularly and organizes classes and workshops for local children. It also tours in France and beyond.
"Artists don't have to stay alive waiting tables here," Mr. de Groat said while rehearsing his dancers for two sequences in Mr. Wilson's production of Mozart's "Magic Flute" before its return to the Bastille Opera in the spring. Clearly, he does not miss the United States.
"I returned to New York last year for the first time in 10 years, mainly to see my friend Jerome Robbins rehearsing a new piece," he said. "But I've lost contact with most of my American friends. A lot of my friends in New York are dead."
In any event, he said, he finds the dance scene more exciting in Europe today. "I don't think success in New York is better than success in Europe," he said. "I think New York has lost something of its aura of being the arts capital of the world. That was in the 1970's and 1980's, but things have changed."
In contrast, he said, dance has developed enormously in France over the past 15 years, and this has enabled him to branch out from what he called his early "post-modern minimalist" style toward one that embraces both classical and experimental dance.
"I am now interested in all kinds of music and movement," he said, noting that his plans for the fall include the choreography for a new production of Stravinsky's "Rake's Progress" at the Lyons Opera. "I mix everything up. I use everything." French audiences seem to go along with it. "There is something about dancing that appeals to the intellectual side of the French," he said. "It makes it very rewarding to work here."
 
 
The Actor
Up From Segregation
 A long road took Joseph Mydell from a segregated high school in Savannah, Ga., in the mid-1960's to the stage of the Royal National Theater in London three decades later. But the actor vividly remembers how it all began.
"One of our black teachers played a recording of an Old Vic version of 'Macbeth,' and that was just it," he recalled, still stirred by the memory. "I was smitten."
Translating his dreams into an acting career took far longer. He went to college twice and moved on twice, and between occasional roles in black theater companies in New York and a tour sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, he taught drama in Tougaloo, Miss., and in Savannah, his hometown.
"I finally decided I had to do something that showed my abilities," he said, "but there wasn't anything. So I wrote my own one-man show."
His chosen vehicle was Paul Lawrence Dunbar, a black American author of the late 19th century whose life and writings provided Mr. Mydell with rich material. "He was a dandy, he was a snob, he had an awful marriage, he was interesting, he was human, he was not politically correct," Mr. Mydell said.
In 1980, Mr. Mydell took the play to the Edinburgh Festival, where it won the Fringe Award for the best one-man show. With that, he decided to stay in Britain. He performed a series of small theater roles until, in 1986, he finally got his break: a two-year contract to perform six plays, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. "That was the beginning of what I knew could be my career," he said.
Since then, his Savannah accent now hidden behind the clipped English of a Shakespearean actor, things have gone well for him. He has done many television dramas, and last year he became the first American actor to win a coveted Laurence Olivier Award for his performance as Belize, the former drag queen, in the National Theater's production of "Angels in America, Part II: Perestroika," which had been a hit on Broadway in the 1993-94 season. This spring, he was again performing with the National Theater, this time in Christopher Hampton's "Alice's Adventures Under Ground."
"I never wanted to become an ex-pat," he said over coffee in his cramped apartment in Hackney, a run-down district in east London. "I always thought it was sad that James Baldwin, Richard Wright and others felt they had to leave. But I couldn't do what I'm doing in the United States. In the States, I was pushed into black roles, but here people aren't intimidated if you're bright and intelligent. If you want to do the kind of theater I want to do, this is the country."
If the right opportunity arose, he said, he would go home. But he is not optimistic.
"I haven't seen anything that has made me think, 'Oh, yes, I want to be there,' " he said. "And now it looks like they're trying to do away with the arts. Between right-wingers and political correctness, there won't be any imagination left in America." He stood up and stretched. "I am very pleased I came here," he said with a smile. "I think I'm about ready for my first 'Othello.' "

IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES, IT WAS THE worst of times. Some concerts were so popular that tickets were scalped for $650. Legendary virtuosos made their way to New York, which was also the testing ground for aspiring performers. Grand concert halls were constructed, though some were harshly criticized for putting decoration above good acoustics. Critics lobbied for American composers and condemned the New York Philharmonic for its excessive love of European models. Some writers were astounded by the plentiful "trash" attracting inordinate public attention.
It was, in other words, a time very like the present. But this was New York in the 1850's, when the city was not yet a world-class metropolis and American musical culture was in its infancy. So everything was radically different, as if taking place in a parallel universe in which the language was the same but the meaning unfamiliar. 
 That, at any rate, is the impression given by a groundbreaking book to be published in September by the University of Chicago Press, recounting, in sometimes exhausting detail, the musical life of New York between 1850 and 1856. It is the second volume in Vera Brodsky Lawrence's "Strong on Music," a projected three-volume study of the New York music scene during the days of the music-loving lawyer George Templeton Strong, who kept extensive diaries until his death in 1875. The first volume of Ms. Lawrence's work, published in 1988 and covering the years 1836 to 1849, has just been published in paperback.
Scholarly attention is now turning back to the origins of American musical culture in an attempt to discover reasons for its current condition and overlooked prospects for its future. These volumes will provide a foundation for research in their resurrection of lost details: newspaper reviews, impresarios' declaration, the economic demands of an art form.
It lends perspective to find the young Verdi, in the new book, called the "Grand Maestro of the Mechanico-spasmodic school." And here is a rare glimpse of the piano before its American renaissance, from The New York Mirror on the occasion of Louis Moreau Gottschalk's New York debut in 1852: "Most people have been subjected to so much thrumming of the instrument at home that they become nervous when they see an artist preparing to attack them with it in public."
These were the years in which the soprano Jenny Lind was sold to the New York public by P. T. Barnum (to some surprisingly critical reviews, as Ms. Lawrence discovered); the Castle Garden theater was built near the Battery and subject to abominable odors from the new landfill ("We are quite of the opinion," wrote The New York Herald in 1854, "that it has militated against the interests of the opera"), and opera was given in blackface at Buckley's Ethiopian Opera House (including versions of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" and Bellini's "Norma").
Strong, a wealthy lawyer whose father-in-law designed Gramercy Park, was often on the scene, attending concerts, reacting to rehearsals, holding "Mass meetings" at his home, in which friends might, for example, read through Mozart's Requiem. (It tends to "drag a little," he noted of the piece.) Ms. Lawrence calls his Pepys-like chronicle a "passport to a bygone world."
Here is how Strong reacted to Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony in an early New York performance: "A symphony, like an epic poem, is either very great or worthless. . . . Why should the Philharmonic Society bother itself to produce correctly this beautiful product of Mendelssohn's . . . when so many of the Philharmonic subscribers have but the vaguest notion of Beethoven's Symphonies in C minor, A and D, the 'Eroica' and 'Pastorale,' Mozart's in E flat and the 'Jupiter,' Weber's and Mendelssohn's great overtures, and so forth?"
MS. LAWRENCE, WHOSE SCHOLARLY devotion to this project is apparent in wry footnotes and asides, calls Strong's comment "a narrow, alas persistent, point of view indigenous to symphony subscribers through the ages."
In fact, Strong is just a loose peg for this collection of documents and opinions. Each year is represented first by his diaries, then by an extensive collection of reviews and commentary by contemporaries.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this collection is the current timeliness of recurring themes: the raging arguments between defenders of High Art (the term was used) and lovers of sensation; between aggressive advocates of American composers and proud exponents of European Classicism; between critics who championed music that "appeals directly to the sympathies and appreciation of the people" and writers like Strong, who called a popular extravaganza "one of the grandest humbugs on record."
A great vitality pervades the documents of this period, in which most music is new and most arguments are fresh; musical life today seems tame by contrast and poorer by half. But the recurring, timeless themes provide great comfort, too: they are seen here setting in motion a constant counterpoint to American musical life. These issues of self-definition have accompanied American music for nearly 150 years, always leaving the way open for continued fractious debate and continued hopes for better times.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a computer coding er ror, the paperback best-seller list on page 16 of The Times Book Review today omits a book. "Apollo 13," by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger (Pocket Books, $6.50), an account of the 1970 moon mission frustrated by an explosion on the spacecraft, should be No. 2 on the nonfiction list. "Reviving Ophelia" should be No. 3, and each further book should be one position lower; "The Kennedy Wom en" should be 15th and last.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Toxic Sites;
Fears of Future Liability Scuttle Many a Deal

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT started off as an all-too-common 90's story: A machine tool business went under, so its bank foreclosed and put its warehouse up for sale.
The warehouse was in good shape and in an accessible Connecticut location. But the bank wanted the property off its books, so offered it at a bargain-basement price. There was, however, a big problem: The warehouse had kept machine oil in vats, some of which had leaked. 
 "The cleanup would have been easy, but I couldn't get a soul to consider buying it," said Bruce P. Meyerson, senior director of Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment bank. "Everyone is frightened of buying an environmental nightmare."
Concerns about leaky storage tanks, asbestos-laden buildings or other environmental problems are scuttling property sales at a growing rate. Many buyers, fearful of cleanup problems or liability suits, will not touch properties with the slightest environmental taint. And lenders are loath to provide funds for buyers who will take the risk.
Some lenders are still trying to unload environmentally problematic properties they took back in the recession. And most fear they will be forced by the courts to clean up sites they take back in the future.
"Predictability is critical for financial institutions, and they cannot predict which way the liability issue will go," said Frank L. Amoroso, the environmental law partner at Nixon, Hargrave, Devans & Doyle in Garden City. The result, said Richard D. Jones, a partner in the Hartford law firm Pepe & Hazard, is that "envirophobia is rampant among lenders."
The fears have hit the capital markets, too, said Carl Kane, managing director of the Ernst & Young Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group. The share prices of real estate investment trusts or of securitized mortgages -- mortgages that are pooled and sold as securities -- often plummet when they include tainted properties.
"Any risk that could have a deleterious impact on cash flow is of terrible concern to the rating agencies," Mr. Kane said.
Such fears have had a chilling effect on deals. More than 40 percent of commercial mortgage bankers polled by Environmental Warranty, an insurance company in West Hartford, said they had backed out of mortgage deals because of fears about contamination, and 87 percent said that such fears had delayed transactions. Nor were the fears specious: 70 percent said that environmental problems had turned up on properties on which they had arranged mortgages.
"Actual experiences and fear of such experiences play a huge role in what gets financed today and what doesn't," said Charles Perry, president of Environmental Warranty, which offers policies that pay off if environmental engineers miss something when they assess a site's cleanup needs.
ALMOST every mortgage broker has a horror tale to tell. Jerry Swartz, a principal at Pergolis Swartz Associates, said it had taken more than a year to get financing to build a Walgreen's drugstore in Mineola, L.I.; normally, it would have taken two months. A gas station had occupied the site, and the insurance company providing the financing asked for more assurances about liability before it would close the deal.
Lawyers say it is unlikely deals will speed up anytime soon. "The standard now is to ask for all environmental data, and then do an investigation," said Thomas E. McHugh, a real estate lawyer with Fulbright & Jaworski in Manhattan. "Even if you don't expect problems, you are not giving proper representation if you don't make sure."
But while environmental fears have slowed sales, they have not stopped them. Lenders are hankering to put loan money back into the market, and there are not enough pristine properties to go around.
"There are far too many dollars chasing far too little product," observed David B. Vance, president of KTR Environmental Services, a Manhattan consulting firm. "So people who once walked away from risk are now looking for ways to manage it."
Fidelity Bond & Mortgage, based in Blue Bell, Pa., recently arranged refinancing for a New York City office building that had asbestos-wrapped pipe in the basement. The owner agreed to sheathe the pipe and continually monitor the air quality around it.
"We wouldn't have touched this if the pipe was in a public area," said Peter R. Steier, a Fidelity senior vice president. "A few years ago we wouldn't have touched this at all."
Even renters are making compromises. The Educational Housing Corporation, a nonprofit provider of student housing, recently took a 15-year lease on the old George Washington Hotel, on Lexington Avenue and 23d Street. The corporation will check each room twice a year, and repaint it if existing lead paint has peeled or chipped.
"We just couldn't find another building in that area at that price," said Michael Myers, chairman of the brokerage Corporate Realty Partners, which handled the deal.
Bankers and investors have grown more savvy about environmental risks. They recognize that asbestos can be contained rather than removed, and that oil leaks that will quickly spread through sandy soil will not move far in clay-like soil. And they know that sellers will pay for site assessments.
Such assessments generally start with an overview of a site's past uses and environmental track record, and sometimes progress to soil and water sampling. They usually include estimates of cleanup costs. Some consultants -- Groundwater Technology of Norwood, Mass., was one of the first -- agree to stick to their cost estimates for a specific level of cleanup.
BUYERS also are insisting on what Mr. Jones calls "a steep fear discount." He recently handled a deal in which an investor paid $2 million for a $10 million mortgage note on a Connecticut office building. Why the low price? The bank discovered that the land below the building contained coal tars.
"No one knew if the coal tar was dangerous, or what it would cost to clean it," Mr. Jones said. "The investor was certain there was no problem, but the bank was afraid."
In fact, a growing number of investors are looking for tainted properties that they can buy for a fraction of what they would go for if they were clean. Some are betting that no problems will crop up; others are ready to clean the properties themselves.
Mr. Meyerson of Eastern Consolidated is currently negotiating the purchase of an asbestos-ridden office building in Atlanta that, he says, is selling for half of what it would cost if it were clean. "Our client is certain he can remove the asbestos for a lot less than the owner thinks," he said.
Entire businesses are forming around such certainties. Last November, six partners, all with backgrounds in either environmental consulting or law, formed LandBank, a Manhattan-based company, for the sole purpose of buying contaminated properties, cleaning them up and reselling them.
"So many properties are unsold or unused or unfinanced because of conditions that we knew could be treated," said Christopher Carpentieri, a LandBank principal.
LandBank is buying an old bus terminal on Jericho Turnpike in Floral Park, L.I., for $700,000. It is riddled with diesel fuel, solvents and gasoline, but LandBank figures it will cost less than $500,000 to clean it up. Mr. Carpentieri expects a shopping center developer would pay $2.4 million for the cleaned-up land.
The partners, who are using their own capital, have also picked up a small strip center with a leaky gas station in Wilmington, Del., and eight contaminated acres in Charleston, S. C., that Mr. Carpentieri thinks he can resell for an entertainment complex.
OTHER investors are hedging their bets with environmental assessment insurance, offered by Zurich, AIG, Environmental Warranty and a handful of other companies.
Such policies often tip the scales for Ahold Real Estate, which Royal Ahold, the huge Dutch food retailer, formed five years ago to develop shopping centers in the United States that would be anchored by Ahold-owned supermarkets. Edward J. Pabich, Ahold Real Estate's executive vice president, has opted out of many deals because of environmental uncertainties. Just last month, he passed on buying 10 acres of beautifully situated land in South Carolina because a leak from an adjacent gas station had migrated onto the property.
"Normally, when we're in doubt, we walk away," Mr. Pabich said.
But Ahold's supermarket executives are even more conservative than Mr. Pabich. He found some land in Willimantic, Conn., that seemed perfect for one of Ahold's Edwards Super Food Stores. It had once held a gas station, but records showed no spills.
"I was comfortable enough to buy it, but the people on the supermarket side were scared that something bad would turn up once we started building," Mr. Pabich said.
They struck a compromise. Ahold Real Estate bought the land and took out a three-year policy with Environmental Warranty that insured Ahold for the acquisition cost of the land, should any contaminants be found.
"This kind of coverage couldn't make me buy land near an oil refinery in Bayonne," said Mr. Pabich, who said he had taken similar policies on four other properties. "But for most of our sites, this provides sufficient comfort levels."

 BODY:

Lawyers May Be Fined For Filing Frivolous Suits
The State Supreme Court took a serious view of frivolous law suits last week. It called upon the court system's Civil Practice Committee to come up with a new rule that could levy fines or other kinds of monetary penalties on lawyers found guilty of filing such suits. 
 Governor Whitman and many business leaders have complained that growing numbers of frivolous suits have overloaded court dockets and been a financial burden on the economy. Many lawyers have demurred. In fact, the majority of the lawyers and judges on the Civil Practice Committee had recommended simply the enforcement of existing standards to control the frivolous suits. The committee minority had plumped for monetary sanctions.
"I think such suits are relatively rare," said Harold A. Sherman of Warren Township, president of the state bar association, "but they do exist, so it's appropriate to do something about them." He warned, though, that any rule based on the Federal regulation could have "a chilling effect on new, cutting-edge kinds of litigation." He also said there was a potential for opposing lawyers to use the threat of a monetary penalty on each other "as a club."
 
Marching Through State, Thrift Buys Another Pharmacy
With the purchase last month of a pharmacy in Point Pleasant Beach, Thrift Drug of Pittsburgh is maintaining its fast-paced invasion of the New Jersey market, and company officials expect the acquisitions to continue. Thrift has bought 40 pharmacies in the state in the last two years, bringing its New Jersey total to 115. Rite Aid, based in Alexandria, Va., is the New Jersey leader.
In most cases, Thrift has sought out independently-owned pharmacies in New Jersey, rather than build new stores, said John Leibrick, manager of retail sales promotion. "In a market already filled with drug stores," he said, "it's often not practical to do new ones. It makes sense to go for established pharmacies with good real estate."
The Point Pharmacy -- now called Point Thrift -- on Arnold Avenue in Point Pleasant Beach is the company's latest acquisition. It has a total of 620 stores in 16 states.
 
Coming to State's Highways: Diesel Inspection Teams
Drivers of diesel trucks on New Jersey highways may soon be in for a surprise. Under legislation passed in Trenton last week, up to 10 teams of state police officers and Department of Motor Vehicle inspectors will start roaming the roads, pulling over diesel trucks that weigh five tons or more for inspection of their smoke emissions. The measure also calls for increased penalties for violators.
"There is a growing list of studies showing the negative health effects of diesel particles," said John C. Elston, administrator of pollution programs for the Department of Environmental Protection. Diesel buses and trucks account for about 10 percent of the miles driven in the state each day. The Department of Transportation would handle inspections of buses, most of them operated by New Jersey Transit.
The legislation also provides for the licensing of privately operated centers for testing diesel emissions; diesel vehicles registered in New Jerey would have to be inspected there.
 
Farmers Go High-Tech With the Jersey Tomato
There are many tomatoes grown in New Jersey, but only one "Jersey Tomato," and it will be picked for the first time this week. The trademark belongs to the New Jersey Tomato Council, a new cooperative of 21 farmers based in Cedarville in Cumberland County.
"In the past," said Robert J. Matarazzo, a spokesman for the council and a farmer in Belvidere, "we grew a great tasting and looking tomato, but we couldn't pack and ship so it looked and tasted like that on the supermarket shelf."
The council's members have put up $1,000 for each acre of tomatoes they grow. That plus borrowings plus some state funds -- $1 million in all -- has enabled the farmers to change their ways. A drip irrigation line is being used to feed plants nutrients based on daily laboratory analyses of their leaves. The Jersey Tomato is being grown on stakes to avoid ground diseases. It will be moved through the packing process in channels of water to prevent bruising. A computerized photo system will classify each tomato by size and color at the rate of 600 a minute, putting like with like. Chain stores like that kind of uniformity, Mr. Matarazzo said. ROBERT W.

THE plan for the state's new arts center is to get people -- from the suburbs, from the cities -- off their couches and into the theater and the concert hall. Bring a center of their own, like Lincoln Center in scope, to people who don't want to schlep to New York City for culture.
And in Newark, a city that more readily conjures up images of carjackings than concertos. Backers of the $165 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center point out that the brownstone-and-cafe-lined neighborhood around Lincoln Center was once considered one of Manhattan's most dangerous. 
 In a time of nationwide cuts in arts budgets, when long-established arts groups are pleading for money, most of the New Jersey center's financing -- $154 million so far -- has been raised from government grants and loans and private donations. A steel skeleton is going up that will support the 2,750-seat concert hall for the New Jersey Symphony, among others; a 500-seat theater, shops and two restaurants.
Now, a year before the scheduled opening, the center's leaders have chosen the people who will figure out what to put on its stages.
In a ceremony a week ago, the arts center's board introduced its selections. The head programmer is Stephanie S. Hughley, 46, who produced the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta; the associate is William W. Lockwood Jr., 57, currently of the McCarter Theater in Princeton. They start work in the fall.
Mr. Lockwood has had plenty of time to witness the effect a major arts center can have on real estate. For 27 years, he produced concerts and other programs at Lincoln Center, including Great Performers, Serious Fun and Mostly Mozart, the last of which is as much a part of New York City in the summer as gushing fire hydrants.
 Now he wants to do the same thing for his native state, where, as a Princeton undergraduate, he used his own savings to dabble in show business, bringing the Kingston Trio, the Weavers and Carl Sandburg to the campus to perform.
 "All roads lead through or to Newark," he said. "We have a clean slate. We hope to draw people seeking performances of all shapes and sizes. Rather than just watching TV or renting a movie, they'll have N.J.P.A.C."
 Ms. Hughley, too, talks of luring people out of the house and into the concert hall. She wants concerts and shows from the East and Africa as well as Europe and the Americas.
 "Our mission is to be multicultural," she said from Atlanta, where she is producer for arts and entertainment for the 1996 Olympic Games. "We want a place for New Jersey's artists of all nationalities."
 "I want to do classics," she said. "But when you talk about classicism, you don't just mean the West. Every culture has classics. I want people to have cultural experiences that are familiar and comfortable, of course. But I also want to push the borders. It's important to have a moment where the artist comes and touches you -- not just demonstrates in front of you. If you don't sit down and communicate with the audience, you don't change the way they think. You have to embrace different cultures. If you don't, the world won't change."
 Ms. Hughley is wrapping up the most international of programs, three years of choosing and producing dances, concerts and other entertainment to go with next summer's Olympics. She says she has traveled the world, seeking out little-known troupes.
 When she was younger, Ms. Hughley said, she knew she loved the arts, especially dance, but never imagined the arts would provide her with a living. She went to Kent State University and Antioch College, majoring in premedical studies, and, after college, was a medical technologist for a short time.
But more than science, she loved modern dance and ballet, which she had studied since 18, and eventually made her way to New York, dancing and helping out at the Alvin Ailey and Fred Benjamin dance companies. She found that her talents lay not in performing but in handing the details, making it possible for others to be on stage. She moved into theater, working on such Broadway shows as "Ain't Misbehavin'," "For Colored Girls" and "Bubbling Brown Sugar."
 "I did everything from payrolls to budgets, contracts to union stuff, box office to settlements, publicity, marketing," she said. "I was a different kind of manager, being an artist. Usually, it becomes us and them, actors versus management, but I was an artist, too."
 She did not, at first, want to leave New York for Atlanta, but her husband longed for his old home. There, in a city where the majority is black, she produced her biggest shows, the National Black Arts Festival, weeks of African and African-American arts and music with mock villages from African countries and the American South. Half a million people attended the festivals in 1988, 1990 and 1992.
 Like Ms. Hughley, Mr. Lockwood loved the arts -- in his case, music and theater -- in college but never dreamed he could support himself that way. But the shows he produced at the McCarter got him an introduction to and, after graduating, a job with a master producer, Sol Hurok.
 "He was a brilliant man, very difficult, autocratic, despotic," Mr. Lockwood said. "He knew this business. He had a canny sense of what would sell. Working for Hurok was experience you could not buy or get from any course or book."
 Though he is known for producing classical music concerts, Mr. Lockwood said he loves rock and pop. "I'm a dedicated Deadhead," he said of the Grateful Dead.
 The ultimate reward, he said of his profession of 30 years, is to stand in the back of a theater or concert hall and watch the communication establish itself between the stage and the people in the seats. "It's a viable connection, a chemistry," he said. "It doesn't always happen, but I'm very much aware of when it does."
 Rob Gibson, director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, said: "Stephanie is a real vision-oriented person. She's unassuming and very, very talented. She's pretty good with film, very good with music and extremely knowledgeable about dance and theater. She and Lockwood are an interesting tandem. Bill is really strong in music. He's excellent in marketing and a brilliant programmer, brilliant at selling tickets at the box office."
New Jersey's investors, officials from the state and from Newark city government and all who are working on the arts center, Arts hope, of course, that it will do for downtown Newark what Lincoln Center did for the West Side of Manhattan. But Mr. Lockwood and Ms. Hughley both say they do not want to try to duplicate Lincoln Center on the Passaic.
 "Obviously, people will always go to New York," Mr. Lockwood said. "But we think there's audience enough for all. It's logical that if we have a great performing arts institute, people will be interested in coming to Newark. Whether it's electronic music or the Dead or Bob Dylan, the Boston Symphony, Alvin Ailey, Liza Minnelli, we want to have whatever will bring people into the seats. We want to be responsive to what they want to see and hear, and we want to try and educate them, introduce them to new experiences, not just the tried and true."
Ms. Hughley said she wants more than stage performances. She wants the artists to go into schools and meet the audience.
 "I see this center as standing on the edge of the future," she said. "I love Pavarotti, but I want to know who the next Pavarotti is. I love symphonic music. I want to know who the Mozarts of today are."
 The New Jersey Performing Arts Center is due to open for the 1996-97 season. The open question is, will people go to downtown Newark, or stay there after work, to see shows? The center's backers say there are 4.5 million people living within 25 miles of it. To succeed, the center's directors have to allay fears of being in Newark downtown at night as well as overcome the habit of sliding a tape into the VCR.
 "Skeptics say this won't ever get off the ground," Mr. Lockwood said. "Come look. Looking at the steel superstructure, it's easy for the imagination to fill in the sides and the seats and see the orchestra pit. There's no reason why something serious like music and dance can't be entertainment, pure entertainment. It's pragmatic -- that's what will tear them away from their couches."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Are the Bulls Headed For Europe Now?

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
HERE in Europe, it is often said that market trends are like the prevailing weather patterns: they blow from west to east. What is hot in America, the reasoning goes, eventually blows out over the Atlantic and arrives on the Continent some months later.
Now, with near unanimity, investment advisers are forecasting warm and sunny weather ahead for European stocks. 
 This year, American stocks have enjoyed their most impressive six-month run-up since 1987, giving investors an 18.6 percent bonanza. But now, with the combination of a weakening economy and low projected growth in corporate earnings, many analysts are wondering how much higher this market can go.
Not so in Europe. Here, strategists are predicting that a collection of economic conditions -- falling interest rates, a depressed dollar that should only go higher against European currencies and much stronger growth in corporate earnings -- will produce the world's best equities markets for the second half of 1995.
"By the end of November you will see a number of European markets at historic highs," said Thomas Tilse, chief equities strategist for the Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "The opportunities here far outweigh what you could get in the United States. It will be worth it for American investors to diversify."
To be sure, predicting market moves carries risks, and none of the big brokerage firms are recommending that investors pour all their assets into European stocks. They warn that if the German central bank decides not to lower rates or if the dollar fails to recover against the German mark, European stocks will underperform expectations. And there is the potential that the United States bull market will continue.
Morgan Stanley's global portfolio, for example, is still underweight in European stocks, though the firm has been increasing its recommended holdings recently.
It is not that Europe has been a laggard in the first half. While everyone has been watching the roaring bull market in the United States and the collapse of markets in Latin America and Japan, Europe's markets have quietly been a respectable second.
Measured in local currencies, for example, these stocks have risen 4.3 percent. But investors who sold dollars to buy overseas stocks on their own markets in, say, January did much better. Since currencies like the mark and Swiss franc rose in value against the dollar, American investors in these markets not only enjoyed the rise in these stocks in local currency terms but they also gained on the appreciation of those currencies against the dollar.
In dollar terms, European stocks rose 11.4 percent in the first half of the year, and two markets even outperformed American stocks: the Swiss market, which was up 22 percent, and the Finnish, which increased by 27 percent. Moreover, two other markets did almost as well as the American markets: the Netherlands, up 15.2 percent, and Belgium, up 15.4 percent.
This was all happening as stocks in the Pacific basin fell 7 percent in dollar terms, and emerging markets -- in countries like Argentina, Turkey and Brazil -- are off nearly 8 percent this year.
NOW, looking to the second half, many equities strategists are predicting that Europe and the United States will trade places at the top of the global markets.
They are urging their customers to shuffle their portfolios away from American stocks and into more European issues. UBS Global Research is recommending that clients increase their holdings of European stocks by almost 20 percent and reduce their North American portfolios by the same amount.
Goldman, Sachs is predicting that, in dollar terms, American stocks will rise 5.5 percent over the next 12 months, while there will be returns of 19.3 percent from Swedish stocks, 17.4 percent from Swiss stocks, 15.4 percent from German stocks and 12.2 percent from British stocks. The calculations are based on expected appreciation plus dividends and are hedged against a rising dollar.
This push-pull relationship between American and European markets underscores the importance of global diversification for American investors. Salomon Brothers calculates that someone who invested 100 percent in American stocks since January 1986 would have had an annual compounded rate of return of 10.4 percent. But if half of those holdings had been a mixture of European and Asian equities, the return would have been 11.7 percent. This means that a $100,000 investment made in January 1986 would be worth $167,214 more to the investor who diversified.
"Why should you invest in European equities? Because there is only one free lunch -- diversification," said Ralf Conen, an equities strategist in Frankfurt and London for Salomon Brothers. "A basket of international stocks plus American stocks clearly gives you a higher return."
But analysts warn that not all European markets will perform equally. Moreover, they say, in order to maximize their gains in Europe, American investors should both weigh the outlook for markets at home and take steps to protect their European investments should foreign currencies fall against the dollar.
In urging their clients to look to Europe for the rest of this year and into 1996, the analysts are largely betting that two things will happen: The Continent will continue to rise out of recession and the dollar will gain strength against European currencies.
While the American economy and corporate earnings were growing in 1992 and 1993, Europe was mired in its worst postwar recession. The European economy is tied to interest rates set by the powerful German central bank, and all of Europe suffered as the Bundesbank pushed up interest rates to economy-crushing levels to stanch the inflationary effects of vast new spending in the former East Germany.
Only last year did the European economy begin to grow as corporate profits exploded and earnings growth in the United States began to weaken.
Still, so far this year, European stock prices have been somewhat dampened by the rise of the German mark and other strong European currencies against the dollar. This is because these stronger currencies tend to make European exports more expensive and less competitive, thus dragging down earnings of export-oriented companies like Daimler-Benz. (At the same time, a weak dollar makes American exports less expensive abroad and thus more competitive, pushing up American corporate earnings.)
But the consensus here is that the dollar has bottomed out. Though it is now trading at just under 1.40 German marks, analysts say the dollar should recover to a range of 1.50 to 1.55 marks through the end of the year. This would turn the export picture -- and the markets -- around, depressing American corporate earnings and benefiting European companies.
And there is another factor at work, the analysts say: Even as the strong mark is beginning to dampen economic growth, it has reduced fears of inflation, creating an environment in which analysts expect the Bundesbank to lower rates later this summer. And as rates fall in Europe, that tends to push up stock prices, since dividend yields on stocks come closer to yields on bonds.
Of course, even in the rosiest outlook, not all European markets are likely to rise, and analysts tend to be divided on which will do better than the others.
Still, there is near unanimity that Italy, with high levels of debt and deep political instability, is not the place for big returns over the next months, and there are strong advocates for Swedish, Dutch, Swiss, German, British, even Spanish and French stocks.
Given an expected fall in interest rates, analysts tend to focus on markets with a high component of banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. These companies hold large amounts of financial instruments on their balance sheets that rise in value when rates fall.
The Netherlands and Switzerland are on top of most lists, since both have a large number of financial institutions, like the ING Bank, the Dutch bank that recently bought the failed Barings Bank of Britain, and the Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, which struck a deal to buy the British merchant bank, S. G. Warburg.
Other European financial institutions that are on the buy list for major brokerage firms are Allianz, Germany's largest insurance company, and Commerzbank, the country's No. 3 bank.
The Netherlands and Switzerland are also characterized as having companies that are big in consumer products, which analysts say should benefit over the coming months, among them Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics company, and Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company.
Germany and Sweden are two other markets that are often lumped together because they have a high component of so-called cyclical stocks, companies whose earnings tend to rise strongly in the first part of an economic expansion and taper off as orders for their products diminish as the economy weakens.
If Europe was seen to be heading into a long recession, almost every brokerage would probably be issuing sell orders on German and Swedish stocks. But that is not the case. Some analysts are neutral, fearing the effects in Germany, for example, on the export earnings of its companies because of the strong German mark.
THAT point was driven home rudely last week, when Daimler-Benz announced that because of the high mark, particularly affecting its aerospace industry, it would report a "severe loss" in 1995. Daimler stock fell almost 7 percent on the news.
But many analysts like some German stocks. For example, Mr. Conen of Salomon Brothers describes Mannesmann A.G. as a "cash cow," because after several years of heavy investment to build the second German national cellular telephone system, it will begin reaping the benefits this year of large revenue inflows.
Much against the grain of other investment advisers, Mr. Conen is pushing Daimler stock, despite the shock of last week. He is predicting that the new Mercedes E-series car introduced just last week will meet enormous demand and that Daimler will start to benefit from a rising dollar and could be very profitable.
"All the worst things are now coming together, creating a lot of sentiment against Daimler," Mr. Conen said. "Into that weakness I would be a buyer, because fear breeds opportunity."
The Union Bank of Switzerland's Global Research also has Mannesmann on its buy list, as well as Hoechst A.G., the giant German chemical and pharmaceutical company.
Just as there is division over German stocks, there is also a divergence over Swedish stocks. Mark Howdle, head of European Equity Strategy at UBS, says Sweden, along with Italy and Germany, are among the markets the firm predicts will turn in the weakest performances.
However, at Commerzbank, analysts say the Swedish market is greatly undervalued, especially since the Government has taken measures to bring big deficits down. Mr. Tilse at Commerzbank sees the market jumping more than 21 percent in local currency terms over the next six months.
Goldman, Sachs also ranks Sweden among the most attractive markets worldwide, predicting a similar market increase, and saying that the country's pulp and paper industry is particularly attractive.
France and Spain are often lumped with Italy and referred to as the Club Med countries, with traditionally weak currencies, a tendency to devaluation and therefore highly sensitive to movements in interest rates. These countries' markets tend to get hurt more than their neighbors when interest rates rise, since to defend the value of their currencies, local central banks have to push up interest rates more than in Germany, thus hurting economic growth and corporate earnings.
But once rates begin to fall the bounce effect on corporate earnings is faster and bigger than in the hard-currency countries like the Netherlands, Austria and Germany. Thus it is not surprising that Spain, and to a lesser extent France, turn up on the positive list at major firms.
Brent Janssen, European stock analyst for UBS, noted that based on price/earnings ratios, Spanish stocks were selling at near historic lows relative to returns on bonds, offering investors bargain prices and a good chance for appreciation.
Moreover, political uncertainty over whether Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, will have to step down from office before the 1996 elections has diminished and is making for a more stable investment climate. Commerzbank sees Spanish stocks rising 11.4 percent in local currency by year end.
In France, there is not as much optimism, primarily because the new President, Jacques Chirac, has proposed large new taxes to finance ambitious programs to reduce unemployment. Analysts warn that even though French stocks are cheap relative to bond prices, it will be a while before the political climate settles down.
Still, there are some stock recommendations on French shares, such as AXA, the large French insurance company, and Societe Generale, the country's second-largest bank, and in the consumer area, L'Oreal, the cosmetic company.
Finally, the British market is in favor with many analysts, although they recommend that investors wait to see if Prime Minister John Major wins next month's Conservative leadership fight.
Britain's economic cycle is more advanced than that in continental Europe and more closely tied to the American economy. But it may get the best of both worlds, benefiting from falling rates and slower but continued growth in Europe.
Moreover, British stocks are offering some of Europe's best values, said Richard G. Davidson, European equities strategist for Morgan Stanley in London, paying, on average, 4.5 percent in dividends, compared with 3.5 percent in all of Europe.
Also, prices relative to earnings are low compared with other European markets. P/E's on projected 1995 results are now 12.8 percent in Britain, compared with 13.5 percent for all of Europe.
Several of the country's banks, like National Westminster, are currently on buy lists, as are some of its telecommunications companies, like Vodaphone and Cable and Wireless.
"We started the year with a negative view on Europe, but we changed that around mid-April," Mr. Davidson said. "And I am still quite happy to hold more European equities."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Remember Growing Pains?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
This bull market may not be the best ever, but it is one of the most painless.
The exciting news for American stock owners is that in the first half of 1995 share prices advanced across the board, with the Standard & Poor's composite up 18.6 percent, not including dividends. But the most remarkable aspect of that is the smooth way in which it happened. 
 Only twice so far in 1995 has has the S.& P. 500 fallen more than 1 percent in a day, with the second one being last Monday.
We went looking through history and found that such an absence of bad days is truly extraordinary, particularly in a period when prices are leaping. It is a cliche that a bull market climbs a wall of worries, and those fears are usually manifest in occasional bad days.
The last time the S.& P. did better than in this year's first half was in the first half of 1987, when the index rose 25.5 percent. A wonderful performance (to be ruined, to be sure, by the subsequent crash) but one in which the index had 14 bad days.
The first half of 1986 was also great for shareholders, with the S.& P. up by 18.7 percent, but that performance was marred by 12 bad days.
What gives? Part of the answer is that there is no hot new trading technique to roil markets. In the 1970's, there was block trading by institutions, and in the 1980's there were index arbitrage and other forms of program trading. For a time, other traders found it hard to deal with both, and there were sometimes big moves brought on by such strategies that had nothing to do with investors' fundamental outlooks on the economy. Now, markets have adjusted.
But what this really represents is a new confidence in American investors. Stocks, the academics and the sales brochures tell us, are the best long-term investment over any period. So if you are investing for the long haul, for retirement or for the kids' college education, you should buy stocks and forget about it. Let a mutual fund manager handle the details of what stocks to own. Since the recovery from the 1987 crash, mutual fund investors are more likely to buy than to sell in response to bad days.
Stock mutual funds now have more than $1 trillion in assets -- ten times what they had a decade ago -- and fund managers keep less in cash than at any time since the 1970's. That is because they too believe that stocks are wonderful long-term investments, and because what they fear most is being out of stocks when they zoom. So while fund managers are quite willing to dump a stock if bad news hits, they immediately buy something else, pushing up prices of other stocks and keeping the market from enduring really bad days.
If you accept that stocks are always the best investment, then there is no point in looking at such traditional indicators as the dividend payout ratio, now at its lowest point ever. The gospel of the time is that market timing is stupid and hopeless.
The closest thing to the current attitude of "you never need to sell the stock market" came in the early 1970's, when the era of "one-decision stocks" sent the Nifty 50 growth stocks into the stratosphere. The theory was that such stocks were destined to grow forever, so they need never be sold. The full year of 1972 saw only six bad days in the stock market, the lowest for any year in the past three decades.
In 1973, long after value-oriented analysts had thrown up their hands in dismay, the worst bear market since the 1930's got underway. Perhaps the lesson is that gains without pain are destined to wane.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Funds With a Continental Flair

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
A SIZZLING year in 1993 put European stock funds on the map. The number of funds in the group nearly doubled, to 43, soon afterward.
If this year's returns continue apace, as the pundits are suggesting, look for the group's ranks to swell again next year. 
 European stock funds have returned 12 percent on average in the first half of 1995, following a measly increase of less than 2 percent last year. And the hot streak is far from over, predicted E. Andrew Lohmeier, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the funds research firm in Chicago. "Trailing five-year returns are still pretty anemic" on the Europe funds, he said. For the five years ended in May, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.4 percent annually, while Europe stock funds gained only 4.7 percent.
Europe has been mostly in a recession since 1990, when German interest rates moved up to cover the high costs of reunification. In fact, Europe stock funds have had only one good year since 1989. That was 1993, when they gained 26.9 percent on average, thanks to a combination of lower interest rates and investor expectations of an economic recovery the following year. But the recovery mostly fizzled in 1994.
Once again, talk of economic expansion is in the air, perhaps signaling a good time to buy. Europe stock funds provide international exposure -- frequently a goal for long-term investors -- with little of the volatility of developing countries, Mr. Lohmeier said.
Despite overall disappointments, a few pockets in Europe performed relatively well last year. Funds that invest in small companies led the pack -- DFA Continental Small Company Fund was ranked second among the 43 funds. Other leaders had big holdings in smaller countries like Ireland, Finland and Sweden.
Both trends have reversed this year. DFA Continental Small Company has slipped to 37th place, as large company stocks have outpaced smaller ones. And funds invested in Germany and the other big markets have grabbed the lead.
Mr. Lohmeier favors two funds sold without a sales charge, T. Rowe Price European Stock and the Vanguard International Index-European, each of which has been around at least five years. Among funds with sales charges, he recommends Putnam Europe Growth and Pioneer Europe, with 5.75 percent levies.
Exchange rates have played a big part in fund gains so far this year. Countries whose currencies are closely linked to the German mark profited the most, as the mark appreciated against the dollar. As the dollar declines, the value of Americans' investments abroad rises.
If the dollar picks up, American investors in the Europe funds should be protected because the vast majority of the funds hedge against currency risk. In hindsight, the funds have hedged too much over the last four or five years, Mr. Lohmeier said, damping their returns. Notable funds that do not hedge are the two DFA funds and the Vanguard European index fund.
Because currency rates are notoriously difficult to forecast -- much like interest rates -- investors waiting for the dollar to recover could be on the sidelines years hence.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: OFF THE SHELF;
Of Capitalism and its Discontents

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE 

 BODY:
APPROPRIATELY enough this Fourth of July weekend, an upbeat blueprint for a business-led reconstruction of American civilization appears for the first time on the business best-seller list. The book, "Rethinking America" (Random House, $25) by Hedrick Smith, slips in at No. 10. It shares that spot with a classic in the celebrity book genre, "Everyone's a Coach" (Zondervan/HarperBusiness, $22), in which Don Shula, with the grammatical assistance of Ken Blanchard, reveals the secrets of his winning ways at the Miami Dolphins since he began coaching way back in the Kennedy Administration. Well, if we can watch ice hockey at the end of June -- and could you ask for a better example of what's wrong with America and capitalism than the owner of the New Jersey Devils? -- we can learn from the cheery Don Shula.
Neither cheery nor American is John Wareham, a headhunter who makes much of his antipodal roots in "The New Secrets of a Corporate Headhunter" (HarperBusiness, $13), the sequel to "Secrets of a Corporate Headhunter." Do not be surprised if you are struck inexplicably by a desire to listen to the cast recording of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" while reading Secrets II, or Secrets With a Vengeance, as I like to think of it. Mr. Wareham has the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth, if not the upturned chin and grin of impetuous youth. 
 His advice is to follow the Mad Max model -- to mix movie metaphors -- and become a "tribeless warrior," or, as Mr. Wareham says, "electronic-age executives without loyalty beyond immediate friends and family." He isn't the first career expert to say this, but the book's detailed strategies may be the most Nietzschean of any recent career guide, and good for him. A lot of employees could use a little will-to-power. In today's market, the Ubermensch is the person with a job.
Mr. Wareham's book might have been a response to another book in the not-new but refreshingly explicit category. The advance copy of "Corporate Executions," by Alan Downs (Amacom, $22.95), has two subtitles, only one of which, presumably, will appear on the final copy. "The Ugly Truth About Layoffs -- How Corporate Greed Is Shattering Lives, Companies and Communities" is the less moderate of the two. The second drops "corporate greed," but the first is truer to the book's intent. In addition to material on the illogic of many corporate downsizing initiatives and the difficulties that employees face during uncertain economic times, Mr. Downs includes a chapter on the untenable role of human resources departments in recent years. Once the advocates for employees, these departments' executives have in many settings become the executioners of policies ignobly set by others. Fortunately, human relations experts don't take a Hippocratic oath to do no harm.
Another corporate critic is more optimistic than the two previous authors about the possibility of corporations healing themselves. Judy B. Rosener, long an advocate of women in the workplace, has compiled her years of thinking into "America's Competitive Secret: Utilizing Women as a Management Strategy" (Oxford University Press, $25). Ms. Rosener is the author of "Ways Women Lead," a seminal Harvard Business Review article on role theory and sex. There, she argued that the ways women lead demonstrated a female preference for cooperative, shared leadership, versus the "command and control" style typical of men.
Their natural inclinations make women particularly suitable for the new world of flat organizations. The current book extends the argument in a way that makes it more palatable to anyone who objects to what might be seen as stereotyping of male-female behavior. American women, she argues, are an untapped, or at least an underutilized, competitive resource, held back by discrimination and other corporate practices that fail to value their contributions. Doesn't make sense, does it? Well, it probably does, but who wants to complain about angry white men on a holiday weekend? Ms. Rosener, like most Americans, believes inequity can be remedied with information and common sense. As Off the Shelf has learned from the inexplicable juggernaut that is "The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success," sometimes the flow is the only way to go.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: AT THE GATE;
Be Glad This One Is Too Costly

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES hoi polloi have it better. In a red-hot market for new technology stocks, for example, the resulting high prices and lack of access can protect many regular folks from themselves.
But costly errors are still possible. Consider Legato Systems, which plans to go public this month. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., it develops networking software designed to store the huge amount of data that corporations are now keeping on groups of computers rather than on mainframes. 
 There's no question that Legato has a lot of promise. "They're absolutely in the right place," says Gerry Eddy, a research analyst for New Issues, a newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla., published by the Institute for Econometric Research. "They should do very, very well." In the explosive field of computer networking, the company has already lined up an impressive list of clients, including the Navy, Xerox, Shell, United Parcel Service and Lehman Brothers.
But sometimes the price is just too high.
It isn't just that Legato is entering a sizzling market. The stock is being pushed by underwriters like Robertson, Stephens; Hambrecht & Quist, and Punk, Ziegel & Knoell. And the relatively small offering -- two million shares -- will make the stock more attractive. For David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in Springfield, N.J., these forces mean Legato's shares could open at least $5 above their expected offering price of $15 to $17.
Even at $16 a share, the stock is expensive. Such a price would signify a multiple of more than 43 times the 37 cents each Legato share earns, as calculated from trailing 12-month earnings. And if Mr. Menlow is right and Legato ends up being priced at $21 or more a share at the start of trading, investors will pay a multiple of 57 or higher.
These multiples are far higher than those of computer-networking stocks that went public five or six years ago, Mr. Eddy said.In 1990, for example, Cisco Systems was offered at a multiple of 30 times earnings.
Of course, pricey stocks can still be good deals if competition is scarce. But that is not the case with Legato, which faces substantial rivalry from Cheyenne Software and from subsidiaries of big companies like EMC, Seagate Technology and Conner Peripherals. And given that Legato's revenue growth has been roughly that of the industry's, Mr. Eddy said, the company does not seem to be gaining market share.
Moreover, like most but not all first issuers, Legato is young and unproven. The company has had only three consecutive quarters of profitability and, in a venture so green, the stock market would not lightly forgive earnings stumbles. "These companies can't miss," said Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. research firm in Greenwich, Conn., about technology companies that go public. But a young one like Legato "will be treated very badly if it does."
Ms. Smith does not expect Legato to have earnings trouble -- but such a turn of events may be just the ticket that would make the company a good buy. A year ago, Cheyenne Software ran into difficulty as inventories rose and earnings fell. Its stock lost more than half its value and at Friday's closing price of $18.75, the shares carry a much more reasonable multiple of 29. Profitability is on the upswing, and while much of Wall Street remains skeptical some people do not. "The business has turned," said Melissa Eisenstat, an analyst at Oppenheimer who recommends Cheyenne's stock.
A lower price, Mr. Eddy said, would also make Legato a buy. "If it were priced in the $10 to $12 neighborhood, it would be attractive," he said. But at the higher prices expected this month, investors without fat wallets should be thankful they can't buy it. They may have a better chance later.

HEADLINE: An Unjust Report

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Employee Leasing: The Risks Of Swimming in a Big Pool" (Earning It, June 11) spends far too much time sensationalizing and far too little time on why more than 70,000 small businesses have embraced this rapidly growing industry. 
 For employers, complex regulations, excessive record-keeping and disadvantages in obtaining insurance coverage and related benefits make employee leasing a no-brainer choice. For employees, leasing systems offer more choices at better rates, often where no choices existed.
Yes, we need oversight, and perhaps reasonable and fair regulation. Hazar Inc., unfairly and inacurrately cited in your article for a variety of phantom offenses, has been long on record in New York as supporting regulation legislation.
You only did cursory research, particularly where Hazar and Robert (Skip) Anderson are concerned.
Hazar did cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation beginning in 1992 in a continuing investigation of the employee-leasing industry. No charges were then, or ever, filed against Hazar. The F.B.I. has never said that Mr. Anderson defrauded any employees of Hazar.
Mr. Anderson is facing trial, but on charges involving unrelated companies dating to 1986 -- long before Hazar existed. Your article rightly notes that Mr. Anderson is no longer associated with Hazar. He has not been since Feb. 11, 1994, and had we been fully aware of the accusations, it is doubtful that he would have been permitted any association with Hazar.
There are two other specific references to Hazar clients in the story. Tom Boghasian is being disingenuous at best in his claim that health insurance premiums involving his company were not paid. Simply put, all premiums have been and were always paid.
Patrick Maney's situation is unfortunate. The fact is that we are under the Chapter 11 protection, and, during this period, Mr. Maney, who decided to terminate our relationship, does not have access to the deposit cited. When this process is complete, the status of that deposit will be decided. Had he remained a client, no loss or restriction to funds would have occurred.
Hazar's difficulties are directly traceable not to unsound business practices but to the continuing sensationalism of newspaper reports like yours, which provide short-sighted competitors with the tools to steal clients.
Employee leasing is growing for one simple reason: it makes sense. Until we have health care reform or some system that allows small companies to enjoy pricing benefits comparable to those received by large companies, our industry is essential to the health of our economy. Owners and managers of smaller companies must be able to focus their energies on building their businesses as well as creating jobs and opportunities, and not be distracted by the administrative routine that can put a small company under.

Why the U.S. Takes Guff From Weaklings

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BURIED in the praise that the American diplomat Mickey Kantor heaped upon his trade agreement with the Japanese was a kernel of realism. "We did the best we could on this," Mr. Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said the other day. "Given the state of the Japanese economy, we had to be realistic."
 What he also could have said is that, in order to avert a trade war, the United States had to accept less than it wanted in its trade agreement with Japan because the Government in Tokyo was too weak to make many concessions -- and very eager to claim victory over the United States. 
 It is not an isolated problem.
 These days, in dealing with China and Russia as well as Japan, the United States is learning just how limited are its powers to persuade, cajole, strong-arm and bludgeon other countries into doing what it wants.
 That is not because those great powers are too strong. It is because they are too weak. In each case, Washington is dealing with a country whose government is unable or unwilling to bend very much because it is too vulnerable to domestic pressure.
 Just a few years ago, of course, the United States had the opposite problem: It was difficult to wring concessions from the Soviet Union because its leaders seemed too powerful and sure of themselves.
 Today, just when Japan, Russia and China are the countries with which the United States has the trickiest disputes and problems to resolve, all three are in the process of redefining themselves.
 Certainly they know that issues the United States cares deeply about are at play. But what does that matter when they are consumed by so much pressing business of their own?

 
 
Watch Out Behind You
 The result, in all three nations, is a look-over-your-shoulder approach to diplomacy.
 "All three are going through very large internal changes in terms of politics and economics," said Robert B. Zoellick, an Under Secretary of State in the Bush Administration. "They are all uncertain of their relationships with others and suspicious of outsiders, particularly the United States, when they believe it is trying to exert a dominant role. If their behavior veers in a dangerous direction they could threaten one another, or they could threaten third parties and they could threaten us."
 First there is Japan, the uncertain power. Obviously, as an ally and partner of the United States, Japan's potential danger to American interests is not nearly as great as Russia's or China's.
 But how can a country make grand gestures when its economy has been sagging for four years, its banking system is mired in the worst crisis since the Great Depression, and the main reason its Prime Minister remains in power is that the governing coalition cannot agree on anyone to replace him?
 Given the constraints, it was no surprise that President Clinton settled for a deal that only slightly expands on past auto trade accords and requires far less change in Japanese business practices than the Administration's stated objective of remaking Japan's economy.
 In the end, the White House calculated that any extra concessions it might have gained by applying more pressure were not worth the potential risks to its most important relationship in the Pacific.

 
 
A Sense of Limits
 "U.S. negotiators recognized that the divisions within the Japanese Government and the weakness of the Japanese economy limited the extent to which they could go to meeting all of America's objectives," said Robert Hormats, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs. He added that Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade negotiator, "got a lot of domestic credit for saying no so long."
 Then there is China, the rising regional power. The Chinese feel particularly off balance now because they don't know who will succeed Deng Xiaoping, China's ailing 90-year-old leader, even as China adjusts to being the world's fastest growing economy.
 The uncertainty at home helps account for the deterioration in relations with the United States over the past year, a state of affairs that reached its lowest point since normalization in 1979 after President Clinton allowed President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to make a private visit to the United States in early June. For the Chinese, that move -- a response to overwhelming Congressional pressure -- fueled their perception that the Administration is hostage to the whims of a hostile Capitol Hill and intent on depriving China of its rightful place as a great power.
 President Jiang Zemin was uncharacteristically candid -- perhaps unintentionally -- about his own vulnerability when he told the outgoing American Ambassador, J. Stapleton Roy, during a recent farewell meeting, "Any leader who let this pass would be overthrown."
 Finally there is Russia, the weakest of the three, struggling to overcome 70 years of one-party rule and a state-controlled economy. It's no wonder that a country that cannot even resolve a crisis in its breakaway region of Chechnya repeatedly says no to the United States -- whether it is to curb the Serbs in Bosnia or end its nuclear cooperation and arms deals with Iran.
 "We are dealing here not with a functioning and institutionalized democracy but with an unstable combination of authoritarianism, pluralism and anarchy," Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security advisor in the Carter Administration, said recently.
 All this might sound like so much fatalism, as if the United States were powerless to win support for its views in a world gripped by other forces. But it hasn't helped matters that since the cold war the United States has failed at the basic carpentry, let alone the grand architecture, needed to build a new framework for its foreign policy.
 That simply hasn't happened, for many reasons -- among them that the United States itself is in the midst of a painful transition in which its financial future is clouded and its Government divided. And that means that the United States ends up dealing with each crisis day by day and lobbying for its point of view from a weak position, as the other side does the same.

At the Fed, It Looks Like Deja Vu, Again

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve is supposed to smooth capitalism's bumps. Its track record, however, has been oddly one-sided. When the economy is booming, the Fed is very good at slowing it down -- reducing inflation but also making it harder for people to buy homes, keep jobs and purchase cars. Then, a funny thing happens once the economy slows: The Fed gets reluctant to bring back prosperity.
 That reluctance is very much in evidence now. Until February, the economy was robust. The Fed's response, given its visceral hatred of inflation, was to slow it down by doubling interest rates in the space of a year. The slowdown came, and the urgency to act disappeared, although by law the Fed is supposed to be as quick to maintain jobs as to control inflation. 
 The public does not know what the policymakers -- 15 men and three women -- are saying in their current closed-door deliberations over whether to lower interest rates. But now we know what they were saying the last time the economy reached a peak and then slowed sharply, which was in 1989. The pattern then was eerily similar to 1995, even to the month -- February -- when the policymakers decreed their last rate increase. And now the Fed, hewing to the practice of releasing transcripts with a five-year delay, has recently made public the 1989 transcripts. They offer a rare, fly-on-the-wall view of how Fed policymakers behave during a turning point in the economy.
 The details are different, then and now. The inflation rate was higher in 1989, for example, than it is today. Real estate was more of a drag on the economy, junk bonds were a problem, and wages seemed more likely to rise, contributing to inflation. But by all accounts, the dialogue and the dynamics of dealing with a slowing economy are strikingly similar. And seven of the 1989 policymakers are still there, starting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman.
 What stands out in the transcripts is how quickly the mood changed from meeting to meeting. There was optimism that the economy would revive on its own, if not immediately then soon. The optimism gave way, and when the data got too negative to ignore, the policymakers finally acted. It was as if, for all their skills and privileged access to information, they were as much in the grip of day-to-day events as ordinary Americans. No word seems to appear more frequently in the transcripts than "uncertainty."
 Mr. Greenspan was no exception. "I will tell you that the calls I've made and the data that I've looked at suggest that there is a much broader softening out there than I think I perceived at [our last] meeting," he said during a telephone conference call on May 31. The last meeting had taken place only two weeks earlier -- and at the meeting just before that one, on March 28, Mr. Greenspan had declared: "The odds in my judgment are somewhat 50-50 that we will have to tighten [raise rates] again before this cycle is over."
 Instead, just two months later on June 5, Mr. Greenspan ordered the first cut in rates. It was just a quarter-point decline, and he and his colleagues kept lowering rates bit by bit for the next three years. But the economy, instead of reviving as loans became cheaper, fell into recession in July 1990. And the Fed never achieved its ideal, which it calls a "soft landing," a state of being in which the economy grows by just enough to keep the unemployment rate and the inflation rate steady at fairly low levels.
 "It has been so long since we have had a soft landing that I don't think I would even remember," Robert P. Black, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in 1989, said at a Fed meeting, in one of the moments of self-doubt that keep popping up in the transcripts.
 At an earlier meeting, James P. LaWare, a Fed governor who retired this year, touched ambivalently on the Fed's preference for fighting inflation at the risk of dumping the economy into recession.
 "I think we miss some of the environment here if we congratulate ourselves too much on the credibility that we presently enjoy and assume that that's because we are seen as fearless inflation fighters," he said at the meeting on Feb. 7 and 8, when the economy still seemed very strong. (The last, whopping rate increase -- three-quarters of a percentage point -- was still two weeks away.) "We are seen and applauded for that only so long as nobody else gets hurt in the process of our fighting inflation."
 Some similar sentiment undoubtedly will be expressed when the Open Market Committee meets this Wednesday and Thursday to consider whether to cut rates for the first time since the 1995 slowdown started. These governors and regional bank presidents have the power to raise or lower the Federal funds rate, which is the interest banks and other financial institutions charge to lend money to each other for a few days.
 What banks pay for money in turn governs what people pay for mortgages, car loans, home equity loans and the like. The lower the rate, the more people are likely to borrow and spend, lifting the economy.
 Some of today's policymakers -- the most outspoken being Alan Blinder, the vice chairman -- have argued recently that the time has come to bring on this stimulation by lowering the funds rate from its present 6 percent level. The danger is no longer inflation, they argue, but whether the economy is growing too weakly, with unemployment rising unnecessarily.
 What the policymakers say this week won't be made public for five years, although their decision will. But the 1989 transcripts suggest what will probably be said.
 The debate, the transcripts make clear, always focuses heavily on the findings in the "Greenbook," and it is still "the baseline and focus" for the discussions today, says Janet Yellen, a current Fed governor. The Greenbook, prepared by the Fed's big staff of economists, is an assessment of the economy and a forecast of what might happen in the coming months. That assessment, sometimes prescient, nevertheless offers so many alternatives and caveats that, at the end of the day, the policymakers are left to vote their personal preferences.
 "The staff tries to avoid like the plague making policy," said Lyle Gramley, the chief economist in charge of preparing the Greenbook in the mid-1970's.

 
 
Simmer to a Boil
 However the debate goes, rates won't change without Mr. Greenspan's O.K. The transcripts make that clear. The meetings, which take place every six weeks, are ritualistic, and they are arranged in such a way that the rare challenges to Mr. Greenspan's point of view don't prosper.
 That is as true today as it was when the policymakers met in early July 1989, Fed officials say. The transcript of that meeting gives an account of incipient challenges abandoned. Manuel H. Johnson, the vice chairman then, seemed to be the first to challenge the chairman by suggesting the Fed push down interest rates more aggressively.
 "Starting on the same day that we made our modest change in [interest rates], June 5," Mr. Johnson said, referring to the rate cut a month earlier, "we got a whole series of data that I think have become a little more troubling."
 Mr. Johnson noted that short-term interest rates were higher than long-term rates, a rare occurrence that can reinforce the downturn by encouraging people to postpone borrowing in the expectation that short-term rates will inevitably fall. Historically, an "inverted yield curve," as this condition is called, has always been followed by a recession.
Mr. LaWare followed up with more gloomy ruminations. "We have junk bonds being a significant investment in a number of pension funds," he said, noting that savings and loan associations held some of the risky bonds. "So a significant turndown in the economy could cause all that to get out of whack and have a ripple effect throughout the whole financial system."
 After all the policymakers spoke, Mr. Greenspan summed up, ending his presentation with his policy recommendation: he suggested a second quarter-point rate cut.
 "I ask myself: why not more?" he said. "And I think more [a larger rate cut] is potentially risking the type of problem that Governors LaWare and Johnson raised." He was arguing that if the Fed moved faster , the financial markets might get rattled.
"I'm concerned that the worst thing that can happen to us, as far as policy is concerned," Mr. Greenspan said, "is that we are perceived to be easing too fast and in a manner which would open up the possibilities of inflationary expectations."
 Having heard the message, the policymakers give their views. Almost invariably they sign on, even Mr. Johnson in this case, although he would have preferred a half-point cut. It is risky, he said, for the Fed to fail to move as aggressively against recession as it does against inflation. "That problem," Mr. Johnson said, "is simmering out there for us."

Farewell to the Old Order in the Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE birth struggle of a new era is not a pretty sight. It is messy, it is unstable, it is riveting. It was the Supreme Court during the 1994-95 term that ended on Thursday.
 An ascendant bloc of three conservative Justices with an appetite for fundamental, even radical change drove the Court on a re-examination of basic Constitutional principles. Long-held assumptions about the authority of the national government, the relationship between Washington and the states, and the ability of the Federal Government to take race into account in making public policy were all placed on the table for dissection. Some precedents were overruled, others sharply limited in a gaudy show of zero-based jurisprudence. 
 These three Justices -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist along with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- could usually count on Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to join them, and in nearly all the term's most important contested cases had the support of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as well.
 When their reach exceeded their grasp, in fact, it was usually not because they lacked the five votes needed to make a majority but because the fifth vote, Justice O'Connor's, carried with it a note of equivocation or compromise that muddied the message of the other four.
 On the term's final day, for example, Justice O'Connor wrote separately to explain her votes concurring with Justice Kennedy's majority opinions in two 5-to-4 decisions.
 One was a decision invalidating a majority-black congressional district in Georgia as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and the other required the University of Virginia to subsidize an on-campus student religious magazine on the same basis as other student publications. In both instances, the wary tone of Justice O'Connor's separate opinions raised substantial questions about whether the definitively stated conclusions in the majority opinions, which she also signed, could actually be taken at face value.
 The center all but disappeared from the Court this term. That was surprising, given the arrival of President Clinton's two nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, both pragmatic moderates who easily won confirmation with strong bipartisan support and who were widely expected to help anchor a strong central bloc.
 But there turned out to be virtually no center for these two experienced Federal judges to anchor. They joined a Court that, far from converging toward the center, was riven by competing visions of the Constitution and the country. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer have clearly staked their ground on one side of the divide along with John Paul Stevens, the 75-year-old senior Associate Justice, and David H. Souter, the New Hampshire Republican whose emergence as a liberal within the Court's current spectrum is one of the more interesting developments of the last few years.
 The old labels have little relevance on the Court today. There is no liberal in the mold of Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr., who both retired in the early 1990's and who sought to use the Court as an engine of social change.
 The current bloc of Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Stevens and Souter might more properly be called conservatives. They are the ones now arguing for adherence to precedent, as for example in their votes dissenting from Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, which held that Federal affirmative action programs are unconstitutional unless they can survive the most rigorous judicial scrutiny. That decision overturned a 1990 opinion of Justice Brennan's that had given the Federal Government more leeway to devise programs designed to benefit members of racial minorities.
 And it is this group of Justices who now argue on behalf of that onetime conservative shibboleth, judicial restraint, and against reaching out to decide cases that are, arguably, not properly before the Court.
 Justice Souter made that argument in dissent from Chief Justice Rehnquist's 5-to-4 opinion in a case from Kansas City, Mo., that curbed judicial oversight of long-running school desegregation programs. Justice Stevens argued, also in dissent, that the white voters who challenged the majority-black Georgia congressional district had suffered no harm and should not have been accorded standing to bring the case.
 By the same token, judicial activism, a phrase that conservatives once hurled as an epithet, easily fits Chief Justice Rehnquist's 5-to-4 majority opinion striking down a Federal law that made it a crime to carry a gun near a school. It was the first time in 60 years that the Court had invalidated a Federal law on the ground that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce.
 A deep skepticism about Federal power was a theme that ran through the term. The decision on the gun law, United States v. Lopez, was only one example. Another was the 5-to-4 decision that rejected state-imposed term limits for members of Congress. The dissenters -- Justice Thomas joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and O'Connor -- argued for a vision of federalism in which the Federal Government operates essentially at the sufferance of the sovereign states.
 The term's two most important rulings about race, Justice O'Connor's affirmative action decision and Justice Kennedy's opinion in the redistricting case, rejected the Court's long-held view that the Government has a special institutional role in addressing racial discrimination. Justice Kennedy's opinion said it would be "inappropriate" for the Court to "accord deference" to the Justice Department's view of its mandate to enforce the Voting Rights Act.
 The Court declared four Federal laws unconstitutional during the term, an unusually high number given that the Court had invalidated only 129 laws in its previous 205-year history. In addition to the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, the Court struck down two laws on First Amendment grounds: a 1935 law that prohibited beer labels from displaying alcohol content and a 1989 Federal ethics law that prohibited Federal civil servants from accepting money for extracurricular writing and speaking. The Court also overturned, on separation-of-powers grounds, a 1991 law that revived a group of securities lawsuits.
 During the term that began last Oct. 3 and ended June 29, the Court issued opinions in only 82 cases. That was the lowest number since the 82 opinions issued during the 1955-56 term. In the early 1980's, the Court was deciding nearly twice the number of cases.
 Thirty-five of the cases this term, or 43 percent, were decided by 9-to-0 votes. One of the most notable was Justice Souter's opinion that the organizers of the Boston St. Patrick's Day parade could not be required by state law to include marchers seeking to identify themselves as gay and lesbian.
 Sixteen of the cases, or 20 percent, were decided by 5-to-4 votes, and these were often the ideological battlegrounds. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor, whose participation was usually the key to victory in these cases, were in the majority more than any other Justice: 13 out of the 16 cases for Justice Kennedy and 11 cases for Justice O'Connor. The Stevens-Souter-Ginsburg-Breyer group voted together 10 times in these cases: four times in the majority, when they gained the support of either Justice Kennedy or Justice O'Connor, and six times in dissent.
 Taking as a rough measure of the Court's ideological polarities the 35 cases in which Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Stevens were on opposite sides, the alliances of the other Justices were as follows: Justice Thomas, 33 times with the Chief Justice and twice with Justice Stevens; Justice Scalia, 31 times with the Chief Justices and four times with Justice Stevens; Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, both 24 times with the Chief Justice and 10 times with Justice Stevens; Justice Breyer, 16 times with the Chief Justice and 18 times with Justice Stevens; Justice Souter, 14 times with the Chief Justice and 20 times with Justice Stevens; and Justice Ginsburg, 11 times with the Chief Justice and 23 times with Justice Stevens. (Not all Justices voted in all the cases).
 Justices Thomas and Scalia voted often together, 40 times in 46 non-unanimous cases, and so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer: 36 of the 45 non-unanimous cases in which both voted.
 The Court's struggle resumes Oct. 2, when the Justices will confront old battles -- further redistricting cases -- and new, most notably, a Colorado case on whether voters can prohibit the adoption of measures to protect homosexuals against discrimination.
 Below, summaries of the term's major rulings.
 
Federal Powers
Revoking Gun-Free Zones And Term Limits
 One of the Court's most striking departures was the invalidation, for the first time in 60 years, of a Federal law on the ground that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. The 5-to-4 decision in U.S. v. Lopez, No. 93-1260, struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a crime to carry a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion said that the law had "nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise," instead amounted to a Federal intrusion on the states' general police powers.
 This bitterly contested decision left open the question of how the Court intends to apply its newly limited view of Federal authority, and how aggressively it intends to police the Federal-state border. The dissenters were Justices Souter, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.
 The Court's ruling in the term-limits case a month later made clear that the Court is engaged in a profound debate over the nature and sources of legitimacy of the national Government. By a 5-to-4 margin, the Court ruled that in the absence of a constitutional amendment, states may not limit the number of terms that members of Congress may serve. The decision, U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, No. 93-1456, had the effect of wiping off the books term-limits measures that 23 states had adopted for their congressional delegations.
 The debate within the Court was over the meaning of national citizenship and over state autonomy within the Federal system. Writing for the majority, Justice Stevens said members of Congress "occupy offices that are integral and essential components of a single national Government," the requirements for which are set out on the Constitution and cannot be further restricted by the states. The majority was composed of the dissenters in the Lopez case with the addition of Justice Kennedy, a member of the Lopez majority.
 In the dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas said that the individual states, rather than the "undifferentiated people of the national as a whole," remained the source of the Federal Government's authority and, as such, retained the right to add further qualifications to membership in Congress.
 The Court also issued one of its infrequent opinions on the constitutional separation of powers. It ruled that Congress stepped impermissibly out of its legislative role by passing a 1991 law that directed Federal courts to reopen a group of securities lawsuits that a Supreme Court decision had effectively killed six months earlier. Congress may not exercise judicial power, Justice Scalia said for the Court in striking down the provision, an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act. The vote in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, No. 93-1121, was 7 to 2, with Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissenting.
 In its most important ruling of the term on the validity of a Government regulation, the Court upheld the Interior Department's broad view of its authority to protect the habitat of endangered species on privately owned land. Justice Stevens wrote the 6-to-3 decision in Babbitt v. Sweet Home, No. 94-859. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.

Discrimination
A Stricter Standard For Affirmative Action
 The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the Federal Government's affirmative action programs must be able to meet the same strict constitutional review to which the Court had already subjected state and local programs that classify people by race. The decision, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, No. 93-1841, will inevitably curtail programs designed to convey special Federal benefits to members of minority groups, but is unlikely to end such programs entirely. In her majority opinion, Justice O'Connor noted the country's legacy of racial discrimination and said "the Government is not disqualified from acting in response to it."
 The ruling, in a challenge brought by a white contractor to a minority-preference provision in a Federal highway construction program, was based on the Court's understanding of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The Constitution protects "persons, not groups," Justice O'Connor said. The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
 On the same day and with the same division on the Court, the Justices ruled that the lower Federal courts in Missouri had improperly ordered the state to help pay for a showcase desegregation plan for the Kansas City schools. Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion, Missouri v. Jenkins, No. 93-1823, cast doubt on the continued viability of the plan, which features magnet schools intended in part to lure students from the surrounding, mostly white suburbs. The decision also underscored the majority's impatience with continued Federal court involvement in school desegregation.
 The Court injected further turmoil into the already unsettled redistricting picture with its final day, 5-to-4 ruling that the use of race as a "predominant factor" in drawing district lines makes the districts presumptively unconstitutional. Justice Kennedy's majority decision, Miller v. Johnson, No. 94-631, invalidated a Georgia's 11th Congressional district, drawn by the state legislature at the Justice Department's prodding to provide a third majority-black district for the state. The 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee does not permit the state to separate citizens into districts on the basis of race without compelling justification, Justice Kennedy said.
 At the same time, the Court agreed to review two new cases involving majority-black districts in North Carolina and Texas, an action that made clear that the Court is still in the midst of grappling with the issue. The dissenters in the Georgia case were Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
 In an important job discrimination case, the Court ruled unanimously that employees who lose their jobs because of discrimination are still entitled to back pay, even if the employer later discovers misconduct that would have justified dismissal had it been known at the time. Justice Kennedy's opinion, McKennon v. Nashville Banner, No. 93-1543, rejected an increasingly popular defense tool in job discrimination cases known as "after-acquired evidence." A growing number of lower Federal courts had ruled that employers could establish a complete defense to a discrimination claim if they learned, often belatedly through pre-trial discovery, that they employee had exaggerated a resume or committed some other infraction that would have merited dismissal.

Religion
Separation of Church, State and Message
 Two religion cases opened the door to greater government accommodation of religious speech in the public marketplace. The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the University of Virginia must provide a financial subsidy to a student religious publication on the same basis as other student publications. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion rejected the university's argument that discrimination against religious speech was required to maintain the separation between church and state. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissented in Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, No. 94-329.
 The Court ruled that the Ku Klux Klan had a free-speech right to erect a cross in a state park in Columbus, Ohio, finding on a 7-to-2 vote that the state could not exclude the Klan's religious message from a public forum that was open to other private speakers. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in Capitol Square Review Board v. Pinette, No. 94-780.

Speech
No Raining on Somebody's Private Parade
 The Court ruled unanimously that the private sponsors of Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade have a constitutional right to exclude marchers who seek to identify themselves as gay. A parade is a form of private expression, albeit in a public place, that may not be forced by the government to carry an unwanted message, Justice Souter said in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, No. 94-749.
 In an important ruling on the free speech rights of public employees, the Court struck down a Federal law that barred Federal civil servants from accepting pay for speeches and articles, even for those without any connection to their public jobs. Justice Stevens wrote the 6-to-3 opinion in U.S. v. National Treasury Employees Union, No. 93-1170. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented.
 The Court ruled that the First Amendment protects the right to distribute anonymous campaign literature. The 7-to-2 decision, with a majority opinion by Justice Stevens and dissenting votes from Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist, raised questions about the validity of election laws in most states, which requires people who put out campaign literature or political advertisements to identify themselves. "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority," Justice Stevens wrote in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, No. 93-986.
 The Court veered sharply from its precedents protecting the constitutional right of lawyers to advertise. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court upheld a Florida rule that lawyers must wait at least 30 days after an accident before writing to solicit the victim's business. Justice O'Connor's opinion, Florida Bar v. Went for It, Inc., No. 94-226, said the rule served the valid purpose of protecting accident victims' privacy and the bar's reputation. She was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices Scalia, Thomas and Breyer.

Criminal Law
Freeing Public Schools To Test for Drug Use
 The question of whether public schools can require student athletes to submit to random drug-testing did not reach the Court as a criminal case, but it did require the Justices to interpret the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, a provision common to many criminal cases on the docket.
 The Court ruled, 6 to 3, that testing of student athletes was reasonable, leaving open the question of whether other students might also be tested. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion, Vernonia School District v. Acton, No. 94-590; Justices O'Connor, Stevens and Souter dissented.
 In an important prison ruling, the Court made it substantially more difficult for inmates to bring constitutional lawsuits, under the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process, to challenge actions by prison officials.
 This 5-to-4 decision, Sandin v. Conner, No. 93-1911, was written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, who has long sought to curb Federal court involvement in state prison affairs. While not directly overruling any precedents, the decision repudiated an analysis that the court has used in its recent prisoners' rights cases under which prisoners could establish the right to be free of various types of restrictions, unless particular prison policies are followed. The dissenters were Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Stevens and Souter.
 Resolving a decades-old constitutional debate, the Court ruled unanimously that the police are ordinarily required to knock and announce their presence before entering a house to execute a search warrant. But there may be "reasonable" exceptions to the rule to account for a likelihood of violence or imminent destruction of evidence, Justice Thomas said in his opinion for the Court, Wilson v. Arkansas, No. 94-5707.
 The Court ventured for the first time into the world of computerized law enforcement. The Justices ruled, 7 to 2, that evidence seized by police on the basis of an erroneous computer report of a valid warrant could be used in court, as long as the error was made by a court employee and not by a law enforcement official. Three members of Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion -- Justices O'Connor, Souter and Breyer -- saw dangers ahead in this area and suggested that the police would be held accountable for their own errors in a future case. This case was Arizona v. Evans, No. 93-1660.
 The Court salvaged the Federal law against child pornography by editing it to make clear that the Government must prove that a defendant knew that the performers in sexually explicit photographs or films were under the age of 18.
 The poorly drafted Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act makes it a crime to distribute or receive "knowingly" a sexually explicit "visual depiction" of a child. The question was whether the Court should hold Congress to what it said, which could make it a crime for an innocent person to send or receive an unidentified package that later turned out to contain child pornography, or whether to read the law as Congress evidently meant to write it and to require the Government to prove that a defendant knew that a performer was under age. In U.S. v. X-Citement Video, No. 93-723, the vote was 7 to 2 to modify the law's clumsy construction, with Justices Scalia and Thomas objecting to Chief Justice Rehnquist's editorial efforts.
 The Federal sentencing guidelines instruct judges to consider all "relevant conduct" in setting the sentence. Since sentences in narcotics cases depend on the weight of the illegal drugs, evidence of other drug transactions that the Government has not yet taken to trial can be used to boost a sentence and, under this ruling, can then be used as the basis for a separate prosecution. Justice O'Connor wrote the 8-to-1 opinion, Witte v. U.S., No. 94-6187, with Justice Stevens the lone dissenter.
 In an important ruling on the obligation of Federal judges to review state prisoners' petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the Court ruled that a judge who is in "grave doubt" about whether a constitutional error affected the outcome of the state-court trial should assume that it did and must order a new trial. Justice Breyer wrote the 6-to-3 majority opinion, O'Neal v. McAninch, No. 93-7407; Justices Thomas and Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 The Court ruled in favor of state death-row inmates in two other habeas corpus cases, both by the same 5-to-4 lineup with the majority comprised of Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer. In one case, Schlup v. Delo, No. 93-7901, the Court gave a Missouri death row inmate, Lloyd Schlup, a second chance to persuade the lower Federal courts that his execution would be a "miscarriage of justice." The majority opinion by Justice Stevens said the lower Federal courts had set too exacting a standard for Mr. Schlup to meet before being allowed to present evidence -- a prison videotape -- that he says shows he could not have been at the scene of a cell-block murder.
 In the second case, Kyles v. Whitley, No. 93-7927, the Court ordered a new trial for a condemned Louisiana murderer, Curtis Lee Kyles, on the ground that the prosecution had withheld important evidence favorable to the defense.

Business, Taxes
Frequent Flier Contract Gets Cleared for Takeoff
 The term's most important consumer case permitted members of airline frequent-flier plans, in this case the AAdvantage program of American Airlines, to sue an airline in state court for breach of contract over retroactive changes in frequent flier benefits. Justice Ginsburg's opinion, American Airlines v. Wolens, No. 93-1286, rejected the argument that the lawsuit was preempted by Federal law. The vote was 6 to 2, with Justices O'Connor and Thomas dissenting and Justice Scalia not participating.
 The Court settled an old dispute in trademark law by ruling unanimously that color can be registered as a trademark when it distinguishes a particular product and serves no other function. Justice Breyer wrote the opinion, Qualitex v. Jacobson Products, No. 93-1577.
 In a major victory for banks in their competition with the insurance industry, the Court unanimously upheld the Comptroller of the Currency's policy of permitting national banks to sell annuities. Justice Ginsburg's opinion, Nationsbank of North Carolina v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co., No. 93-1612, strongly endorsed the Comptroller's regulatory authority.

HEADLINE: The World: Electoral Confusion;
So Far at Least, Inept Is the Kindest Word For Haitian Democracy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
LOOKING at the long lines of Haitians who waited patiently and peacefully for hours under a broiling sun to cast their ballots last week, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide saw "a clear sign of political maturity." Looking at the disorganization that reigned at polling places and in vote counting centers afterward, American election observers from the International Republican Institute saw a complete "national breakdown of the electoral process."
 By all accounts, Haiti's first attempt in nearly five years to carry out a democratic vote turned out to be a seriously flawed exercise. On voting day, hundreds of polling places opened hours late or did not open at all because ballots were not received, while others got ballots with the names of some candidates missing. Then the count quickly deteriorated, with ballots and tally sheets being scattered about, mixed together, replaced entirely or reportedly altered, and even thrown away as garbage. 
 It is not easy to determine whether last week's irregularities were the product of deliberate wrongdoing or simply an extraordinary display of incompetence. Many foreign election observers here, especially those from the United States, argue that certain minimal universal standards must be maintained in order for an election to be deemed credible, and that last week's vote failed those tests. But Mr. Aristide, joined by the foreigners most intimately acquainted with election procedures here, has been pleading for Haiti's history of misrule and misery to be taken into account.
 The difficulties of organizing a complex parliamentary election, after all, were complicated by Haiti's position as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a population that is 80 percent illiterate, and virtually no highways, electricity or telephones in the rural areas where most of the people live.
 Clearly, those realities contributed to the disarray on election day, and not just in the form of polling officials who could not read or write. American observers seemed especially appalled by what the International Republican Institute, a U.S.-financed civic education organization, called "a total absence of safeguards against fraud, tampering, disappearance and destruction of election material." In the capital, for instance, many ballots were counted under streetlights outside the regional reporting center, and not at local precincts, as Haiti's electoral code demands.

 
 
Safety First
 But polling officials said they acted that way out of concern both for the integrity of the vote and their own safety. With no electricity in their neighborhoods, they were afraid to count votes in the dark and eager to turn their tallies and ballot boxes over to higher authorities before any zenglendo, as the thugs who have disrupted elections in the past here are known, could intervene. Yes, they acknowledged, they knew what the law required, but it just was not practical.
 At the polls, voters seemed unsure what the election was about and even how to vote. Many seemed to think they were being asked to choose whether to re-elect Mr. Aristide, and were startled not to find his picture or name on the ballot. Some, faced with the task of choosing a single mayoral or parliamentary candidate from as many as 30 competitors, simply threw up their hands or marked an X by every name. Still others voted not for two senators and one deputy, as the ballot requested, but for the reverse.
 "The level of ignorance was the worst that I have ever seen," said Benedita da Silva, a Brazilian senator sympathetic to Haiti's situation who was invited to observe the elections from the central plateau town of Hinche. "There was no information and no training," either for voters or election officials.
 But the level of understanding among candidates, especially those from the ancien regime, did not seem much higher. Carmen Christophe is a former Mayor of Port-au-Prince with strong ties to the Tontons Macoute -- the defunct, thuggish secret police force -- who ran for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. When asked during a campaign stop in the town of Arcahaie to delineate her platform, she seemed baffled by the question.
 "Deputies don't have programs, they just vote on proposals in Parliament," Madame Christophe replied. If she has no ideas of her own, then why was she running? "I am a politician," she answered. From the knot of supporters around her, someone else called out, "She is the mother of the people."
 With a second round of balloting scheduled to take place three weeks from today, the Haitian Government and the foreign specialists brought in to help organize the vote are now scrambling to avoid a repetition of last week's electoral fiasco. They argue that the process will be much easier next time, since voting will be limited to runoffs for the 101 seats at stake in the new Parliament and election officials now have some experience to guide them.
 But even if the second round and a presidential vote scheduled for December go like clockwork, some deeper issues remain unresolved. Haiti is not a society with any tradition of negotiation and compromise: politics here has always been a winner-take-all game. Mr. Aristide took a step away from that practice by inviting political parties to meet with him to discuss their complaints about the vote, but the level of intransigence remains high both in the opposition and among his own followers.
 "I'll only be able to tell you if the results are valid when I see the names of the winners," said Joel Pierre, a 35-year-old unemployed man who supported Mr. Aristide's Lavalas ticket. "If the Macoute sector wins even one seat, then I would say there has been trickery in the election.
 "I suppose there are democrats who are not Lavalas, but they cannot win in this election. It's only the losers who are crying."

HEADLINE: Mexico's Question: Who's in Charge, Anyway?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 1

 BODY:
Since he abandoned index cards and started using a Teleprompter last month to give important speeches, Ernesto Zedillo has started to look less like a timid schoolteacher thrust into the spotlight and more like the President of the 11th largest country in the world.
But after seven difficult months in which his leadership has been constantly doubted, and Mexico has at times seemed on the verge of chaos, the Teleprompter may be the only way Mr. Zedillo has lately appeared to be in control. 
 Hardly a week has gone by since Mr. Zedillo took office on Dec. 1 that he has not had to deal with a new political, economic or social crisis, usually promising a neat settlement and then failing to deliver. As the economic crisis continues, so does the wave of violence. Last week two officials in Mexico City were killed. This week 17 peasants in the state of Guerrero were gunned down in a confrontation with the police Two police commanders and eight agents have been arrested for their parts in the killings, officials said today.
One of the men Mr. Zedillo beat in the election last August, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, recently suggested that everything that had gone wrong in Mexico proved Mr. Zedillo should resign and hand over power to someone who could lead, without mentioning himself.
Under pressure from all sides, including his own party, and with up to a million Mexicans suddenly thrown out of work by the economic crisis, Mr. Zedillo has tried to defuse the rising discontent in Mexico. In recent days he has acknowledged mistakes and tried hard to get his administration off to a new, clean start.
On Thursday he urged Mexicans "to leave behind rancor and bad feelings that stand in the way of the advance" to a more democratic Mexico. He has tried to stop endless speculation by saying recently that "a small group of bad guys" who resisted change was probably behind the violence that has shaken the country. This week he also accepted the resignation of Esteban Moctezuma Barragan, a politically inexperienced economist who has been his closest confidant and who was head of the Interior Ministry, where he was responsible for all matters of internal politics and security.
On Friday, Mr. Zedillo also accepted the resignation of Jose Cordoba Montoya, Mexico's representative at the Inter-American Bank for Development. Mr. Cordoba was chief of staff for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and a troublesome link to the past administration for Mr. Zedillo.
To many Mexicans, Mr. Moctezuma's inability to handle the job -- he could not use his Mexico City office this week because angry protesters had it surrounded -- reflected Mr. Zedillo's own shortcomings. Although Mr. Zedillo had frequently defended Mr. Moctezuma, he finally replaced him with Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, Governor of the state of Mexico and a hard-line political negotiator.
Mr. Zedillo's aides say that what critics see as indecision is merely commitment to creating a democratic Mexico, at whatever political cost. They say he has been capitalizing on the unusual freedom afforded him because as a substitute for the governing party's original candidate, who was assassinated, he entered office without having made a long list of commitments to would-be supporters. That, they say, angers people who benefited from the old system of promises.
Worries about the peso and Mexico's ability to pay its debts have been replaced in large part by concerns about political instability, corruption and drugs. The United States Ambassador, James R. Jones, said in an interview that the first question he is asked now when he addresses American businessmen is about Mr. Zedillo's ability to handle such serious problems. "There's a feeling in the U.S. that they don't know who they're dealing with in Mexico," Mr. Jones said.
Over the last 25 months, the list of important Mexicans who have been brutally killed includes a Roman Catholic Cardinal, a presidential candidate, a leader of the governing party, a young prosecutor, a defiant judge and a Mexico City transportation chief whose death by two pistol shots to the chest was ruled a suicide but no one believes it.
Mexicans have believed from the first shot that behind all the horror there must have been a general conspiracy to destabilize Mexico for either financial or political gain. Mr. Zedillo has tried to bring things to a boil by asserting that the country's recent misfortunes were the handiwork of a small group of Mexicans who oppose democratic reform and prefer an authoritarian state.
"After all these bad things that have happened, we are beginning to assume that in Mexico there is a small group, very small, of 'bad guys,' who would like things to be the way they were before," Mr. Zedillo said in a recent speech. "But to them I say you're wrong."
Mr. Zedillo has not identified these "bad guys," a term one official says the President penciled in the speech before delivering it. A governing party governor who did not want to be named said he doubted that the Government had identified the villains but that might not be what mattered most.
"It is easier to explain how you have identified a group without giving names," he said, "than to give the impression that such things can go on and that you, as leader, do not have any idea who is behind them."
Mexicans are growing weary of the endless conspiracy theories coming out of the investigations into the slayings of the presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, and the secretary general of the governing party, PRI, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. A major Mexico City daily newspaper recently published a report about how Mr. Colosio's confessed and jailed killer, Mario Aburto, is really just one of three look-alike Aburtos.
But polls show Mexicans still want to know the truth, wherever it leads. "I've never seen anything like it in Mexico, so many crimes, so much violence," said Juan Ruiz Ramirez, a 70-year-old cab driver in Mexico City. He thought the "bad guys" were within the PRI itself, as do many Mexicans. "The party's old and it's falling apart," he said.
Valentin Ramirez, 24, an air-conditioning mechanic, said he doubted that Mr. Zedillo really knew who the "bad guys" were. "I think he just said it to control the situation, to calm it, show who was in charge," Mr. Ramirez said.
But not that strategy, nor the Teleprompter, have worked, at least as far as Mr. Ramirez is concerned. "He's never seemed to me someone who had what it takes for the job, to be President," he said. "It seems like he doesn't know anything about character, which counts for a lot. If you don't have character, you can't do anything."

HEADLINE: STATES SHELVING AMBITIOUS PLANS ON HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
After Congress killed the Clinton Administration's proposals to revamp America's health care system, ambitious state plans to extend health insurance to more people took on importance as possible models for the nation. But nearly a year later, most of those plans are dead or stalled as the states turn their attention to cutting budget deficits. Meanwhile, the number of uninsured people is growing fast.
In Florida, for example, Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, had proposed in 1992 that employers be required to provide health insurance for their workers. Under pressure from large self-insured employers, he quickly withdrew that plan. Since then, Republicans, who now have a majority in the Florida Senate, have blocked another of the Governor's plans: to transfer $3.2 billion in Federal Medicaid money over five years to a managed health care program that Mr. Chiles said would cover 40 percent of the state's 2.8 million uninsured residents. 
 Florida was one of six states, along with Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington, that had enacted formal commitments to universal health coverage. None of these states, or dozens of others that had considered similar provisions before the Clinton plan collapsed, has moved forward with them.
"There were high hopes last year that states could still achieve universal health coverage and show the way for the nation," said Deborah Chollet, a Washington-based health economist who has studied these trends for the National Institute for Health Care Management, a Blue Cross-sponsored group. "But now," she said, "after the watershed conservative gains in Congress and state legislatures, these hopes have been deflated."
Susan Laudicina, research director for the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Washington, said: "The till is empty. The states that promised much have had to swallow hard and say, 'We bit off too much.' "
Recent polls show that the public is still intensely concerned about health care. But with money tight, most states are "focusing on things they can achieve right now," said Joy Wilson, a health care expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Dramatic changes in health care are not among them.
Faced with severe budget restraints, New York and other states have moved in the opposite direction of the Clinton plan, slashing Medicaid costs -- by more than $1 billion in New York's case. Other attempts to force tougher insurance requirements on employers have also withered.
Oregon and Washington, for example, had passed laws in 1989 and 1993 requiring employers to provide workers with insurance. Oregon has delayed enforcement of the law, and the Republicans who took control of the legislature have called for its repeal.
Washington revoked its law on May 9 because it realized it could not get Congress to exempt it from a law that prohibits a state from regulating health care coverage provided to employees by self-insured businesses.
"Congress caved in to big business," Gov. Mike Lowry said as he signed the repeal bill, referring to the opposition of the business community.
As states try to decide what to do about health care, the number of people without insurance has continued to grow. Although a few states have been able to expand their basic Medicaid programs for low-income people, the number of uninsured people is rising by 1.1 million annually, to 40.9 million in early 1994, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington.
Employers added 2 million workers to the insured rolls as the economy picked up last year, but 4.5 million spouses and children were dropped, mostly by small businesses, for a net loss under private insurance of over 2.5 million.
"Early in the summer of 1994, we thought we had reasonable certainty that some kind of bill approaching universal health coverage would have been passed by Congress," said Doug Cook, director of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. "Now in the brief span of a year, we have moved to a 180-degree turn, and we are marching in the other direction."
Public programs for the working poor in states like Minnesota have had little effect on the overall number of uninsured workers. Indeed, the public programs provide "an incentive for small employers to give up coverage," said Kala Ladenheim, an expert on state programs at the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project at George Washington University.
With the death of the Clinton proposals, Hawaii remains the only state that has turned a commitment to universal coverage into action -- and that took place more than 20 years ago.
Since 1974, when it won a unique waiver from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Hawaii has required employers to share the costs of health insurance coverage with employees who work more than 20 hours a week. But Hawaii has not been able to win another waiver that would have helped it extend coverage to the 14 percent of its 1.2 million people who still do not have insurance.
Every state that had hoped to replicate the Hawaii requirement has been thwarted by the same restrictive Federal law, which protects self-insured businesses from state regulations. Those companies now employ the majority of workers in most states. Hawaii was exempted from the requirement because it had enacted its plan before Congress passed the law in 1974.
And so Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican who had opposed the mandate in any case, has called for the repeal of that state's law requiring employers to cover their workers, the implementation of which had been delayed by the legislature anyway.
States have tried to expand coverage by pushing Medicaid recipients into health maintenance organizations and other managed care programs, hoping those programs would deliver savings that could then be used to cover the uninsured. Many experts remain skeptical of the strategy. Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, Tennessee and Rhode Island have adopted this tactic, which requires permission, a so-called Medicaid waiver, from the Federal Government.
New Jersey and Connecticut also have new, although more limited, programs to move poor people on Medicaid into managed health care.
But Sharon Canner, a Washington-based health care expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, said she questioned whether health maintenance organizations would produce the promised savings for the states, a concern voiced by other analysts as well.
Indeed, the future of Medicaid waivers is clouded. Bruce C. Vladeck, who heads the Federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, said in a recent interview that "none of these waivers could be sustained" under the Republican budget resolution. The resolution would cut projected increases in Medicaid spending by $180 billion during the next seven years, so even if there were savings from managed care, there would not be enough money to pay for additional people without insurance.
"The real issue is whether Medicaid will continue to grow fast enough to make up for the reductions in private insurance," Mr. Vladeck said. "There is a real risk that we will go backwards."
Although some states, like Minnesota, Vermont and Washington, help pay health care costs with tobacco and alcohol taxes and hospital surcharges, raising taxes to finance health care has become politically impossible in most states in this age of tax cuts. "The favorable political climate has basically evaporated," said Phyllis Torda, policy director of Families USA, a consumer group that advocates universal coverage.
Hope for more modest change is still alive in many states. Most states have changed their Medicaid eligibility rules so that more small children, infants and pregnant women will be covered. A growing number of states are passing laws to regulate the practices of health maintenance organizations and other managed care groups, Ms. Wilson of the conference of state legislatures said.
And New Jersey, for example, is starting a program that will help pay for coverage for about 30,000 of its 1.1 million uninsured.
"Now that we have backed off from mandates and universal coverage, the hope is that we have backed into controlling the costs through managed care and showing that voluntary coverage can work," said Ms. Chollet of the National Institute for Health Care Management.

HEADLINE: Colombia's Rebels Grow Rich From Banditry

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
At age 68, Manuel (Sureshot) Marulanda's aim may be getting a little shaky. But the lifelong guerrilla commander's instinctive answer to the latest peace offer by Colombia's President was bombs and bullets.
When President Ernesto Samper Pizano unveiled a peace plan in May, Mr. Marulanda and other guerrilla leaders responded with an offensive that killed 157 people and wounded hundreds. Guerrillas kidnapped 35 people, blew up oil pipelines seven times, exploded a bomb in Colombia's Congress building, and destroyed a peace statue created by Fernando Botero, the father of Colombia's Defense Minister. 
 In late June, Mr. Marulanda's guerrillas killed two American missionaries they had held captive for 17 months, an act that drew international attention to the offensive.
Long after guerrillas in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela have given up their guns and joined electoral politics, Colombia's guerrillas fight on, keeping alive Latin America's longest and largest insurgency.
For older commanders like Mr. Marulanda, who started fighting in 1948, the life of a guerrilla is a career. For the younger generation, dreams of socialism from the 1960's have given way to a reality of pure olive green banditry. Colombia's guerrillas earn millions of dollars annually through kidnapping, extortion and providing protection to drug traffickers. Guerrilla units have increasingly become autonomous money-making operations devoid of any ideological mission, sometimes fighting among themselves over the spoils.
New money has injected new energy into a flagging movement. Today, there are about 12,000 guerrillas in Colombia, roughly the same as a decade ago. Two groups that were demobilized in the early 1990's, the M-19 and the Popular Liberation Army, are being rebuilt.
Faced with fragmented guerrilla armies with little incentive to leave the mountains, President Samper appears likely to become the fourth President in a row to fail to make peace.
To jump start peace talks, he offered to pull all Government troops out of Uribe, the traditional base for the largest guerrilla group, Mr. Marulanda's Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Spreading over a mountainous area half the size of Connecticut, this rural municipality is within easy striking distance -- less than 100 miles -- of the savannah that surrounds Bogota, the national capital.
Conservatives complain that the Government plan would surrender control of a key area to the guerrillas. "The President is generous, and the guerrillas respond with a hard line," said Fernando Cepeda, a former Interior Minister. "We do not even know if they want peace."
Peace is a foreign concept to commanders like Mr. Marulanda who cling to the dream of replicating Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba in 1959. But, faced with high desertion rates, they fill their ranks with teenage peasant boys who are easier to indoctrinate and to discipline than adults.
Roughly one-third of the country's guerrillas work guarding laboratories and farms used to produce cocaine or heroin, according to a survey conducted in May by El Tiempo, Colombia's leading newspaper. While professional gangs usually handle the trafficking, guerrillas tax drug harvests and charge landing fees at jungle airstrips.
Guerrillas carry out about half of Colombia's kidnappings every year, according to a survey conducted by Pais Libre, a group for kidnapping victims. The Colombian Army estimates that FARC and an allied group, the National Liberation Army, hold about 250 kidnapping victims, including 5 Americans and 31 other foreigners.
A National Liberation Army commander recently sent a letter to subordinates holding two Italian oil engineers kidnapped in April in which he instructed them to "always charge for proof."
"For example," he wrote, "we charged $50,000 for the information we gave about the German."
The letter continued: "In the case of the Italians, we can ask for $100,000 for information. That way, we will reduce the pressure, and get back what we have invested so far."
In the oil-producing state of Arauca, a National Liberation Army unit has amassed through kidnapping and extortion an investment portfolio worth $12.5 million, according to a military intelligence report made public recently. By forcing local governments and companies to deposit funds in guerrilla-controlled bank accounts, the 250-man unit now operates a fleet of 30 vehicles, a 3,300-acre ranch for stolen cattle, a sugar cane plantation, coca leaf farms, and several hotels, restaurants and hardware stores.
The evolution from Che Guevara-style revolutionaries to Sicilian-style gangsters has cost Colombia's guerrillas the popular support such insurgencies knew on college campuses in Europe and the United States during the 1960's. Today, Colombia's guerrillas are largely forgotten outside the country. Cuba, once a source of inspiration and of arms, now has normal diplomatic relations with Colombia and is courting Colombian tourists and business investors.
Although the guerrillas have minimal popular or political support, their new wealth has strengthened them militarily, allowing them to buy sophisticated radios and weapons.
"From the economic point of view, they have become stronger," a Colombian Army general said recently, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "The guerrillas have the economic clout brought about by coca crops and kidnappings. Take that away and defeat would be easy."
But with no defeat in sight, Colombia's guerrillas are a powerful, disruptive force.
Over the last decade, 700,000 people have fled the countryside, according to a survey released in April by Colombia's Bishops Conference. Most had witnessed a killing or had lost a relative or close friend to the violence. Each year, about 3,000 people die in the war -- roughly 10 percent of homicides registered annually in this country of 37 million people.
The guerrillas have placed large swathes of rural Colombia off limits to private investment. With security costs high, foreign investment is limited to small, highly profitable projects that can be protected, like oil wells or coal mines. So much ranch land has been abandoned that Colombia's leather industry now imports cow hides from neighboring countries.
While many Colombians are skeptical of their Government's chances of negotiating peace, greater credence is given to three other policies adopted by President Samper: vast social spending in the countryside, eradication of drug crops, and "humanizing" the war by opening human-rights offices, banning torture, and other measures.
Offering rural Colombia a "social leap," Mr. Samper, a Social Democrat, is directing a mixed public and private plan to channel $10 billion into rural areas over the next three years to improve roads, telephones, schools and hospitals in an effort to slow migration to the cities and ease resentment against the Government.
Mr. Samper is also using $15 million in United States aid to carry out Latin America's most ambitious drug crop eradication program. Since February, the National Police have eradicated about one-quarter of Colombia's illicit coca leaf and opium poppy. American officials, who supply airplane fuel, herbicide and Turbo Thrush spray planes to the effort, believe that Colombia can reach its goal of total eradication by the end of next year.
The guerrillas, seeing their interests threatened, have responded with almost weekly attacks on fumigation planes. This year, they have damaged 15 aircraft and shot down 6 helicopters. In response, the authorities are bulletproofing vulnerable parts of the helicopters.
In another strategy, President Samper seeks to reduce civilian casualties and to place the guerrillas on the defensive by "humanizing" the war. Last December, he signed the Second Geneva Protocol, an international convention that bans the torture of prisoners, the taking of hostages, the recruitment of children, and attacks on civilians.
Instructing Colombia's army and police to comply with the convention, Mr. Samper has opened human rights offices in all major military and police garrisons. Turning to the guerrillas, he has asked that they release an estimated 500 soldiers under the age of 15 from their ranks and that they stop sowing land mines in areas frequented by peasants.
The guerrillas show little interest in complying. In May, soldiers deactivated a five-mile-long perimeter of 2,000 land mines protecting a 40-acre guerrilla complex that included a coca bush plantation and an explosives factory and warehouse.
After decades of directing criticism at the Government's counterinsurgency operations, human rights groups are now also focusing on abuse by Colombian guerrillas.
After FARC guerrillas killed the two American missionaries, Stephen Welsh and Timothy Van Dyke, on June 19, Human Rights Watch/ Americas immediately criticized Mr. Marulanda's guerrillas.
"These violations form part of a pattern of kidnappings and executions carried out by Colombian guerrillas, especially the FARC, that go against internationally accepted codes of behavior," the New York-based human rights group said in a statement widely reprinted here. "We demand the immediate liberation of the hundreds of kidnapped civilians."

HEADLINE: All the Comforts of Manhattan;
Why Rough It in the Hamptons? Goodies Are Delivered

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
The Lexington Avenue butcher shop's missive to its Upper East Side clientele was as pointed as its knives. Can summer in the Hamptons be savored without hung pheasant or designer chicken, liberated from cages and nurtured in the sweet air of Pennsylvania Dutch country?
"We have been informed by many of our valued customers on how 'difficult' it is to purchase quality meats and poultry at the East End while away from Albert & Sons during the summer months," wrote the proprietors, Robert and James Moffa. 
 Poultry lovers, fret no more. For a purchase of at least $100, the Moffas will happily provide chicken-to-pot delivery service from Manhattan to their customers' summer homes on the wind-scrubbed beaches of the Hamptons, almost 100 miles away.
There goes the neighborhood. More and more Manhattan merchants are willing -- for a fee -- to treat the Long Island Expressway like a short subway line to Fifth Avenue, as long as they reach their prized and pampered clientele.
Their basic pitch is this: don't leave home without it (Manhattan). Planning a Hamptons dinner party now requires no more effort than strolling out to the doorstep, where Manhattan merchants are eager to deliver table linens and dishwasher-safe wine glasses, shell steak and a good bottle of Lafite-Rothschild.
Summer in the Hamptons traditionally was the period squeezed between Memorial Day and Labor Day, but the season has gradually expanded from Easter to Thanksgiving, an unsettling trend for Manhattan merchants who rely on their trade to New Yorkers with second homes in the Hamptons.
Aided by fax machines, computer modems and overnight delivery services, many summer residents are becoming "semi-commuters" who have taken to heart the words of the 19th century poet John Howard Payne, whose homage to "Home Sweet Home" was inspired by a rough-shingled saltbox house that still stands in East Hampton. Typically, the commuters spend four-day weekends in the Hamptons and the rest of the week in Manhattan.
"Manhattan businesses are faced with the problem that the world is not in Manhattan in the summer, it's in the Hamptons, and basically they see their business drop like a stone," said Jerry Della Femina, the Manhattan advertising executive who also owns Jerry & David's Red Horse Market in East Hampton. He added, "If someone said, 'I want you to get all the affluent, influential New Yorkers and then go to one spot and wait for us,' the fact is that they all go to the Hamptons."
Given this view, it's not surprising that Mr. Della Femina advertises his celebrity New York customers far more than the Long Island potatoes at his market: "See a big-deal ad guy groveling for customers. Catch Mort Zuckerman pushing a shopping cart. Stand on long lines next to minor celebrities. It's summer in the Hamptons."
Peter Meltzer, a wine writer and publisher of the "Passport to New York Restaurants," who divides his life between the Upper East Side and the Hamptons, said, that "For many, the Hamptons is an extension of Manhattan culture."
"It's no surprise that people seek the same creature comforts," he said. "I think it's boring, and I try to seek out the contrast. I don't want to replicate Third Avenue on Main Street."
If there is a border to this virtual community, it is bounded by the Long Island Expressway, the Long Island Rail Road and the Hamptons Jitney, which cossets its Manhattan customers with airline-style beverage service and a courtesy rule that limits cellular phone conversations to three minutes.
Eight months ago, those borders were stretched into cyberspace with the advent of Hamptons Online, a computer bulletin board and self-styled "virtual beach" that offers customers computer access to most local Hamptons newspapers along with classified advertisements and restaurant reviews. More than 20 percent of the 750 subscribers are from Manhattan, said Robert Florio, the founder of the service.
"I think we're seeing people stay longer because they've been liberated from their 9-to-5 jobs because of technology," said Tom Neely, president of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce. "You can do pretty much the same here as you can in Manhattan with faxes and computers."
Even New York charities have trailed their supporters to the Hamptons. The AIDS Resource Center on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan opened the Welcome AIDS Thrift Shop on Main Street in Southampton two years ago. Many of the initial donations came from Manhattan, and in turn the store raises money to support a temporary housing program in New York for women and children suffering from AIDS.
"We have a great number of people who come to the East End who are involved in arts and theater, and we knew we would have support," said Marie C. Bernard, a director of the store, who noted the lengthening of the summer season.
Watching that trend, the owners of the Lexington Avenue butcher shop decided to launch their delivery service to eastern Long Island. Last summer the business at Albert & Sons dropped more than 60 percent while many of shop's customers were vacationing in Europe and the Hamptons, said James Moffa, the president of the company.
He noted his customers' complaints about the difficulties of finding specific types of poultry in the Hamptons: pheasant, hung for at least 12 days, or Bell & Evans free-range chicken from Pennsylvania. He sent out letters announcing his service.
Last week, the company prepared for its first run, but not enough orders came in to fill a truck with meat. Still, they tried to satisfy two orders from the Hamptons; the meat made it there by Federal Express.
The pages of Dan's Papers, a free weekly newspaper in the Hamptons, is thick with the advertisements of New York City businesses reaching out to the Hamptons. Some promote architectural services and professional family portraits. Others offer singles introductions and the Hamptons Mobile massage ("Two Hands, Four Wheels").
Sherry-Lehmann, an Upper East Side Manhattan wine shop on Madison Avenue, was touting its blue-ribbon delivery service with a full-page ad, "America's Best Wine Shop Goes to the Hamptons!" The company's chairman, Michael Aaron, is even more effusive about the service, which his father started in the 1950's when his family used to vacation on Fire Island.
The store's trucks deliver wine to the Hamptons weekly for minimum orders of $175. Particularly popular this year, he said, are requests for the store's Sherry-Lehmann wine glasses and cases of Boyer Brut Blanc de Blancs, a sparkling wine. "This year our growth has been explosive," Mr. Aaron said. "We had small growth since the beginning of the 90's because of the recession, but we're up over 45 percent in the deliveries."
Local merchants in the Hamptons have watched this flurry of activity with some skepticism. They point out the hazards of seasonal business and the failure of the Sfuzzi Italian restaurants in Manhattan to try hard enough to cater to the Southampton locals during the slow winter seasons.
"I think their expectations were a little high," said Lee Walter, who divides his life between his home in East Hampton and his work promoting classical music concerts in Manhattan. "They have to be able to appeal to the local people. They're not going to spend a lot of money to have a couple of lettuce leaves on their plate."
After Sfuzzi left, another group of New Yorkers moved into the old dance hall that was popular in the 1940's and changed its name back to the original, Bowden Square.
This roulette of New Yorkers doesn't seem to faze the merchants who have lived in the Hamptons through seasons of winter and summer. They have also watched with satisfaction as the flow of business has reversed directions, from the Hamptons to Manhattan.
Sonny Mattera, a butcher with silver hair and a pencil perpetually jammed behind his ear, shut down his 30-year-old shop in Queens to move to the Hamptons seven years ago. Sonny's Meat Market of Astoria, Queens, became the Village Shoppe of East Quogue. And the shop has thrived, he said, because he has stocked quality meats like pheasant and Bell & Evans chicken.
Naturally, he announces, The Village Shoppe delivers to Manhattan.

HEADLINE: WAREHOUSE OF ADDICTION;
Bars Don't Stop Flow of Drugs Into the Prisons

SERIES: Warehouse of Addiction -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Elliot Crespo Jr. was a small-time heroin hawker in Brooklyn until he was arrested twice in late 1989 on the same block in Williamsburg.
Then he became a small-time heroin hawker in a cell block at the Marcy Correctional Facility in upstate New York.
To feed his new market in prison, Mr. Crespo relied on the wiles of visitors from home. His male friends smuggled in drugs hidden in the heels of sneakers, he said. And his female friends passed small balloons filled with heroin from their mouths to his when they kissed in the visiting room. He then swallowed the balloons or hid them in body cavities. 
 "You get a visit, you swallow a balloon," Mr. Crespo said, detailing the techniques matter of factly. "You go to the bathroom and you put it inside your behind in a balloon. You get a sneaker, hollow out the heel, put the drugs inside and glue it back up. That's it."
Mr. Crespo's drugs followed a well-traveled route. Drugs are seeping, and in some cases flowing, into the nation's prisons as the war on drugs has packed them with drug dealers and drug users.
But this captive audience of the nation's hardest core, most dangerous drug users is left mostly to its own devices. Resourceful inmates can maintain their addictions with the help of friends, relatives and corrupt prison employees. And long-term, intensive treatment, which experts say could turn around their lives, is scarce; costly rehabilitation programs are unpopular with taxpayers.
By failing to halt drug use or to provide widespread treatment, the penal system is missing an opportunity to attack, and try to break, the very cycles of addiction and crime that keep the nation's prisons filled.
Inmates have long been adept at getting contraband in prison, from jail-house hooch to makeshift knives. But the trafficking and use of drugs behind bars is particularly striking because it is the same criminal activity that is overcrowding the prisons. The number of inmates nationwide has more than tripled since 1980, pushing the nation's annual corrections budget to more than $29 billion. And 800,000 of the nation's 1 million inmates have a history of drug use.
Inside, the drug business often goes undetected, and is sometimes ignored. Since few inmates caught using drugs in prison are prosecuted, some are selling marijuana or using heroin with virtual impunity while serving time for drug offenses.
"Inside, you should be able to have total control and you should be able to say, 'O.K., this is the consequence for your crime,' " said Vince Adszko, a deputy district attorney in Sacramento County, Calif. "The problem is they just continue their criminal enterprise once they're inside."
Speaking by telephone from the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., Mark Young, a convicted marijuana trafficker, said drugs were easy to come by. "Right now, I'm in a sea of heroin, and anybody who wants it can get it," he said.
Marijuana cigarettes, which he prefers, cost him about $12 in postage stamps, he said, adding, "I don't think I'd ever pass up the divine opportunity to smoke a joint."
Evidence of the prison drug trade abounds.
Last summer, a convicted murderer, Frederick Matthews, was found dead of a cocaine overdose in his cell at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock, N.Y., a hypodermic needle, similar to those stocked at the prison hospital, clutched in his right hand.
In February, the State Auditor of Mississippi issued a report on the drug trade at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman in Sunflower County, which one investigator said was so prolific that there was an oversupply of drugs and inmate dealers were actually smuggling them out.
In March, 3 New York City correction officers and 2 cooks were charged with smuggling drugs to Rikers Island in New York City, bringing to 26 the number of officers charged with drug smuggling there since 1990.
In May, Keith Eugene Gaffney was convicted on charges of running a heroin distribution ring in the District of Columbia's prisons that had all the violence and sophistication of a street gang.
Also in May, a guard at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., smelled marijuana smoke wafting from the cell of Tupac Shakur, the rap star, who had been convicted of sexual abuse. After he tested positive for drugs, Mr. Shakur was ordered confined to his cell for 60 days.
No one suggests that drugs are as easy to find in prison as they are on the street, and availability varies widely from prison to prison. The price of drugs in prisons' barter economy is usually the equivalent of 3 to 10 times their street price, reflecting a smaller supply. Many corrections officials play down the availability of drugs and say inmates are exaggerating.
James Flateau, the spokesman for the New York State Department of Correctional Services, said all indications are that there is not "widespread availability" of drugs. But he added: "Do we know there are drugs in prison? Of course. Unless you searched everyone going in and out, kept all packages out and locked all inmates in their cells for 24 hours a day, you're going to have contraband."
Drug use in prison has become an open secret among many in the corrections industry. Bobby Lewis, a senior security specialist with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said that despite some successful anti-drug efforts, drugs "obviously" get inside. Don Cabana, a former prison warden in Mississippi, Missouri and Florida, said corrections officials often feel the need to present prisons to the public as pristine institutions of reform.
"It's public relations gimmickry," he said. "If a warden acknowledges he has a drug problem, he's going to pay a terrible price."
The cat-and-mouse game played by police officers and dealers on the street is re-created in some prisons. Corrections officers resort to strip-searches and cell shakedowns while prisoners become ever more inventive at smuggling drugs, from working with corrupt guards to receiving liquefied LSD painted on the backs of postage stamps.
Experts consider random testing of inmates' urine a deterrent to drug use. But many states, including New York, California and Texas, which together have more than one-quarter of the country's prison population, do no broad, random testing of inmates.
About half the states and the Federal Government test all their inmates, and punish them with solitary confinement or loss of privileges for a "dirty" urine specimen. Most of those states, however, test just 5 percent of their prisoners a month, meaning that on average, each inmate receives a random test just once every 20 months.
Some correction officials say the tests are a good barometer of drug availability, and note that only from 3 to 10 percent of the inmates tested are found with drugs in their urine.
But others, including Mr. Lewis, who ran the Federal inmate testing program, said the results should not be seen as an accurate picture of all drug use in a prison. Mr. Lewis said the chances of catching an inmate who is using drugs with a random drug test are "very slim"; most drugs can be detected for only a a few days after they are taken.
And drug use is likely to be much higher without the threat of tests, experts say. "There's little doubt in my mind that if we started a drug testing program today, we could expect a hit rate over 30 percent," Mr. Lewis said.
Drug-possession cases in prison often go unprosecuted because the quantities found are usually small by street standards, and because the users are already locked up. State and Federal prosecutors who handle prison crimes say they do not file charges in simple possession cases, instead leaving it to prison officials to punish inmates with solitary confinement or loss of privileges. They say that for a criminal already serving a long sentence, losing television or visiting rights is often more punishment than additional prison time.
Penelope Clute, the District Attorney in Clinton County, N.Y., home to three state prisons, said of drug possession: "If it's on an inmate, if it's not a felony level, we don't prosecute them." Since the maximum punishment for misdemeanor possession is a year in county jail, she said it simply isn't worth "the hassle" of transporting the inmate to court for processing.
 
Point of Entry
At Visits, a Kiss Is Not Just a Kiss
In a large, brightly lighted gymnasium at one of Washington, D.C.'s seven prisons, nightly visiting was under way. Nearly 80 prisoners were sitting with two or three visitors each, watched over by barely a dozen corrections officers. Children romped around and some inmates took their visitors to one side of the gym to pose for pictures under a huge poster of a black Mercedes and the words "High Roller."
Sitting on long rows of chairs, men prisoners and women visitors engaged in prolonged hugging and kissing as officers walked the gym like chaperones at a high school dance.
Prison visiting rooms are a prime entry point for drugs. Although visitors to Washington's prisons are frisked before visits and inmates are strip-searched afterward, it is easy to see how balloons of drugs could be either swallowed or hidden in body cavities and go undetected in this whirl of activity.
Just as the District of Columbia came to signify the ravages of drug trade, its prison complex in Lorton, Va., is a stark example of drug trafficking behind bars.
"The ease with which inmates can obtain drugs in Lorton is a public scandal," Judge T. S. Ellis 3d of Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in November 1993, explaining his refusal to return to Lorton a man convicted of heroin possession while serving a drug sentence there.
A recent internal Federal Bureau of Investigation memo on drug trafficking at Lorton outlined what is "essentially a transfer of the criminal problem of the District of Columbia to a correctional institution."
Since 1992, more than two dozen corrections officers or other staff members at Lorton have been convicted of drug smuggling, and since 1993, 26 inmates and 13 visitors were prosecuted on drug charges, Federal officials said.
In February 1994, Vicki Michelle Griffin, a Lorton psychologist who counseled prisoners, was accused of smuggling 70 grams of marijuana in for an inmate. In court papers, prosecutors called it "an unusually large amount, even for Lorton." She later pleaded guilty to smuggling charges.
It is hardly surprising that there is a ready drug market at Lorton. The population has grown to 7,262, from 2,951 prisoners in 1983, before the crack epidemic. About 40 percent of the inmates are there for drug offenses, but 80 percent have a history of drug abuse.
Yet in December, budget cuts forced the District Department of Corrections to suspend drug counseling for about 300 prisoners, although some treatment continues.
With prison populations expanding and budgets shrinking, there are fewer resources available to do much beyond keeping Lorton and other prisons secure and calm. "We recognize the need to provide substance abuse treatment," said Margaret Moore, Washington's Director of Corrections. "We also recognize that our primary responsibility is to that of public safety."
She said drugs are a persistent problem that could be fully stopped only by performing body cavity searches of everyone who entered a prison, including visitors, members of the clergy and the staff. Even if that were practical, she said, it is illegal.
"There is no constitutional way to prevent drugs and other forms of contraband from coming into the institution," she said. "The only way to prevent it is we would have to be prepared to take some measures that would shock the conscience."
Contact visits are commonplace at all but the highest security prisons, where inmates are considered too dangerous for that privilege. Two years ago, federal officials inadvertently created a virtually drug-free prison in Marion, Ill., when they tightened security there following the murders of two officers. Because most inmates are locked in their cells 23 hours a day and separated from visitors by a glass window, Marion, where drug trafficking used to be blatant, is probably the only prison where all inmates routinely test negative for drugs.
At Lorton, screening of applicants for corrections officer has been intensified and other security measures have been taken -- like banning the delivery of pizza and other take-out food to officers on duty -- in an attempt to reduce the incidence of drug and other contraband smuggling.
Ms. Moore, who has worked in corrections for 20 years, was a deputy commissioner of corrections in Pennsylvania before taking the Washington job a year ago. She said she encountered similar drug problems in Pennsylvania's prisons, particularly those near Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. She said that like Lorton, those prisons drew corrections officers and inmates from the same neighborhoods, hindering "professional detachment" and making drug trafficking more likely.
The large number of drug offenders and addicts in prison, she said, reveals a flaw in the nation's criminal justice system. "There is quite frankly an over-reliance on corrections to deal with social ills," Ms. Moore said.
The depth of Lorton's drug problem was underscored in May when Mr. Gaffney, a convicted rapist and kidnapper, was found guilty of running a heroin distribution ring at Lorton that netted at least $250,000 a year and involved both prison employees and inmates.
Federal prosecutors said the heroin flowed through the visiting room and the prison mail room, was "cut" from its pure form and packaged inside the prison and then distributed to inmate customers by a network of runners. Mr. Gaffney ordered beatings and stabbings of inmates he saw as threats and paid his soldiers in drugs to carry out the attacks. The money was smuggled out to Mr. Gaffney's mother, prosecutors said.
The indictment was ammunition for members of the House of Representatives who favor closing Lorton and moving inmates to Federal prisons. "There's literally no rehabilitation there," Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, said. "The place almost should be bulldozed down."
Thomas M. Davis 3d, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House District of Columbia subcommittee, said, "You send this guy to a prison in upstate New York and see if he's able to do this."
 
Contradictions
Evidence And Disavowals
At the Great Meadow state prison in upstate New York, Frederick Matthews was found dead in his cell at 6:30 A.M. last July 26 with a syringe in his right hand, a needle wound in the bend of his left arm and a small glassine bag containing cocaine and heroin on the floor.
"He got himself a hot load and he overdosed," said John Duff, a state police investigator in nearby Glens Falls.
Both a state autopsy and an independent one commissioned by Mr. Matthews's family found cocaine, morphine and codeine in Mr. Matthews's blood and urine -- evidence that he had access to an array of drugs. (Heroin shows up as morphine in the body.) The independent toxicology report, performed by a Long Island laboratory, noted that Mr. Matthews "had the highest concentration of cocaine in urine that has been seen in our laboratories in over 30 years."
Shortly before he died, Mr. Matthews had given corrections officers information on heroin trafficking at the prison, according to Department of Correctional Services documents, and authorities investigated a tip from an inmate that prison dealers killed Mr. Matthews in retaliation by supplying him "with some high-powered raw dope." No charges were filed.
Mr. Matthews's drug problem apparently was longstanding. When he was arrested for the murder of two Brooklyn Heights men in 1973, the police said Mr. Matthews was in a methadone treatment program.
Aleek Jones, who was a friend of Mr. Matthews's in Queens and later in prison, said: "I knew Fred from the street. He definitely had problems. It was something he couldn't cure."
Mr. Jones, who is serving a sentence for murder and robbery, said Mr. Matthews usually injected liquefied cocaine. Mr. Jones said corrections officers once confiscated a bag of potato chips sent to Mr. Matthews containing about a dozen hypodermic needles. Mr. Jones said the bag had been carefully opened, the syringes inserted and the bag glued shut.
Although the death of a prisoner from drug use is rare -- there were six such deaths among New York State prisoners from 1992 through 1994 -- the drug trafficking is common, investigators say.
Mr. Duff, who investigates crimes at Great Meadow, said there is near-constant drug activity there, although prison officials disagree.
"It gets in there all the time," Mr. Duff said. "It gets in there every day. I do 200 cases at the prison a year; probably 50 or 60 are drug cases."
Mr. Duff said an inmate had recently been arrested while swallowing two balloons filled with heroin. "We caught him with one balloon on him and we took him to the hospital to have his stomach pumped to get the other one," he said.
Frequently, Mr. Duff said, prison drug dealers intimidate weaker inmates into arranging for a visitor to smuggle drugs into the prison. "They'll make arrangements with a wife or girlfriend to bring it in," he said. "She'll bring it in because he's under the threat of violence."
Kevin Kortright, an assistant district attorney in Washington County, N.Y., said his office prosecutes all people caught trying to smuggle drugs into the prisons in his county. But when inmates are found with drugs in the prisons, they are rarely prosecuted because they usually do not have large enough quantities to qualify for felony charges of possession with the intent to sell. To prosecute for felony marijuana possession, for instance, an inmate would have to be found with half a pound of the drug -- enough to produce hundreds of marijuana cigarettes -- which almost never happens, he said.
In 1994, the inspector general of the Department of Correctional Services conducted 248 narcotics investigations in prisons statewide, leading to the arrest of 8 employees, 23 visitors and 20 inmates.
Thomas A. Coughlin, who resigned last year after 15 years as the department's commissioner, said in an interview that the amount of drugs in the state's prisons are overstated.
"There are very few drugs in prison," he said. "It's not the management problem people think it is." The state stopped random drug tests of all inmates in the early 1980's because, prison officials said, the positive rate was low.
According to department statistics, 118,709 drug tests were performed on inmates last year and about 5,380 tests, 4.5 percent, were positive. Those tests were performed on work-release inmates, inmates in other programs that allow them to leave prison or those suspected of drug use, but not on the general inmate population.
Rick Kingsley, the president of the corrections officers' union at the Washington Correctional Facility in Comstock, said that in addition to curtailing testing, officers are further hampered in looking for drugs because of the increase in the number of inmates and the decrease in officers. "It's impossible to do a thorough job any more in terms of frisking and looking for drugs," he said.
 
Prison Ethics
Staying Alive In a Harsh World
Drugs are part of the rhythm of life in prison. At Leavenworth, "You can tell when the heroin hits here," Mark Young, the convicted marijuana trafficker, said. "People can't pay their bills," he explained, and "they start checking into protective custody" to avoid attacks from other inmates.
In prison, both the opportunity for drug use and the desire for a narcotic escape are common. Even in maximum-security prisons, inmates spend much of the time from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. out of their cells, moving about the institutions in a controlled flow, participating in educational programs, working at jobs, going to the exercise yards and eating meals.
This increases the chance for interchanges between prisoners and the opportunity for them to duck away for some illegal purpose, like taking drugs. "Facilities are very widespread," said a woman named Loura, who spent four years in New York State prisons for cocaine dealing, and spoke on the condition that only her first name be used. "You walk outside, you smoke."
Visiting policies are fairly lenient. Many prisons allow conjugal visits in trailers or other private settings. Friends or relatives who see inmates in visiting rooms are allowed to stay for several hours in some instances and, in the case of New York State, the visitors are not frisked before entering, nor are corrections officers arriving for work.
On the flip side, the raw ethics of prisons are harrowing. In the world of hardened convicts, forced sex between prisoners is a constant danger, and a common tactic angry inmates use to taunt officers is to throw human feces and urine at them. Clashes between racially divided gangs are sparked by the smallest perceived insult. The violent pursuit of the trappings of jail-house power -- drugs, sex, cigarettes, food, control of televisions and telephones -- is the subtext of prison life.
"Prison is a frightened city," said Mr. Jones, a convicted murder who has been incarcerated since 1974. "If you get a chance to walk through the halls and look in these people's eyes, you'll see fear and fury. You have a situation where guys fight with guys they don't hate and have sex with guys they don't even like. Everything is turned on its head."
New sentencing laws have sent nonviolent drug traffickers to the nation's toughest prisons for terms as long as life. Parole no longer exists in the Federal system and some states are also doing away with it, giving prisoners fewer incentives to abide by prison rules.
"Most of the guys pick up drugs out of boredom," said Mr. Young, whose original life sentence for marijuana dealing was recently reduced to 12 years. "I know a lot of guys who never did heroin until they came in here. They're serving 40 years. They're just about dead."
 
Availability
Quickly Learning Tricks of Trade
At 19, Felix Sarda wound up at the Bare Hill Correctional Facility in Clinton County, N.Y., after spending his teen-age years selling and smoking marijuana and cocaine on the streets of the Bronx. Angry and agitated, Mr. Sarda said he wanted a new twist in his life. What he wanted was freedom, but he went for something more attainable: heroin.
"That was the first time," he said. "It was the only thing I never had tried."
Getting it in prison was easy. He had a friend in the Bronx send $30 to an address in Brooklyn that had been given to him by a dealer he met in prison. When the dealer got word that the money arrived, he delivered the heroin to Mr. Sarda.
"Addicts are smart people when they want to get what they want," he said.
Mr. Sarda is now 20, out of prison and, he said, resolved to make a new start. He said he was working in his father's boiler-repair business, attending prayer sessions and working out in the boxing ring. He swears he is off drugs, but only since he got out of prison.
He first saw drugs in prison when he went to Rikers Island at age 16 on a parole violation. "At first I said, 'How do you get it in here?' " he said. "Then I learned the tricks of the trade."
Mr. Sarda said he learned to prepare for visits by putting Vaseline behind his ears. When a friend passed him a balloon, about the diameter of a quarter, he could then grease it up and insert it into his rectum. In prison, the process is called "slamming."
When he went to Rikers in 1993, he left drugs and money with a friend and then called him from prison. Mr. Sarda said he arranged for his friend to visit him at Rikers along with his mother and aunt. The two men agreed to pass the drugs when they "pounded" each other, or engaged in a two-step handshake of slapping and shaking hands.
Mr. Sarda said he told his friend, "I'm going to hug my mother, hug my aunt and then when I give you that pound, you hit me off." It worked beautifully, he said.
He said when he was transferred to a prison in Franklin County, his sister was his courier. "My sister brought me weed upstate," he said. "She'd hit me off under the table, then I'd go to the bathroom and do my thing."
He learned other tricks of the prison drug business. After smoking marijuana in a cell, blowing a little baby powder into the air will mask the odor. He also learned that the demand for drugs and the balky supply routes pushed the prices up as much as five times the street value.
In the cashless economy of prison, , one thin marijuana joint is worth two packs of cigarettes.
 
Sentencing
Mandatory Terms In Drug Havens
Jeff Stewart was a classic prisoner of the nation's drug war. He was arrested in 1990 at age 35 when Federal agents found marijuana growing on his land near Spokane, Wash. "I was a marijuana grower," he said.
He was also a habitual marijuana smoker. So, between the time he pleaded guilty and his sentencing date, he attended 16 weeks of intensive drug treatment. Drug free and proud of it when he appeared for sentencing, he told his judge in United States District Court, Robert J. McNichols, "Well, your honor, I stand before you a nonsmoker."
Mr. Stewart remembers the judge's response. "He interrupted me and said 'Mr. Stewart, there are drugs where you're going,' " Mr. Stewart recounted recently. He was first imprisoned at Camp Sheridan in Oregon and found the judge was right. "You'd smell marijuana in the dorms down in Sheridan," Mr. Stewart said. "I was surprised to find that people were using heroin and needles in these places."
Mr. Stewart spent much of his 49 months in prison at a minimum-security camp near Spokane. "Marijuana was used in the camps, heroin was used," he said. "LSD was used a lot."
Mr. Stewart said that he stayed away from drugs but that many others didn't, even though there was a random drug-testing program. He said people were able to gauge when they would be tested based on their last test.
At the camps, most of his fellow inmates were nonviolent drug offenders. Many were marijuana growers like himself, Mr. Stewart said. "I used to jokingly tell people I was doing five years for first-degree botany with aggravated horticulture," he said.
Since his release in December, Mr. Stewart has been working for a group based in Washington, D.C., Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which was founded by his sister to fight against minimum mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.
"Given that you have only so much money to go around," Mr. Stewart said, "it makes no sense to spend money on a bunk for me."
That's not a surprising analysis from an ex-convict, but Michael Quinlan, who retired in 1993 as director of the FederalBureau of Prisons, does not entirely disagree.
"The perception I think that's become accepted, because it's popular for vote-getting, is that locking up all these people is going to put a hole in drug usage," he said. "I don't think the evidence will bear that out."
In 1982, Mr. Quinlan said, 25 percent of the 24,000 Federal prisoners were drug offenders. In 1992, there were 80,000 Federal prisoners and 60 percent were drug offenders.
Mr. Quinlan said he does not believe that has caused a significant drug problem in Federal prisons. But at least in some, like the one in Atlanta, where almost all the inmates have a history of drug use, drugs seem to be obtained relatively easily, inmates and investigators say.
"The Atlanta penitentiary has to be the worst," said Edward C. Lopes, who was transferred early this year from Atlanta to Leavenworth. "You can walk into Atlanta today, and I could take you into 10 or 15 cells, and you could get marijuana, cocaine, crack."
Stuart B. Silver, an F.B.I. official in Atlanta, said that when he began investigating drug trafficking at the prison three years ago he was struck by the level of drug activity there. "I guess I was a little surprised," Mr. Silver said. "I would have thought it would be a little more difficult in a penitentiary. I guess it was just my naivete."
A spokesman for the prison, Jody Upton, said he did not think it was any easier to get drugs in Atlanta than anywhere else. But in response to a recent spate of violence at the Atlanta prison -- including, in December, the first on-the-job murder of a Federal corrections officer since 1987 -- Kent Alexander, the United States Attorney in Atlanta, has intensified efforts against drug trafficking and assaults. He said none of the recent assault cases had been proven to be caused directly by the drug trade, but the drug activity and violence in the prison was "just an unfortunate reflection of the street."
Mr. Alexander said an inmate who was recently convicted of assaulting a physician's assistant at the prison told investigators that he had arrived just days before from Leavenworth, where he had a steady supply of heroin. He had yet to establish a connection for obtaining heroin in Atlanta and attacked the assistant with a homemade knife in an attempt to gain access to prescription drugs.
Six Federal indictments have been filed in the last year charging Atlanta prison employees, visitors and inmates with attempts to smuggle drugs.
But the drug-eradication effort does not seem to have filtered through to the entire prison staff in Atlanta. "Who really cares if an inmate uses drugs?" said Dave Wilson, a senior correctional officer there. "Who really cares if an inmate gets his hands on some drugs and uses it? Who really cares? That would be a correctional officer's point of view."
 
Supply and Demand
Pushers Push, Abusers Abuse
At the sprawling Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, investigators found that loose security and an unchecked growth in gangs had allowed drug dealers to continue operating once in prison.
"These drug pushers have found a willing and cooperative clientele within the confines of the prison system of Mississippi due to a lack of a proper drug trafficking control system," said a report issued in February by Steven A. Patterson, the Mississippi State Auditor. "The pushers continue to push, and the abusers continue to abuse. The only difference is that it is now under the auspices of the State of Mississippi."
The investigators found that the prison walls were unusually permeable. "Inspection of both incoming and outgoing visitors is so cursory as to be virtually useless," the report said. "The only inspection made is to open vehicle trunks and simply inquire as to possession of weapons."
Bill Jones, an investigator in the auditor's office, said there were so many drugs flowing into the prison that there was more supply than demand. "There's such a large amount of them coming in that it's not all consumed inside, so some of it is actually being shipped out of the prison, back to the street to be sold," he said.
Don Cabana, a former Parchman warden who is now a professor of criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, said he thought Mr. Patterson's report overstated the problem, but agreed that drug use is a constant in prison. "Parchman's no worse than any other prison," he said, "and better than some."
He said "prison reflects life in the country" both in the use of drugs and the nation's effort to combat them. "The illusion we've fought a war on drugs in this country is just that," Mr. Cabana said, "an illusion, and a very expensive one."

HEADLINE: Uncertainty Pains Oklahoma City Merchants

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY

 BODY:
"Yes, We Are Open," read the plaintive signs at the Phoenix Book Store nailed to sheets of plywood where windows used to be, three blocks from where the bomb destroyed the Federal Building here on April 19.
"The roof got lifted off and set back down, so every time it rains, the ceiling leaks," said Andy Waner, an assistant manager of the store, which sports a huge collection of old dime-store westerns. "Then we have to cover up all the bookcases with tarps, and we get out the Shop-Vac." 
 It may be years or even decades before people in Oklahoma City can say that things have returned to normal. But two months after the bomb went off, killing 168 people in the worst incident of domestic terrorism in the nation's history, the city is trying to get back to work.
The area near the Federal Building was hardly thriving, but the economic damage has been immense, even eclipsing that caused by the World Trade Center bombing in Manhattan in February 1993. Some people are now concerned that the scope of the destruction will jeopardize a long-planned renewal of downtown.
In the several blocks north of downtown that surround the Federal Building, six other structures collapsed and more than 300 were damaged. Struggling merchants and displaced residents wonder just what shape the neighborhood will take in the coming years.
"The truth is that nobody can answer that question right now," said Garner Stoll, the city planner for Oklahoma City. "It's dependent on so many variables. It depends what people decide to do with the insurance proceeds, once they get them. Do they believe in the area and rebuild right there, or do they just move on?"
In the center of downtown, several blocks away and largely physically unaffected, broader questions about fallout from the bomb loom. City officials insist that they will go ahead with the $285 million plan to remake downtown. That plan, financed by a five-year, one-cent increase in the city sales tax approved by voters two years ago, includes a new minor-league baseball park and a sports arena, a San Antonio-style "Riverwalk" through downtown, an expanded convention center and new hotels.
But while the plan and the public money remain in place, Mr. Stoll said there were worries about investor confidence in the private development of stores and hotels.
"I don't know of any city, short of a war experience, that has had a major explosion next to downtown like this," he said. "I don't know what impact it will have on public perception in terms of the whole idea of even coming downtown. We just have no way of judging that."
A state task force, appointed by Gov. Frank Keating and working with KPMG Peat Marwick, recently estimated that the economic impact of the blast on this city of 440,000 was $652 million, topping the $500 million damage estimate for the World Trade Center bombing.
Some will be covered by insurance, and just this week, Governor Keating and a state delegation received pledges of more than $75 million in Federal aid from Congressional leaders. Still, as the Governor observed, "No amount of Federal help, no amount of state help, is going to make this whole."
Some state economists have suggested that the bomb, however perversely, could ultimately have a positive economic impact on the city, revitalizing the ruined area and boosting construction and jobs. The Federal Building site might also become a lure for tourists, like Dealy Plaza in Dallas, the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
But for now, the city is still reeling, and the neighborhood around the building remains all but devastated as merchants struggle to hang on.
"There were quite a few people looking around here up until they got rid of the building, but then it just died," said Dolores Hale, owner of Hale Photo, an 80-year-old photography store on Broadway two and a half blocks from the blast. "It's like there was never anything here."
Mrs. Hale, 65, said she had lost more than half her business, and, she said, the fact that she had no money to replace windows blown out in the bombing had not helped matters. She has plywood in place of glass, as in the Phoenix, but hers is spray-painted with, "Hale Photo Open!" She said she would not be able to replace the glass until she settles with her insurance company, weeks or even months from now.
Mrs. Hale, who said she still felt physically ill whenever she looked in the direction where the Federal Building stood, said she also felt tremendous guilt that one of her employees lost most of his hearing because of the explosion. Mrs. Hale was in Arizona at a bowling tournament with friends on April 19.
At one time, the area around the Federal Building was home to some of the most elegant residences in the city and had many busy stores because streets like Broadway and North Hudson Avenue were the main approaches to downtown.
But as a network of interstate highways sprung up to the south and west, providing new entrances to downtown and hastening the growth of the suburbs, the neighborhood went into decline.
Still, it did have some major employers, including Southwestern Bell. And many of the 600 or so people who worked at the Federal Building ate in neighborhood diners or spent lunch hours browsing in stores like Mrs. Hale's or the Phoenix.
Now, many of those people are dead, and the rest have been transferred to new or temporary offices, some in shopping malls as far as 10 miles away.
A few Federal employees have been returning for lunch to spots like Alan's, a once-popular place where a large sign out front warns passersby: "Alan's Restaurant is not a fast-food restaurant. Cajun is 15 minutes cooking time. Thank you. Management."
"Yup, there are a few real loyal customers," said Doug Ball, the cook. "I guess that after you've done this four, five years, you really get a taste for the food."
But mostly, the neighborhood has the feel of a ghost town, and nobody knows whether it will recover. "The bomb's just devastated a lot of people," said Mr. Waner at the Phoenix, which is run by a nearby private drug-treatment center. "As far as I'm concerned, it's going to last forever."
There are no plans to rebuild the Federal Building. Instead, Federal employees will be moved elsewhere in the city and a memorial will be erected at the site. "Even if people come down here to see the memorial, they're certainly not going to be in a mood to shop," Mrs. Hale said.
The damage is visible throughout the area. At the 24-story Regency Tower, an apartment building a block and a half from the bomb site, plans to allow residents to move back this month have been shelved. The place needs "new windows, new carpets, new drapes, new cabinets, you name it," said Mary Scott, the assistant manager. The new target date for reopening is Sept. 1.
Still, many people in the area have a remarkable ability to plow ahead, and some find positive signs in the disaster -- for one thing, zero reports of looting.
"People adjust," said Leonard Gatewood, owner of Radio Supply Inc., an electronic parts distributor on North Hudson Avenue, two and a half blocks from the bomb site. He has reopened his store, though it still has structural damage to the roof and walls, and he has applied for a low-interest Small Business Administration loan to cover the repairs.
"What are we going to do?" Mr. Gatewood asked. "The world is not going to stop and wait for us. So I think most people are just trying to look to the future rather than dwelling in the past, although the past is still very much there."

HEADLINE: Orange County's Threat to Us All

 BODY:
A great many local governments are going through fiscal crises this year, but only one -- Orange County, California -- has actually filed for bankruptcy. The latest blow to the county came when voters in this very wealthy area rejected a modest sales-tax increase that was essential to averting insolvency. Orange County is not broke, however. It is simply refusing to pay its debts because voters remain in the thrall of their anti-tax ideology. Their arrogance is roiling the bond markets and threatening to raise interest rates for governments everywhere.
 Certainly Orange County voters have a right to be incensed at the failure and incompetence of their leadership over many years. But when the county treasurer, Robert Citron, invested county funds in high-risk derivatives that yielded rich dividends and avoided the need for a tax increase in the county, nobody was complaining very much. 
 When the markets turned around, and Mr. Citron's investments cost the government $1.7 billion, the voters pointed the blame at everyone but themselves. Their decision not to pay up was correctly labeled by Moody's Investors Service as "outrageous."
 In trying to avoid tax increases, Mr. Citron and the county executives in Orange County were living in the spirit of the property-tax revolt that first stirred in the area under the heading of Proposition 13. From the beginning, the tax revolt was based on a philosophy that taxpayers could get services without having to pay for them. But the philosophy spread and finally helped to propel the state's Governor, Ronald Reagan, to the Presidency, with the United States going deeper and deeper into debt.
 Since filing for bankruptcy early this year, Orange County has reduced its work force by 10 percent, cut its discretionary budget by 40 percent and moved to sell buildings, parks and other property, perhaps including the local airport. County officials warn that further austerity could mean closing libraries, reducing law enforcement and cutting arts and physical education programs at schools. The voters still refused to boost the county sales tax from 7.75 percent to 8.25 percent, the level in neighboring Los Angeles County.
 Conservatives are saying the current crisis can transform the county into a laboratory for their anti-government theories. A wealthy place like Orange County might be able to put its faith in privatizing or charging fees for services like garbage collection, schools and public libraries. But such an option may not work for poorer places, or for the less-well-off people in the county itself. The headlong rush to slash government in Orange County thus poses a threat to the very concept of government as a shared enterprise with benefits for all.
 In a corporate bankruptcy, a judge or outside trustee can demand that the company owners meet their debt obligations even at some sacrifice to their equity interests. But in a government bankruptcy, no one holds the equivalent authority to order a tax increase. The bond markets have already demanded huge premiums for Orange County debt, and they could well shut the county out of the markets altogether if the $1 billion in debt coming due in the next few months is simply ignored.
 One person whom one would have expected to show some leadership by now is Gov. Pete Wilson, who has been beseeched by many Californians to ask the Legislature to take over the county's finances, perhaps with a gubernatorially appointed trustee. But Mr. Wilson has consistently looked the other way, apparently in part because he did not want to be associated with a necessary tax increase while running for President. His sputtering campaign is hardly going to be helped by questions about why he did so little about a problem that has penalized local governments around the country.

HEADLINE: The China Problem

 BODY:
China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, was in Moscow last week, urging that Russia and China stand together against alleged American bullying. Twenty-five years after Richard Nixon courted China to help contain the Soviet Union, China is playing its own version of triangular diplomacy to exert leverage on the United States. The gambit was further evidence that relations between Washington and Beijing, once the pride of American diplomacy, are profoundly troubled. It will take a combination of patience and firmness by President Clinton to stabilize the relationship while not sacrificing American interests.
 The United States has a clear interest in maintaining good relations with Beijing. China is a nuclear power, one of the world's fastest-growing economies and home to one-fifth of the world's population. American companies have invested more than $7 billion there since 1979 and export about $9 billion worth of goods to China annually. The United States also imports nearly $40 billion worth of Chinese goods, making China America's sixth-largest trading partner. 
 But managing relations has not been easy. Both President Bush and President Clinton tried hard to accommodate Chinese sensitivities. Instead of responding with greater cooperation, Chinese leaders have turned more truculent. Now they are caught up in political maneuvering to succeed Deng Xiaoping, which seems to be driving all factions toward ideological rigidity and a prickly nationalism.
 Sino-American relations have been deteriorating since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, but tumbled in recent weeks after Washington -- correctly -- let Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, attend a reunion at Cornell, his alma mater. China has withdrawn its ambassador from Washington and withheld approval from America's proposed new envoy to Beijing, Jim Sasser, the former Tennessee Senator. It has conspicuously courted Iran and Iraq.
 American interests with China have changed since Mr. Nixon opened links to Beijing as a cold-war counterweight to Moscow. Today Washington must try to constrain nuclear proliferation and regional conflict, protect American access to one of the world's largest and most dynamic markets and encourage more humane treatment of Chinese citizens, including intellectual dissenters and national and ethnic minorities.
 For years, China has violated its own pledges and international agreements on matters ranging from weapons transfers to prison labor and generally gotten away with it. Washington was content to see China concentrate on economic reform. But the economic renaissance has masked political repression and increasing international belligerence that the United States must protest more vigorously. Beijing recently sent warships to back its claims in the potentially oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, more than 500 miles from China's coast.
 Egregious affronts to human rights, like the latest reimprisonment of the pro-democracy intellectual Chen Ziming and the denial of consular access to a detained United States citizen, Harry Wu, should be met by withholding American gestures China clearly wants, like Cabinet-level visits and a meeting between Mr. Clinton and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin.
 When Secretary of State Christopher meets China's foreign minister at the annual Southeast Asian foreign ministers conference later this month he should be blunt about the dangers posed to regional peace by China's show of force in the Spratly Islands.
 Washington need not respond in kind to every Chinese diplomatic provocation. But excessive concern about Chinese sensitivity can lead to policy paralysis. The transition ahead in Beijing may be bumpy, which is all the more reason Washington's handling of China should be clear and consistent.

Four Elements Tangle In Volatile Lockout Mix

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The National Basketball Association lockout is no garden variety work stoppage. For one thing, the lockout is not canceling games or disrupting training camps because there are no games to be played or training camps to be held. For another, this is not the basic, easy-to-understand management versus labor confrontation sports fans have come to know and detest.
It's the mix of adversaries that takes the N.B.A.'s first work stoppage beyond the experiences of its fellow professional leagues. This unique conflict pits (1) a large group of dissident players against (2) their union leadership and other players against (3) management. 
 The union and the league include a fourth element in the volatile mix: agents. Agents for the dissident players have played a major role in the events of the past two weeks that led to the lockout, which has caused cessation of all basketball operations.
Although the league, in its announcement of the lockout Friday, said nothing about trades, it, too, apparently is a victim of the lockout along with contract negotiations and signings, payments due now on player contracts for the 1995-96 season, player benefits, summer leagues and tryouts.
"It's a lockout," Elgin Baylor, general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, said yesterday when asked about the completion of a trade the Clippers and the Denver Nuggets made on the day of the college draft. "You can't do anything. All basketball operations stop."
That apparently includes talking publicly about trades, too. Asked if the deal had been completed, Baylor said by telephone from his home: "I don't want to get into that. We're not even supposed to discuss basketball. I can't discuss anything."
The prime topic of discussion continued to be the positions of the union and the camp of dissident players.
"I would love to say its players against players because that's what it comes down to," said Charles Smith of the Knicks, a union vice president. "But I'm not going to put the sole onus on the players because their agents are behind them. On the other hand, they're grown men. They can make their own decisions."
When baseball players struck Aug. 12, they staged a pre-emptive strike against the strong possibility that the owners unilaterally would implement a new economic system, a salary cap. When the National Hockey League locked out its players Oct. 1, officials and owners acted because they thought the union was dragging its feet in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement.
In the N.B.A.'s first venture into the land of labor strife, Commissioner David Stern and his club owners thought they had a new six-year agreement, only to have the rebellious players undermine the union's effort to get it ratified.
"As everyone knows," Simon Gourdine, the union's executive director, said, "we negotiated an agreement with the league that contained some provisions that players were not happy with. We think absent the agents' initiative, it would have been normal negotiations. We would have worked hard to get our player reps to ratify it, but the agents' activities and what we considered the high level of misinformation clouded the whole atmosphere and permeated the discussion."
League officials adopted a similar view, putting the league and the union closer to each other than the union and the breakaway players.
That lineup raises the question of what would happen if the league and the union actually negotiate a new agreement. They obviously would treat it as a deal, again pending ratification, but the third (and fourth) party would disagree.
Speaking of the players' and agents' effort to decertify the union, their lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, said, "I hope this action will get the players association to realize that collective bargaining has led to this lockout and the best thing they could do is join us so we have 100 percent of the players supporting decertification."
Gourdine said the union would continue negotiating on behalf of all of the players, but Arn Tellem, one of the agents most prominent in the movement, said, "The union leadership is completely out of touch with the will of the vast majority of the players and I think it's only a matter of time before the remaining players join the decertification move."
Smith, the union officer, lamented the split in the membership.
"I'm not crazy about the tax either," he said, referring to the tax the abandoned agreement would have placed on salaries above the payroll cap. "But we did the best we could. Decertifying and trying to bust us up is disappointing."
Whatever the agents told the players, Smith said, isn't true because "there are no guarantees in this situation."
Nor is there a guarantee that an agreement can be worked out, however it would have to be achieved. "I would like to say it's possible before the season starts," Smith said, "but it looks pretty grim right now."
Also uncertain is the fate of some trades. The expansion Toronto Raptors were prepared to trade B. J. Armstrong to Golden State for Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander, with Armstrong fitting into a salary slot that would have become available yesterday. But there has been no word as to whether or not the trade will be permitted.
Seattle was trading Kendall Gill to Charlotte for Hersey Hawkins and David Wingate, but the deal was contingent on the completion of physicals.

Whitman's Budget Ax Clears a Path for Her

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, likes to say that, by getting elected a year ahead of the Republicans who won last November, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey gave herself a chance to be the pathfinder in her party's trek toward lower taxes and leaner government with more local control in statehouses.
 Last week, Mrs. Whitman showed she knew the way when she rolled over the objections of some of her own party's leaders to enact the second half of her 30 percent income tax cut a year ahead of schedule. The legislature, which is in Republican hands, also passed her $16 billion budget for the coming year, including a plan to put dozens of state operations in the hands of private contractors, at the cost of 2,900 public jobs.
 The Governor's easy budget victory did nothing to diminish her reputation as a contender for the national ticket next year. Even complaints from statehouse Democrats that she is starving the state of services to fatten her own national reputation have failed to dampen New Jerseyans' affection for her.
 But Mrs. Whitman must wonder if her national destiny will find her before the weaknesses in her budget do. Her tax cut needs a strong economy and the indicators are faltering. And even Republicans fear that her cuts may only raise property taxes. But by then she could be in Washington. IVER PETERSON

Mr. Major needs the backing of 165 of the 329 Tory M.P.'s and a margin of 50 votes over Redwood to win outright.
 
The Fourth of July holiday. All markets, banks and government offices are closed.
 
Wednesday
 
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets today and Thursday. Analysts say recent strong reports on durable goods, initial jobless claims and new home sales make it unlikely the Fed will lower interest rates.
 
Thursday
 
The Commerce Department releases leading economic indicators for May. Forecast: down 0.2 percent. The index has not risen since December and, after remaining unchanged in January, has fallen every month since. In the past, three straight declines have often signaled a recession.
 
The Commerce Department also reports May housing completions. They fell 7 percent in May, but rose 10.5 percent in March.
 
Friday
 
The Labor Department releases unemployment figures for June. Forecast: the jobless rate is expected to inch up to 5.8 percent, from 5.7 percent in April. But it is estimated the economy will have added 95,000 nonfarm jobs, after losing 101,000 in May. Few analysts think the report will influence a Fed move on interest rates.

HEADLINE: Banking Law Keeps an Industry Down

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Bigger Banks, Bigger Problems" (Op-Ed, June 28): John W. Moscow, in his defense of the Glass-Steagall Act, cites the precarious state of Japanese banks as evidence that the United States regulatory framework is superior. 
 However, Japan is the only other major economy to have a Glass-Steagall-like separation of commercial and investment banking.
 Thus the Japanese example shows that such a separation fails to protect commercial banks from massive credit problems.
 Mr. Moscow also cites recent losses at Germany's largest bank. Despite these losses Deutsche Bank has a perfect credit rating from Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies, a record unmatched by any bank in the United States.
 Indeed, the only United States bank to come close is J. P. Morgan, which has, despite Glass-Steagall, successfully combined commercial banking with many traditional investment bank activities.
 It is illustrative to look at countries that have eliminated artificial restrictions on commercial banks entering investment banking.
 Several of Canada's investment dealers were weakened by the stock market crash of 1987. Rather than failing or requiring a public bailout, they were saved by commercial banks that acquired and recapitalized them. This was possible because Canada repealed its equivalent of Glass-Steagall several years earlier.
 In Britain, it was Barings, one of the few remaining independent merchant banks, that allowed a rogue trader to bankrupt the institution. None of London's clearing banks have had such a problem.
 The historic distinctions among financial institutions are fading.
 Commercial banks have followed corporate customers into capital markets. Investment banks undertake credit risk to offer custom financial contacts. Retail banks sell mutual funds because customers request them.
 If the regulators cannot understand these multiproduct combinations, they must learn to do so. To hold financial institutions to the level of their regulators' ignorance will result in weaker institutions, poorer customer service and a less competitive United States financial services industry.

HEADLINE: What Ford Discovered When He Paid His Workers $5 a Day

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Bad News for Workers" (editorial, June 24) will also prove to be bad news for capital owners. 
 In today's pressure for higher productivity and improved international competitiveness, reducing the number of employees and their wages has become a widespread and socially acceptable practice. As a result, demand drops, inventories build up, cutbacks increase, and we head into the classic spiral toward depression.
While the effects can be staved off temporarily by emphasizing overseas developing markets, domestic personal spending still accounts for two-thirds of our economy. It is not possible to take money out of the pockets of consumers without noticing the effect at the cash register.
 Today's managers have apparently forgotten the lesson taught by Henry Ford, dean of American capitalism. He discovered that by paying his auto workers the princely sum of $5 a day (to the dismay of the rest of the industry), it became possible for them to buy Ford cars. High wages, in the end, produce high profits.
 It should be kept in mind that the recession that cost George Bush his office was due to falling demand. This resulted from the fact that wages of American workers had been falling during most of the Reagan-Bush years.
 Jobs today are harder to get, easier to lose, have lower security and pay less than they did 20 years ago. None of the dramatic productivity gains of this period have gone to workers.
 Aside from the purely economic consequences, this represents a repudiation of the American social contract. This unwritten contract has generally resulted in a steadily increasing standard of living and an aura of optimism that has gone far to promote domestic tranquillity.
 As money tightens at every level of government and at many nongovernment organizations such as schools, hospitals and social-service agencies, we are seeing that tranquillity, much valued by our Founding Fathers, disappear as we fight over the remaining funds.
 This problem cannot and will not be solved by the free market. On the contrary, it has been produced by a form of free market in which each enterprise takes actions that produce the highest profits in the short term. Since that is what managers are now paid to do, we ought not to be surprised at the results. If we want some other result, we shall have to open our eyes to other possibilities.

HEADLINE: County Debating Hospital's Status

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT the country, public hospitals are falter ing unable to keep pace with the changes around them.
In Los Angeles, a proposal is under consideration to close the Los Angeles County-University of California Medical Center -- one of the largest hospitals in the nation -- because it is facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion. In Nassau County, a committee appointed to question whether government should be in the business of health care is studying privatization of the financially strapped County Medical Center there. And in Washington, budget cuts have forced the District of Columbia to consider changing the form of governance at its public hospital. 
 Hawaii, too, is wrestling with the issue of public versus private health care for its statewide hospital system. In Denver, the city has developed a plan to convert its general hospital to a public authority. And although there is a quasi-independent authority overseeing New York City's 11 public hospitals, plans are under consideration to sell 3 of them.
Now Westchester has come forward with a plan to convert the County Medical Center here to a public-benefit corporation -- a move designed to make the hospital more cost efficient and more competitive with other large hospitals in the New York metropolitan area.
Across the country, the quickly changing medical scene is placing new demands on all hospitals and other health-care institutions -- but especially those that are publicly owned -- to downsize in order to compete more efficiently.
State cuts in Medicaid, Federal cuts in Medicare, excess capacity at many hospitals and the new demands of managed care are only some of the forces affecting a change in the way medical services will be delivered in the coming years, experts in the field say.
"Hospitals that can't change with the times run the risk of becoming dinosaurs," said Arthur E. Weintraub, president of the Northern Metropolitan Hospitals Association, which represents 40 hospitals.
In a controversial move on June 19, the Westchester County Board of Legislators unanimously voted to change the 600-bed hospital, which includes a burn center, neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units and a cardiac center for pediatric and adult open-heart surgery, from a county-run hospital to a public-benefit corporation, which could form independent business alliances and other agreements and rely less on taxpayer dollars.
The county hopes to make what Legislators are calling "a pre-emptive strike," before the Medical Center, which is also the only tertiary-care trauma center in a seven-county region, suffers irreversible financial setbacks.
"In a sense, Westchester has recognized the need for radical surgery, and they are to be saluted," said Anne B. Camper, corporation counsel to the National Association of Public Hospitals and a consultant to Westchester's Board of Legislators.
She explained that even though it was very costly for most city and county governments, they often remained in the health-care business to insure a safety net for many of their poorer citizens.
The Westchester County Medical Center has a long tradition of caring for the indigent. It opened in 1916 as a small, red-brick almshouse, and it initially treated victims of tuberculosis and polio. By 1977 it had become the County Medical Center, with the dual mission of treating Westchester's poor and offering the latest in sophisticated medical care to seven counties north of New York City.
In recent years, the Medical Center, constrained by its status as a government-owned institution, has been unable to fight back as New York City hospitals -- among them New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Mount Sinai, Beth Israel and Columbia-Presbyterian -- reached into the suburbs for more patients.
The larger city-based hospitals forged alliances with local health care institutions and set up elaborate referral systems to attract patients who otherwise might have sought treatment in Westchester.
Most recently, Montefiore Medical Center, the university hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, signed an affiliation agreement with the Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry.
"We need to be able to function with the same kind of flexibility that other hospitals have, whether it's to order equipment or to do business," said Dr. Samuel S. Kasoff, chairman of the department of neurology at the Medical Center here. "We need to level the playing field with other tertiary-care teaching hospitals."
Dr. Kasoff said he and his colleagues welcomed news of the Board of Legislators' proposal to change the form of governance at the Medical Center, a teaching hospital allied with New York Medical College.
County Legislator Suzanne R. Swanson, chairwoman of the Board's Committee on Health and the Medical Center, said the proposal to convert the hospital to a public-benefit corporation would allow it to enter joint ventures and other business arrangements for profit -- activities prohibited under its current status.
A statement by the Committee on Health and the Medical Center said that the Board of Legislators had recognized the hospital's "need for more flexibility to cope with a rapidly changing, more competitive health care environment and at the same time reduce the ever-increasing burden on the taxpayers."
About $24 million in taxpayer subsidies was allocated this year toward the Medical Center's annual $367 million budget.
It was expected that with decreases in state and Federal financing for Medicaid and Medicare, the taxpayer subsidy would have to go up, unless the hospital found new ways to generate income.
"This is an idea whose time has come," said Steven A. Galef, chairman of the hospital's 12-member Board of Advisers, which would become a board of directors with decision-making powers under the new plan. "It's as if General Motors split off Chevrolet into a totally independent company."
Westchester's Hospitals Commissioner, Edward A. Stolzenberg, said it was important that the proposal move ahead quickly.
"Time is of the essence," he said, explaining that the conversion would permit the hospital to generate independent sources of income. "It would be fatal to the hospital if it had to rely only on tax dollars."
Commissioner Stolzenberg cited the Los Angeles County-University of California Medical Center, the Nassau County Medical Center and the Health and Hospitals Corporation in New York City as examples of health-care systems that were not adapting to the changes around them. "You have to be able to respond quickly," he said, "or else go out of business."
But not everyone embraced the legislators' proposal to make the County Medical Center more independent. At first, the County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, called the Board of Legislators' plan "a public relations ploy" to get votes in an election year. He has since moderated his position.
Last week, Claire Palermo Flower, a spokeswoman for Mr. O'Rourke, said that the County Executive would work closely with the Legislators to forge the new governance package, which must be approved by the State Legislature. "Mr. O'Rourke's concern is that whatever form the hospital takes, it must maintain the same philosophy of taking care of those who cannot get care elsewhere," she said.
She also said that Mr. O'Rourke wanted to make sure that the county would maintain its AAA bond rating separate from the hospital, once the Medical Center is independent.
Herman S. Geist, the County Executive's liaison to Mr. Galef, the hospital's board chairman, said he had "a lot of buts" when it came to the Legislators' proposal.
"It sounds good on paper, but there aren't enough specifics," said Mr. Geist, a former Legislator and the Board's first chairman, in the early 1970's. "The language is too vague. For example, what do they mean when they say 'maximize the economic viability of the hospital?' "
"And what happens if the hospital goes bankrupt?" he asked. "Does the county then have the moral and legal obligation to step in and rescue it?"
Mr. Galef said the county would not have a legal obligation to step in, although it might choose to.
Under the proposal, the county would lease the buildings on the 600-acre Medical Center campus -- which includes the hospital, the Ruth Taylor Geriatric and Rehabilitation Institute, the Westchester Institute for Human Development and the Psychiatric Institute -- to the newly created public-benefit corporation.
The county would maintain a service agreement with the public-benefit corporation for provision of health care services financed by the county. For the first fiscal year after transfer of the Medical Center to the corporation, the county would support the Medical Center at its current level of financing. In subsequent years, the county would identify those services it wishes to insure for residents -- like trauma care, prisoner care -- and pay for only those.
The public-benefit corporation's board would have 15 voting members and 3 nonvoting members. All board appointments would be subject to approval by the County Executive and the County Board of Legislators.

HEADLINE: Ardsley Country Club Marks 100th Year

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
THE more things change, the more they remain the same. That could be the motto of the Ardsley Country Club, which began centennial celebrations on June 10 and 11.
The membership plays tennis and golf, swims and attends social events much as it always has at this impeccably manicured site overlooking the Hudson. 
 Founded in August 1895 to cater to industrialists, the club counts among its original members Amzi Barber, who bought the land in 1895; William and John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Some of them sailed up the river from Manhattan and docked their yachts in slips at the club.
"This club was proof that the two groups of society -- the robber barons and old New York -- would blend," said Kate Buford, a member of the club, a commentator for National Public Radio and author of "From Hudson to Hilltop: The First 100 Years of the Ardsley Country Club."
"The sports of tennis and golf were brand new here, and the idea that men and women would go outdoors to exercise was revolutionary. This club was created to enable people to enjoy these sports in a congenial setting.
"It was a place for active golfers and tennis players right from the beginning. What distinguishes this club was that it was the most complete club of the time. Some clubs were no more than nine holes and an apple orchard. Ardsley offered a massive, hotel-like clubhouse and spectacular golf course. It was a symbol of the gilded age. The entire package was supposed to knock people's socks off."
While the life style may have been celebrated -- and scorned -- by 20th-century writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, the country club model of tennis parties, golf dates and club dinners was not the creation of the 1950's or even the 1920's.
In fact, the development of Westchester County as a suburban retreat was linked to the creation of country clubs. Contemporaries of the Ardsley Country Club include Knollwood in Elmsford, which is a year older, and Bonnie Briar in Larchmont.
"The country club movement has been central to the development of Westchester," said Dr. Roger Panetta, professor of history at Marymount College in Tarrytown. "It was used by real-estate developers to attract people to Westchester. These were near railroads, which was their attractiveness; that middle landscape is very important.
"By the 1890's, the whole notion of recreation and physical activity was important. Country clubs are a logical development of the notion of conspicuous consumption, of having affluence and leisure time for these pursuits."
The robber barons and other contemporary "masters of the universe" who founded the Ardsley Country Club a century ago arranged it so that their private train station at Ardsley-on-Hudson (now Metro-North property) would be designed to match the original neo-Elizabethan clubhouse (now the cooperative known as Hudson House).
In his book "American Architecture: Westchester County, N.Y." (North River Press, 1977), Frank E. Sanchis observed that the Ardsley Country Club was "one of the grandest country clubs ever built."
Mr. Barber, who had the idea for the Ardsley Country Club, was one of the county's earliest real-estate developers.
"He had an unusual conception," Ms. Buford said. "He assumed that the homes he developed in Ardsley Park would be bought by members of the country club."
This sense of symbiotic interchange between the residents of the surrounding community and the club helped create a cozy, if undeniably exclusionary, enclave.
"During the club's middle period from 1935 to 1965, it was very local," Ms. Buford said. "The club intentionally identified with Ardsley Park, and it was very family oriented. Families would join together and have a compound. People had wonderful times."
Mrs. Peggy Stover, who has been a member of the club since 1931, recalled:
"It was not a fancy or elaborate club. It was a family club. Children enjoyed the pool and played tennis and learned golf. It was nice to have something so pleasant nearby."
While the club had some difficulties during the 1960's and 70's, when the conservative traditions that country clubs symbolized fell out of favor, it has adapted to the times.
There are currently 450 member families, and the club prides itself on its ethnic diversity. The economics of club membership, however, act as a different barrier. "An active member after initiation can expect to pay at least $7,000 in annual dues and assessments," said Harvey Appelle, president of the Ardsley Country Club.
And Steven Arias, the club manager, said: "While the average age for our members is probably in the late 50's, we probably have a younger membership than most clubs because of our good youth program and junior membership program. It has been improved significantly in the last few years."
For Joseph A. Valvano, a younger member who, with his wife, Therese, and two school-age children, belongs to the club, the appeal is its recreational opportunities and family-friendly atmosphere.
"Children become a big part of the club," said Mr. Valvano, a realtor in Dobbs Ferry and a member of the Ardsley Country Club's executive committee. "My kids don't want to go to sleep-away camp. They prefer the Ardsley Club. It's the kind of club where you become comfortable immediately. The club really tends to be a microcosm of the community that surrounds the club."
Several of the members are professional musicians, and they often offer classical recitals. "The members just come, stay for dinner, and get to talk with the musicians," said Ruth Negri Armato, a member and harpist with the New York Philharmonic. "It's very unusual for a club to have this."
The club's longevity is regarded by members as a testament to the club's ability to adapt.
"We've become much more of a multiplicities of peoples, which was not the case years ago," Mr. Appelle said.
"The club started as a suburban club for New York City swells, but starting in the 1930's, it became a neighborhood club.
"It's an attractive place for upscale younger people. Most people who join here make it the focus of their recreational activities."

On Race, It's Thomas v. an Old Ideal

BYLINE: By DAVID J. GARROW; David J. Garrow is the author of "Liberty and Sexuality: The Right to Privacy and the Making of Roe v. Wade" and received a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for "Bearing the Cross," a biography of Martin Luther King Jr.

 BODY:
Of the Supreme Court's paramount decisions this century, one stands out as virtually a sacred American text. It is Brown v. Board of Education, which annihilated the moral and legal justification for segregation with the ringing phrase, "Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."
 Now, 41 years later, a Justice of the Supreme Court has voiced misgivings about that central insight of Brown. That would be remarkable enough, given the decision's stature. Even more remarkable, that Justice is Clarence Thomas, the Court's second black member. And in one more surprise, the critique of Brown by the Court's most conservative Justice owes much, whether knowingly or not, to a line of anti-Brown scholarship with respectable intellectual roots in the political left. 
 Justice Thomas's critique of Brown was one of the many surprising developments of the Court term that ended last week, and was part of his full-throated emergence as a distinctive and articulate judicial voice. It is a voice that is scornful, sometimes indignant, coherent though not, so far, visibly persuasive to most of his colleagues. It is a voice for a formal, even rigid approach to constitutional interpretation, a rejection of the idea that modern influences might cast a new light on the intentions of the framers.
 The criticisms of Brown offered by Justice Thomas last month, in a Kansas City school desegregation case, Missouri v. Jenkins, go directly to the heart of the integrationist ideal articulated by the Court in 1954.
 In Brown, Chief Justice Earl Warren, speaking for a unanimous Court, emphasized that reconsideration of the previously sanctioned doctrine of "separate but equal" segregation required the Court to examine not only legal principles but also "the effect of segregation itself on public education."
 To do this, the Court relied heavily on social science testimony that showed, as the lower court put it, that "segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children."
 "The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law," the court went on, "for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to retard the educational and mental development of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system."
 Three years later, Chief Justice Warren quoted that finding in full -- and added that it was "amply supported by modern authority" -- in articulating the Supreme Court's constitutional conclusion that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."
 Although Brown's mandate excited considerable segregationist opposition during the 1950's and 1960's, the decision itself was considered virtually unassailable. Yet by the mid-1980's more and more black voices began to question whether Brown's integrationist emphasis was really in black America's best interest.
 Almost from the start, Brown's reliance on social science conclusions concerning educational effects had drawn sharp professional criticism even from the decision's supporters, for, as one commentator recently explained, "something that is 'inherently unequal' is not so because of empirical data, but because of its very nature, known through pure reason."
 But the newly emerging black unhappiness with Brown goes deeper. In a 1987 book titled "Plural But Equal," Harold Cruse, a black intellectual, complained that Brown had wrongly presumed "that separateness is inherently to mean inferiority."
 "Intrinsically," Mr. Cruse wrote, "it means no such thing. Legally imposed segregation was what rendered separateness implicitly inferior. Remove the legal sanctions of imposed segregation, and separateness has the potential of achieving equality in its own right."

 
 
Black Skepticism
 Mr. Cruse's blunt comments were a harbinger of a growing black skepticism about Brown's integrationist underpinnings. Six years later, in 1993, a University of Virginia law professor, Alex M. Johnson Jr., writing in the California Law Review, declared that "Brown was a mistake" and that integrationism "has failed our society."
 Voicing a preference for "the 'voluntary' integration that occurs when individuals are given the choice whether and when to integrate," Professor Johnson accurately noted that Brown had been "premised on the notion that we are but one community, geographically separated in major urban areas but culturally prepared to merge." Rejecting that premise, Professor Johnson asserted, "Brown failed because it did not acknowledge the prior development of a unique African-American community with its own cultures, languages, religions and territories."
 While the critiques by Mr. Cruse and Professor Johnson represent black nationalist views that most Americans would associate with the left end of the ideological spectrum, they are strikingly similar to the contrarian view of Brown expressed by Justice Thomas in his concurring opinion in Missouri v. Jenkins.
 Mr. Cruse concluded "Plural But Equal" by observing, "The only hope left for the political, economic and cultural survival of blacks into the next century is self-organization." In Jenkins, Justice Thomas, writing from an ostensibly antithetical ideological pole, emphasized how "black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success and achievement."
 It is here, too, that Justice Thomas departs from the usually dispassionate voice that he exhibited in the last term, that of the advocate of pure legal principles. "It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior," he wrote, joining four of his conservative colleagues to void a magnet school program that a lower court judge had instituted in order to attract white students back to Kansas City's public schools.
 Justice Thomas angrily said the lower court appeared to have been less interested in providing the best possible education for black students than in stimulating racial integration. The lower court's decision, he wrote, "appears to rest upon the idea that any school that is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites." The district court's "willingness to adopt such stereotypes stemmed from a misreading" of Brown, he said, adding, "the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development . . . not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority."
 Segregation, he stressed, "was not unconstitutional because it might have caused psychological feelings of inferiority."
 The most forceful passage in Justice Thomas's concurrence analyzes the courts' post-1954 experience with segregation so concisely and memorably that it is likely to be quoted for decades to come.

 
 
Jurisprudence of Inferiority
 "Mere de facto segregation (unaccompanied by discriminatory inequalities in educational resources) does not constitute a continuing harm after the end of de jure segregation," he wrote. " 'Racial isolation' itself is not a harm; only state-enforced segregation is. After all, if separation itself is a harm, and if integration therefore is the only way that blacks can receive a proper education, then there must be something inferior about blacks. Under this theory, segregation injures blacks because blacks, when left on their own, cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that conclusion is the result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of black inferiority."
 Justice Thomas's proffered contribution to America's conversation about race reaches well beyond a judicial critique of Brown, for Justice Thomas, by bridging an old ideological chasm, is asking Americans to rethink basic presumptions about race. If Americans really do believe in fundamental racial equality, he says, then "there is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment."

HEADLINE: Trouble Down on the Farm

BYLINE: By Richard Panek; Richard Panek is author of "Waterloo Diamonds: A Midwestern Town and its Minor League Team."

 BODY:
Where have all the baseball fans gone? Apparently fed up because of the strike and the economic and legal machinations in the major leagues, many are abandoning big league ballparks this season, driving down attendance more than 20 percent and taking their discretionary income elsewhere.
 Disenchantment, however, hasn't spread to the minors. "Baseball the way it used to be" is how fans and pundits commonly characterize minor league baseball. Cheap seats, closeness to the playing field, the hustle of young athletes -- the traditional virtues of minor league baseball are still evident. While fans stay away from the big leagues, attendance in the minors is holding steady, the latest sign of strength in a 15-year resurgence in popularity. 
 Yet even while their appeal is stronger than ever, the farm teams, beset by increased economic pressures, face a troubling future. In fact, minor league franchises have never been more prosperous, but the very nature of the experience is what's changing.
 My own interest in the minors dates to the major league players' strike of 1981. Frustrated by the locked doors at Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago, some friends and I set out for a small ballpark in Davenport, Iowa. What we found one mild Saturday evening were $1 tickets, wooden stands that rose maybe a dozen yards from the field and players who possessed considerable skill. During the National Anthem (the crowd actually sang), a freight train rumbled by, sending a whistle up into the night.
 This wasn't just the next best thing to the major leagues: it was something else altogether. Out of such settings must have arisen the enduring romance of baseball: innocence by association.
 In the old days, before about the late 1970's, minor league baseball was still a dormant corner of mom-and-pop Americana. The major leagues insure the survival of their talent pipeline by providing the players, equipment and some economic support. The local municipality usually provided the ballpark, but the day-to-day operation of a franchise often fell to a group of local fans who ran the ball club virtually as a community service, glad to more or less break even.
 By the early 1980's, people had begun rediscovering the charm of the minors -- and not just fans but also investors. The opportunities were out there, and in those days franchises could be bought for next to nothing. Furthermore, thanks to subsidies from the majors and free use of a municipal stadium, small-time owners could actually make a profit.
 The land rush was on. The sudden demand for minor league clubs drove up the prices of franchises, which created a need for higher profits, which required more sophisticated marketing techniques, which prompted moves to larger and potentially more lucrative markets, which drove up prices again.
 Since 1980, attendance in the minors has climbed to 33 million from about half that, and the market for minor league ball clubs has yielded one bonanza after another. The Durham Bulls of the Carolina League, the club that lent its name to the movie that enhanced the mystique of the minors, was bought in 1979 for $2,400 and sold in 1991 for a reported $4 million.
 In 1990, the pressures increased when the majors and the minors -- separate organizations in pro ball, though historically interdependent -- renegotiated the contract between them. The new contract immediately ended a number of subsidies from the majors and established new, more stringent standards that each ballpark would have to meet, effective April 1 of this year.
 No statistics are available on how many cities have lost their ball clubs under these pressures, but an informal count quickly climbs into the dozens. The losers tend to be smaller, older, often blue-collar communities where factories have downsized or closed and where the choice for taxpayers and city councils has eventually come down to adequate police protection or a better ballpark.
 The point isn't simply that the minors are now as much a business as the majors. Professional baseball has always been a business first -- and a vigorously parochial one, at that. ("They've done something to add to the glory of our city," a civic booster wrote of his 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the club whose barnstorming tour marked the transition from baseball's amateur to pro eras.)
 Increasingly, though, the minors have rewarded the haves and punished the have-nots. In recent years, numerous prosperous cities have added a minor league team as one more civic attraction, while struggling cities have lost one of their remaining points of pride.
 There aren't many promising ways to reverse this trend, but some states are trying to help. In New York, the Legislature has included money in a tight budget to build or renovate several minor league ballparks. Thus, Rochester, where pro ball has been played for 89 seasons since 1900, will be able to keep its minor league club, since its substandard stadium can now be replaced by a new one.
 Minor league baseball isn't more important than police protection, but it's worth something. Even in austere times, government may have to do what private enterprise cannot or will not do -- unless we want to see the minors go the way of the majors.

HEADLINE: Meet Me at the Fair

BYLINE: By David Nasaw; David Nasaw, chairman of the history program at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is working on a biography of William Randolph Hearst.

 BODY:

1939
The Lost World of the Fair.
By David Gelernter.
Illustrated. 418 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $23. 
DAVID GELERNTER, the author of "1939: The Lost World of the Fair," is a professor of computer science at Yale University (he is also the survivor of a June 1993 attack by the so-called Unabomber that left him with a badly damaged right hand and a lacerated, partly blinded right eye). Though he tells us, in a prefatory author's note, that "1939" is a "history book," it is both more and less than that. A good deal of this story of the New York World's Fair is told through fictional interviews and the invented diary of an elderly woman who, as a young girl in 1939, fell in love and was courted at the fair.
For Mr. Gelernter, the fair incarnated the spirit of the "high 30's." Its malls and rotundas, its theme buildings, commercial exhibits, outdoor sculptures and guidebooks celebrated the future that would soon be realized through the joyous marriage of technology and art. Its heroes -- and the heroes of Mr. Gelernter's book -- were Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Moses, men who embodied the master-building, authoritative, get-it-done ethos whose disappearance the author mourns.
Mr. Gelernter re-creates for us an Edenic past that he sets against our fallen present with an ironic twist all his own. "There is near-universal agreement," he reports without footnote or elaboration, "that ever since 1970 or so, we have been economically and spiritually adrift." We have lost a sense of purpose and optimism even though, he argues, we have in fact entered the utopia prefigured for us a half-century ago at the World's Fair. "In 1939," Mr. Gelernter says, "Americans yearned for suburbia." The fair's representation of "Democracity's utopian World of Tomorrow" amounted, "in essence, to the modern suburbs." Today we live in that suburban paradise, but we have lost our belief in a better future.
Mr. Gelernter points out that hunger remained a painful reality in the Depression year of 1939 and that Hitler and Mussolini were poised to take over Europe. Nonetheless, Americans were hopeful about the world their children would inhabit. Why, he wants to know, was their perspective on the future so different from ours? Why have the utopian visions of 1939 been replaced by the dystopian images that clutter today's cultural landscape?
The answers, for Mr. Gelernter, are connected to our abandonment of "the American religion, the 'civic religion' which has always been characteristic of this country." In the late 1930's, he says, Americans everywhere believed in the "American way of life" and accepted the obligations it entailed. They honored and obeyed authority and "lived in an 'ought' culture" (as compared with our "want" culture) with rules, rituals and conventions that regulated every aspect of daily life: dress, speech, personal relationships, public behavior and sexual practices. They were more literate, softer spoken, less scatological, more religious, more polite, more chaste, less likely to divorce and better dressed than today (the men at the fair wore ties and jackets; the women wore dresses).
WE have read stories of decline and fall like this one many times before. What is missing from Mr. Gelernter's version is any element of surprise. Once we know where he is taking us -- and he clearly sets out his purposes in the introductory chapters -- we have less and less reason to follow him. The problem with "1939" is not the author's unorthodox mixing of factual and fictional discourses. Historians like Simon Schama and John Demos have also experimented with fictional representations in their histories. This book is problematic because neither its subject nor its story is particularly new or, I am sorry to say, particularly interesting. Regrettably, in a book that fuses fact and fiction, Mr. Gelernter's characters never come to life. Too often he uses them only to repeat what he has already told us in his own voice.
There are also problems with his history. While he is quick to attack others for their interpretations, he never provides readers, or at least this reader, with sufficient evidence to support his own. In the section of his book on the "ought" culture of the 30's, for example, he relies on Emily Post as the "principal source" for his "intelligences," almost daring professional historians to criticize him. His editor has not helped him by providing an endnote apparatus that is impossibly confusing. Mr. Gelernter does give us a hearty glimpse of the fair's architecture and New York City in 1939. In the end, however, that is not enough to sustain our interest in his 400-page tour of a corner of our past.

HEADLINE: Cyprus Respects Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Cyprus Shores Wash Dirty Money" (news article, June 15): 
 The Republic of Cyprus, although small and partly under illegal foreign occupation, is proud of its record as a law-abiding and international-law-minded state.
Cyprus, at substantial political and economic cost, is second to none in strictly applying Security Council resolutions on sanctions -- the more so since we expect other states to implement the United Nations resolutions applicable to our own longstanding problem. Cyprus has a free-market economy, encourages tourism and is a center for offshore banking. There are strict rules regulating offshore banking activities, administered by the Central Bank.
Cyprus is a small country with limited investigatory and enforcement means. To those who raise the issue of violation of sanctions or of money laundering, the answer has been clear: "We do our best to apply the law and we believe we do so effectively. But if you have evidence in specific cases showing otherwise, let us know, and we shall put it right."

Buying American Goods, Through the Japanese Mail
If the recent Japanese-American trade dispute gives the impression that American goods are being held at bay in Japan, consider the near-doubling in the last year of one segment of American exports.
A growing revolt by Japanese consumers is fighting high prices with an American retailing custom: mail-order shopping. Clothing, camping gear and cosmetics are arriving in record quantity. [Page 1.]
 
A Grimmer Reality on the Job
The economy may be starting to sputter. The latest stretch of growth shows, though, that except for professionals, executives and the most skilled industrial, construction and computer workers, many problems employees faced only in bad times have become fixtures in all times: some wages are still falling; people must be ready to work 12-hour shifts and 6-day weeks, and no job is for keeps. [1.]
 
Satellite TV Dispute in Canada
Fifty thousand Canadians who can't do without small-dish satellite TV have sparked a war between telecommunications titans over who will provide the service. The fray has drawn members of the Government opposition charging the Prime Minister with nepotism, a regulatory agency complaining that its authority is being undermined and consumer groups protecting their interests. [39.]
 
Tug-of-War Over Food Safety
Congress is to consider legislation that would sharply change rules on food safety. Scattered through several bills, the changes would lessen the burden on business to prove food is safe, increase it on agencies to prove that proposed rules are worth the cost and expand the industry's opportunity to appeal. [1.]
 
S.E.C. Said to Investigate Firm
S.E.C. regulators are to visit the office of First Capital Strategists today to investigate the firm's loss of $128 million of college endowments, people familiar with the situation said. [38.]
 
Underwriting Profits Keep Rising
The pace of Wall Street's bedrock business, underwriting the sale of stocks and bonds, continued to improve in the second quarter, according to the Securities Data Corporation. At $189.9 billion, underwriting volume was up 36.7 percent from the first quarter. [38.]
Among winning and losing stocks in the second quarter, Continental Airlines, not too far removed from bankruptcy court, was the New York Stock Exchange's biggest gainer. [40.]
 
As the Web Grows, So Grow Its Fans
A consumer researcher believes that the World Wide Web's on-line marketplace is expanding the Internet's audience. For on-line users, the researcher said, "It's the end of geekdom." Steve Lohr: On the Net. [39.]
On World's TV, Life's a Beach
America's most pervasive cultural export is a TV show that was canceled after one season on NBC, has never earned an award or any critical respect. But "Baywatch," which stars David Hasselhoff and is nominally about the adventures of California lifeguards, has a wider audience on the planet than any other entertainment show ever. Bill Carter: Television. [41.]
 
For Cartoonists, a Fading Glory
Editorial cartoonists say they are incisive social analysts whose wit can change the course of current events. But they fear they are becoming the buggy-whip makers of American journalism, accessorizers to a business -- newspapers -- that is the industry's horse-drawn carriage. [41.]

HEADLINE: QUALITY IS FOCUS FOR HEALTH PLANS

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
At a meeting quietly convened at a mountain house in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, representatives of some of the largest employers and purchasers of health insurance agreed last week to pursue a fundamental shift in emphasis in the nation's managed health-care systems: They want the primary focus to be placed on measuring the quality of care now that costs have begun to be controlled.
The broad-based agreement was reached at Jackson Hole last week by 30 officials of Federal, state and local public employees organizations, consumer groups and officials of such major employers as American Express, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the Ameritech Corporation and Pepsico, which together represent an estimated 80 million consumers of health insurance. 
 "Monitoring quality will be the next battlefield," said Tom J. Elkin, assistant executive director of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which represents more than 800,000 employees of state and local governments and their families. He predicted that only health plans that demonstrated high quality would still be in existence by 2000.
Two elements of the consensus that emerged were regarded as significant by leaders in health care. One was that purchasers of health care for such a large number of consumers, with great potential power in the marketplace, were united in their desire for greater attention to quality. The second was a decision to put into motion a plan to gather data, in a more uniform and comprehensive way than ever before, on the medical outcomes for various methods of treating patients for major illnesses.
In the first phase of the nation's transformation to managed care, which has accelerated in the last two years, the chief impetus has come from employers' desires to contain their costs. Last year those costs dropped by 1 percent after 10 years of climbing as much as 18 percent annually. Economists attributed the drop in part to the rapid spread of managed care, especially health maintenance organizations that save money by closely controlling treatment decisions as well as by paying doctors and hospitals less.
The H.M.O.'s have insisted all along that they have not neglected quality in their attempts to control costs. But they face skepticism from some patients, doctors and legislators who contend that these organizations sometimes create incentives to spend less on medical care, perhaps shortchanging patients.
The critics say some of the organizations, which usually contract to provide all necessary care for a preset fee, are too reluctant to send patients to high-cost specialists, for example, and too quick to send patients home from hospitals.
Now, many leading H.M.O.'s as well as their critics are searching for objective ways to measure the quality of health care, a notoriously difficult task. Research and accreditation groups have been working for some time to measure the effects of treatment decisions and establish guidelines for care. But there have been few widespread and detailed attempts to determine the results of different measures. The Jackson Hole conferees agreed that over the long term such follow-up studies would be a major factor for both improving health and controlling costs.
The conference was held as part of a general re-evaluation currently under way in what many in the industry call Phase 2 of the health care revolution. In part in response to the criticisms, managed care organizations, employers, consumers, doctors and hospital groups are trying to refine and revise their participation in the new systems by, for example, rethinking methods of paying hospitals and doctors.
Dr. Paul Ellwood, a pioneer in the development of H.M.O.'s and the head of the Jackson Hole group, which convened the meeting, called the agreement a milestone in the development of managed care. He recently expressed disappointment in the evolution of H.M.O.'s because "they tend to place too much emphasis on saving money and not enough on improving quality -- and we now have the technical skill to do that."
Another participant at the conference, Colleen A. Cain, executive director of HealthChoice, a consulting company advising employers on choosing health plans, said the agreement reflected an important realization by employers and consumers alike that "much has been done to lower costs, but now it's time to look at quality."
The group approved a plan to collaborate with managed care organizations to develop by Sept. 23 formulas for measuring the effectiveness of treatments of four major illnesses. They will probably include breast cancer and asthma, but no final decision has been made. The goal is to add more treatments to the study each year, while emphasizing practical outcomes such as whether a patient's pain was relieved and the person was able to return to work.
Employers hope that such measurements will enable health plans to be more accountable for the treatments of illnesses they cover and provide consumers with more precise and clearly understandable information about their results from treatment.
A subcommittee was formed to seek ways to set up a foundation to pursue wider information about the outcome of treatment, to be financed by employers. It will attempt to work with the two major existing health care accreditation organizations, the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
The subcommittee will be headed by Dwight McNeill, information manager of GTE Corporation of Stanford, Conn., and Dr. Rodney C. Armstead, director of the Office of Managed Care at the Federal Government's Health Care Financing Administration.
Among other members are Lou Ann Cash, vice president of benefit planning for American Express; Alan Peres, manager of benefits planning for Ameritech Corporation, and Peggy Connerton, public policy director of the Service Employees International Union.
"What we want to do," said Mr. McNeill, "is have information out there in the marketplace on performance and outcome measurements. If consumers and purchasers have information on both outcome and cost, it drives market share toward that vendor that has the best value, and, surprisingly, we haven't got that as yet."
Some in the managed care industry who did not attend the meeting said that if employers wanted improved quality they were pushing on an open door. Gerald R. Plotkin, medical director of the Harvard Community Health Plan, said: "Some of the things the employers now say they want us to do we have been doing for years. But we welcome anyone who wants to help us."
But Margaret O'Kane, president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which is widely used by employers to help them select health plans, said quality varied widely from plan to plan and region to region. Ms. O'Kane, who was at the Jackson Hole meeting, said she welcomed the new work.
Dr. Arnie Milstein, who represents the Pacific Business Group on Health, with three million employees, the largest employer's health care purchasing coalition in the United States, said the Jackson Hole agreement "sends a very clear signal to the health care industry that the basis for market competition will now include outcomes -- and this implies two sea changes."
"First," he said, "expertise in health education and the psychology of patient behavior will be required to help patients become more skilled partners in managing their own health. Second what happens between doctor visits will become just as actively attended to and managed as what happens during doctors' visits and hospital stays. This is a deviation from traditional medicine, and it has major implications."
Generally, Dr. Milstein said, medicine has taken "the factory approach." New treatment methods are tested at a university or other research hospital, and the findings are reviewed by peers and reported in a journal. Doctors adopt or do not adopt the new approach, depending on their assessment of the findings.
Historically, the only reviews of treatment have come from hospital or doctor groups, or perhaps from a malpractice jury.
Mr. Peres, of Ameritech, said his company, along with 13 other employers and 17 health plans, had started pilot projects to study outcomes in breast cancer and asthma treatment.
"We found in a study of 6,600 adult asthmatics that people didn't feel they were getting the care they needed," he said. "And for a variety of reasons, the health plans were not giving them the right tools to help themselves."
He cited devices that allow an asthmatic patient to test his own breathing difficulty, known as peak-flow meters, which tell a patient whether he must rush to an emergency room or can wait hours to see a doctor.
Mr. Peres said a quarter of the patients studied had missed a day of work a month.
Dr. Milstein said that "good-outcomes data" will help patients obtain timely treatment to avoid longer, far more costly hospital stays.

HEADLINE: WAREHOUSE OF ADDICTION;
Drug Therapy: Powerful Tool Reaching Few Inside Prisons

SERIES: Warehouse of addiction: Second of three articles

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
On a summer night as sweet and soft as any he had ever known, Pierre Mathurin and another young man pulled to the curb in a quiet section of Queens, snorted a couple of lines of cocaine and set out down the sidewalk. They had spotted a man and a woman strolling alone, and now they were going after them, Mr. Mathurin's fingers tightening on a chrome-plated .25-caliber pistol.
It was just a week shy of Mr. Mathurin's 20th birthday, and his career as a drug dealer and robber was gathering momentum nicely. But that evening did not go as expected. The woman screamed, and Mr. Mathurin, fleeing with a wallet and a gold chain, was chased down by neighbors with baseball bats, turned over to the police and eventually sent to a prison drug treatment program that transformed his life. 
 Now, more than four years later, Mr. Mathurin says he is a retired criminal and recovering cocaine addict, earning a living as a barber and a partner in a video shop, paying taxes and finding it hard to visualize the frightening predator who stalked the streets in his skin. An energetic fireplug of a man who has traded the excitement of the streets for the dreams of a budding entrepreneur, Mr. Mathurin seems to be living proof that drug treatment, long viewed by skeptics as just so much touchy-feely hokum, can have a powerful impact.
With more than one million Americans now behind bars and up to 80 percent of them involved with powerful drugs like cocaine and heroin, rehabilitation programs, at their best, offer a potent weapon for decreasing addiction, crime and the spiraling costs of incarceration.
Yet only about one in six inmates receives any kind of treatment, and much of it amounts to little more than "just say no" admonishments. Only a fraction of inmates -- about 2 percent -- undergo the kind of serious rehabilitation that can change destructive behaviors that have been congealing for a lifetime.
A result is that prisons perpetuate a kind of pinwheel of failure among drug users, who return to the streets unchanged and end up back in prison, sometimes within weeks. This is despite mounting evidence that drug programs work by weaning inmates not only from drugs, but also from lives of crime. The best programs drastically cut the rearrest rate of participants. And they seem to be economical. One study in California showed that every $1 invested in solid drug treatment saved $7 in future costs of crime and incarceration.
Abstinence alone would not end the longing for drugs, experts say, but abstinence is not even an issue at most prisons, where drugs are available for those willing to pay.
Drug treatment advocates say the country could be providing intense anti-drug therapy to everyone in prison who needs it for a tiny fraction of what is being spent on the most explosive prison-building spree in history. But the nation's political leaders have stuck with bricks and mortar. Last fall, the Democratic-controlled Congress authorized $8 billion to build new prisons over the next six years, and only $400 million for drug treatment in state and Federal prisons. This year, the new Republican majority in Congress increased the prison construction allotment to $10 billion, leaving the treatment money the same.
A few states, like California and South Carolina, are expanding drug treatment for prisoners. Texas began a sweeping new program four years ago, but is now scaling it back. And in New York, one of the pioneers, Gov. George E. Pataki, has cut treatment for several thousand prisoners as part of his plan to reduce state spending.
Joseph A. Califano Jr., the former aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson who now heads the Center on Alcohol and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said society has a warped image of the inmate population that works against greater allocations for drug treatment.
"The average American thinks we've got guys in jail like the ones Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart played in the 1930's," Mr. Califano said. "In reality, the prisons are wall to wall with alcohol and drug abusers and the mentally ill. They're not hardened criminals; they're people who can change. But they can't change without help."
But Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican who heads the House subcommittee on crime, said he and many others remain skeptical about the rehabilitative powers of treatment and about its power to reduce prison populations.
"The priority is in taking violent criminal offenders off the street and locking them up for long periods of time," he said. "That comes before drug treatment."
 
Reshaping People
'My Life Started Changing'
 Prison is an ideal place to apply drug treatment, in large part because that is where the addicts are.
On the outside, heavy drug users are scattered through almost every community. It is often hard to locate them and even harder to persuade them to enter treatment. Inside prisons, most inmates are motivated to enter treatment not because they are concerned about their drug problems but because they have something else to gain: early release, in New York; a relief from boredom; a cell in a prison closer to home.
After months in a treatment program, however, many inmates find that they have been drawn into the process despite themselves. That was the case with Mr. Mathurin. "It just started growing on me," he said. "Stuff started happening and my life started changing."
Keeping addicts from dropping out of treatment is almost as big a problem as coaxing them to enter in the first place. In prison, though, partly because the alternative is just another bunk in another cell block, the dropout rate is much lower.
Drug treatment programs, even the least intense ones, seem to bring tranquillity to prisons. Administrators and officers say inmates in treatment programs fight less and give their keepers less of a hard time. John P. Erickson, who is in charge of substance abuse programs in the California prison system, said, "There is a ripple effect in terms of the overall prison environment."
The kind of treatment that has proved most effective with inmates is done in a so-called therapeutic community. Residents are housed together, and they eat, sleep and work on their drug problems together. They begin the day at the crack of dawn by cleaning up their cells and making their beds with military tucks. Then, after a peppy morning meeting, they march through a schedule of encounter groups and seminars that continues into the early evening. The structure itself is part of the treatment.
While drug abuse is the universal link in these programs, it is addressed as a symptom rather than the heart of the problem.
"The therapeutic community is a school about life," said Ronald Williams, a former heroin addict and armed robber who now runs New York Therapeutic Communities, which operates treatment programs in prisons in New York and Texas. "It's teaching how to live a life that is crime free and drug free, and providing the tools to accomplish that."
It amounts to reshaping people, and researchers say the best results usually take 12 to 18 months. But a therapeutic community at the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility, a medium security prison in southern California, has shown a striking impact after only 9 to 12 months. In that program, the reincarceration rate has been cut by about a third. A year after leaving prison, 42.6 percent of the inmates who graduated from the program were back behind bars again -- compared with 63 percent of those who had served their time merely lifting weights, playing basketball and doing chores.
The results have been even better at a therapeutic community in a Delaware prison with a program that runs 18 months. There, after 18 months on the street, 29 percent of those in the program were rearrested, compared with 71 percent of those who received no treatment.
Drug-treatment programs promise eventual savings because they reduce the recidivism rate among graduates. But they require more initial spending, raising the cost per prisoner by about $10 a day in Texas and California and $15 a day in New York. Without treatment, Texas spends $44 a day to keep an inmate in prison. In California the cost is $57, and in New York it is $71.
States try to cut costs while still offering treatment by offering lectures on the dangers of drugs -- which are pretty well known to most addicts -- and weekly meetings of an hour or two of Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous. California and New York offer some drug education programs that run over several months, and Alabama and Florida have been providing eight weeks of intensive treatment for many prisoners. But experts say such abbreviated treatment has little lasting effect.
"It's a false economy," said Dr. Lewis Yablonsky, a sociologist at East Texas State University who has been working with therapeutic communities for years. "If the states get behind the therapeutic community concept, we will cut our prison population in half over the next 25 years. That would save billions of dollars."
 
Showing the Way
Once an Inmate, Now a Counselor
 Drug treatment is a glacial process. Powerful changes can occur, but they take months, not days.
In a session shortly after breakfast one Monday morning at the Donovan Correctional Facility in California, on a sun-parched plateau overlooking the Mexican border, a handful of inmates sat in a circle of armchairs in a pleasant, carpeted room with paintings and color photos on the walls.
Michael Watkins, an imposing young burglar who likes crack cocaine far too much, was hunched over, glowering.
"I dreamed I was getting high," he said. He was upset. He had been working to rid himself of cravings for three months, and now he worried that he was sliding back.
But across the circle, Phillip Serrato, a 25-year-old drug smuggler and heroin addict, could not have been happier with himself. He had been out on the grassy prison yard, between the plaza filled with barbells and weight lifters and the asphalt basketball courts, he said, when some friends from his old neighborhood started passing around heroin and crystal methamphetamine.
"It gave me the chills," he said. "But I didn't take any, and I feel real good in my chest."
Gregory Kuhn, a 30-year-old drug dealer, had just turned down a marijuana joint in the yard. "Being right there, smelling it," he said wistfully. "I looked at it and I knew I couldn't touch it."
It was the start of another week of treatment at Donovan, where the drug culture that persists behind bars is so accepted that it goes unremarked upon by prisoners and counselors alike. Russell Power, who has the name Rita tattooed on his neck in small, loopy script, was leading the group. Like many of the counselors working in the program at Donovan, run by Amity, a private treatment organization also operating in Arizona and Texas, Mr. Power, 38, is a former inmate and recovering drug addict; methamphetamine was his drug, manufacturing it was his crime.
Like most of America's inmates, many of the men came from households and neighborhoods where conversations about ideas, emotions and dreams were rarely held. Thinking broadly and deeply about their lives was not easy for them. And so Mr. Power's objective that morning was simply to get them talking and, in turn, thinking, first steps in recognizing and changing habits that repeatedly landed them in prison.
The addict-counselors, like Mr. Power, often seem to be participating as equals. But they are quietly suggesting ethical approaches to life, ways to get along without drugs, often using their own recovery and return from crime as illustrations.
Later that Monday, departing from his notes in a seminar dealing with truth, information, priorities and support, Mr. Power talked about using the group sessions to let off steam and tension. "If you're dreaming about using, you need to be talking about it in groups," he said. "If you're thinking about killing somebody, you need to be saying it in the group.
"I use the group that way. If I talk about it, I usually won't do it."
On another afternoon in group therapy, after watching a film about German concentration camps intended to provoke a conversation about hatred, one inmate, Jimmy Carpenter, a heroin addict and shoplifter, objected to comments from another, Larry Jones, that compared the new Republican leadership to the Nazis.
Certain that Mr. Carpenter, who has two years of college, was putting him down, Mr. Jones sprang to his feet, veins pulsing in his neck, and lunged across the circle. Standing inches apart, the two men blustered and sputtered. Finally, with everyone shouting them down, they slumped into their chairs.
It had been a close call, two men at the precipice of what would have been the first fist fight since drug treatment was started at Donovan in 1991. And, as it turned out, it was not about Nazis and Republicans at all.
Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Jones had been friends for 25 years. A year ago, when they entered the treatment program, they promised each other they would stay away from drugs. But not long before the Holocaust discussion, Mr. Carpenter had broken his word. He had got hold of some marijuana and crystal methamphetamine in the yard and, after everyone else went to sleep, he turned on the light by his bunk and began to party. He stayed up all night, reading, listening to music and savoring the drugs.
A guard noticed the light and, in the morning, Mr. Carpenter was asked to give a urine sample, which, of course, proved he had been using drugs.
Though they try not to get so close to the edge, the explosion was the sort of thing the counselors strive for.
"It teaches the inmates how to work through emotions," said Rod Mullen, the executive director of Amity.
"If they don't learn to control their emotions," he said, "the first bad thing that happens will set them off. They'll go rob a store, beat up their girlfriend, get drunk, get into a high-speed chase and then, of course, they're right back in the institution again."
 
Gradual Acceptance
Success Brings More Programs
 Drug treatment in American prisons has had a rocky history. From its inception in the 1930's, at Federal institutions in Lexington, Ky., and Fort Worth, it has generally been poorly administered and ineffective. By the mid-70's, criminal justice experts had come to believe that nothing works.
Some of the first convincing evidence that treatment could have a significant impact on crime came in the late 1980's from a therapeutic community in a New York State prison. Tracking inmates who had been out of the Arthur Kill state prison on Staten Island for three years, Dr. Harry K. Wexler found that of those who had spent a year in the Stay'n Out drug treatment program there, 27 percent had been in trouble with the police again, compared with 41 percent of the inmates who received no treatment.
Gradually, drug treatment in prisons began to expand as word of the success at Arthur Kill and at a prison in Oregon spread among professionals and Federal officials began financing pilot projects around the country. In a bit of horse trading in 1989, the New York State Assembly, which was Democratically controlled, agreed to go along with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Republican-controlled Senate to build more prisons on the condition that drug treatment also be increased. By last year, there were eight therapeutic communities, treating about 8 percent of the state's 68,000 inmates.
Except for Stay'n Out, the therapeutic communities in the New York prisons run programs that last six months, about half as long as most experts think is the minimum necessary. Most of the inmates who go into therapeutic communities are primed with about six months of anti-drug education. But experts say the combined programs have far less impact on inmates than a full year in intensive treatment.
 
Living Without Drugs
On His Own, Tempted No More
 Pierre Mathurin's journey to recovery started in the Mohawk state prison in the gently rolling farmlands of central New York. He had been in prison for about a year and he had been getting high on marijuana and cocaine about every other week, depending on how supplies were running. Once in a while, he would get some heroin, he said, and sell it for 10 times its street value.
One morning at Mohawk, he said, he woke up and said to himself, "I don't want to get high no more."
He was not particularly interested in drug treatment. He did not think he needed it.
But he was told that the only way he could get into the work release program that would get him back on the street a year earlier was to go into treatment. So he signed up, and was sent to a therapeutic community run by Phoenix House, the largest residential drug treatment organization in the nation, at the state prison in Marcy.
He was not a model patient. Twice he became incensed in encounter groups and threatened to punch other inmates. Each time, he was punished with extra chores and required to repeat parts of the treatment. Therapeutically, that may have worked to his advantage, because he ended up with nine months of treatment, three months more than the standard in New York.
Though experts say that follow-up treatment outside prison further diminishes the likelihood of inmates' being rearrested by as much as 20 percent, Mr. Mathurin, like most inmates around the country, was not required to continue his treatment after being released.
But something had taken hold in him, and he arranged to participate in encounter groups at a Phoenix House center in Manhattan three times a week. Then it was twice a week. Then, once a week and finally, he was on his own, except for the Narcotics Anonymous meetings that he attends three times a week.
He is back with some of his old friends, and some of them are still using drugs. One is the young man with whom he did his last stickup. He got away that night, was picked up for gun possession a couple of years later, but got off with probation. He is still using drugs, and he and Mr. Mathurin are still close. But Mr. Mathurin said he did not feel tempted to get high with his friend.
"He doesn't do it in front of me, and we don't talk about it," Mr. Mathurin said. "One day, he'll probably be like me. But I'm not going to preach recovery. He's got to want it."
In the old days, Mr. Mathurin said, he considered himself mainly a drug dealer and had gone out to rob people only when sales were slow. There was, though, a certain amount of excitement, he said, in "putting somebody in fear."
"Now," he said, "I don't think that was right. I'm not going to say I'm making more money now. But I'm feeling better. I may make less, but you spend more wisely when you actually earn it."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS MOVING TO REVAMP RULES ON FOOD SAFETY

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
In the next few weeks, Congress will consider legislation to alter rules on food safety drastically. The changes, scattered throughout several bills, have been proposed by the Republicans to limit the Federal Government's authority to regulate not only food safety but also health and the environment.
Taken together, the bills would reduce the burden on businesses to prove that food is safe and would increase the burden on Government agencies to prove that proposed rules would reduce risks to the public and would be worth the cost. The bills would also expand the food industry's chances to appeal the rules in court. 
 The centerpiece of the effort is a bill on regulatory reform sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, which would affect many food rules. "It is clear that the American people are fed up with a regulatory state that is out of control," Mr. Dole said. "The bill simply asks that agencies use common sense to avoid unnecessary costs when pursuing important goals such as health and safety." The changes, he said, would not foreclose tougher safety standards or override existing mandates.
But critics disagree and contend that the result would be a food supply that is much less safe.
"These proposals are an assault on 40 years of consumer protection," said Dr. David A. Kessler, the head of the Food and Drug Administration who was nominated for his post by President George Bush. In a recent interview, he spoke out against the proposals for the first time, saying he had decided to do so because "there is an enormous amount at stake."
"It's one thing to eliminate unnecessary burdens on business," Dr. Kessler said. "It's another thing to compromise longstanding health and safety standards."
The bills, if approved, would have the following consequences:
*Rules to modernize the meat inspection system, including microbial testing, scheduled to go into effect next year, would either be dropped or postponed. The rules were proposed by the Agriculture Department in an effort to prevent an estimated 5 million illnesses and 4,000 deaths each year from meat and poultry tainted with harmful bacteria.
*A major regulation intended to improve the testing of seafood by the end of year, would either be stopped or postponed several years.
*The Delaney Clause, which forbids adding even the slightest trace of any known carcinogen to food, would be repealed. The Clinton Administration opposes the move as part of regulatory reform.
*Pesticides that are considered probable human carcinogens could continue to be used. The Environmental Protection Agency had been in the process of removing them from the market.
*The Food and Drug Administration's plan to regulate the packaging of iron supplements -- the leading cause of poisoning of children -- would be dropped or delayed several years. The rule was scheduled to go into effect later this year.
Currently, most decisions on food regulations are based on their effect on health. But under the proposed legislation, benefits to farmers and food processors would play a greater role in determining whether the Food and Drug Administration could issue new safety requirements for food companies or whether the Environmental Protection Agency would permit the use of a particular pesticide.
The Republican majorities in both the House and Senate strongly support changes along these lines, and some Democrats are prepared to vote for them as well. Some form of legislation reducing regulations is likely to pass, and the Delaney Clause will be weakened, at the very least. The provision -- considered an important regulatory device by many environmentalists -- is named for James Delaney, a former Congressman from Brooklyn who was the author of the clause, an amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act passed in 1958.
On the other hand, President Clinton has said he will veto some more sweeping measures, including the Dole bill, unless they are substantially changed, and some members of Congress said they were alarmed by what they saw as too much deregulation.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, said: "The Republicans cloak their actions in terms of anti-Government regulation, but it's more than that. They are siding with and helping special interests at the expense of public health when they attack food safety."
In addition to the regulatory reform bills -- already passed by the House and due for a vote in the Senate after the Fourth of July recess -- the House is considering a bill on the regulation of pesticides and an amendment to an Agriculture appropriations bill concerning meat and poultry inspection. And a House subcommittee is debating a proposal to turn the approval of food additives over to private testing laboratories.
The food industry, which has made significant campaign contributions to Republican candidates, is supported by the Republican leadership in the belief that the current system is broken, that food safety regulations are too burdensome and too expensive for the amount of protection they provide. They want more detailed analyses of the risks and the benefits before a regulation can be approved.
But Dr. Kessler said the proposed modifications would only make the agency's work more difficult. "Most people think of regulatory reform as streamlining or eliminating bureaucracy, but it would do exactly the opposite," he said.
The requirements for elaborate studies to show the risk and benefits of a regulation will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. "Given budget restraints, this will force agencies to scale back or curtail regulations," said David Vladeck, director of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen Litigation Group.
One consequence of the additional studies, Mr. Vladeck said, would likely be an end to the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to regulate iron tablets, which were responsible for 100,000 cases of poisoning among children in a five-year period, from 1988 to 1993. The agency wants to place warnings on all packages of the pills and require the packaging of higher potency pills in child-resistant containers.
Though iron pills are already known to be toxic to children, the proposed legislation would require the Food and Drug Administration to go through a costly process to show risks and benefits. The cost to manufacturers of implementing the new regulations would have to be taken into account in deciding whether regulation was appropriate, as would higher indirect charges like increased landfill and transportation costs for larger, heavier containers.
While it is easy to quantify costs, it is difficult to quantify benefits. "There is no accepted way to value the pain and suffering of having to endure life with a disability such as an impaired digestive system," Mr. Vladeck said. The high costs to the agency for making such determinations, he said, will force it to make choices on priorities, "so the iron toxicity rule probably would never see the light of day."
Dr. Kessler said that weighing risks against benefits sounds great, "but the truth is there is no magic formula, especially when the risks are taken by one group and the benefits by another."
Another provision also calls for the agency's earlier decisions to be reviewed using the standards of the new regulations. "You should not underestimate the significance this legislation can have in terms of its impact on agencies' ability to get day-to-day work done," Dr. Kessler said.
The regulation that the food industry finds most onerous is the Delaney Clause, an amendment approved in 1958 that says that no food additives that cause cancer in humans or animals when ingested can be intentionally added to food. A recent California court decision said that the same standards must be applied to some pesticides.
But Jeffrey Nedelman of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, who helped draft the portion of the Dole bill that would repeal the Delaney Clause, has his own strong views on the subject. "The zero-risk approach is scientific junk," he said, "because toxicologists and food scientists say it is the wrong criterion on which to judge safety. Zero might have been the right policy in the 1950's, but now we can measure substances with a million times more sensitivity than when Delaney was enacted."
Critics of the Congressional rush to deregulate said the Delaney Clause had been a valuable health protection but might need modifying.
In the House bill aimed at altering regulations on pesticides, the Environmental Protection Agency would have to give greater weight to economic benefits for farmers and food processors than it now does.
In 1993, the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children issued a report that said current regulation of pesticides was insufficient to prevent harm to children and needed to be tightened. Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of that committee, said that the pesticide legislation in the House is contrary to the report's recommendations.
"The current system doesn't protect kids, and the bill at the least perpetuates the system and probably make it worse because it abolishes Delaney," he said.
Efforts to modernize meat inspection are also the subject of legislative action. Much of the meat and poultry industry appears to have had a change of heart about proposed Agriculture Department regulations that would require microbial testing and would enact safeguards designed to make it easier to catch problems before products leave the processing plants.
The American Meat Institute, a trade association, has now reversed its earlier support and is asking for a delay, seeking instead a cumbersome and time-consuming regulation-writing method called negotiated rule making. Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the association, said the group feared that the new regulation would be layered on top of old rules. "We want to move forward as quickly as possible and we think negotiated rule making will achieve consensus," she said.
Michael Taylor, Acting Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety said the delay "would postpone progress we know we can make toward reducing foodborne illness in our country."
Others said the delay was an effort to defeat the rule completely. "It's a waiting game, until there is a new Administration in place which will do it the way that is least burdensome to industry," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.
The food industry would also like to privatize the approval process for food additives, which even the Food and Drug Administration acknowledges takes too long. The industry wants the Food and Drug Administration to certify outside testing companies to do the studies. If the agency did not act on the outside company's recommendation within 90 days, the additive would be automatically marketed. Under current regulations the agency is not required to take the advice of an outside testing service.
William B. Schultz, Deputy Commissioner for Policy for the Food and Drug Administration, said the problem is that the agency might not have sufficient resources to act within 90 days, leaving consumers "exposed to a new additive without a Government agency ever having made a decision about its safety."
Dr. Kessler finds the proposed regulatory changes troublesome. "Plain and simple, these bills would impose meaningless process and endless obstacles," he said. "They make it harder to do things people expect and want us to do, like protecting the food they eat."

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Suburbia Arises Out of the New Jersey Farmlands

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, fields of corn, barley and wheat stretched for hundreds of acres in all directions from the crossing of South Middlebush Road and Claremont Road here in southern Somerset County. But in the last decade, the cropland has vanished. Now the area is filled with 2,600 new single-family homes, garden apartments and town houses.
To city dwellers and even residents of the older, close-in suburbs, these new outlying developments, like the Wynnefield Village town houses and garden apartments, seem isolated. 
 Wrong, says one of Wynnefield Village's new settlers, Jim Menke, 36-year-old president of an engineering company based in Hillside, N.J., near Newark, that designs pharmaceutical equipment. "This is the center point," Mr. Menke said. "You're an hour from the Jersey Shore, 42 miles from the center of Manhattan; you're next door to Princeton, two hours from the Poconos and an hour and a half outside Philly."
In the last decade, Mr. Menke and tens of thousands of others like him have poured into hundreds of new housing developments scattered across the farmlands and meadows of six northern and central New Jersey counties, Somerset, Morris, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean. The Census Bureau estimates that since 1990, the six counties have accounted for two-thirds of the population growth in New Jersey, or 114,800 of the state's 173,000 increase.
Mr. Menke's new neighbors include hundreds of young couples in their 20's and 30's and families with preschoolers. Though urban dwellers think of them in terms of their distance from New York City or Philadelphia, they do not see themselves that way, and do not typically work in those two cities nor spend a great deal of their leisure time there. Indeed, at the time they bought, more than twice as many of the people in Mr. Menke's subdivision worked in Somerset or neighboring Middlesex as in New York City.
These outer suburban counties are changing the face of central New Jersey, challenging the decades-old reign of the four post-World War II suburban boom counties closest to Manhattan -- Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic -- as the state's most powerful population center and its economic heartland.
In 1980, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic had nearly 563,000 more residents than the six upstarts. Now their edge has tumbled to just fewer than 80,000, at 2,622,000 to 2,542,300, according to census estimates.
In terms of new jobs, the six outer suburbs have outpaced the four inner suburbs by a wide margin since 1982, according to a 1994 study of non-government jobs by James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca of Rutgers University.
"We've reinvented the geography of the New Jersey economy," said Dr. Hughes, associate dean at the Rutgers School of Planning and Public Policy.
In 1989, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic had nearly 167,000 more jobs than Morris, Somerset, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean. The lead of the four older suburban counties fell to about 61,000 (987,000 to 926,000) by September 1993, the last year the state's county-by-county job figures were available, the study said.
And if not for the arrival of 91,000 immigrants from overseas in the four inner suburban counties, there would have been severe population losses there.
Years ago in the four older counties, most jobs sprouted along railroad corridors and older state highways, like 3, 4, 1 and 9.
Job growth in the six surging counties in the 1970's and 80's depended on new offices built on cheap farmland and woodlands made accessible by interstate highways 78, 287 and 80, and the Garden State Parkway, Dr. Hughes said.
The 400 town houses and garden apartments of Wynnefield Village make up the newest section of a sprawling development, Society Hill at Somerset, which looms from the fields about a 10-minute drive down South Middlebush Road from Exit 6 along Interstate 287. Cars are critical to the jobs and life styles of most residents.
The project's developer, the K. Hovnanian Companies, New Jersey's busiest housing contractor, priced the two- and three-bedroom homes in Wynnefield Village, now three years old, from $106,950 to $138,950, hoping to attract young, first-time home buyers, and the strategy seems to have worked. A majority of the 200 or so buyers who answered a K. Hovnanian survey said they had been renters under 40 with no children and family incomes under $60,000 a year. Most came to Wynnefield Village from Somerset or neighboring Middlesex County. The next biggest batch came from New York City -- 12 from Brooklyn, 11 from Manhattan and 8 from Staten Island.
At the time they bought, 86 worked in Somerset or Middlesex, 42 in New York City and the others in counties across northern and central New Jersey.
Michael and Michelle Redfern were among the earliest buyers in Wynnefield Village. "For now, this is perfect for us," Mr. Redfern said. He works as a manager for a company that packages liquid pharmaceuticals. His office is only 15 minutes away, in Dayton, N.J. "By Exit 8A on the turnpike," he said.
Overwhelmingly, the new jobs in offices and headquarters campuses on or near the interstates are white-collar professional, including engineering, administrative, pharmaceutical, telecommunications, high technology, information processing, accounting and law, he added.
Public transportation and reliance on jobs in Manhattan are alien to most workers in the six surging counties. The 1990 census found that about 5 percent of workers in the six counties, or 61,236, worked in Manhattan, as opposed to 11.5 percent, or about 146,000, in the other four.
That affects the way residents see the world. Speaking about the convenience of this area, Kevin Kendall, who lives on deLeon Circle with his wife, Eileen, and their two young children, first said, "It's local to Princeton." Before moving here from Bergen County, Mr. Kendall, 33, worked in the Inspector General's office in New York City's Human Resources Administration. Since then, he has become an insurance adjuster, based in Philadelphia.
Wynnefield Village's settlers say they enjoy the community pool and tennis courts, the block parties, the bus trips to Atlantic City and the pick-up basketball and football games on Sunday mornings.
Sal Monaco, 68, came from Carnarsie a couple of years ago after finishing 36 years of work in a Brooklyn factory that produced molasses and brown sugar. He misses the old neighborhood stores and the rumble of the subway. But Mr. Monaco said his new home in Society Hill at Somerset has pluses, too.
"I feel safer here," he said. "There's no hangouts, there's no noise and there's no kids taking dope and breaking windows. I'm at the age where I don't need teen-agers around."
Growth brings problems, too, of course. According to the 1990 census, at least 80 percent of the workers in each of the six outer suburban counties drove alone to work or took a car pool, producing heavy reliance on the interstates and state highways that helped create, and disperse, all the new jobs since 1982. Usually, they also produce bumper-to-bumper rush-hour crawls.
Years ago, Franklin Township was a secluded farming town of 50 square miles, with a tiny urban corner bordering New Brunswick on the northeast, a few historic hamlets on the Delaware and Raritan Canal along its western border and vast fields and woodlands in the middle. But between 1980 and 1990, its population grew to nearly 43,000 from 31,350.
A small piece of Interstate 287, including Exit 6, crosses its northern tip now. New motels and offices, including one for AT&T and another for Merrill Lynch, are tucked next to the exit. Wherever Bob Puskas goes he sees cars. Mr. Puskas is the last dairy farmer on South Middlebush Road. Years ago, he had the narrow two-lane road pretty much to himself. Now he refuses to take his equipment onto South Middlebush or herd his 40 Holsteins across it before 9:30 in the morning or after 3 in the afternoon.

HEADLINE: Job Insecurity: A special report.;
In New Work World, Employers Call All the Shots

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, July 2

 BODY:
Not so long ago, American workers would suffer the sting of a recession by losing jobs or having their hours or wages reduced. They responded by taking part-time work, signing with temp agencies and just making do -- at least until the economy revived. Then they would pour back to work, their wages rising as employers competed for their services.
Not anymore. Recent reports suggest that the economy is starting to sputter after perking along for the four years since the last recession. But whatever the economy's prospects, the latest stretch of growth shows that for all but professionals, executives, new college graduates, and the most skilled blue-collar workers, many problems that workers faced only in bad times have become fixtures in all times: Some wages are still falling, people must be ready to work 12-hour shifts and 6-day weeks, and no job is for keeps. 
 "The difference between today's economy and a recession is anyone can get a job who wants one; it just depends on what you call a job," said Gary Galloway of Tarrant County Junior College here, who oversees retraining for aircraft workers laid off by the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
Of 124 million people who were working in May, 8 million -- 2.2 million more than a decade ago -- moonlighted, or held two or more jobs simultaneously. Of 22 million part-timers, 4.5 million wanted full-time work and could not get it. The number of temporary workers has tripled in a decade to 2.1 million in May. And the average hourly wage, in terms of what people can buy with it, has been falling since 1973.
Three factors -- weakening unions, foreign competition and automation -- are undermining workplace verities, like annual salary increases and regular promotions, on which most Americans counted and from which they charted their future.
These factors are well entrenched in the widely diversified economy of Fort Worth. Unemployment in the city last month was 5.9 percent, just above the national rate of 5.7 percent. The area is awash with big service, restaurant and retail store employers. The corpses of old businesses and bunting of newcomers line mall-encrusted highways.
Like many northern cities, Fort Worth and neighboring Arlington have a mix of unionized manufacturing industries that pay $30,000 to more than $50,000 a year, well above the $23,000 average for American workers, and new, largely nonunion industries -- electronics and telecommunications -- that typically pay half the old industry wages.
But here, as nationally, the old industries are contracting. Fifteen years ago, factories in the area provided 25 percent of all the jobs; the figure is 16 percent today, in line with the decline nationwide. Last week, General Motors Corporation said it would eliminate 1,200 jobs in October at an automobile plant in Arlington, leaving about 2,000 jobs. Lockheed Martin has chopped its work force from 32,000 to 13,000 since 1990.
What has emerged for most people here, -- as for most other Americans -- is a new and unstable work world in which they feel that the employer can call all the shots.
"Before, looking for a job meant you were looking for someone who was looking for you," said Earl Davis Jr., a 48-year-old divorced father of three from Fort Worth who lost his $49,000-a-year job with Lockheed in 1993 after a Pentagon budget cut. "Now you have to go out and convince someone that you've got something no one else has."
Low-wage workers say they feel like yo-yos, yanked from part-time work to full-time work and back, from the day shift one week to the lobster shift the next.
For the average worker with a high school diploma or a little college, wages that would rise with the economy are not budging. In factories, high-paid assembly-line jobs keep disappearing as though the recession never ended, and it has become harder to find a job paying even $8 an hour, or $16,000 a year.
For the jobs that are available, employers insist on applicants with experience -- even when the skills required could be learned quickly, like stocking store shelves and cleaning motel rooms. They make no commitments to the people they hire, however. Indeed, since the late 80's, employers have been using temporary help agencies like spigots, bringing temporary workers in when business heats up and pulling the plug on them when it cools.
 
Searching
Wage Illusions Meet New Realities
 As workers' job security has evaporated, so has their bargaining power -- their ability to ask for more money, more vacation time, more health benefits. Across the nation, and across industries, employees perceive that they are more vulnerable to dismissal now than in the past.
Mr. Davis, for example, said he thought he had broad and readily marketable management experience from Lockheed, where he was a mid-level executive, and from an earlier job at a shipbuilder.
But he said no one had been willing to take him on for even half his old salary. So, while grinding out resumes and job applications, Mr. Davis makes ends meet with a part-time job delivering and installing computers to a computer store's customers for $20 a trip.
Even if Mr. Davis lands a regular job, he can probably forget about the periodic raises that once came automatically to lift his living standard. From $9.66 six years ago, just before the recession, the average hourly wage has increased to the current $11.40. But the increase was an illusion; inflation outpaced it, so workers cannot buy as much as they once did for their wages. And now, since the recession's end, even the illusion of rising wages is withering.
"From my perspective," said Chuck Reed, who owns a Minute Man temporary help agency in Arlington, "wages have been frozen for the last four years."
But as employers freeze wages, they demand more experience. "Nothing is unskilled any longer," Mr. Reed said. "Even digging ditches. Employers want someone who's been digging ditches. They want a mechanic who's operated this type of machine to operate this type of machine. They want a janitor for a health care facility who's been a janitor in a health care facility."
Darlyne Stewart, a job counselor in the Texas Employment Commission's office in Arlington, is witnessing both phenomena. Consulting her computerized list of job offers from local employers, she noted: "Here's one from a manufacturing company. They make plastics. In April last year, they wanted a trainee assembler for $5.75 to $6.05 and no experience. Now they want one for $5.75 with three months' experience."
Another company is seeking a worker to load trucks and make deliveries. It offered $9.49 for the job last June, $9.79 in October and $9.49 again this month.
 
Disappearing
Automation Hits At Skilled Jobs
 In Fort Worth, people closest to the job market suspect that the continuous march of automation, first in factories, now in ever-more computerized offices and shops, is the main culprit undermining the job market. Automation has struck hardest at the middle range of the wage scale, jobs paying $8 to $14 an hour: those of skilled clerks, some assembly-line workers and machine operators.
"We're not seeing as many of those jobs, and they have been the slowest to come back," said Michael Wallace, the manager of a state employment commission office in Fort Worth. "The competition for them is really fierce."
What remains is an oversupply of semiskilled workers who must settle for low-skilled, low-wage jobs, like running convenience store cash registers and waiting tables, that do not lend themselves to automation. Demand for those workers has strengthened with the economy, but the wages -- $4.50 to $6 an hour, not much above the Federal minimum wage of $4.25 -- will not lift most one-worker families out of poverty.
Mary Bryant, for example, a 38-year-old single mother with a 6-month-old son, Dylan, says $9 an hour, or $18,000 a year, is the threshold she must meet to stay off charity and welfare. It is just enough, she said, to let her move out of her son's godparents' house, rent an apartment and pay the $65 weekly cost of child care.
"I just can't take less than that," Ms. Bryant said. "It's not going to benefit my son to get a job where I know I'm going to starve."
Her credentials would seem to qualify her for the pay she wants. She has two years of college and more than 10 years of experience in clerical jobs with banks.
A month ago she lost a $9-an-hour clerical job for a retail map store because the business was failing. Then two weeks ago she found another $9-an-hour, full-time job as a clerk with a mortgage company.
But she has also found that whatever her skills and experience, this job market can take her or leave her. "The day before I was to go to work," she said, "I got an infection in my lymph nodes." She was scared because she had only recently suffered from cancer, and had had a hysterectomy.
"I asked my new bosses if they could hold the job one extra day," she said. "They couldn't."
 
Coping
Worker Flexibility, By Choice or Not
 Ms. Bryant, at least, can still vie for a regular, full-time job paying an adequate wage. Ben Almond, 30, says he is trapped under a "paper ceiling" -- with no college diploma or other credentials testifying to his expertise as a health-care aide.
Clean cut and eager looking, Mr. Almond has two sons, ages 3 and 6; his wife stays home to care for them. He has a full-time job as a therapeutic recreation technician at a rehabilitation hospital and earns $6.79 an hour -- close to $960 a month -- helping patients with their exercises and playing games with them.
"In late February," he said, "the patient count went down. Everything revolves around the number of patients. So they moved me from full time to part time, meaning they would call me as needed.
"Then, they called me back in late April for three days a week. They wanted me to do central supply in the morning and do recreation technician in the afternoon."
Soon after, he was shifted to five days. "But the second week they said, 'Well, we're going to have to cut you back to five-and-a-half hours on Sundays,' " Mr. Almond recalled. "The guy said, 'It's nothing personal. Just a function of money.' "
For most workers, an often fruitful route into a permanent job is the temporary help agency, which has displaced the old Main Street employment agency.
Temporary agencies hire workers, pay their wages and dispatch them to regular employers for jobs that often become "temp-to-perm" trial runs. The employer typically takes three months to a year to size up a worker, then offers her a permanent job or sends her back to her real employer, the agency.
The number of temporary workers, some 2.1 million, seems minuscule in the work force of 124 million. But millions more workers have passed through the agencies into permanent jobs.
Six years ago, Ms. Crossett of the Texas Employment Commission said there were 51 temporary help agencies in Fort Worth and Arlington employing 4,937 workers. By late last year, she said, 154 agencies had 15,528 workers on their rolls.
"It's really a revolution," said Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "Essentially, many employers have given up the idea they're going to screen employees and let temp agencies do the screening."
For all its turmoil, the job market has mellowed for at least one group of Americans. Carolyn Ulrickson, the director of career services at Texas Christian University here, said that after several lean years, offers flowed freely and starting salaries rose for this year's crop of college graduates.
Yet for these workers, too, employers are fussier, Ms. Ulrickson said. "I can remember back in the early 80's, I.B.M. would hire 6,000 graduates a year and Rockwell International 6,000," Ms. Ulrickson said. "Texaco used to schedule recruiting visits here three years in advance."
Today, she said, many employers send out only one recruiter or two from offices closest to the university, rather than pay for trips from headquarters. "And we're lucky if they call three weeks in advance," she said.
Few of these employers commit to lifetime careers, she said. They have applied to hiring practices their "just-in-time" method of inventory control, buying supplies the instant they are needed rather than stocking up on them.
Often, too, these veteran employers now use temporary help agencies. As Ms. Ulrickson explained, "They tell the agency, 'We have a project and we need four accountants. Show us some new graduates.' "

HEADLINE: AIDS Group Urges a Plan On Medicines

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
A Federal advisory group has urged the Government to provide drug companies with tax credits and protection against competition to accelerate development of new medicines for AIDS.
The pharmaceutical industry anticipates such limited profits that it is rapidly abandoning research on new AIDS drugs, the National Task Force on AIDS Drug Development said on Thursday. Except for new drugs called protease inhibitors, now in clinical trials, the pipeline is mostly empty, the group said. 
 "This is a major threat," said Peter Staley of the Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization. He said the situation involves not just cash-strapped small firms, but larger companies that "simply are dropping AIDS when they do economic calculations of what research to pursue."
Dr. Daniel Hoth of Cell Genesys Inc. said that companies could not spend millions researching drugs to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome unless the medicines hold the potential for big profits at a time when investment in drugs by the Government and Wall Street is lagging. "The investment environment is chilly to hostile with respect to investing in AIDS drugs," Dr. Hoth told the task force.
The task force, composed of patients, drug makers and government and private scientists, spent a year studying how to speed development of new AIDS drugs. Currently, there are only four.
On Thursday the panel forwarded its recommendations to the Clinton Administration. Here are some of its proposals:
*Offer a 50 percent tax credit for all clinical research into potential drugs for AIDS and the human immunodeficiency virus.
*Give several years of market exclusivity to all H.I.V. and AIDS treatments. AIDS drugs once automatically got seven years of exclusivity under a law to promote treatments for rare diseases, but too many Americans now have AIDS for it to qualify any longer as a rare or "orphan disease."
*Add an extra six months of exclusivity for drugs that are prepared in special infant formulations and are proven safe. Most AIDS drugs have a "lousy" track record of being studied for their effects in children, said Dr. David A. Kessler, the head of the Food and Drug Administration.
*Offer a 50 percent tax credit for studying additional uses for approved AIDS drugs.
The task force also won a pledge from the F.D.A. to issue written guidelines about exactly when it would approve a drug based on just one test in humans.
The agency normally requires more data, but has made exceptions for drugs to treat life-threatening diseases. But so few companies know this exception exists that they spend valuable time pursuing more trials.

HEADLINE: Malnutrition Hits Many Elderly

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Despite America's reputation for plenty, 25 percent of people age 65 or older may suffer from some form of malnutrition, experts say.
One half of elderly hospital patients are malnourished, as are two in five nursing home residents. Sixteen percent of all older people consume fewer than 1,000 calories a day. 
 Poverty is an obvious and common cause, but the condition is pervasive even among those who are not poor, the experts say.
"Too often people just focus on economics," said Deborah Clark, staff director of the Nutrition Screening Initiative, a research group lobbying doctors to routinely screen their patients for nutrition. "They think poor people don't have the money to get the right foods.
"That's a risk factor, but we're seeing it regardless of income because of things like medications, oral health, mental health and functional status."
Few doctors are trained to recognize malnutrition, despite knowing that well-nourished elderly people become ill less often, recover from illnesses and injuries quicker and are less expensive to treat, said Julie Stauss, a member of the American Dietetic Association's government affairs team.
"When we say malnutrition we don't mean our typical definition of malnutrition, like a starving child in a third world country," Ms. Stauss said. "You could look at someone and not know that they're malnourished. But since they are malnourished, that puts them at higher risk for additional disease and complications."
Advocates for the elderly want doctors and other health care providers to check their patients' nutritional status as routinely as they check their blood pressure. An American Dietetic Association study showed that for every dollar spent on nutrition screening and intervention, at least $3.25 in medical costs are saved.
Health care workers can gauge nutritional levels accurately by using one of several different questionnaires that ask about a person's eating habits, illnesses, medications, weight, alcohol consumption and social habits.

HEADLINE: Japanese Do Buy American: By Mail and a Lot Cheaper

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 2

 BODY:
Gathered outside a college classroom, Sayaka Fujimoto and six of her friends tore open their packages from the United States, and to the astonishment of their male friends who were watching, pulled out $1,133 worth of Victoria's Secret lingerie.
"We're going to have a sleep-over and wear everything -- like a fashion show," said Miss Fujimoto, a 20-year-old college student who often orders clothes through the mail along with her friends. 
 In Japan, Miss Fujimoto and her friends are part of a growing consumer rebellion, fighting sky-high prices with an American custom: mail orders.
If the recent trade dispute has given the impression that American goods are being held at bay, take a look at the near-doubling in the last year of American imports arriving in Japan by mail. Clothing and camping equipment, fishing tackle and cosmetics are here in record quantities. So are bicycles, musical instruments, even a small helicopter.
In a country where economic indexes all seem to be dropping -- stock prices, property prices, even sales at supermarkets -- mail orders from the United States are soaring.
American companies send hundreds of thousands of catalogues across the Pacific, and Japanese read them as if they were hot suspense novels, keeping them in office drawers for furtive browsing at dull moments. Indeed, mail-order shopping has become a blossoming American success story in Japan.
By conservative estimates, mail orders from the United States this year will total $750 million.
From its headquarters in Freeport, Me., L. L. Bean sends thousands of catalogues to consumers throughout Japan, now Bean's largest foreign market. Sales last year reached $100 million, up 66 percent from 1993.
The volume of packages has swelled so that the United States Postal Service, which handles much of the express mail, dispatched a delegation to Tokyo to improve coordination.
"The mail-order business is very, very promising these days," said Kiyotomo Sakuma, president of Eddie Bauer Japan Inc., whose sporty and casual clothing has become well known in this country.
The rise of the yen, which makes dollar-priced goods cheaper, has helped, and there is also a growing craze to buy what is considered the American look: the preppie at school, the camper in the wilderness, the fly-fisher on a rowboat, the healthy biker.
The Japanese seem to have a little more leisure time these days, and when Japanese think of leisure, their thoughts turn to the United States. Fortunately for American-mail order companies, Japanese are meticulous at getting the sporting look perfect, even if they can't sometimes enjoy the sport.
In Japan, lakes and rivers are so crowded that fishermen, with their eight-pocket jackets and spanking-new tackle boxes, end up sitting on the banks so close together that their rods bump and their lines tangle. And while families may buy American camping gear, the tents can end up pitched in the front yard where the children play.
Some Japanese are captivated by the novelty of buying by mail and avoiding the discomfort of shopping in Tokyo's crowded commercial areas.
They are also able to import small quantities of products like cosmetics or pharmaceuticals, favorite items that are difficult to find at home.
American auto makers and other industries complain that while Japanese tariffs are low, the nation's complex distribution system is a formidable barrier to entry. But catalogue sellers are able to turn that to their advantage, bypassing usual distribution channels. One result is that they enjoy a greater price advantage than in most other nations.
The Japanese mail- and package-delivery system is efficient and, by this country's standards, inexpensive -- although still twice as costly as in the United States. And as Japanese trade negotiators love to say, the average tariff on manufactured goods is only 2.2 percent, lower than in the United States.
Would-be catalogue-sellers still face some of the obstacles that bother the Big Three auto companies, for Japanese consumers are more brand- and quality-conscious than Americans. Instead of simply ordering something because it is cheap, Japanese want to buy from a company that has a reputation for quality.
Inside Tokyo's international post office, which handles most overseas mail, the floors are covered with mail-order parcels, stacked in ceiling-high piles. The overwhelming majority of labels are American: L. L. Bean, Lands' End and REI, to name a few.
The international post office had to hire new employees and clear a new floor to accommodate the increasing number of giant mail sacks, which increased from about 400 a day last year from the whole world to an average recently of 900 sacks just from the United States. Postal officials say that most of this, by volume, is mail-order merchandise, equivalent to about 50,000 pounds each day.
For the moment, it is such a freshly budding business -- the more prevalent domestic mail-order business accounts for 2 to 3 percent of retail sales -- that the Government does not publish statistics on the industry.
Nor does it separate mail-order purchases from other imports into Japan. But some industry experts say that the mail-order business could expand this year to three million packages, up from 2.6 million last year.
A Japanese mail order typically runs about $250, roughly twice an order in the United States. But both the value and the physical size of the orders appear to be increasing. These days, the packages may contain tents, folding bicycles or something even more surprising.
Earlier this year, the Subaru World Trading Company Ltd., which sometimes assists mail-order customers with difficult requests, helped Japanese consumers bring in a small helicopter, a motorboat, a canoe and several harps by express mail. Yet, as with other companies, most of the mail ordering through Subaru, where sales have quadrupled in the last year, consists of clothing for women and children.
The popularity of American catalogues is notable, given that the mail-order business has had to overcome obstacles that included a seedy reputation.
"Japanese mail-order companies used to be thought of as down-market, and people used to buy things like socks, nylons, underwear and sexually related things like sex toys and adult videos," said Sawako Takahashi, a spokeswoman at Lands' End in Tokyo. "You couldn't trust the quality. If you bought nylons, you could only wear them once, but they were so cheap you didn't care."
Still, with Japan's inefficient, costly producers raising prices from high to outrageous, consumers are increasingly abandoning that old distaste for mail-order merchandise.
There are other problems, born of distance or unfamiliarity. Many Japanese consumers complain that American sizes are too large, that they cannot touch or feel the fabrics and other merchandise, or that they cannot read the English in the catalogues. So several American companies, like L. L. Bean and Eddie Bauer, a unit of Spiegel, have opened complementary store outlets, even if this means that customers try on the clothes and run home to order by catalogue at cheaper prices.
Lands' End, Eddie Bauer and other companies have also set up Japanese-language mail-order operations, sending out catalogs in Japanese and American-made merchandise from warehouses in Japan. Sales at those operations seem to be buoyant, even though the same goods may be 20 percent to 70 percent more expensive than in the United States. Others, like L. L. Bean and REI, rely on English-language catalogues, but insert Japanese order forms.
These days, mail-order companies in the United States can send their merchandise by plane to arrive at homes in Japan within 5 to 10 days at a moderate cost. Purchasers do have to pay duty, but even with these extra costs the American merchandise is significantly cheaper than Japanese goods are. But with duty, returns can be messy, and getting the Government to refund a duty payment can be a real chore.
And even avid mail-order purchasers are known to complain about the quality of American goods.
"With products imported from America sometimes, the buttonholes are not sewn very well so they come apart," said Kaori Morozumi, a 33-year-old jewelry designer who spends up to $1,000 on mail-order goods several times a year. "There are deficiencies that Japanese products just wouldn't have."

HEADLINE: Cartoonists See a Future That's No Joking Matter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, June 30

 BODY:
Ted Rall, mop-headed antiestablishment political cartoonist, has abundant talent, a 1,400-drawing portfolio, seven years' experience, the acclaim of peers and the approval of newspaper editors who, every so often, print his work. What he lacks is someone who will hire him full-time.
"People have been telling me I'll find a job for seven years now," he said, sprawled glumly on a sofa at the downtown Stouffer's here. "I'm not going to find a job. There are no jobs." 
 No wonder the nation's editorial cartoonists look a bit drawn. In their hearts, they say, they are brilliant and incisive social analysts whose savage wit can change the very course of current events. They also confess to "wildly inflated egos," as one of them put it.
Taken as a whole, however, they fear they are becoming the buggy-whip makers of American journalism, accessorizers to a business -- newspapers -- that is the industry's horse-drawn carriage. And they are beginning to look at new venues like the Internet.
At the annual meeting of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists here recently, the president, Signe Wilkinson, counted 168 members, some 120 of whom were employed by daily newspapers. Cartoonists for six dailies are losing their outlets: those at the Evening Sun of Baltimore; the St. Petersburg Times; the Houston Post; the Chicago Tribune; the Providence Journal, and the Seattle Times.
Some of these newspapers, such as the Tribune, simply decided that full-time cartoonists were an expensive frill in an era of rising newsprint costs and bottom-line publishers. Others, like the Post and the Evening Sun -- themselves vanished, killed by dwindling readership and growing electronic competition.
"There are a lot of papers left that do back up their cartoonists, and I hope they'll be the model," said Ms. Wilkinson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist at the Philadelphia Daily News. "Maybe what's happening is that we're weeding the weaker newspapers out."
Maybe. When the Providence papers merged the Bulletin into the morning Journal earlier this year, the publisher elected to end the contract of the Journal's cartoonist "for essentially economic reasons," said Robert Whitcomb, the editorial page editor of the surviving paper, the Journal-Bulletin. Mr. Whitcomb said the paper chose to plow more money into local news coverage and to buy cartoons from features suppliers known as syndicates.
But editorial cartoonists, a prickly lot, tend to take it more personally. "We're seen as one of the fringe elements of newspapers," said Rob Rogers, a cartoonist who moved to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette when the city's other paper, the Press, ceased publishing. "So when something has to be cut, who's first in the food chain?"
Truth be told, however, the economics of the business are working against the cartoonists. Established artists, mostly at big papers, get an increasing share of their income from the syndicates, which bundle their works into packages that are sold to virtually all papers and magazines of consequence. This allows local papers to get a well-known name and style for their opinion pages. On a price-per-cartoon basis, local artists simply cannot compete.
"If an editor can get Walt Handelsman and Steve Kelley for ten bucks a week, why would he pay $70,000 a year for a guy in his hometown?" asked Mr. Handelsman, a cartoonist at the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
Mr. Handelsman was, of course, speaking rhetorically; both he and Mr. Kelley, a syndicated cartoonist at the San Diego Union-Tribune, grouse that that syndicates have given newspaper editorial pages all the spice and variety of shopping malls. One outcome is that some artists like Mr. Rall now break into the business not through newspapers, but by syndicating their own work.
But the ultimate result, the cartoonists say, is that the remaining local artists have had to scramble to make themselves indispensable, or at least less offensive, to their bosses. Some say cartoonists are under greater pressure to pull their punches, so as not to offend advertisers or the publisher's golf partners; this year's cartoonists' convention included a display of some 30 cartoons that never made it to press, and a Golden Spike award for the best example of such censorship.
Others are trying to survive by branching into computer media. Mr. Rall signs his E-mail address to each cartoon he syndicates, and reports "a terrific response" from readers and a steady, if small income from readers seeking reprints. Mr. Rall also has a site on the World Wide Web called Tool User Comics (http:/ /www.tooluser.com).
Larry Wright, a cartoonist at the Detroit News, is designing the newspaper's new site on the Internet with editorial cartoons as a regular feature. He has come to believe that is the wave of the future, and that "flat, dead-tree" cartooning -- his words for two-dimensional newspaper art -- will dwindle in importance. The News site will encourage readers to talk back by E-mail.
Eventually, he predicts, editorial cartoons will be computer-animated -- The Simpsons, after all, is the work of a political cartoonist who could not break into mainstream newspapers. "Why not?" he said. "If the technology's there, why shouldn't a cartoonist change his thinking about the concept of a cartoon? Why wouldn't he stop thinking of starting with flat cartoons and then trying to animate them, and just begin with animation?"

Where the Rent-Stabilized Rental Units Are.

 BODY:
More than a million rental units in the city are regulated by either rent-control or rent-stabilization programs.
 
Rent control applies to about 100,000 pre-war apartments. Tenants have no leases, and rent increases are limited to 7.5 percent a year. When a tenant moves or dies, a landlord may raise the rent to nearly the market value, and the aprtment becomes rent stabilized.
 
Rent stabilization applies to about 900,000 post-war units. A state board ties rent increases roughly to inflation and to the landlord's maintenance costs.
Last week the Rent Guidelines Board approved increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for four-year leases for all of the city's 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments.

HEADLINE: George Elbert, 83; Wrote of Cooking And Indoor Plants

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
George A. Elbert, who collaborated with his wife, Virginie, on a score of cookbooks and books about indoor plants, died on Thursday in the New York University Medical Center. He was 83 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
The cause was congestive heart failure, Mrs. Elbert said. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Elbert's books were published from 1968 to 1991. Almost all of the books were illustrated with photographs taken by the couple.
Joan Lee Faust, the garden writer for The New York Times, wrote in a review of the couple's 1973 book "Fun With Terrarium Gardening," "Their pleasures are conveyed in the many novel ideas for plants to grow and containers to grow them in."
The couple's other books include "Foliage Plants for Decorating Indoors" (Timber Press, 1989), "Dolci: The Fabulous Desserts of Italy" (1987, Simon & Schuster) and "Down-Island Caribbean Cookery" (1991, Simon & Schuster).
Mr. Elbert also wrote about cooking and indoor plants for magazines including Ladies Home Journal, Gourmet, Horticulture, Houseplant Magazine and Woman's Day. And he wrote articles, on the same topics, for The New York Times.
The Elberts also helped to found the Indoor Gardening Society.
Mr. Elbert was born in Manhattan, the son of August and Blanche Elbert, and grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y. After graduating from a boarding school in Zurich, he received a degree in economics from the University of Heidelberg.
He worked for three decades as a New York-based importer and exporter of chemicals, successively for his father, in partnership with his brother Edwin, and with other associates. He also traded on the New York Produce Exchange.
In addition to his wife, the former Virginie Fowler, he is survived by a daughter, Suzanne, of Washington, and a grandson.

HEADLINE: South Africa Lifts Bank Rate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
South Africa's central bank has raised its bank rate by one percentage point, to 15 percent, to counter inflation, the bank's governor said last week.
The bank rate is the rate at which the South African Reserve Bank makes loans to banks. By raising the rate -- the third increase since a new Government was elected in April 1994 -- the central bank hopes to slow the economy to contain inflation while allowing enough growth to finance its reconstruction program. 
 "It's very positive for the market and it needed to be done," said Dave Wright, vice president of fixed income at Smith Borkum Hare Inc. in New York.
The South African rand rose against the dollar on the news.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Paradise Enow?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Generations of American visitors have fallen in love with Italy. It offered what home so often did not: beauty, passion, history, sensuality in food and clothes and life. With their revolving governments, Italians might not order their politics as efficiently as we did; but they knew how to live.
What few of us noticed, in our romance, was that postwar Italy carried off an economic miracle. It made itself the world's fifth-largest industrial economy. And it did that, handling the resulting social strains without compromising individual liberty. 
 Now the country is going through a political transformation just as dramatic as the economic. For three years magistrates have been exposing corrupt links between business and politics. As a result, the political parties that ran things for 50 years have simply disappeared. In the present Parliament, elected last year, three-quarters of the members have never held office before.
The figures may make Rome sound like today's Washington, with its legions of radical Republicans new to office; but the two are entirely different. Italian politics is not driven by ideological zealotry. The challenge, and the fascination of it, is of another character.
In those decades of short-lived governments -- 54 of them since 1945 -- the Italian state grew fat and lazy. The political parties, working with one another in successive arrangements, lived by the art of the indecisive deal. The bureaucracy grew ever more arrogant and inefficient.
The state ducked hard financial problems by borrowing. When governments have an average life of nine months, it is easy to avoid responsibility and say to yourself that those who come after us will pay.
Italy's national debt today is 25 percent more than its annual gross domestic product. That is twice as much as the target set by the European Union. Unless Italy brings its debt down, it may find itself relegated to a second tier of the E.U.
The country's current economic performance is terrific. Inflation is declining, and Italy had the biggest rise in industrial production last year of any developed country. But the good news does not dispel alarm about the overhanging shadows of debt and bloated government.
To deal with the problems Italy now has a government of a kind virtually unknown elsewhere, one led by nonpolitical technicians. The Prime Minister, Lamberto Dini, used to be director general of the Bank of Italy.
Mr. Dini has made a good start on the financial challenge. The budget deficit is coming down sharply. He is pushing legislation to reform the national pension scheme so that it no longer promises pie in the sky. Experts say the reform is not strong enough but at least is a start -- which is more than some other European countries can say.
In fact, the Dini Government has been so effective that some people are tempted to think the country would run better without politicians. But in the long run, and not very long, the really tough changes that are needed can only be made if they have the democratic legitimacy of political choice. That means an election.
An election could lead to more decisiveness in government than Italy is used to. Whenever it comes, voters will have a choice between two main blocs, center-right and center-left, instead of the myriad parties of the old system.
But one significant party is staying out of the blocs. That is the Northern League, which stands for ending subsidies to poorer regions. When I asked its leader, Umberto Bossi, where he would throw his weight after the next election, he said, "We can work with either the moderate left or the moderate right." He hopes, that is, to be the balance of power -- which would probably mean old-style government by deal.
In the end, Italians may want a more efficient state -- but not at the price of changing the special qualities of the way they live. In a referendum last month they rejected a proposal to expand shopping hours, making shopkeepers stay open longer. I asked the leader of the center-left, Romano Prodi, about that. He is an apostle of competition and efficiency, but he said:
"We don't want cities like yours, in which nobody walks! You can't be doctrinaire [about efficiency]. You need small shops. In Bologna we work like mad. But we are a gregarious people -- we like to walk, to talk, to relax."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
The Root of Devils' Unrest Is Unwritten Promise in '82

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
From the day he became the New Jersey Devils' owner in 1982, John McMullen believes, he was deceived by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. Now that he admits erring in relocating the former Colorado Rockies to his home state, he is seeking to create the legal right to relocate to Nashville.
"They don't give a damn about us," he said recently, referring to the authority. "Aren't I entitled to break even?" He said that the Devils' Stanley Cup-winning season added a $2 million loss to his $18 million deficit. 
 McMullen's fight for radically new personal economics at Byrne Meadowlands Arena led last week to declaring twice that he would terminate his lease, first in 1997, and then this Thursday. The authority swiftly sued the team to prevent the termination and keep the team from moving.
In what may indicate progress in talks held since last Thursday, lawyers for the team and the authority have agreed to postpone the Devils' termination notice for a week, as well as a hearing that was scheduled before Judge Peter Ciolino of Superior Court in Hackensack, N.J., at 9 A.M. today, said Joel Kobert, the authority's general counsel.
"Everyone is encouraged and they'll keep talking this week," he said yesterday.
The landlord-tenant imbroglio, rooted in what McMullen says was an oral promise of a perpetually packed arena, reached a boil last December when the authority suspended the team's lease during the National Hockey League lockout, a maneuver that the team insists was designed to deprive it of luxury suite revenue.
But McMullen has always pointed to this promise in 1982:
"The authority has continually and repeatedly represented that the authority would deliver a base of 19,000 fans at the arena," the team charged in court papers filed Friday. The Devils have "lost millions of dollars" because of that unfulfilled, albeit unwritten, promise. "I was promised 19,000 fans and they never gave us a chance to produce them," McMullen said.
Although the authority has granted two rounds of concessions since 1986 -- which it values at $33 million when fully realized by 2002 -- the team has never felt they were enough. At various times, McMullen has suggested running the arena, creating a cable sports network for Devils and Nets games and, most important, adding new luxury boxes to the arena's complement of 29.
"We found it was architecturally sound to build 48 more," said McMullen, a naval engineer and architect, "but even if that happened, it wouldn't compare to the new arenas."
To understand the Devils' financial underperformance at Byrne Arena, he said, one must visit the Fleet Center, the Bruins' new home, which has 104 suites. But McMullen said the ancient Boston Garden was a better deal for the Bruins than Byrne Arena is for the Devils.
The advent of new arenas from which teams receive the lion's share of revenues and the alleged long-term mistreatment by the authority have now led McMullen into open battle. The authority has responded by accusing McMullen of concocting 13 defaults in the lease as a subterfuge to take Nashville's sweetheart deal.
Whatever McMullen's strategy, he omitted public relations. He sent his first notice of default to the authority hours before the Devils' June 25 Stanley Cup victory. And just hours before its victory parade Wednesday, the team filed its second notice. The authority swiftly announced the action in a news release, rankling McMullen. Then the authority promptly sued the team.
While last week's rush of negotiations may indicate that the war of paperwork aggression is largely hard-line posturing, the talks cannot mask the palpable anger the Devils feel about their 13-year tenancy at the Meadowlands.
"The authority has treated Meadowlanders shabbily for years," the team said in court papers, referring to its corporate name. "Meadowlanders does contend that it should not be forced to remain yoked to the authority's continuing bad faith and contractual defaults."
Twice, the Devils alleged, authority officials advised the team to leave if it did not like life at Byrne Arena. In a March 1994 meeting described in an affidavit by Lou Lamoriello, the Devils president, he referred to the authority's chairman, Michael Francis, saying, "Mr. Francis went so far as to say that Dr. McMullen 'was the last person that [he could] help' because Dr. McMullen had supported Governor Whitman in her political campaign." Later, Lamoriello quoted Francis as saying, " 'Well, maybe you have to leave.' " He quoted Robert E. Mulcahy, the authority's president, as making a similar statement.
The Devils ridiculed the authority's argument that the loss of the Devils to Nashville would cause irreparable economic and psychological harm.
The authority "indicts itself by arguing that the relocation of a professional sports franchise violates the rights of the general public," the Devils charged, citing the migration of the Nets, the Giants and the Jets to New Jersey, and its wooing the Yankees to leave the Bronx. "Simply put, the authority has never acted as if it believes the arguments it is now making."
The Devils' position found backing in a poll published yesterday in The Record of Hackensack, which found that 68 percent of those surveyed in Bergen and Passaic counties opposed using tax money to keep the Devils in New Jersey, and 51 percent said it mattered little to keep the team in the Garden State.
Although she has said she would do what is prudent to keep the team from leaving, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has stopped short at throwing money at the Devils.
The Devils said that talks aimed at reaching "an alternative agreement," presumably with Nashville, were justified because the authority has not resolved the 13 defaults that have allegedly deprived them of $11 million.
It would be "imprudent for Meadowlanders not to engage in such negotiations with the authority and/ or others given that the agreement may terminate in a week," the team said. It added that the authority "should not be permitted to rummage about in the alleged negotiations" because the dispute is not about relocation, but who breached whom.
The authority said it has remedied all 13 alleged defaults. But in his affidavit, Mulcahy said the defaults "are nothing more than a pretext designed to allow the defendant to remove the Devils from the state of New Jersey." The Devils, he said, breached the lease by talking to Nashville.
Nashville Mayor Philip Bredesen said last week that he had met twice with McMullen last fall about moving the team, but backed off when he felt that McMullen still had a valid lease. McMullen has never admitted to talking to Bredesen, who said Lamoriello accompanied McMullen on one of the visits. "It's nobody's business when we went to Nashville," Lamoriello recently said.
In describing the Devils' "poorly concealed attempt to bring hockey to the home of the Grand Ole Opry," the authority said that "if the Devils were not seeking to play its games elsewhere and were instead simply trying to resolve their differences with the authority, McMullen would have unambiguously proclaimed that the team would be returning to New Jersey."
It added the Devils "have allowed their negotiations with Nashville officials to become public in an effort to render the authority short-handed" and "exhibited an embarrassing lack of proper business demeanor, good faith and sincerity."

HEADLINE: CUNY Restructures for a Fiscal Crisis That Doesn't Exist;
College, a Privilege

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a graduate of CUNY (Brooklyn College), I support the tightening of remedial education at the four-year colleges (news article, June 27). It is a necessary step to attempt to balance the system's budget. 
 A college education should be available to everyone. But it is a privilege to be earned through academic achievement, not a basic right granted through special favors.
CUNY's solution strikes the appropriate balance. Remedial classes should be available, but students should not be able to endlessly fail and repeat the same low-level courses. Ideally, remedial education should be completed in high school. When that is not the case, night school or community college is more appropriate.
This is an example for the city and society of the type of balance needed to maintain the opportunities opened in the 1960's while meeting the tougher educational and economic challenges of the 90's and the next century.

HEADLINE: For the Young, It's Looking Like a Jobless Summer;
The Hunt for Work Is Taking On an Air of Futility as Openings Grow Scarcer

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Around the Queens housing complex where 17-year-old Cynthia Roman lives, the search for a summer job has taken on a depressing air of futility.
For weeks, Ms. Roman has been applying for jobs at retail outlets around the city, but no one calls with an offer. "If I don't find one, I'll just hang around the projects -- broke, hot and thirsty," she said. 
 Some teen-agers in her neighborhood, she said, have already become frustrated enough to consider shoplifting popular labeled clothing -- Nautica, Polo and Hilfiger -- from department stores in Manhattan and selling it on the streets. "There's a lot of pressure in New York to have money and have things," she said. "Without jobs this summer, it's going to be more kids in the streets doing crime."
In New York City and throughout the region, the demand for summer jobs is outweighing the supply. In New York City alone, about 55,000 youths applied for the 35,000 minimum-wage jobs that begin this week in libraries, hospitals, parks and recreations centers through the city-administered Summer Youth Employment Program.
Last summer, the unemployment rate for those between the ages of 16 to 19 in New York City was 29.4 percent. In New York State, it was 18.6 percent, and in New Jersey 16 percent. This summer will most likely be worse, according to economists and labor market professionals.
"The economy was moving ahead last year," said John Wieting, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's regional commissioner. "This year it's flattening. It's not a great job market."
At the same time, Federally funded jobs are drying up. In 1992, New York City received enough money through the Federal Job Training Partnership Act to provide 52,000 jobs; in 1993, the number dropped to 47,000, and last year it was down to 35,000. This year the figure is 32,000 -- augmented by an additional 3,000 jobs financed by the city. But Congress has eliminated financing for the program in 1996, leaving its future in doubt. Nationwide, the Federal Government finances 615,000 jobs through the job training program.
Summer jobs in the private sector have also declined. In 1993, New York City's largest private summer-jobs program, sponsored by the New York City Partnership, hired 36,000 youths. Last year, the partnership, an organization of local chief executives and leaders of universities, nonprofit and civic groups, could offer only 20,000 summer jobs.
Officials at Jobs for Youth in New York City can attest to the shortage. Of 100 college students who are enrolled in one of its summer jobs programs, only 20 have found work. In another program, half of the 400 students enrolled have not been placed.
"We're turning to the private sector to pick up the slack, but it doesn't seem to be happening as much as we'd like," said Linda McLaughlin, an employment specialist at Jobs for Youth. "One of the trends we've found is that students are settling, they're lowering their standards. High school kids are getting shut out of a lot of jobs because college kids are taking the jobs they normally would get. College kids are performing menial task like stuffing envelopes, filing or cleaning up."
For many, like Colleen Clark, a junior at Cornell University, the search for work has been full of frustration. "Every time I go to apply for a job, there are these people in their 30's who are there applying," said Ms. Clark, a 20-year-old Queens resident. "No one wants to hire me because I'm only going to be at home until August. They want someone with experience, but I'm in school all year long."
To be sure, many students are finding summer jobs, and one of the bright spots is tourism. The weak dollar is attracting foreign visitors and increasing the demand at places that count on youth helpers in the summer, like tour companies, parks and museums.
Through the Academy of Travel and Tourism, a partnership between private companies and six public schools, more than 100 students who just completed 11th grade have found jobs on tour buses, in hotels, gifts shops and travel agencies. "We've placed every eligible student in the program this year," said Richard Graziano, director of the eight-year-old effort to prepare high school students for careers in the tourism industry. Mr. Graziano warned that a possible hotel strike in the city could drastically alter things. "We don't want to send kids across the picket lines," he said.
On Long Island, where tourism is strong, Gary Huth, a market analyst for the New York State Department of Labor, said it should be a good summer for jobs near the beach. "We got an early jump on the season this year with the U.S. Open Golf Tournament, which was played in the Hamptons," Mr. Huth said. "That gave a nice boost to the economy and a lot of early job opportunities. But whether that left employers kind of flush and ready to hire more remains to be seen."
Though many of her friends are having a tough time finding jobs, Michele Borg, who lives in the village of Bayville, L.I., on Long Island Sound, is working for the third summer in a row at Marine West, a boating and marine supply store in Syosset, L.I. Ms. Borg, a 21-year-old senior at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., said she was originally able to land her job because she comes from a family that spends a lot of time sailing and she has taken a number of sailing and boating safety courses. Now, Marine West hires her each summer, she said, because "they want people with experience."
Some students who do not have work experience have been savvy enough to learn how to enhance their marketability. They start their searches early, develop contacts, attend job fairs and even volunteer to gain experience. Volunteering can be tough for a student who needs to save for school, but it beats sitting around all summer and it often leads to decent positions that pay, many say.
Kerwin Lawrence, 20, of Brooklyn, a junior at St. John's University, said he was earning a competitive salary this summer as an intern in the marketing department of the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. His first two jobs, he said, were as a volunteer at Coney Island Hospital and Bellevue Hospital Center. "Employers see volunteer work as an asset," Mr. Lawrence said.
Carolyn Serrano, another summer intern at the accounting firm, has been aggressively pursued by would-be employers. A 20-year-old junior at Pace University, Ms. Serrano left her job in the finance department at the Henri Bendel store to accept a similar job at Deloitte & Touche. Henri Bendel has asked her to come back and work part-time when school resumes, and although some of Ms. Serrano's classmates have found summer jobs, "they're all jealous of me because they wanted to work at a big firm, too," she said.
However, the size of the company is irrelevant for many unemployed youths. For Ms. Roman, the young Queens resident, a summer job will mean an escape from her housing project, where she said most teenagers are thus far spending the summer "sitting outside on the benches, drinking, whatever."
Ms. Roman, a senior at Fashion Industries High School in Manhattan, said she thought she would be able to parlay the experience she gained last fall working part-time at Toys 'R' Us into a full-time retail job this summer. She has applied at The Gap, Foot Locker, Modell's and Sloan's.
With her asymmetrical haircut, a nose ring, and pristine high-top white tennis shoes, Ms. Roman said she thinks store managers "stereotype" her when she walks through the door. "I think they have this image thing," she said. "They want you to dress and look a certain way. After I fill out the application, no one ever calls back."
Complicating matters for job-seeking teen-agers like herself, she said, is the plight of her 21-year-old brother. Married, with a year-old baby and another on the way, he is struggling to support his family by working full time at McDonald's, she said. "Older people like my brother work at Mickey D's now, so even they don't have jobs available," she said.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Reveals A Man's Plan To Blow Up A Courthouse

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., July 1

 BODY:
Federal agents say that they have uncovered a plot to use a fertilizer bomb to destroy the United States Courthouse here, but that the conspiracy appears to have no connection to the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
According to newly released court documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about the Spokane plot from an informer eight days after the April 19 Oklahoma City blast, which killed 167 people and injured more than 400. 
 The suspect was identified in the documents as Darwin Michael Gray, 27, of Spokane, an unemployed insulation installer.
According to a confidential Washington State Patrol intelligence bulletin, circulated to police agencies throughout the state, Mr. Gray stole blueprints of the courthouse while working for a company that installed insulation in the building. The company later dismissed him, but declined to say why.
The F.B.I. informer, who is not identified in the court papers, told the authorities about the blueprints and said Mr. Gray had detonated practice fertilizer bombs before the Oklahoma City explosion.
Federal employees familiar with the investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the practice devices were exploded in a rural area of Pend Oreille County in northeastern Washington.
After the F.B.I. learned of the plot on April 27, the General Services Administration, which manages the Spokane building, installed portable concrete barriers on the courthouse plaza to keep vehicles away. The G.S.A. and the United States Marshals Service, which provides security for five Federal judges in the building, also hired additional building guards.
The case was given high priority, Federal officials said, because the suspect has ties to the white supremacy group, Aryan Nations, based in nearby Hayden Lake, Idaho.
Mr. Gray is an acquaintance of Randall C. Weaver, a white separatist who now lives in Iowa, and a stepbrother of Kevin Harris of Republic, Wash., the authorities say. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Harris were involved in a standoff with the authorities in August 1992 after Federal marshals went to Mr. Weaver's mountaintop cabin on Ruby Ridge, Idaho, to arrest him on charges of selling sawed-off shotguns to an informer for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Mr. Gray was a visible and vocal opponent of the Federal agents at Ruby Ridge. At the start of the confrontation a Federal marshal and Mr. Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sammy, were killed. The next day an F.B.I. sniper mistakenly shot and killed Mr. Weaver's wife, Vickie. After a 10-day siege Mr. Weaver surrendered, but was subsequently exonerated on conspiracy charges.
Agents who investigated the Weaver case are based in the Federal building and courthouse in Spokane's downtown business district.
Mr. Gray has not been charged in the bombing plot, but remains in the Spokane County Jail without bond on Federal drug and firearms charges.
He was arrested on May 5 by A.T.F. agents who found firearms and 43 marijuana plants growing in the basement of his home here.
The agents did not find bomb-making chemicals or components, but they did seize three bomb-making publications, including one about homemade detonators, according to court documents.
"It remains an open investigation at this point," said Assistant United States Attorney Earl Hicks.
Mr. Gray has declined requests for interviews. His court-appointed lawyer denies that he was involved in a bombing scheme.
The court documents were sealed and kept from public inspection until Thursday, when Federal prosecutors had to return to court after Mr. Gray sought release from jail.
Mr. Hicks argued successfully that Mr. Gray posed a risk of flight and was a danger to the community, and that he should remain in jail without bail until his trial on the marijuana charges in mid-July.
The court documents say the F.B.I. "received information from a concerned citizen that Darwin Michael Gray and another individual were involved in the manufacture and testing of destructive devices, more specifically, fertilizer bombs."
They also say the informer reported that Mr. Gray and David Plunkett of Clayton, Wash., near Spokane, had been detonating "progressively larger fertilizer bombs at an unknown location in the woods for approximately one and one-half months" before April 27.
In an interview with Federal agents on May 5, the court documents say, Mr. Gray admitted he had used fertilizer and other explosives in the past, but only "for stump removal."
Mr. Plunkett said he knew nothing about Mr. Gray's activities, the documents say. Efforts to reach Mr. Plunkett were unsuccessful.

HEADLINE: Economist Is Said to Enter A Six-Month Drug Program

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Lawrence A. Kudlow, the former Wall Street economist, went to Minneapolis yesterday to check into a long-term, residential drug treatment program at Hazelden Foundation, his wife, Judith, said.
Mr. Kudlow, 47, agreed to undergo the six-month Hazelden program, where Kitty Dukakis, Eric Clapton and other well-known people have sought help, after three shorter treatments in the last two and half years for cocaine and alcohol habits, his wife said yesterday. 
 Fifteen months ago, Mr. Kudlow made a highly public confession of his drug problem shortly after he was forced to resign as chief economist at Bear Stearns. He also made a fresh career start as a conservative political commentator for television and magazines and said he believed that he had overcome his addiction.
But over the weekend, court papers filed by Mrs. Kudlow indicated that he may have lost his battle against cocaine. In a filing on Thursday, she petitioned the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan for a divorce and an order to prevent Mr. Kudlow from tapping their Bear Stearn's retirement account to pay for a weeks-long cocaine binge. "The defendant will use such money to buy cocaine," she stated in an affidavit, "and in so doing will likely suffer a fatal overdose and will dissipate the only remaining liquid marital assets."
Mr. Kudlow could not be reached for comment yesterday. A Hazelden spokesman said the treatment center could not say whether or not a patient had checked in because of Federal regulations.
Mr. Kudlow's apparent setback comes a time when he appeared to have turned his career around. After losing his $800,000-a-year Wall Street job, Mr. Kudlow landed quickly on his feet. His disclosure of cocaine problems in an interview with The New York Times prompted an outpouring of sympathy. He landed a consulting position at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
And Mr. Kudlow, who was President Ronald Reagan's budget director and considered one of the brighter lights in the New York Republican Party, regained his political footing. He became economics editor of the conservative magazine National Review and started dispensing political advice again, sharing a platform with Gov. Christine Whitman of New Jersey. Indeed, Mr. Kudlow had urged her to cut taxes sharply, an issue that helped sweep her into office.
As recently as several weeks ago, Mr. Kudlow seemed to have regained his former professional stature. He shared a dais last month with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, when he addressed New York's financial elite. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Kudlow was appointed by Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing under President George Bush, to a commission to study how best to cut taxes. Always immaculately dressed and ready with a clever line, Mr. Kudlow seemed always to be racing between television studios and from speech to speech.
There were occasional signs of stress: the client presentation at Montgomery Securities that he missed or missed deadlines at the National Review. In the end, the occasional slip turned into something far more frightening.
"He had slips but he was sober for big intervals," Mrs. Kudlow said in a telephone interview. "He was doing everything. He was going to A.A. He was going to church. He was seeing his counselor. He was determined to overcome this, but it just overpowered him."
According to Mrs. Kudlow, her husband initially resisted the idea of long-term treatment, which is expensive, disruptive and almost impossible to hide, even though two monthlong and one weeklong treatment program had not been enough. Instead, he turned more to drugs.
In the end, she said she decided to act. Mrs. Kudlow, a former press secretary for the Department of Justice and now a painter, said she did not intend to end her marriage to Mr. Kudlow. The divorce action, she said, was a legal device to keep him from using the money to buy more cocaine. As it turned out, she added, it also helped convince Mr. Kudlow that he had to take drastic measures.
"It came down to saving his life," she said. "I have no intention of divorcing him, but I had to take a hard line."
What happens now? Mrs. Kudlow said she looks forward to life together with him but a very different one from the fast-paced, high profile existence the couple shared in Manhattan. She said in the affidavit that she planned to sell their apartments to pay for Mr. Kudlow's treatment and to begin a new life outside of New York City with her husband.

More Open Latin Borders Mirror Region's Freer Markets

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 3

 BODY:
Latin America's free-trade mood, though overshadowed by the Mexican financial crisis and war between Peru and Ecuador, is expansive, reflected best perhaps by the new express lanes at Brazil's international airports.
With cursory nods, the police wave through thousands of passport bearers from the nations of Mercosul, the common market of the South -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
 Jets that shuttle hourly between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires carried 1.3 million passengers last year, twice as many as four years earlier. In 1994, four times as many business executives from Mercosul countries visited Brazil as did executives from the United States.
Eager to take advantage of Latin America's move toward free trade, United States officials played host in Denver last weekend to 33 trade ministers from the Americas. Officials from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile agreed to meet in Mexico City on July 25 to start negotiating Chile's entrance into an expanded version of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
And raising hopes that Chile would join the group early next year, Republican Congressional leaders indicated last week that they would work with the White House to win approval of "fast track" authority for negotiating an agreement with the Chileans.
"The three amigos have become four amigos, or at least we hope so by the end of the year," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in Denver. "We have made a marvelous start to establishing a free-trade area for the Americas."
Looking beyond Chile, the trade ministers agreed to start working on the creation, by 2005, of a hemisphere-wide customs union, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, lecturing doubters among 1,000 business executives in attendance, said that United States exports to Latin America had doubled since 1989, now nearly reaching the level of those with Europe. This year, the United States expects a $2 billion trade surplus with Brazil -- one of its few significant trade surpluses worldwide.
By 2010, officials in Washington calculate, the United States will export more to Latin America than to Europe and Japan combined.
While all the negotiations are expected to take years, two essential building blocks for a Western Hemisphere trade zone are taking shape -- Latin American multinational corporations and regional free-trade groups.
Cross-border financial ventures are increasingly routine. In recent deals, for instance, an Ecuadorean bank bought a Colombian bank, a Colombian bank bought a Venezuelan bank, and a Chilean bank bought a Bolivian bank.
Mauro Saccomani Moreira, export manager of Tintas Renner S.A., Brazil's largest paint company, championed the use of joint ventures. "In many countries it is difficult to participate in markets by sending paint from Brazil," he said, so Renner adopted joint-venture tactics. Now with local partners, the company has paint factories in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Renner is one of 300 Brazilian companies now operating in Argentina, and in Brazil, there are 100 Argentine companies. Chile, a leader in Latin American multinationals, has 170 companies in Argentina and dozens in Peru.
Provida, Chile's largest private pension fund, has invested in funds in Peru and Colombia, and is entering Bolivia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
Telecomunicaciones de Chile, that country's largest private phone company, has invested in telephone companies in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, and is considering investments in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Paraguay.
Over all, intra-Latin trade has grown to 25 percent of the region's total, from 10 percent a decade ago. With this surge, business leaders are pressing their governments to allow private companies to improve roads and communication. Copying the Mercosul system of express passport lanes, the five nations of the Andean Pact -- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- later this year plan to introduce a regional passport, the Andean Migration Card.
As Brazilian trade with Argentina runs at five times the 1990 level, Brazil is reviewing 14 proposals from construction companies to link the two nations, the largest in South America.
"Mercosul will develop faster than Nafta in the next few years," Henry A. Kissinger, the former American Secretary of State, predicted in Sao Paulo in April, after a visit to Buenos Aires. "My impression was that the Argentines believed that their future and Brazil's future are closely linked."
Mercosul, which has been in full operation only since Jan. 1, has created its own constituency. Early in the year, Brazilian businesses with investments in Argentina created Grupo Brasil, a lobby dedicated to defending the free-trade pact against protectionist attacks.
Not everyone has prospered in every respect. After three years of trade surpluses with Argentina, Brazil is veering toward a deficit this year as high as $1 billion. Indeed, two weeks ago, O Globo, Rio's largest-selling daily newspaper, carried an article headlined "Mercosul Trade Accord Damages Brazil."
Mercosul encountered its first major crisis in mid-June, Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, decided to halve his country's car imports for the second half of this year. President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina objected, saying that auto-import quotas violated Mercosul agreements, and he threatened to boycott a regional meeting of heads of state in Sao Paulo. After negotiations, Mr. Cardoso exempted Argentina from the import quotas and gave both sides until mid-July to negotiate a solution.
"We don't want any restriction that wounds Mercosul," the Brazilian leader said. "The bulk of the car imports come from Europe and not from Argentina."
Predicting that the United States would move slowly to extend the North American trade agreement south, Brazilian diplomats are working overtime to hammer out accords with the other countries of South America.
"Our intention is to conclude talks with Chile by November," Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, Brazil's principal trade negotiator, said today by phone from Montevideo, Uruguay. "A breakthrough with Chile would accelerate talks with the others."
Bolivia and Venezuela are also eager to negotiate duty-free trade status with Mercosul, which would hasten the Andean Pact's drift into what Brazilians are informally calling Safta -- the South American Free Trade Association.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Pullback

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 3

 BODY:
President Clinton's credentials as a free-trader seemed substantial. But now he is in danger of tarnishing his record.
Mr. Clinton enthusiastically supported the world trade liberalization talks that concluded last year under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the creation of its successor, the World Trade Organization. 
 The year before, after initial hesitation, he pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the President now hopes to extend it beyond Mexico and Canada, to nations of South America, beginning with Chile. Beyond that, he endorses a Pacific Basin free-trade zone and has not ruled out a a free-trade area encompassing North America and Europe.
But in quarreling with Japan over access to its automotive market, the Clinton Administration threatened to impose sanctions, bypassing the World Trade Organization's new arbitration machinery.
More recently, the United States pulled out of global talks aimed at lowering cross-border barriers to companies engaged in financial services, and today it announced that it would investigate charges by Eastman Kodak that its rival, Fuji Photo Film, had conspired to deny it access to the Japanese market.
The auto dispute was settled by the two nations last week, and even if the United States had imposed sanctions, Japan would have taken the matter to the World Trade Organization. But Washington's refusal to participate in a global pact on financial services represents a potentially more serious threat to the new world trading system.
The Clinton Administration says it will not open the American market to all financial-services companies seeking entry unless fast-growing Asian and Latin American economies offer greater access to their own markets to American banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms. It is thus opting out of the first attempt to write global rules for one part of the $1-trillion-a-year market in internationally traded services.
According to Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade official, the proposed accord would cover nine-tenths of international banking, insurance and securities business, which in turn represents 5 percent of the world's economic output.
Moreover, as Renato Ruggiero, the World Trade Organization's Director General, noted last week, the United States was largely responsible for pushing financial services toward the top of the trade agenda.
"U.S. policy makers introduced the subject onto the international agenda for two reasons," Mr. Ruggiero said. "They knew that the services sector could provide the bulk of economic growth and new employment, and they believed open markets and multilateral disciplines would insure this growth."
Washington, though, fears that it would lose leverage over emerging economies if it opened its market before they had liberalized their own. So it plans to offer access only to countries that agree to reciprocal arrangements.
The European Union argues that this negotiating strategy is flawed because developing nations do not want access yet to the American market. They are still building their financial industries and prefer protection to deregulation, particularly in the wake of debacles like the Mexican financial crisis and the demise of the investment bank Barings.
As Sir Leon said last week, "There just isn't a line of Malaysian bankers waiting to get into Montana."
Moreover, by offering to negotiate special-access deals with individual countries, the Clinton Administration is undermining a pillar of the postwar trading system known as most-favored-nation status, which holds that any trading privilege given one nation is extended to others in good standing.
The 15 countries of the European Union are now struggling to prevent the emerging liberalization package from falling apart as nations withdraw concessions they were prepared to make before the United States pulled back.
At the end of this month, the Europeans will try to persuade wavering countries to undertake a trial liberalization agreement for a limited period. But to bring the United States back into the fold without a loss of face, the Europeans will have to persuade the developing economies to improve their offers of access, not just maintain market access at current levels.
This provides an opportunity as well as a challenge, as the European Union dreams of forging a common foreign policy, even if it has not had much luck thus far in doing so.
In his own way, President Clinton has given the Europeans a chance to maintain free trade in financial services and to help pull the United States back from its latest flirtation with protectionism. And that would be quite a coup.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance Sharply, With Dow Up by 29.05

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks rose strongly in abbreviated trading yesterday as new signs of weak economic growth fostered hopes of an interest rate cut in the final session before Federal Reserve policy makers meet tomorrow.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.05 points to end at 4,585.15 in a shortened pre-holiday session. Gaining issues exceeded decliners by 1,172 to 854 on extremely thin volume of 117.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 311.7 million Friday. 
 The Nasdaq index rose 1.08, to 934.53, and the American Stock Exchange index added 1.28, to 501.47.
Stock markets will be closed today for Independence Day.
Investors, focusing on the meeting tomorrow and Thursday of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, saw economic reports issued yesterday as pushing the Fed toward reducing interest rates to keep the economy from sinking into recession.
"There is a good chance the Fed will ease rates," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index fell in June to a level many analysts consider recessionary. The report showed a second consecutive monthly slowdown in manufacturing despite continued slow growth in the overall economy.
Separately, the Government said construction spending in May fell 1.5 percent, far steeper than the one-tenth of 1 percent fall economists had been expecting and the biggest monthly decline since May 1991.
At the same time, it said personal income fell two-tenths of 1 percent, while spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in May, suggesting economic growth will remain slow in the coming months.
"The data is somewhat constructive toward the hope that we will see a decline in rates on Thursday," said Joseph Barthel, director of investment strategy at Fahnestock & Company.
"The $64,000 question is, 'Does the Fed want more time?' It's a possibility knowing the way Greenspan has operated over the years. It is possible he does something small." The reference was to Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve Board chairman.
Mr. Dwyer said there was a 50-50 chance of a quarter to half a percentage point easing in rates after the committee meets. "I think that it will come out that they will," he said.
But Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons, said confidence in an interest rate cut had been somewhat dampened over recent weeks by mixed economic data. But that would still support stocks, he hinted.
"If we don't have a cut this week, it will be positive because we will have something in front of us," he said.
Among individual issues, the Argosy Gaming Company jumped 3 3/4, to 16 5/8, on the Nasdaq after the company's joint venture, which includes a unit of Conseco Inc., was issued a certificate of suitability to operate a riverboat casino in Lawrenceburg, Ind.
Protein Design Labs Inc. shares dropped 6 7/8, to 13 7/8, on the Nasdaq after the company and its partner, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., part of Roche Holding, said a study showed its Zenapax drug was ineffective in preventing disease after bone marrow transplants. However, analysts said the company had ample cash and other products.
Eastman Kodak rose up 1 3/4, to 62 3/8, in heavy volume of more than 550,000 shares after the Clinton Administration said it would investigate the company's claims that Fuji Photo had conspired to deprive it of Japanese market share.
Boeing, which said over the weekend that it was cutting production of two aircraft, was down 1, to 61 5/8, in heavy Big Board volume of more than 812,000 shares
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft rose 9/16 , to 9015/16 , in heavy volume of more than one million shares. The company said it would continue its stock repurchase program in the 1996 fiscal year, and there were rumors that the company was studying how to unbundle software for its planned on-line service from its forthcoming Windows 95 program in case the Justice Department took antitrust action.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.34 points, to 547.09. The Big Board's composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.15, to 292.99. The average share rose 14 cents.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of the New York Stock Exchange, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 5,367.031, up 18.258, or 0.34 percent.

HEADLINE: Change-Minded Voters of '94 Find That Unease Remains

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MURFREESBORO, Tenn., July 3

 BODY:
The Republican tide last year swept across no state more forcefully than this sprawling one, and it was unwittingly fueled by voters like 46-year-old Michael Henderson.
Traditionally, Mr. Henderson supported Republicans and Democrats alike. But last year, he and his fellow Tennesseans saw to it that the state's two Senate seats and the governorship turned Republican. 
 "I wanted a change in what politicians were doing," said Mr. Henderson, a high school chemistry teacher who put his expertise to good use on Sunday selling fireworks at a local shopping mall. "I didn't know the whole country felt the same way. I was shocked that I voted the way most Americans were feeling."
And how are they feeling now, eight months after disgruntled voters delivered one of the most dramatic Election Day verdicts in decades? In nearly 50 random interviews over the weekend in this fast-growing patch of central Tennessee -- from the Murfreesboro town square to the golf course to the ballpark to the watermelon stands -- voters who helped bring about the enormous political upheaval said they were hopeful but very cautious.
Except for the most devoted partisans, these voters said they were not convinced that the ascendancy of Republicans would be a panacea -- or that it would last. Few were ready to pronounce the Republican takeover of Tennessee's highest offices -- and of the Congress -- a success or a failure. If anything, many said, cleaning house is good for the Republic. But despite passage of a budget-balancing bill last week and an assortment of Republican proposals, most said it was far too early to determine if the party's sweep would bring about the fundamental change that voters talked about last November.
"Would I vote strictly Republican again?" Mr. Henderson asked himself. "Not necessarily." He said he was worried about the speed with which Republicans were moving to cut the budget and restrict abortions. "They're going just a little too far, too fast," he said.
Specifically, several voters said they were disturbed by how Republicans scuttled the nomination of a Nashville obstetrician-gynecologist, Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr., as Surgeon General. "The ultra-conservatives were against him," said Susan Louthin, 33, a homemaker who is a Republican.
But Kim Stalvey, 42, a contractor who was remodeling a restaurant in downtown Murfreesboro, said fast action was why he abandoned the Democrats and voted Republican last year. Citing the House Republicans' promise to act on the 10-point Contract With America in the first 100 days, he said: "I liked the way they set up the 100 days, stuck to it and made some things happen. That's unusual in Washington."
Still, many voters here were reluctant to heap such praise on the new majority that they helped install. Rawls Ray, 50, a computer operator, said: "There's still a lot of distrust among the voters. If you have the right Democrat out there next time, I'll vote for him."
In fact, a large proportion of those interviewed, including Republicans, said they were uneasy with what they described as extremist behavior coming from Capitol Hill.
Jeff Sweatt, 28, a supervisor at United Parcel Service, said he backed Republicans last year but worried that Speaker Newt Gingrich had "gone too far to the right." He said he was relieved that a Democrat was still in the White House "for checks and balances."
Another who voted for Republicans, 34-year-old Joel Beckham, a city golf course superintendent, had more good than bad to say about what his decision wrought. "I'm not crazy about everything that the Republicans are doing, but we are seeing more accountability for what's going on," Mr. Beckham said. "But if these guys can't get it done it will go right back to the Democrats."
He and his wife, Jackie, 30, who is expecting their first child, said they were concerned that Republicans seemed fixated on opposing abortion. "They push the pro-life issue too much," said Mrs. Beckham, a secretary at an insurance company.
"I wouldn't want to be associated with an abortion," Mr. Beckham said. "But I'm not one to say whether that's right or wrong for someone else, either."
The Republicans' electoral successes here last year were all the more stunning given that they were not touched off by a sluggish economy; in fact, the economy has been doing fairly well. That may explain why many more voters said crime -- not the economy -- was the issue of most concern to them.
Murfreesboro, 33 miles southeast of Nashville, has transformed itself from a small farming town to one of the fastest growing sections of the state, due in part to the construction in recent years of nearby automobile plants by Nissan and General Motors' Saturn subsidiary. Newcomers as well as many of the longtime residents are turning more and more to the Republican Party. A Democrat, Representative Bart Gordon, was elected to a sixth term in this district last year, but with only 51 percent of the vote.
One after another, voters responded first with a chuckle, then a shaking of the head, when asked about Mr. Gingrich. More often than not, they said they were uncomfortable with his tone and style but were at a loss to cite specifics.
"He scares me," said Doug Rhodes, a 52-year-old farmer who voted Republican last year. "It's all right to go a little bit conservative, but you don't want to drop off."
While Mr. Gingrich has often overshadowed President Clinton in news coverage since November, three voters did not know who he is.
"Huh, what is that?" replied Wanda Underwood, a 38-year-old Democrat on disability, when asked about Mr. Gingrich. She went on to speak knowledgeably about her disappointment over the failure of Mr. Clinton's health care proposal.
Asked the same question while he was watching his daughter play baseball, Chuck Lawson, 33, a machinist, said: "Who? I'm lost."
"He's the one on television all the time," his wife, Theresa, a secretary, interjected, looking up from a novel about a serial killer.
Mr. Lawson was still puzzled. Even so, he said he voted last year "right down the Republican line," adding, "That's the way the N.R.A. told me to vote in my magazine."
Mark Moore, 35, a registered nurse and longtime Democrat, said he regretted that he "succumbed to the anti-Washington movement," when he voted last year for the two Republicans -- Fred D. Thompson and Bill Frist -- who won Senate seats without ever having held elective office. And he said he resisted supporting Don Sundquist, who was elected Governor, because he had been a member of Congress.
"The Christian Coalition and the insurgency of the religious right frightens me," Mr. Moore said. And noting that Mr. Frist backed the doomed nomination of Dr. Foster while Mr. Thompson did not, he added, "Frist has shown himself to be a moderate, but Thompson has moved to the right extreme."
Indeed, some Democrats in Tennessee in recent days have urged Dr. Foster to challenge Mr. Thompson when he runs for a full six-year Senate term next year.
According to a Mason-Dixon poll of regular Tennessee voters that was conducted in May, 62 percent rated Mr. Thompson's performance as excellent or good, while Governor Sundquist received a 54 percent rating and Senator Frist only a 46 percent rating.
Many voters said they were disappointed in Mr. Clinton, who in 1992 captured Tennessee with 47 percent of the vote. His biggest hope to hang on to the state next year, according to some Democrats here, may be the good will many voters feel toward a native son, Vice President Al Gore.
"I'll vote for Clinton -- I don't like what they're doing to Medicare or what they're doing to the education bill, or what they're doing to the older people," said Helen Whitworth, 47, a kindergarten teacher, referring to the Republicans. "But you know it would be even better if Gore would run. Oh, I just love that family."
Many voters also spoke highly of another Tennessean, former Gov. Lamar Alexander, a Republican Presidential candidate.
But Mr. Clinton can claim some converts. Joe Dillon, a 42-year-old contractor, voted for George Bush in 1992 but has changed his tune. "I was scared to death of Clinton," he said, appropriating the same words many voters use for Mr. Gingrich. "I thought that he may be a little bit too radical."
But the soft-spoken Mr. Dillon said the recent spate of national traumas had brought out the Presidential bearing of Mr. Clinton. "With the hurricanes and the bombings, we've heard more out of him and seen him do more," he said. "I don't see anyone we're going to run against him that's going to do anything better for the country."

Not necessarily. They're going just a little too far, too fast;" Kim Stalvey, Contractor -- "I liked the way they set up the 100 days, stuck to it and made some things happen.

HEADLINE: David H. Sawyer Dies at 59; Innovator in Political Strategy

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
David H. Sawyer, a pioneer in the field of political consulting that burgeoned in the 1970's and 1980's as party machines lost their clout in choosing electoral candidates, died on Sunday in New York Hospital. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
He had been under treatment for several weeks for a brain tumor, his family said. 
 By 1988, Mr. Sawyer's clients included four Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John D. Rockefeller 4th, Edward M. Kennedy and John Glenn, six Governors as well as leading politicians in the Philippines and Israel.
One notable turnaround engineered by his firm, D. H. Sawyer & Associates (later the Sawyer-Miller Group) was in the 1987 gubernatorial primary in Kentucky, where his client, Wallace Wilkinson, started out with about 5 percent in the polls and went on to win against two strong contenders.
Mr. Sawyer based his strategy then and later on polling studies of the electorate. In the case of Kentucky voters, both major opponents of Mr. Wilkinson had advocated tax increases and attacked each other bitterly. In place of higher taxes, the Sawyer-Wilkinson strategy advocated a state lottery.
In a 1984 interview for the Inc. Publishing Company, Mr. Sawyer defined his work this way: "I don't manipulate voters, because I can't -- they're too sophisticated. I'm much more interested in the nature of communication itself. How do you create a dialogue with the electorate? How do you control the dynamic of the campaign? Set the agenda for discussion? Answer an opponent's charges? Those are my issues. You have to get way inside a campaign before you can resolve them, too."
A Democrat, Mr. Sawyer worked only for Democratic candidates, but he had no problem dispensing advice to big corporate clients, including Coca-Cola, Apple Computer, Goldman Sachs, Time Warner and Resorts International.
Colleagues, headed by Scott Miller, bought out Mr. Sawyer's ownership interest in his firm, which had a staff of 40, in 1993. In that same year he opened a political-economic consulting firm called the G.7 Group. By this time there were more than 200 political consulting firms across the country and more than 3,000 people working in the field.
David Haskell Sawyer was born June 13, 1936, in Boston. After earning a bachelor of arts degree at Princeton University in 1959, he made documentary films, working in the cinema verite genre with Frederick Wiseman and Richard Leacock. One film dealt with rural poverty in Maine. Another feature, "Other Voices," about mental health patients, was nominated in 1970 for an Academy Award for best documentary. He was drawn into political consulting in the early 1970's in Illinois, where he did some film work for an elected official.
He is survived by his wife, the former Nell Michel; a son, Luke, and two stepsons, Andrew and Gavin McFarland, all of New York; his mother, Mrs. Edward Brewer of Hartford; a brother, Edward of Cleveland, and a sister, Penny Sawyer, of New York.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Assess Kodak's Case Against Fuji

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
In what is shaping up as the next focus of trade friction with Japan, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would investigate charges by the Eastman Kodak Company that its rival Fuji Photo Film had conspired to deny it fair access to the Japanese market over the last 20 years.
The American move, made less than a week after the two countries pulled back from the brink of sanctions and settled a bitter automotive-trade dispute, was based on a 275-page complaint filed by Kodak in mid-May, contending that the Japanese Government had helped Fuji create an anticompetitive market, costing it $5.6 billion in sales. 
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in a brief written statement announcing his decision to mount an investigation that "American manufacturers of photographic film and paper should be able to compete on a fair basis in the Japanese market, just as Japanese firms can here." He acted under a provision of American trade law known in official shorthand as Section 301.
"It is critical that U.S. firms achieve full access to Japan's market, a market roughly comparable in size to that of the U.S," Mr. Kantor added.
Kodak, which began selling its products in Japan more than 100 years ago, said in its complaint that it held less than 9 percent of the Japanese market last year, far below the nearly 45 percent it holds in other foreign countries.
"All we're asking for is for the Japanese to enforce their own laws," said Alan W. Wolff, a former deputy United States trade representative, who directed the team that Kodak assembled at the Washington office of the law firm Dewey Ballantine to conduct its study.
Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. said in response that it regretted the American decision to initiate a Section 301 action, rather than dealing with Kodak's charges "through more constructive channels" in Japan or at the new World Trade Organization in Geneva.
It called its American rival's complaint "a heavy-handed attempt to shift the blame for Kodak's own poor business decisions in Japan from Kodak to the Japanese photographic industry and the Japanese Government."
Fuji said Kodak's trade complaint "relied almost exclusively on statements from various publications which are taken out of context, mischaracterized or inaccurate."
The Clinton Administration, which waited until the very end of the 45-day period within which to proceed with an investigation or deny the company Government help, seemed eager to prolong the harmony that concluded the automotive negotiations.
Playing down the immediate effect of today's decision, which had been widely expected, officials held no news briefing, and Mr. Kantor was unavailable to elaborate on his statement.
The United States now has up to one year to assess Kodak's charges and to seek a satisfactory market-access agreement with Japan. If this fails, the Administration could impose tariffs or other sanctions, as it had threatened with automobiles and auto parts.
The Japanese Embassy in Washington offered no response today to the American decision.
While the language of this new disagreement was subdued, specialists said it did not mean that the Kodak-Fuji dispute lacked the potential to become a full-scale trade battle with threats of high American tariffs. Indeed, Washington might find the film dispute a handy enforcement weapon, should it find that Japan was not fully living up to its commitments on automotive trade.
Specialists also said that Kodak's charges would also be closely watched as a guide in creating rules for the World Trade Organization to address problems of competition, a subject discussed at last month's economic summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The basic charge by Kodak, the American photographic industry leader based in Rochester, is that in the 1970's, when formal postwar restrictions were about to end, the Japanese Government joined with Fuji to head off Kodak's possible domination of the market and to preserve the market for the Japanese company.
Kodak cited as "countermeasures" that had impeded it for two decades a system of exclusive distribution relationships, artificially high prices that subsidized Fuji's research, "a complex clandestine system of cash payments to financially strapped wholesalers and retailers," and interlocking trade associations committed to price stability and avoidance of competition.
A restrictive market, dominated by Fuji and four main distributors, "remains in place today with the complicity of the Japanese Government," Kodak contended in its complaint, filed on May 18.
It said that these impediments, involving both film and photographic paper, had cost it billions of dollars in revenue and allowed Fuji to build a $10 billion reserve that enabled it to dump products on the American market. Fuji, Kodak continued, was "fundamentally altering the global competitive balance" between the two companies.
Despite these asserted barriers, Kodak has been more successful in Japan than many other American companies, having invested heavily and tailored products specifically to Japanese taste.
Its latter-day aggressiveness results from the decision of George M. C. Fisher, its chairman since late in 1993, to pursue a strategy that succeeded in opening the Japanese market when he headed the electronics company Motorola.

HEADLINE: Dead-End Jobs? Not for These Three

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 3

 BODY:
Mark Ishaya was a toddler in Baghdad when his father died and his mother abandoned the family. He was a child laborer in a Lebanese oil filter factory when Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas massacred co-workers as he hid in a cabinet.
Zdenka Bulic was 21 when she emigrated from Bosnia nine years ago, frustrated at the career roadblocks she faced as a Croat. David Nunez left his home in Mexico at the age of 16 in search of higher wages. 
 All three have ended up in management jobs at the McDonald's restaurant on Peterson Avenue on Chicago's north side, overseeing the 50 other immigrants on a staff of 55.
Their achievement testifies to the energy and talent of immigrants who use "burger flipping" jobs that most Americans deride as dead ends to lift themselves to modest prosperity and many of the trappings of middle-class American life.
Their success also reflects the effectiveness of systems that McDonald's and other fast-food chains have been forced to develop to integrate into their work forces vast numbers of low-skill workers, whether they be immigrants or American citizens.
More than 1 out of every 8 Americans now working -- at least 20 million people -- have worked in a McDonald's since Ray Kroc opened his first McDonald's hamburger stand 40 years ago in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines.
Behind that number is a corporate strategy of using armies of part-time workers. In addition, hourly pay for McDonald's crew members is typically only a bit higher than the $4.25 minimum wage and fringe benefits are meager. Employees leave so frequently that this year McDonald's and its franchisees, which employ more than 500,000 workers in the United States and Canada, will have to hire well over that number of new employees to stay fully staffed.
But there is an upside to this upheaval. The leading fast-food chains have been forced to concentrate more than other businesses on designing their jobs and training programs with an eye toward quickly adapting large numbers of raw recruits from diverse backgrounds, including those with little or no experience speaking English. And turnover, plus the industry's relentless expansion, gives quick learners a rapid shot at management.
Training programs at Peterson Avenue start with McDonald's-supplied videotapes, in either English or Spanish, ranging from general topics like methods of dealing with customer complaints to the specifics of operating different kinds equipment. Written manuals repeat much of the information. In addition, experienced employees designated as crew trainers work shoulder-to-shoulder with new hires.
The management track starts with introductory weeklong operations and management courses for assistant managers taught at regional training centers. Those promoted to second assistant become eligible for the Intermediate Operations Course, focusing on recruitment and retention of workers and advanced decision-making problems, and an equipment-maintenance and technology course.
First assistant managers, who have already received up to 2,000 hours of training, become eligible to attend the two-week Advanced Operations Course at Hamburger University, the company's national training center in Oak Brook, Ill. Managers also take review courses and specialized offerings, such as courses on career development for women, blacks and Hispanics.
Nowhere has the McDonald's system worked better for immigrants than at the Peterson Avenue restaurant, one of six franchises owned by a retired contractor, Ralph Wright, and his wife, Marilyn, an immigrant from Croatia. Native-born Americans rarely make up more than a handful of the employees there. And these days it's Mr. Ishaya, Ms. Bulic and Mr. Nunez who are among the role models.
 
Mark Ishaya
Mark Ishaya's psychological ties to his perilous childhood remain strong. He dreams of returning to Baghdad some day to visit the grave of his father, who died when he was 2 years old. The memories are vivid of the flight with his grandparents and sister by car, camel and foot to Lebanon when he was 6 and from Lebanon to Greece nearly three years later when Palestinian and Syrian attacks engulfed their Christian community.
By the time Mr. Ishaya took the suggestion of some friends and applied to work with them at a McDonald's, the habit of hard work to help support one's family was already engrained. Then 15, he lied about his age to obtain more hours.
"I was made manager of a McDonald's within months of graduating from high school," Mr. Ishaya said. "There I was, an 18-year-old, running a $1 million operation."
Mr. Ishaya, now 31, was transferred to the McDonald's on Peterson Avenue within two years. He soon fashioned the branch into a frequent winner of performance awards from both the company and neighborhood trade groups. In 1993 he was promoted to a job supervising the restaurant on Peterson Avenue and two others, with a salary he describes as "about $45,000." The fringe benefits include health care and a leased 1995 Ford Explorer.
One of the first lessons McDonald's taught Mr. Ishaya was that he was not as shy as he once thought. "After you deal with thousands of people of every race day-in, day-out, your personality changes," he said.
Mr. Ishaya said McDonald's had taught him enough about machinery and building systems to do most of the work refurbishing a two-apartment building he bought and then sold. He also picked up the basics of American financial controls, inventory management and marketing strategies. Above all, he learned a respect for employees and customers that he said was foreign to the Middle East.
Asked to explain, he cited a case in which a manager under him covered up the fact that a batch of Chicken McNuggets had been sitting too long, setting back the timer to make it look as if they were fresher than they were. Mr. Ishaya briskly ordered new McNuggets and removed the old ones. Then he took the manager aside, told him to taste the old McNuggets, and inquired whether he would be happy to pay for them if he were a customer. The typical restaurant in his homeland, Mr. Ishaya said, would have neither rigid quality controls nor a policy of teaching wayward employees instead of just berating them.
"I'm not gifted," Mr. Ishaya said. "But McDonald's put me through a lot of classes and I really practiced what I learned. I believe I could do anything now."
 
Zdenka Bulic
Bosnia had not yet plunged into civil war when Zdenka Bulic, now 30, came to Chicago to attend a relative's wedding, live with her cousin, Judy, for a year and perhaps go to school. Her parents both worked at an airplane factory and her family enjoyed a middle-class life. But it was already apparent that she would never be given a shot in Muslim-dominated Mostar at teaching math and science, her dream job.
In retrospect, it is no surprise that Judy promptly took her to work at McDonald's: Judy's sister is Marilyn Wright. Ms. Bulic was initially assigned to grillwork and began picking up Spanish from fellow crew members before she learned any English. Like everyone else in the Wrights' stores, she goes by her first name (pronounced iz-den-ka). It is so frequently mispronounced that she wants to change it to Pam when she applies for American citizenship next year.
"That's what some of my regular customers decided to call me when I first started serving," she laughed.
As Mr. Ishaya's successor as store manager at Peterson Avenue, Ms. Bulic arrives at 4 A.M. every fourth day to meet the McDonald's delivery truck and by 5 A.M. the rest of the time. She sometimes leaves as early as 3 P.M., but often gets caught up chatting with employees or customers.
"The concept of 100 percent customer satisfaction was new to me," said Ms. Bulic, who had worked briefly in a restaurant in Mostar before coming to the United States. "At home, we never even say 'please' or 'thank you' to customers."
The other eye-opener, she said, was the emphasis on teamwork. "The system is so organized and responsibilities are so broken out that it makes the role of teamwork clear," she said. "I had no clue about how much goes into it when I started."
Ms. Bulic, who now earns about $35,000 annually, has piled up such all-American assets as a Chevy Beretta and a small two-bedroom home in Elk Grove, Ill. Her main hobby is tending the house's huge garden, which includes plants contributed by some of her customers.
She recently completed the company's advanced course on store operation at Hamburger University. She is studying computers but her career dream these days is to graduate from the Wrights' chain into a job as a McDonald's field consultant advising other restaurant managers.
 
David Nunez
David Nunez, now 32, never had trouble finding work in his native Michoacan, a state just west of Mexico City. By the time he was 17, he had been laboring for more than a decade making construction materials or clothing to help his parents and six siblings make ends meet.
"I wanted something better," he said, recounting in halting English how he left in 1979 to join two older brothers who preceded him to Chicago.
On the recommendation of a friend, he left his first job here as a busboy at an upscale restaurant to clean tables and mop floors at McDonald's. Willingness to work rather than raw ambition has lifted him to his current job as first assistant manager at Peterson Avenue under Ms. Bulic.
It took two years before Mr. Nunez made the move from cleaning into the kitchen, and even then it came only after prodding from Mr. Wright to try it. He quit in 1982 when his closest friend left Chicago for a job in Texas tending vegetables and flowers and urged him to come along. A year later, he drifted back to Mexico, and in 1985 he got married.
Returning to Chicago with his new wife, Maria, he called Marilyn Wright and was offered a kitchen job. That lasted two more years but his wife, who was homesick, returned to Mexico with their infant daughter, and after four months he followed her. He came back to Chicago for good in 1988, this time getting a machine maintenance job with the Wrights and an eventual promotion into customer service.
"The first time they asked me to consider going into management, I said no because it's too much responsibility," Mr. Nunez said. But in 1990, when he was asked again and, assured there would be others double checking everything and backing him up, he agreed. The extra money helped reunite him with his wife and three children.
Mr. Nunez earns about $25,000. He frets about weaknesses in his English and people-management skills but has begun to entertain the notion that he could someday run Peterson Avenue. "I would never have gotten this far outside the McDonald's system," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Flat in Thin Trading, With Interest Rate Cut Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most leading currencies yesterday as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates this week.
Still, trading was very thin yesterday ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, with few traders willing to establish big positions on the dollar before the Fed meeting. 
 Many analysts expect Fed policy makers will cut rates when they meet tomorrow and Thursday because the economy is slowing to a pace at which recession is a danger. Lower interest rates often hurt the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits less attractive.
"It won't be a surprise if we see them cut a quarter of a percentage point," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. If the Fed does trim rates, "the first reaction will be selling the dollar," Mr. Yu said.
Some traders said the Fed would wait for more evidence that the economy was slowing before reversing course and cutting rates.
"I don't think there'll be any change in rates," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He and other traders said they would scrutinize Friday's report on United States employment in June for clues to the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.
Even if the Fed leaves rates unchanged, the dollar is likely to remain under pressure because speculation about rate cuts will persist beyond this week's meeting, traders said.
In New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.3799 German marks from 1.3817 marks on Friday. The dollar rose to 84.74 yen from 84.69 yen.
While financial markets will be open today in Asia and Europe, foreign-exchange trading will still be light because of the holiday in the United States.
In other trading, the British pound was little changed as traders waited to see how Prime Minister John Major will fare in today's Conservative Party leadership election.
If Mr. Major fails to win enough votes, a second vote will follow. A country's currency often suffers when there is government turmoil.
The pound was last quoted at 2.2050 marks, little changed from 2.2025 marks on Friday. Against the dollar, the pound edged up to $1.5980, from $1.5940 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Workers' Benefits Cost More, but Less So

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
After spiraling upward for years, the cost of employee benefits is flattening out.
The soaring costs of health care -- the biggest and fastest of the runaway horses -- have been growing at a slower rate. Workers' compensation claims have been reined in. And the buoyant stock market, by producing substantial gains on investments, has allowed corporations to meet their pension obligations with only minimal extra contributions. 
 Although some analysts think this may prove a blip rather than a trend, strong evidence of a turning point came in a recent Labor Department report. Benefit costs, which account for nearly 20 percent of total compensation, edged up a scant two-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of 1995, according to the report. This was the smallest quarterly rise since 1987. Measured against the comparable period a year earlier, benefit costs rose 2.9 percent, the smallest such increase since the first quarter of 1987 and the second smallest since the calculations were first made in 1979.
"Something big is going on," said Frank B. McArdle, manager of the Washington research group at Hewitt Associates. "This is not a flash in the pan."
Even hard-pressed small companies are feeling better about benefit costs. A poll by the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents some half-million establishments, found only about 10 percent now think that the cost of health care and workers' compensation insurance is their No. 1 problem. That is down from a peak of 14 percent in the early 1990's, according to William J. Dennis, a researcher for the group.
Still, not all economists are as sanguine as Mr. McArdle. Some doubt that the recent trend will last; others question whether workers will benefit even if costs remain under control.
In theory, if employers do not have to pay as much for benefits, they should be in a better position to raise workers' pay -- which has scarcely kept up with inflation for more than a decade.
But some economists argue that whatever extra amount workers receive, it is likely to end up being used to shoulder more of their health care costs.
The experience of Martin G. Imbach Inc., a family owned marine contractor in Baltimore, illustrates both the change and some aspects of the debate. Imbach, which has about 60 employees, has moved forcefully over the years to contain health and workers' compensation costs that had begun to threaten its survival.
In 1989, it began to pay its own health insurance claims, instead of paying Blue Cross and Blue Shield to do so, saving costs of about 20 percent over five years. Then, in 1993, Imbach had employees pay 25 percent of the health costs.
In addition to these savings -- which Stuart McGeady, the company's vice president and treasurer, said kept Imbach from dropping its health coverage -- the company bargained aggressively with hospitals and clinics for the best deal.
"We told them: 'Don't give us the off-the-street rate. We want the same rate as your best client,' " Mr. McGeady said. His approach worked.
Such efforts by hundreds of thousands of companies like Imbach have helped chop health care inflation to 3.5 percent in a three-month period through May, from a peak of 9.6 percent in 1990.
Of course, workers who bear costs formerly paid by their employers may find it can takes considerable time to get even -- much less ahead -- from related wage increases.
"It was seen as a small pay cut," Mr. McGeady acknowledged. "But all things being equal, they saw it as an adjustment that has had to be made in difficult times."
Kirk Ridgell, a 35-year-old mechanic and equipment operator for Imbach, said that by and large, workers did not object to the cost shifting, considering the company's financial constraints. "You don't miss it because you never see it," he said.
He said the main complaint was that single employees pay the same $15 a week as those with large families.
"That was the biggest thing that I heard," said Mr. Ridgell, who has two children and a third on the way. "Those guys were saying, 'Why should I pay the same amount as somebody that's got five kids when it's just me?' "
In order to save on health care costs, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said, some employers have switched their workers to health maintenance organizations or coverage with higher deductibles. In other cases, health costs have been lowered by the one-time expedient of reclassifying workers as independent contractors.
Another factor that has been holding down the cost of fringe benefits has been a lengthening of the workweek as employers, unwilling to hire new workers until they could be sure that the economic recovery had taken hold, have simply demanded more overtime work.
"You get free benefit costs for those extra hours," observed Sylvester J. Schieber, director of research at Watson Wyatt, a benefits consultant.
Yet fringe-benefit costs could be contained for some time without workers seeing any gains in their paychecks, argued John Zalusky, a senior economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who specializes in wages and industrial relations.
Mr. Reich, commenting on recent data showing real wages skidded 2.3 percent over the last year, was similarly skeptical. "One would expect that with health benefits and the cost of health care declining, employers could afford to put more money into wages," he said. But instead, "wages and benefits appear to be falling at the same time."
An argument over who gains from the slowing costs of benefits might be premature, some analysts say, arguing that the relief may not be permanent. Some say it is largely a delayed reaction to the 1990-91 recession and will not last if the economy continues to advance.
"In times of recession, people buy fewer goods and services, including health care" and 401(k) plans, said William S. Custer, a Washington researcher specializing in benefits. "Four years is about right for this to work through the insurance market" and show up as lower costs.
Another factor that may have only temporarily held down benefit costs was the Clinton Administration's health care proposal, now defunct. During the debate, the health industry held down costs in order to help ease political pressure for sweeping change.
Still, many analysts say some of the new-found restraint will remain, buttressed perhaps by legislation working its way through the House that would put small businesses on equal footing with major companies by allowing them to band together to offer a common, self-insured health plan.
Much of this would involve managed care, predicted Alan Mertz, chief of staff to Harris W. Fawell, an Illinois Republican who is the legislation's chief sponsor.
Only 46 percent of workers in companies with fewer than 10 people on the payroll have employer-provided health insurance, while 80 percent of workers in companies with at least 1,000 employees are covered, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
Another sign of lower pressure on benefits, one reflecting the intense competition now found in much of health care, is a dramatic slowing of pay increases for private-sector hospital workers.
Hopeful as he is for the immediate future, even Mr. McArdle of Hewitt Associates is not sure the present trend will last forever. "It's a positive signal," he said, "but it's not persuasive that costs are under control for the longer term."

Treasury Securities End Mixed In Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after several economic reports produced no surprises. Trading was light in the shortened session.
While many traders were off yesterday ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, the session still had the potential to be volatile after the turmoil of last week. On Thursday, Treasury prices fell sharply after the May new-home sales report showed expected strength in the economy. The report raised fears that the Federal Reserve would not, as expected, reduce short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets tomorrow. On Friday, Treasury prices seesawed on expectations, later confirmed, that the Chicago purchasing managers' survey would show weakness, which helped the case for a Fed rate cut. 
 But the data released yesterday contained few surprises for the market. The Commerce Department reported that personal income fell two-tenths of 1 percent in May, meeting expectations. Spending for the month was up seven-tenths of 1 percent, only slightly stronger than an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent that had been expected.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its index of overall manufacturing conditions slipped to 45.7 last month from 46.1 in May. And while the number still suggests a contracting manufacturing economy, the drop was not as steep as the 45.2 some analysts had expected.
Construction spending fell 1.5 percent in May to an annual rate of $514.7 billion, restrained by decreased expenditures on single-family homes, the Commerce Deparment report showed. In April, construction spending, which was originally reported as rising four-tenths of 1 percent, fell two-tenths of 1 percent in a revision by the agency. Analysts said it was the largest monthly decline for construction spending in four years.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist with CS First Boston, said that all the reports were close to expectations, with the exception of construction spending, which came in weak.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 6/32 , to 11227/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 6.63 percent, from 6.62 percent on Friday. The market closed early yesterday, at 2 P.M., and will be closed today in observance of the Fourth of July holiday.
Also yesterday, the Treasury held its regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, and the sale went better than expected. Some traders had feared that with so many people out yesterday that there might not be enough buyers. The average rate at auction for a three-month bill was 5.53 percent, up from 5.35 percent last week. For a six-month bill, the average rate was 5.46 percent, up from 5.34 percent last week. Both rates were the highest since June 12.
When traders return tomorrow, their attention will be turned to the Fed's meeting. Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the national purchasing managers' data yesterday "might give the Fed some manuvering room should it decide to ease rates, only because the number indicated a further slowing in the economy."
"I think the Fed will ease 25 to 50 basis points," Mr. Dwyer said. "It's simple to see that the market has priced in an easing. And the Fed is unlikely to do anything that the market hasn't already anticipated."
Following are the results of that Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Rise in Consumer Spending May Rule Out Fed Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Spending by consumers showed unexpected strength in May, the Government reported today, suggesting that an interest rate cut might not be necessary to give the economy a lift.
Consumer spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in May, considerably faster than April's increase of one-tenth of 1 percent, even as incomes dropped for the first time since January 1994, the Commerce Department said. 
 "The message is that the consumer should not be written off as dead," said Carl Palash, chief economist with MCM Moneywatch in New York. "It argues against a Fed easing."
Analysts said the spending rise was the key figure among a number of economic statistics released today, the last batch of reports before the start of a two-day meeting by the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. At the meeting, which begins Wednesday, officials will decide whether an interest rate cut is needed to keep the economy from falling into a recession.
Despite the spending rise, there was plenty of evidence of economic weakness today that could be used by Fed policy makers to argue for a rate cut. For example, the Commerce Department reported that personal income fell two-tenths of 1 percent in May, the first decline in nearly one and a half years, after having risen a revised one-tenth of 1 percent in April. For the year so far, monthly income growth has averaged only three-tenths of 1 percent, half the rate of six-tenths of 1 percent in the corresponding period last year.
The agency also reported that construction spending fell 1.5 percent during May, the largest drop in four years, restrained by declining expenditures on single-family homes.
Meanwhile, data released by the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated the manufacturing slowdown continued in June. The industry group's index of overall manufacturing conditions slipped to 45.7 last month from 46.1 in May. Before May, the index had increased for 20 consecutive months.
"This throws a mixed bag at the Fed," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in New York.
Many economists expect the Fed to ease credit at some point this summer, even if it does not do so this week. "I think the Fed's going to ease," said Raymond Stone, a managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. The May increase in consumer spending was still relatively low, he said. "I don't think that would stop them from easing."
Other analysts, however, said the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's concern about inflation would likely lead him to argue against an immediate cut. "The sway of the numbers is toward continued slow growth in the economy, with consumer spending speeding up in the second half," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist with Fleet Financial in Providence, R.I.
Today's Commerce Department report showed that after adjustment for inflation, consumer spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent in May. Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased seven-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Parks in Peril

 BODY:
This is the time of year when Americans begin flocking to their national parks. Some will find what they were looking for: vistas of spectacular beauty, hours of restorative silence. But others may find themselves wondering whether they have traded one rat race for another. The national parks contain most of America's greatest scenic wonders. They also suffer from the urban nuisances vacationers had hoped to leave behind: traffic jams, noise, dirty air and garbage.
There is, as Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico notes, "trouble in paradise." If past experience is any guide, for example, there will be gridlock today in Yosemite. By one estimate, the Grand Canyon alone needs $350 million to repair roads, sewers and water systems. Many of the park system's 22,000 historic buildings, as any visitor to Ellis Island can confirm, are simply falling apart. 
 Human overload is the most visible culprit. Nationwide attendance at the Park Service's 368 separate units is expected to reach 270 million this year, 300 million by the turn of the century. But the real culprit is Congress. In the past 20 years, it has established more than 80 new parks while refusing to give the Interior Department's Park Service enough money to do its job. The service's $1.5 billion annual budget barely covers operating costs. The result is an estimated $6 billion repair and construction backlog.
Congress is responsible for cleaning up the mess it created. The question is how. Not surprisingly, given Washington's anti-environmental, budget-conscious mood, the most popular option is to trim back the system itself. A bill before the House would direct the Interior Department to review all parks and determine which ones are "nationally significant." At that point, a special commission would decide which parks should get the ax and then present its list to Congress.
The proposal excludes 54 "major" national parks but leaves open for review more than 300 monuments, historic sites, scenic trails, urban parks and assorted recreation areas.
On its surface, this bill, co-sponsored by Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado, and Bruce Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, has an appealing simplicity. The park system definitely includes substandard sites -- what Mr. Hefley calls "pork parks," shoe-horned into the system to enhance local economies and the careers of the politicians who sponsored them. Get rid of these, Mr. Hefley argues, and we will have more money to spend on the "crown jewels" like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.
In the end, though, this is an unnecessarily messy and potentially dangerous approach to the problem. Mr. Vento says that Congress will vote on each recommendation "on its merits." But a more likely scenario is that the proposed closings will be lumped together in one omnibus "closings" bill, threatening valuable wilderness along with mediocre sites that do not belong in the system.
A more positive approach to rescuing the parks is contained in two other bills confronting the Senate and House. One would overhaul entrance fees, which are ridiculously low. The average entrance fee is $3, less than half the cost of a ticket to "Batman Forever." A carload of people can explore Yellowstone for a whole week for only $10 -- the same price they would have paid in 1916. Doubling entrance fees, a not unreasonable proposition, could generate an extra $100 million for the parks.
The second bill would end the sweetheart contracts awarded years ago to the companies that run the lodges, souvenir shops and other facilities inside the parks. In 1993, concessions generated gross revenues of $657 million but returned only $18.7 million -- 2.8 per cent -- to the Federal Treasury. The bill would mandate competitive bidding for these lucrative enterprises, giving the Park Service a bigger cut of the proceeds and generating $60 million more for long-neglected repairs.
Both measures were well on their way to approval when time ran out on the 103d Congress last December. There is now in place a vastly different Congress, more inclined to budgetary parsimony than environmental stewardship. Its basic philosophy is that to save the patient we have to cut off an arm here, a leg there.
That is the wrong way to go. The right way is to provide the park system with enough resources not just to survive but to renew itself. The language in the original mandate establishing the Park Service was unambiguous. The national parks should be left "unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Congress wrote that language, and Congress needs to honor it now.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
$20 Billion Thriller

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Spent weekend reading great yarn of international intrigue reaching into high places, very high. Stakes of billions of dollars, manipulation of governments, that kind of thing. Bit long -- 748 pages -- but moves right along; highly recommended.
Only two things may spoil reader enjoyment. Perpetrators win and justice is not done -- that's one. 
 The other is that since this story is all true and the money your own, it can leave you with a heavy awareness that you have been taken for a ride economically, morally and politically by the Administration and Congress you put in office.
In fact you are still on it -- a ride for which Americans had to gamble $20 billion of taxpayer money without ever being asked if they wanted to get on board.
The narrative, chronology and documentation are all in this story -- a report put out by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, as head of the Senate Banking Committee, about the Clinton Administration's $20 billion loan to Mexico. It is the result of under noticed committee hearings and months of staff research.
The reason given for the loan was to prop up a staggering Mexico because any default on loans would end foreign investment in all developing countries. That was malarkey then and is malarkier now.
The real reason was to rescue American and Mexican investors who had thrown their money into the craps game of high-interest Mexican Government bonds. They saw their money disappearing. So they got the U.S. to make the loan that would turn their risks into a guaranteed return -- in American money. Some lighthearted day ask for the same deal on your own investments in America.
Congress went along with the loan without a vote or debate.
From the beginning the issue seemed to me not so much the Mexican Government and its failures, but the conduct of the U.S. Government. For a year before the loan was ordered, on Jan. 31, 1995, top Treasury officials and President Clinton were telling us how great things were going economically in Mexico.
Didn't they know the truth, which they revealed only at the time of the loan, that Mexico was heading to disaster? Who knew what? When?
The answer given here in several columns was gathered from available information. It was a cover-up to prevent Congressional defeat of the North American Free Trade Agreement, to bolster the Mexican and U.S. administrations in upcoming elections in both countries, and to protect the major speculators.
Now the report puts reality beyond discussion: It was indeed a cover-up. Scores of internal documents show that from February 1994, while the Administration was shilling for the Mexican "miracle," its top officials knew that Mexico was in big economic trouble. Documents show that they had information from their own statistics, from what Mexicans told them privately and from the C.I.A.
The report puts chief responsibility for the charade on Under Secretary Larry Summers. But obviously the Treasury Secretary, then Lloyd Bentsen, knew. If they knew, so did the White House.
Epilogue: The burden of the whole Mexican-American mess falls on ordinary citizens in both countries. In Mexico, one million workers have lost their jobs and inflation is expected to reach 50 percent this year.
For the U.S., according to the report, trade with Mexico has gone from an American surplus to a deficit that may reach $15 billion this year. The beneficiaries are Mexican, American and international companies that are increasing their exports of cheaper Mexican-made goods.
The decision of Congress to go along, for fear of taking responsibility, was a historic example of cowardice hiding behind bipartisanship.
When the first $10 billion was turned over to Mexico, the U.S. said no more would be needed this year. Now Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin says the second $10 billion is available to Mexico immediately.
Senator D'Amato asks for a fight against that second $10 billion, since the loan is a betrayal of Americans' trust in their Government.
Senator Robert Dole recently put to entertainment executives a question every adult must face sooner or later. Now it faces all members of Congress who permitted the betrayal: "Is this what you intend to accomplish with your careers?"

Shell Decides Not to Develop Iran Oilfields

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3

 BODY:
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group said today that it had decided not to bid against Total S.A. for the development of Iran's offshore Sirri oil and gas fields.
A two-company contest was expected after President Clinton of the United States forced the Conoco Inc. division of Du Pont on March 15 to withdraw from the Sirri project and later banned all United States companies from buying or selling Iranian oil. 
 Julian Barnes, a spokesman for the British-Dutch oil company, said Shell had expressed interest in the Iranian oilfields after Conoco had withdrawn, but there were no current plans for an agreement.
Higher costs from equipment suppliers and subcontractors dealing with Iranian oil projects, as a result of the United States embargo, could have forced Shell to rethink its initial proposal, which had envisaged production starting in late 1996 or early 1997, according to the Middle East Economic Survey, a Cyprus-based newsletter.
"By and large, then, it can be said that it was the indirect effects of the United States embargo on the commercial execution of the contract terms which prompted Shell to bow out, rather than the direct political impact of the embargo itself," the newsletter said.
Combined crude output from the Sirri-A and Sirri-E fields would start at 70,000 barrels a day, rising to 120,000 barrels a day by the turn of the century, the Middle East survey has previously reported, citing estimates from the National Iranian Oil Company. Exports would be processed by existing facilities on Sirri Island after some modifications.
Shell's withdrawal leaves Total S.A. of France as the front-runner for the Sirri project.

HEADLINE: Supply Exceeds Demand for Ph.D.'s in Many Science Fields

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
THE holder of a doctoral degree in science or engineering would probably make a better taxi driver or bank teller than someone without a Ph.D. But if a newly minted doctor of science is hoping for a permanent, full-time job in his or her specialty, there is a 1-in-4 chance of being disappointed, according to a recent survey.
As if that were not bad enough news for young scientists, the authors of the report have concluded that increased government spending for scientific research, even if it were granted, would eventually make the job situation even worse. 
 The survey, supported in part by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and by Federal funds, was conducted by the Institute for Higher Education Research at Stanford University and the Rand Corporation, a Santa Monica, Calif., research institution with traditional ties to the Defense Department.
The study, which covered 13 science and engineering fields, 210 doctorate-granting institutions and more than 1,000 educational institutions that employ people with doctorates, was led by two economists, Dr. William F. Massy at Stanford and Dr. Charles A. Goldman at Rand, assisted by two graduate students, Marc Chun and Beryle Hsiao. They concluded that "universities in the United States are producing about 25 percent more doctorates in science and engineering fields than the United States economy can afford."
The group experimented with mathematical models designed to predict the effects of changes in conditions, and concluded that increasing government funding for scientific research would actually exacerbate the glut of Ph.D.'s in the long run.
By increasing research funding, Dr. Massy said, "the whole system will be expanding and people will get the kinds of jobs they were trained for.
"However," he adds, "as soon as you stop increasing it and go back to a steady state -- not a decrease -- all of a sudden the underemployment comes back. In fact, it comes back worse than it was before because the whole system has scaled up."
Professors whose research projects depend on cheap, competent help from a constant supply of graduate students are among the main offenders, they said, and it is time for university administrators and professors to throttle back the flow of graduate students passing through the educational system into very uncertain careers.
Surprisingly, the overproduction of Ph.D. degrees seems to be highest in computer science at present. The surplus of doctoral computer science degrees currently awarded over the number of those who get desirable jobs in their field is 50.3 percent, Dr. Massy said. (This figure does not represent an actual unemployment rate of 50.3 percent, but merely the current estimated imbalance between supply and demand.)
The job situation in other branches of science and engineering is better, the study found, but surpluses of supply over demand are still large; for example, 31.5 percent for physics, chemistry and mathematics; 26 percent for chemical engineering; 44 percent for mechanical engineering, and 23 percent for geological sciences. The survey found that demand actually exceeds current supplies of new Ph.D. holders in psychology, but Dr. Massy said the probable reason is that doctoral-level psychologists are often siphoned off into clinical jobs not included under the heading of science and engineering.
The findings of the new study closely parallel those of several recent studies by other academic and professional groups.
A task force created by the American Chemical Society and headed by Dr. David K. Lavallee, provost at City College of New York, reported in May that its preliminary findings "indicate an annual oversupply of chemistry Ph.D.'s in the work force of between 250 and 400."
The overall unemployment rate for chemists is low, only about 2.5 percent. But substantial numbers of chemists recently awarded Ph.D.'s are unable to find permanent, full-time chemical research jobs. Many therefore accept postdoctoral academic appointments as teaching or research assistants, usually for two years at a time with relatively low pay and little chance for permanent employment.
The chemical society task force calculated that if a postdoctoral appointment persisting for more than four years is considered unacceptable, 12.5 percent of recent Ph.D.'s are either unemployed or stuck in undesirable temporary jobs. If the desirable cutoff is assumed to be anything more than three years in a postdoctoral job, the percentage rises to 19.5.
To some extent, the gloomy job prospects for aspiring scientists have already affected the degree-granting institutions of the nation.
A recent report by the education and employment statistics division of the American Institute of Physics said that the number of first-year physics graduate students has dropped by 6 percent for the second consecutive year; about 2,900 students entered physics graduate programs in 1993-94, down from 3,300 in 1991-92.
Some universities have announced their intention to hold down enrollment in physics, and one, James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., has announced that beginning with the coming semester, it will no longer offer a physics major program at all. The contracts of the university's 10 tenured physics faculty members will be terminated in August 1996.
The outlook for young mathematicians also looks bleak. A survey by the American Mathematical Society of the 1,125 recipients of doctoral degrees in mathematics from July 1, 1990, to June 30, 1991, found "an alarming 12 percent of this population to be unemployed and seeking employment." This rate, according to Dr. Donald E. McClure, professor of applied mathematics at Brown University, was more than twice as high as for the previous year's crop of Ph.D.'s.
Holders of doctorates are not alone in facing the slump in scientific and engineering jobs. A survey by the National Science Foundation published this year concluded that the 1993 job market for recent college graduates in the sciences and engineering was significantly worse than it was in the late 1980's.
Dr. Goldman of Rand said in an interview that it had been "surprisingly difficult" to get reliable statistics on the sizes of university faculties in scientific and engineering disciplines, or on the rate at which academic positions become open, and that many sources of data had to be compared to calculate estimates.
Most science students tend to regard their professors as role models in research careers. But instead of becoming tenured faculty members like their teachers, many end up with temporary postdoctoral jobs or worse.
In a recent satirical essay published by the journal Nature, the British physicist and humorist David Jones chided television programs that "take up science on the absurd pretense that science is fun."
"In fact," he wrote, "there is no demand for scientists, as shown by their low salaries and dismal career prospects." Dr. Jones's tongue-in-cheek advice was to have a student float stock to pay for his studies, and let market forces shape his career.
"Suppose he wants to study physics," Dr. Jones wrote. "If the market feels him to be a rotten physicist, or reckons there are too many physicists already, he will find it hard to raise capital. His shareholders will steer him toward classics, advertising studies or wherever they see the best future returns."
Dr. Massy took a more sober view. Asked what he would advise children of his own who might be considering earning Ph.D. degrees in science, Dr. Massy replied: "I'd tell them, first of all, that they should not expect, as a matter of course, to be able to replicate the kinds of careers that their mentors have had, or that I have had. The job market is just too competitive to have any expectation of that. They might be very fortunate and achieve it, but the odds are against it.
"Having said that, if they have a true, deep and abiding interest in research, they certainly could give it a try," he added. "It's a wonderful career, if you achieve success. And if you have a deep interest in teaching, as some doctoral students do, this might not be a bad time, if they select their institution carefully.
"I think there will be renewed interest in the profession of teaching as opposed to the profession of research," Dr. Massey said.

HEADLINE: MILITARY OFFICIALS SEEK WAY TO SAVE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Pentagon officials have crafted a plan with members of the independent commission on the closing of military bases that they hope will save thousands of jobs at a California Air Force base and political face for President Clinton.
After intense negotiations over the weekend involving the commission, the military and the White House, the Pentagon is preparing to recommend that the President reject the panel's suggestion that 11,000 jobs at McClellan Air Force Base be transferred out of state. 
 Under the proposal, Mr. Clinton would ask the eight-member panel to reconsider the recommendations it made last month but only on the narrowest grounds. He would be most likely not to challenge the decision to close McClellan, but would ask that it be left to the Pentagon to decide which bases or private contractors will be awarded the work now done there.
Panel members had directed the Air Force to move the communications electronics work at McClellan to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania.
Many details are still unfinished and the discussions are still under way, but the Pentagon's preference would be the approach adopted with another large maintenance depot, Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio, where the panel left it to the Pentagon to decide where the work should be awarded. Under the compromise plan, President Clinton would ask for the same flexibility, offering hope that some or all of McClellan's military and civilian jobs could stay in California with private contractors.
If the commission approves this proposal, which the Pentagon could send to the White House as early as Wednesday, Mr. Clinton could claim credit for saving jobs in a state that is crucial to his 1996 campaign hopes. The President could also deflect Republican criticism that he is tampering with the integrity of the base-closing process by saying that what is fair for Texas is fair for California.
Mr. Clinton can suggest changes in the panel's recommendations, but he and Congress must approve or reject the list in its entirety.
"There is some hope for a resolution," Alan Dixon, a former Democratic senator from Illinois who is the commission chairman, said in a telephone interview. He declined to comment further.
Another panel member, who had joined Mr. Dixon in the 6-to-2 vote to close McClellan and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said of the proposed Pentagon recommendation: "I'd go along with that. But that's about as much as we're willing to compromise."
But it was unclear whether the plan goes as far as Californians or some senior White House political operatives would like. "It's something that sounds like it might have promise, but we'll have to see the analysis that supports it," said a senior Administration official.
Since the proposal would not guarantee McClellan's jobs would stay in California, the plan drew sharp protest today from California's two Democratic Senators, who have lobbied the President to reject the panel's recommendations as harmful to national security and California's suffering economy.
"It seems very timid and very strange, and it's not acceptable to me," Senator Barbara Boxer said in a telephone interview.
A spokesman for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Seth Oster, said, "Senator Feinstein does not see how this idea would make any sense at all. The Senator believes the only idea that makes sense is for the President to reject this list outright. There are simply too many jobs at stake in California."
The three previous rounds of base closings, in 1988, 1991 and 1993, resulted in the loss of 26,421 civilian jobs at California installations, according to the Pentagon. But Senator Boxer has said that as many as 200,000 jobs directly or indirectly tied to the bases would be lost.
In addition to losing McClellan in this latest round, the panel would also strip California of the Naval Shipyard at Long Beach, which employs 3,500 civilians, and the Army port in Oakland, which has 670 civilian workers.
Defense Department analysts have vainly struggled to find sufficient credible reasons to reject the panel's suggestions on Kelly and McClellan on the basis of cost or military value.
But if the base must close, the next best solution for the state would be to keep most of the work in Northern California, even at the base, to be done by contractors at lower costs.
The idea of shifting military maintenance work to the private sector has strong appeal for senior Pentagon officials. An independent commission looking for ways to streamline the military recommended such a plan in May. The head of that panel became the new Deputy Defense Secretary, John P. White, whose first tough task has been coordinating the Pentagon's response to the base-closing commission's list.
Under the legislation governing base closings, the President has until July 15 to accept the panel's recommendations or return the list to the panel citing his objections. If the White House rejects the list, which has never happened before, the commission will have until Aug. 15 to make any changes.
Mr. Clinton would then have to accept or reject the entire package. He could not tinker with its parts. If he accepts, the President will send the package on to Congress for an up-or-down vote on the recommendations in their entirety.
But few Congressional and military officials believe Mr. Clinton or lawmakers would dare to reject this last scheduled round of base closings. The Pentagon is counting on the more than $6 billion in annual savings to buy new weapons, pay salaries and insure proper training.

HEADLINE: In a Change of Policy, and Heart, Colleges Join Fight Against Inflated Grades

BYLINE: By DAVIDSON GOLDIN 

 BODY:
A year after Stanford University and Dartmouth College announced changes in their grading policies designed to stem a 30-year trend of grade inflation, a number of other elite colleges say they are considering making high grades the exception rather than the rule.
At Dartmouth, where the average grade increased last year to a B-plus from a B in 1973, transcripts now include not only grades, but also their context -- the class size and class average. 
 Dartmouth's registrar, Thomas Bickel, said the new grade reporting policy seemed to be encouraging professors to grade more harshly. At the end of the winter semester, grades were down from last year.
Stanford's new policy will bring back the F for the first time in a quarter century, beginning this fall, and will prohibit students from dropping classes late in a semester, a common practice to avoid low grades. Currently at Stanford, 90 percent of all letter grades are A's or B's. The goal is to return the center to C, for average work, and B, for good work.
Ramon Saldivar, Stanford's dean, predicted that Stanford's new grading policies would spark "a slow downward trend that will probably be noticeable in two to three years."
Deans at Cornell University, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania said their institutions were likely to follow Dartmouth's lead. The deans said that because getting an A was no longer necessarily indicative of superior achievement, their goal was to provide graduate schools and employers with a way to compare students.
"We feel that providing additional information will allow the readers of transcripts to have a better idea what grades really mean," said Kathryn Youtrakis, the associate dean of Columbia College. "For example, if a student scores a B-minus in one of our chemistry courses if the average grade in the course is a C, knowing that average grade gives you a lot more information about that student."
Even institutions that are not considering drastic changes in either their grading policies or their transcripts, like Harvard and Princeton Universities, said they are reminding professors that high grades should be awarded sparingly.
According to information provided by more than half a dozen leading colleges and universities, grades rose significantly in the late 1960's and early 1970's, leveled off in the mid-70's to mid-80's and began to rise again in the late 1980's. Institutions compiled their grading patterns in different ways, making it difficult to compare individual colleges. The bottom line is that professors award about twice as many A's as they did 30 years ago and less than half as many C's.
At Cornell, the percentage of A's doubled, to 36 percent of all grades in 1994 from 18 percent in 1965, while the number of C's dropped to 12 percent from 40 percent.
At Princeton in that time period, A's rose to 41.2 percent from 16.9 percent, with C's dropping to 9.4 percent from 19.6 percent.
At Harvard, the average grade has risen to an A-minus/B-plus from a B/B-minus in 1965, with more than 40 percent of all grades in the A range.
Institutions also report an increasing disparity in grades between humanities courses and science courses. At Penn, for example, average course grades range from an A-minus/B-plus in small humanities classes to B/B-minus in large natural science classes. That is prompting concern not just about grade inflation, but also about grade fairness.
Kent Peterman, Penn's associate dean for academic affairs, attributed the discrepancy to differences in the ways science and the humanities are taught. He said humanities classes are generally small, allowing students and professors a greater opportunity to develop personal relationships, and grading is based on writing assignments that can be revised or rewritten. Science classes, on the other hand, tend to be larger and generally award grades based on one-time exams.
Even while many institutions are seeking to make sure transcripts include a student's entire academic record, including both the proud and the not-so-proud, Brown University remains intent on making transcripts reflect only achievement. Any grade below a C does not appear on transcripts, and students are permitted to withdraw from classes at any point in the semester. Only 20 percent of a class, however, can graduate with honors.
"When you send in your resume, do you put down all the jobs you applied for that you didn't get?" said Sheila Blumstein, Brown's dean. "A Brown transcript is a record of a student's academic accomplishments."

Fuji Complaint by Kodak Shrugged Off in Japan
To officials at Eastman Kodak, perhaps, their complaint charging Fuji Photo Film and the Japanese Government with conspiring to block Kodak's entry into the Japanese photographic market might be as clear as a well-focused snapshot. But in Japan, the case seems more blurry than that. 
 On Monday, the United States said it would investigate charges by Kodak that it had been denied fair access to the Japanese market. Yesterday, Fuji and Japanese officials dismissed Kodak as a sour-grapes loser and ruled out negotiations on the dispute. Japanese retailers said that when prices are the same, consumers just prefer Fuji. [Page D4.]
 
'Apollo 13' Provides Hollywood Lift

Building a Bigger Military Budget
For the first time in more than a decade, the budget being prepared by Congress locks in military spending at levels higher than even the Pentagon requested and comes close to ending the post-cold-war decline in arms spending. The Clinton Administration and some outside experts say the Republican spending plans are stuffed with throwbacks to the era of a Soviet threat. Republicans and conservative Democrats say they are not increasing the Pentagon's budget in real terms, just slowing its cutback. [A1.]

HEADLINE: British Stocks and Bonds Gain as Major Retains His Leadership

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
British stocks and bonds rose yesterday ahead of a key vote on Prime Minister John Major's continued leadership of the governing Conservative Party, and the pound advanced following news of his victory.
Financial markets in the United States were closed for the Fourth of July holiday. Elsewhere, European and Asian markets were generally higher. Germany's main stock index rose 1 percent, led by utilities and chemicals, amid hopes that a slowing American economy would hasten cuts in global interest rates. 
 The London Stock Exchange closed before votes were counted in Mr. Major's move to wrest back control of his Conservative Party. He defeated a challenger for the party's top post, which also carries the prime ministership.
A win by Mr. Major was seen as benefiting British assets by reducing the risk of an early general election that could lead to a change in government and its economic policies.
"The market's been preoccupied with the idea that Major's going to win the vote," Fred Yearly, a trader at Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. said. "That's helped support stocks."
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index rose 25.50 points, or 0.77 percent, to 3349.20, led by gains in British Telecommunications, British Petroleum and Tesco P.L.C.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Government bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was last quoted at 8.42 percent, compared with 8.45 percent on Monday.
The British pound rose against major currencies after Mr. Major won the leadership election, strongly beating his challenger, John Redwood. A country's currency often suffers when its leadership is in question.
"Sterling is taking the news quite well," said Chris Turner, director of currency strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "It was a better result than people expected."
The pound rose to 2.2105 German marks from 2.2051 marks, where it was quoted before the results of the election were announced at about 5:20 P.M. London time.
The pound rose against the dollar as well. It was last at $1.5991, up from $1.5970 before the results, and up from $1.5978 in London on Monday.
The dollar rose against the mark after Mr. Major's victory. Many traders sold marks for dollars, then sold those dollars for pounds to try to take advantage of the British currency's gains. The dollar rose to 1.3823 marks from 1.3800 marks in London late yesterday.
The rise in the German market came on the eve of a meeting by the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, which will decide whether recent signs of economic weakness will permit a cut in American interest rates.
In Frankfurt, the DAX Index of 30 electronically traded stocks rose 10.45 points, or half of 1 percent, to close at 2,110.13. The index was pulled higher by gains in Siemens, Deutsche Bank and Mannesmann.
The prospect of lower United States rates lifted stocks in Germany as traders reasoned that a cut would give Germany the leeway to lower its own rates.

HEADLINE: Temple U.'s Dispute With Philadelphia Stalls a Giant Sports Complex

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 2

 BODY:
On a Saturday afternoon in June 1994, Temple University's executive vice president, James S. White, was in his office putting the finishing touches on testimony he was to give before the City Council two days later.
After several years of land acquisitions, engineering studies and negotiations with business and civic groups, the university appeared close to breaking ground on an $80 million sports arena and business complex for the blighted inner-city neighborhood surrounding Temple. Only a few routine city ordinances were still needed, and the mood in Mr. White's office, as he recalled, "was real high." 
 Then the telephone rang. The caller, a lobbyist hired by Temple to sell city officials on the project, relayed some unsettling information.
"The message was from the City Council president that I was to include in my testimony a commitment to finance a $5 million housing program," Mr. White said recently. "I had never heard of anything like this. Everything went rapidly downhill."
Since that day, the complex, the largest development proposed in many years for the hard-bitten streets of North Philadelphia, has been stalled by a standoff between city and university officials. And the complex, known as the Apollo of Temple, has become a lightning rod for a debate over the extent of responsibility that a powerful university has to its neighbors.
The standoff has pulled in the State Legislature and the Governor and has prompted Temple to threaten to move more of its operations to the suburbs. The dispute has also underscored the detrimental effects of a long, acrimonious rift between two of the city's most dominant leaders: Temple's president, Peter J. Liacouras, and the City Council president, John F. Street, a Temple law school graduate whose district includes the 111-year-old public university.
After negotiations over the last year, the university and the city have agreed that Temple will provide the $5 million to rehabilitate housing in the neighborhood, raising the total price tag of the project to $85 million. But the sides remain at loggerheads over who should control the housing fund, the university or a neighborhood group.
Despite the promise of more than 400 construction jobs and some permanent jobs for local residents, Mr. Street has led the opposition to Temple's request for the zoning variance. He is demanding that the $5 million for the housing program be given to an autonomous neighborhood-controlled development group.
"We get the housing under the terms we want and Temple will get the zoning," Mr. Street said in a recent interview.
Temple officials insist they must maintain authority over the housing fund, since university trustees would raise the money.
They also express concern about a pattern of misuse of money by nonprofit community development corporations in the city, like that the City Council has proposed in the Temple neighborhood. The officials also assert that Mr. Street wants to control the patronage that the housing fund would provide.
Temple has offered to have a board dominated by neighborhood representatives administer the day-to-day use of the fund, while the university would retain the right to audits and financial reports.
 
Raising the Stakes By Defying Council
The Apollo would include a 11,000-seat sports and convocation complex, a 12-screen movie theater, stores and a restaurant with live jazz. Temple received $33 million from the state toward the project, and the rest of the money would come from private donations. University trustees have raised about $21 million so far.
Temple officials have enlisted the help of the university's most famous graduate, the entertainer Bill Cosby, to advertise the project in the local media. In an interview, Mr. Cosby, a native of northeast Philadelphia, said that the dispute "making Philadelphia look silly" and that "people in other cities are laughing."
In an effort to get around the City Council, the university sought special authority from the State Legislature to build the Apollo without the city's approval, raising the ire of Mayor Edward G. Rendell and other municipal officials. The Legislature approved a bill that would exempt the university from city zoning ordinances, and Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, signed the measure on Friday.
City officials contend that zoning is a local issue and say they will fight the exemption in court, if necessary.
Part of the problem is that community leaders, business owners, Temple administrators and faculty members and city officials have different views on how to achieve and maintain a healthy, attractive neighborhood.
Thomas Marino, a professor at the Temple medical school, said, "The Apollo just happens to be a focal point for a much larger discussion about what the university and North Philadelphia are going to look like in 10 years."
Many faculty members argue that Temple's role as the community's primary employer, and its record of providing social services, health care and police protection to city residents are unappreciated in the neighborhood.They say the university's resources are stretched too thin to develop a project that includes such significant largesse for the neighborhood.
Faced with a $16 million budget gap, Temple announced in recent weeks the layoffs of 85 administrators and cut 55 faculty positions. It has also eliminated some graduate programs, shut down its public television station and closed a day-care center.
"We have to be a good citizen," said Roland Lipka, president of the faculty senate, which represents the university's 1,500 faculty members, "but the question is, How good a citizen should we be?"
 
Neighborhood In Need of Lift
The Cecil B. Moore Avenue area, which borders the southwest end of campus where the Apollo would be built, looks like a neighborhood suspended between death and resurrection.
The $5 million contribution from Temple would be part of a $25 million effort to revive the area with 400 new houses and 100 renovated ones for low- and moderate-income owners. The city would raise the additional money.
"They move our people out," said Paula Taylor, president of the Jefferson Manor Community Development Corporation, and an ally of Mr. Street. "They believe this is Temple Town, not that they are our neighbors in northeast Philadelphia."
If the university tries to begin construction without reaching an agreement on the housing program, Ms. Taylor warned, "we are committed to laying our bodies down to stop them."
For their part, Temple's administrators say the Apollo is a necessary investment. With the 18-to-24-year-old population on a steady decline in the city, the university must draw more students from surrounding counties.
Twenty years ago, 80 percent of Temple's students were Philadelphia residents; now, 40 percent are. Enrollment has dropped 7 percent to 30,300, and there are fears of crime in the neighborhood. Two months ago, a Temple undergraduate was killed at a cash machine a block from the campus.
In a letter to Mayor Rendell, Mr. Liacouras, the university's president, warned that if the Apollo project was canceled, Temple's trustees would have to consider "the downsizing of Temple in Philadelphia and the movement of programs to the suburbs."
Such a move would severely alter the face of education in the city, given Temple's traditional role as a sort of city college that educates a wide variety of local residents.
Temple already has about 2,000 students at its suburban campus in Ambler, Pa., where the university owns 184 acres. Mr. Liacourcas said Temple would be forced to refocus on the suburbs for future projects if it could not build in the city.
In Philadelphia, he added, "nothing will work unless we have the neighborhood improve cooperatively."
 
2 Personalities In Conflict
But cooperation has not been possible between Mr. Liacouras and Mr. Street, who were once close friends.
When Mr. Street had difficulty getting into Temple University's law school, a program for disadvantaged students started by Mr. Liacouras, who was then dean of the law school, helped Mr. Street gain admittance in 1972. In 1980, when Mr. Liacouras ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate, Mr. Street campaigned on his behalf, endorsing him as "the guy who gave me a chance."
In 1984, the friendship fell apart when information about Mr. Street's defaulted student loan debt were disclosed to the press and Mr. Liacouras was reported to be the source. He said he was not the source of the disclosures. Mr. Street refuses to discuss the matter. The two men have not talked since.
In an interview in his office, Mr. Liacouras pulled from his desk a black and white photograph taken in 1982, on the occasion of his being named Temple's president. In the photo, Mr. Street is kissing the cheek of Mr. Liacouras's mother, Stella.
Gazing at the photo, Mr. Liacouras said, "I wish this wasn't viewed as personal, but it partly is."
Mr. Street feels differently. "I don't ever have to talk to him," he said in a telephone interview. "Why do I need to talk to him?"
He pointed out that they communicate through intermediaries and letters. "This is business," he said.
Time is running out, as construction costs continue to rise and benefactors get cold feet. And the City Council has recessed until September without taking action.
Probably no one is as frustrated with the dispute as is John Chaney, Temple's venerable basketball coach. Known for his winning teams and acerbic tongue, Mr. Chaney said that the 3,900-seat basketball arena and the condition of the surrounding neighborhood gave other coaches an advantage in recruiting.
Mr. Chaney said he had a solution: "that Temple pack it up, move to the suburbs, and leave a hole in the ground and a statue of the Mayor and the Council president holding hands, together again."

HEADLINE: Lower Budgets Don't Cut Flow Of Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
At a time when the New York City and State governments are cutting sharply into spending for schools and social services for the poor, they are providing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits to big businesses, including some of the nation's largest corporations.
The Pataki and Giuliani administrations say the tax breaks, which have gone to such corporatons as ABC and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the Wall Street brokerage concern, are part of a long-term strategy to shore up the local economy by keeping big employers from leaving New York. In other states, they say, such enticements abound. 
 But a growing number of critics, including elected officials, economists and urban planners, question whether a strategy of broadening tax breaks to business makes sense while cities and states are doing some of the most far-reaching budget cutting in decades, affecting virtually every government service from education to garbage collection.
In Connecticut, for example, which has attracted more than 25 major Manhattan companies over the last 20 years, the appetite for extending large-scale corporate tax breaks has cooled under Gov. John G. Rowland, a conservative Republican who took office in January.
"The new administration is placing greater emphasis on the overall business environment, not on assisting specific companies," said Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Economic Development Department.
Over the last 18 months, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has approved 11 deals to give $348 million in sales tax breaks to a variety of companies. Although the arrangements were negotiated by the city, they include concessions from the state and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which gives the city's Economic Development Corporation the power to act in its stead on such matters.
These incentives are part of a long menu of tax breaks, low interest financing, energy subsidies and other benefits that have been expanded under Mayor Giuliani, despite challenges from the State Comptroller and several City Council members.
"There is this silly debate, fueled by left-wing critics, over whether you have a choice about whether to extend these benefits," said John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "If you want to keep jobs, you don't."
Similarly, in Albany the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has agreed to give I.B.M., which was threatenting to move out of state, an extraordinarily rich package of incentives, including $75 million in state-financed, low-interest loans to build a new headquarters in Westchester County. The state also agreed to lease vacant I.B.M. buildings in Kingston, East Fishkill and Binghamton, and to transfer more than 2,000 state data processing jobs to those buildings.

Fierce Competition To Keep Businesses
With other cities and states offering similar deals to prevent departures of manufacturing plants, office complexes and sports teams, a fierce national competition has broken out. But in recent years, with the costs of such enticements, some states have started to back away.
"When firms ultimately do leave, their parting words are that the streets are filthy and the schools are bad," said Elliot Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. "Government should get back to providing government services."
Though the present administrations in New York have expanded these economic development programs, they were not the first to embrace them. Starting in the early 1980's, New York City responded to an exodus of companies to Connecticut and New Jersey by offering property tax breaks and other subsidies.
Among the beneficiaries under the adminisration of Mayor David N. Dinkins were CBS, Morgan Stanley and The New York Times, which was given $21.5 million in tax credits, grants and purchase options from the city for a new printing plant in College Point, Queens. The long-term tax breaks for the companies were intended to keep them from moving operations out of the city.
"Bear in mind that companies don't need to be here," said Clay Lifflander, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which has negotiated the biggest corporate deals under Mayor Giuliani. "I think that if you ask for a long-term commitment, you should give them something in return."
Last year, hundreds of New York City companies, from small merchants to the nation's top investment firms, benefited from the city's largesse. In property tax breaks, city records show that businesses received $301.8 million in subsidies last year, far above any previous year.
The largest source of subsidies, accounting for $147.9 million of the 1994 property tax breaks, is the Industrial and Commercial Incentive program, which has been available since 1981 to companies and real estate developers who build, move to or expand above 96th Street in Manhattan or in the other four boroughs.
That program was broadened gradually in the 1980's, and, at Mayor Giuliani's behest, was expanded again in a Council vote called shortly after 2 A.M. on June 22 after a full day of action on budget issues. Under the new rules, developers who build "smart buildings," which are highly computerized and climate-controlled, qualify for property tax breaks if the buildings are between 23d and 59th Streets in Manhattan.
The Mayor also won Council support for a package of tax breaks for companies and developers below Chambers Street, but those need approval from the State Legislature.
"This is a giveaway to the real estate industry," said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza.
Mr. Dyson said the city must offer such subsidies to compete with the rising number of governments trying to lure businesses away. "There isn't a day that goes by when I don't hear about some mayor, governor or foreign official in this town trying to lure a company away," he said.
Already, New Jersey, a tough competitor for New York City business, has begun to raise the stakes in the competition. "It is becoming a more competitive world," said Alan J. Steinberg, assistant commissioner of New Jersey's Commerce and Economic Development Department. He said his agency and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman would give the State Legislature a proposal to offer large companies that move to or expand in New Jersey long-term reductions in sales and corporate income taxes.
Much of the controversy in New York has been set off by the circumstances surrounding many of the richest incentive packages. For the most part, the tax breaks and other incentives have been negotiated behind closed doors without public input, approval by the City Council or the Legislature. And a handful of the beneficiaries are political supporters of the Mayor and the Governor.
Two of them, CS First Boston and Donaldson, Lufkin, were among the biggest corporate donors to Mr. Giuliani's 1993 mayoral campaign. More than 20 executives of Donaldson, which received $29.5 million in long-term tax breaks in September 1994, combined to contribute $39,880. Executives of First Boston, which got $50.5 million in city tax breaks in January, contributed $21,850.
One business organization that stands out in lobbying is the New York Mercantile Exchange, which received the largest corporate retention package under Mayor Giuliani and now plans a new headquarters and trading floor in Battery Park City. That deal includes $129 million in cash from the city and $58 million in other city and state benefits.
The package, announced by the Mayor last September, provoked opposition by many officials before it was approved by the City Council and the City Comptroller in recent months. At the same time, the exchange's City Hall lobbying expenses, recorded by the City Clerk, jumped to $28,939 in the first three months of this year, from $13,200 in the last three months of 1994 and $9,800 the preceding three months.
In Albany, Governor Pataki's chief economic adviser and corporate negotiator, Charles A. Gargano, was the top fund-raiser for his campaign, responsible in that job for seeking support from companies and individuals alike.
"When these corporate benefits are negotiated behind closed doors, they almost inevitably lead to the impression of an incestuous relationship between government officials and big business," said Stephen Moore, chief economist for the Reason Institute, a conservative California research organization that has analyzed the increased use of tax breaks to attract and retain corporations across the nation.

Making Sure Promises Are Kept
When giving large tax breaks, the city and state governments have sometimes been lax in insuring that companies live up to their promises not to relocate jobs.
Last month, the New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said an audit by his staff found "no evidence" that New York City "actually monitored employment levels."
The focus of Mr. McCall's audit was the the city's Industrial Development Agency, which provides low-interest financing to companies through the sale of tax-free municipal bonds. Determining which companies qualify, and assuring that they meet employment requirements, is the Economic Development Corporation's responsibility.
The Comptroller's staff examined the hiring and employment levels of 12 companies among 124 business organizations receiving low-interest loans between July 1988 and June 1993. It said seven had failed to meet their employment objectives.
Earlier this year, Mr. Giuliani learned that both First Boston and Donaldson Lufkin were planning to cut hundreds of New York City jobs in their trading and public finance departments. The city's agreement with the companies did not include potential layoffs in those departments.
In May, the Mayor announced that he was freezing a $6.4 million package of tax breaks extended a year earlier to the Republic National Bank of New York. Republic, which had promised to keep 2,400 workers in the city, had instead announced layoffs in the city of 850 employees.
Late last month, aides to the Mayor said the Republic deal was dead.
City officials say they have toughened the rules to make sure companies do not renege on their commitments. "We have put teeth into the process that never existed before," Mr. Dyson said.
He said each benefits package negotiated with a company contains provisions that it keep a minimum level of employment, subject to some flexibility in economic downturns, and that anytime a company failed to live up to its commitments, its benefits would be canceled.
Other provisions, not yet tested, Mr. Dyson said, would require a company that blatantly violates its commitments to the city -- particularly by moving workers somewhere else -- to reimburse the city for its tax breaks or other benefits.

HEADLINE: The Anti-Tax Man Cometh

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Individual income taxes, Irwin A. Schiff tells everyone who will listen, are voluntary, but almost everyone pays because politicians have enacted complicated laws to trick people into thinking they must pay.
The view might sound absurd, and Mr. Schiff used to be cursed at when he voiced it. But some Americans are taking it seriously. 
 The works of Mr. Schiff are now widely cited in the literature of tax protesters and right-wing organizations challenging the legitimacy of the Federal Government. Over the years, he has been a frequent guest on talk shows around the country, having discussed the issue with Larry King, Tom Snyder and, in the New York area, Bob Grant.
He says he has sold 30,000 copies of his latest self-published book, "The Federal Mafia," and more than 67,000 copies of his 1982 book, "How Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Taxes." And, in recent weeks, an Internet site devoted to taxes has been dominated by arguments over Mr. Schiff's idea, now advanced by a variety of his followers, that no law makes individuals or corporations liable to pay income taxes.
Mr. Schiff preaches that "a compulsory income tax would violate" the Constitution despite the 16th Amendment, and so the Internal Revenue Code "was written to make paying income taxes appear mandatory."
"The Government succeeded in doing this," he contends, "by tricking the public into believing that those enforcement provisions of the code that apply to other, nonvoluntary taxes -- like alcohol and tobacco taxes -- also apply to income taxes when in fact they do not."
At age 67, tanned and exuding confidence that he has uncovered the greatest hoax of all time, Mr. Schiff says he is finding a sharp change in public reaction to his theories.
"Ten or 15 years ago I was called a Communist," Mr. Schiff said in an interview last month. "People who called in would say if you don't like America, leave it. Tomorrow I will be on nationwide radio for three hours telling people the same things and I won't get one negative call."
And he didn't. Nor did anyone attack his views on several other programs in the days that followed.
Mr. Schiff's grass-roots challenge to the legitimacy of the Internal Revenue Service is so far mostly words. He has won no big legal battles in his crusade and has spent more than three years in prison after losing a couple. The I.R.S. brushes off Mr. Schiff and his followers as sadly misguided pests.
Yet even people who ridicule his interpretations of tax law say Mr. Schiff is tapping into a deepening well of popular resentment. His books are widely cited by a melange of groups, many calling themselves patriots of various stripes. "A belief that the income tax is invalid or illegal is a fundamental belief among Christian Patriot groups," said Jonathan Mozzochi of the Coalition for Human Dignity in Portland, Ore., which tracks such organizations.
But Mr. Schiff's anti-tax message is also making its way into the mainstream. "His argument appeals to people whose economic situation has peaked and are desperately looking around for some way to improve their situation," said Richard D. Adams, an assistant professor of auditing at the University of Baltimore who frequently jousts on the Internet with advocates of the idea that income taxes are voluntary.
Indeed, the tax revolt may be more widespread than the I.R.S. lets on. While it reported only 160 open criminal investigations of tax protesters as of last fall, an agency official testified in the trial of an anti-tax activist last year that "hundreds of thousands of people" directly challenge the legal authority of the I.R.S. by filing protest returns or asserting a constitutional right not to file.
The reasons for the change of heart are complicated. Beyond economic factors, one might be the collapse of Communism, a force that had rallied Americans behind the Federal Government against a foreign enemy. Another is a belief that the Government is mostly wasteful and inefficient.
"There has been a dramatic loss of public support for the income tax," said Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School and former Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy in the Bush Administration. "The anti-tax movement extends far deeper than Mr. Schiff and his believers."
In fact, there are many proposals in Washington to scrap income taxes in favor of a flat tax, a national sales tax, a value-added tax or some other plan, all promoted with a promise that most people will pay less.
Mr. Schiff's journey to the libertarian fringe of the tax-protest movement was a long one. In his youth in New Haven, he says, he absorbed the leftist politics of his father, a carpenter and self-described Socialist.
"I was very pro-Roosevelt," he said.
Then, in his mid-20's, he went through a crushing disillusionment. Running the state election campaign of a friend, he was shocked by what he regarded as the moral crassness of politicians. "I never heard them say, 'We will do this to help people,' " he recalled. "They said, 'We will get this guy this job and that guy a contract,' and I realized government is just a business people get into to benefit themselves. From that point on, I listened closely to politicians and I realized that they lied."
Despite that experience, he led a fairly conventional middle-class existence in Connecticut through the 1960's and early 70's, raising a family and running a company he formed to administer health plans for doctors.
He wrote his first book, "The Biggest Con," in 1976 to expose what he viewed as the Federal Government's deceitful ways, including how departing from the gold standard would spur inflation and higher taxes. As time went by, he became more interested in tax issues, inspired by a businesswoman who refused to withhold income taxes from her workers' paychecks. "I wondered at how she had the courage to do what she did," he said.
Ultimately, he took a similar step. In 1974, he quit paying Federal income taxes, prompting a long legal battle that resulted in his imprisonment twice in the 1980's for a total of four years. By the time he got out in 1993, he had sold his business and gotten a divorce.
This year, Mr. Schiff moved to Las Vegas and rented a $730-a-month, two-bedroom apartment that is decorated with plaques and trophies that he has won as an amateur magician. But he spends most of his time on the road, selling books and videotapes and preaching his anti-tax gospel at seminars and on talk shows. He has his own weekly broadcast here.
He carries a cellular phone but says he has no bank account, using cash or credit cards to pay his bills, because he figures the I.R.S. would seize the money as payment toward the $1.2 million in back taxes that it contends he still owes. Already, the agency has confiscated $220,000 in royalties from his 1982 book, "How Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Taxes."
Mr. Schiff is as close to an intellectual light as anybody in the movement against the income tax. His confidence and seeming mastery of the most arcane details of tax law make him a hit with some people. "People respond to Irwin because he is a genuine guy and he has court cases and laws he cites to back up everything he says," said Jamian White, co-host of the nationally syndicated "Birdwell and White" program on Talk America Radio Network, on which Mr. Schiff was a guest last month.
Timothy L. Deaton, who with his wife runs a tiny computer repair and programming business in Shelbyville, Ind., listened to lectures by Mr. Schiff last October, then paid $385 for his collection of books and tapes and started reading tax court cases in the local law library.
"After my studying I'm convinced that Irwin is right, that there is no law that says you have to pay income taxes," he said. Last year, the Deatons paid the I.R.S. $25,900 toward income taxes for the year, but then filed a return reporting no income for 1994, adopting Mr. Schiff's argument that wages are not income under the law. The I.R.S. then refunded the $25,900.
A spokesman for the I.R.S. declined comment on the Deatons' tax return, but said the agency's policy was to withhold refunds from taxpayers who file returns claiming zero incomes. The spokesman, Steve Pyrek, said the I.R.S. typically did not begin auditing returns until 18 months after they were filed and that recovery of refunds issued in error might take several years.
William Cohan, a lawyer in Encinitas, Calif., who defends tax protesters, calls the notion that individuals are not liable to pay income taxes "loony." But Mr. Cohan said the I.R.S. made it possible for people like Mr. Schiff to flourish because it uses the term "voluntary compliance" on its Form 1040 instruction booklets for taxpayers.
I.R.S. officials say Mr. Schiff reaches his conclusions by selective reading of the law. And Margaret Milner Richardson, the I.R.S. commissioner, said that in I.R.S. usage, the term "voluntary compliance" referred to filling out tax forms, not to paying taxes.
In an interview, Mr. Schiff compared himself to two dissidents in the former Soviet Union. "Sharansky went to jail! Solzhenitsyn went to jail!" he said. "Repressive regimes always send people who speak the truth to prison."

HEADLINE: Fed Rate Step Won't Ignore Bond Market

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Speculation has been building for weeks about whether signs of an economic slowdown will lead Federal Reserve policy makers to reduce short-term interest rates when they meet here Wednesday and Thursday. But the key question before the central bank's officials may lie in how well financial markets would withstand a decision not to cut.
The Federal Reserve prizes its independence from Wall Street and from the White House: "No one forces our hand," a Fed Governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, said in an interview last week. Still, the Fed's leaders take many of their cues from the bond market. 
 Prevailing interest rates for Treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of up to five years are now less than the Fed's 6 percent target for overnight loans. And while rates have bounced back slightly over the last two weeks following signs that the economy might be less weak than previously thought, the persistent gap between market rates and the Fed-controlled interest rate suggests that many investors still believe the Fed will have to cut rates this summer, and possibly this week. Having already adjusted to lower rates, markets might slump if the Fed does not follow through.
What remains unclear is whether the concern by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, about the health of financial markets will exceed his worries that a premature rate reduction could feed inflation later if, as he has predicted, the economy bounces back by the end of this year. And a rate cut on Wednesday or Thursday could prove embarrassing to the Federal Reserve if unemployment figures for June, scheduled for release on Friday, show a rebound in the economy.
The Federal Reserve is scheduled to receive an advance copy of the June unemployment figures, but not until late Thursday afternoon. By then, its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will likely have adjourned.
Fed officials are fond of reminding listeners that their shifts in short-term interest rates affect spending and investment decisions -- and therefore economic growth -- with a lag of six months to two years. Yet a quarter of a percentage point reduction in short-term interest rates -- the scenario most commonly cited now by economists -- would make little difference for the economy, but could have a big and immediate effect on financial markets.
Top Fed officials, including Mr. Greenspan, have been feeling the pressure for a reduction in short-term interest rates this summer. Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, noted in an interview last month that soaring stock and bond prices, and the accompanying fall in long-term interest rates, have partly counteracted weakness elsewhere in the economy.
The scattered signs of economic health in the last two weeks seem to have reflected lower interest rates in financial markets. For example, the Commerce Department announced on June 29 that sales of new homes had soared 19.9 percent in May, when mortgage rates were falling steeply in lock-step with interest rates in the bond market.
The conflicting pressures on the central bank have opened fissures within the committee, with Mr. Blinder expressing more concern about the economy than Republican appointees like Mr. Greenspan and Edward W. Kelley Jr., another governor. When Mr. Greenspan conducted his usual informal poll of the committee members ahead of this week's meeting, Mr. Blinder was said to have pressed him for lower rates and warned that he might dissent if this did not happen.
Mr. Greenspan noted during a speech in New York on June 20 that, "Of one thing I am certain -- our Federal Open Market Committee meeting in a couple of weeks will be most engaging."
For all these reasons, cautious experts are forgoing predictions about this week's meeting. "It's a very close call," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor. "I think this is going to be a meeting at which reasonable people can differ."
The American stock and bond markets are also no longer the only financial markets that are important to the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan said in his New York speech that every central banker has to set policy these days with an eye to the huge sums of money flowing across national borders these days, which can swamp even the best-planned economic strategy.
A reduction in interest rates now could cause the already weak dollar to fall further by reducing the returns in short-term interest rates here. As a result, even Wall Street economists who want lower rates are saying that the Fed should cut only the Federal Funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, and not the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for short-term loans.
The Federal Funds rate, currently 6 percent, is much more important for the economy than the discount rate, which is currently 5.25 percent. Banks borrow very little money at the discount rate these days because the Fed discourages them from doing so. But the discount rate has remained an important symbol of the stance of American monetary policy, particularly for traders in foreign countries where the discount rate is still more important.
As a result, Sung W. Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis, predicted this week that the Federal Open Market Committee would probably cut "the Federal Funds rate by half a point but leave the discount rate alone to keep the dollar from sliding."
But Mr. Sohn's prediction of even a half-point cut this week puts him in a minority. Some economists predict that the Federal Open Market Committee will give Mr. Greenspan explicit authority to cut short-term interest rates at his discretion at any time before the committee's next meeting on Aug. 22.
Still other economists, looking at this week's meeting, take the view of Paul L. Kasriel, vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company, a Chicago bank.
"I am predicting a quarter percent cut in the Federal Funds rate and no change in the discount rate," he said. "The Fed is not really sure how much it will need to lower the funds rate now, so it's probing."

HEADLINE: A Rough Year For Farmers Appears Likely

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 4

 BODY:
Cold, wet spring weather across much of the Midwest, followed by a searing dry spell in early June, has set the table for what could be a rough year for many farmers. An average or even slightly better than average grain and soybean harvest is still possible, analysts say, but shortfalls seem more likely.
Problems with this year's crop already are translating into higher prices for livestock feed, costlier ingredients for food and beverage companies and higher prices for industrial consumers of agricultural products. Little of the expense has filtered through to consumers, but that could change if continued weather problems hamper the current harvest of winter wheat and the progress of crops planted this spring. 
 "We're in nail-biting time," said John McMillan, who follows agribusiness for Prudential Securities. "The margin for error is low."
The high risk of poor harvests is particularly worrying because worldwide corn and wheat supplies began the year near historic lows when measured against how much is being consumed. With less in reserve, every new hint that harvest projections will have to be lowered makes buyers more nervous. As more of them purchase futures contracts to lock in the price they will pay for crops they need next month, or even next year, prices for both the futures and the grain currently being sold spike upward.
"What we've seen so far will raise consumer food prices by a half a percent to 1 percent, to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent," said Paul Prentice, president of Farm Sector Economics Inc., a Colorado Springs consulting firm. "But if corn got to $3 a bushel and stayed there, the rate of food inflation could double to between 5 percent and 6 percent."
That impact would come primarily from the effect of higher feed costs on poultry, pigs and beef. Higher feed prices can initially drive meat prices down as animals that become too expensive to feed are killed, adding to supplies. But once those animals are gone, supplies tend to tighten, sending prices up.
Price increases are already pinching profits for many agribusinesses. The stock prices of food producers like Tyson Foods Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland have slumped as analysts pare earnings estimates. Many smaller competitors have been even harder hit. Last week, a large ethanol plant in Southpoint, Ohio, owned by Ashland Oil and three minority partners, said that it would shut down and lay off 182 workers because it could not sell ethanol and its byproduct, a feed additive for cattle, at a high enough price to cover the cost of corn.
The outlook got even bleaker on Friday when a Government report cut estimates of the number of acres of corn farmers managed to plant to 72 million, well under the average estimate by analysts of 73.4 million. Corn futures prices rose sharply that day in heavy trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, and analysts said the price could continue to move up in coming weeks. Traders around the world use the Board of Trade contracts as the benchmark for virtually all other corn sales.
Wheat prices, up more than 30 percent since March, to their highest levels since the 1970's, have climbed even more sharply. They could well head still higher if more storms hit the winter wheat harvest, which is currently working its way north through Oklahoma and Kansas. Winter wheat accounts for more than three-quarters of the United States crop. The projected total crop this year is 69.4 million acres, well below what analysts had earlier expected. Poor quality is also a major concern.
The weather has been better further north, but the wet, cold spring delayed planting of spring wheat in that region making it less likely that American farmers can contribute much this year to lessening the tight worldwide supply outlook.
"The question worrying us now is whether this price rise is a blip, a plateau, or a rising curve," said Mark Dirkes, a spokesman for the Interstate Bakeries Corporation in Kansas City, a leading producer of breads and cakes.
The hardest hit corn growing regions are in the southern half of the Corn Belt, including Missouri and the southern portions of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. Unlike the floods of 1993, where the worst of the weather damage occurred after crops were planted, this year's problem was simply getting into the fields in the prime planting period of late April and early May.
"I've never seen anything like it in 22 years in the business," said Bill Shaw, the district representative in northeastern Missouri for Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the country's largest corn seed company. Over 80 percent of the Pioneer seed sold for early planting in Mr. Shaw's district was returned. Some was exchanged for soybeans or strains of corn bred to mature more quickly. But, Mr. Shaw estimated, about 50 percent of the land that farmers in the region originally intended for corn never got planted.
The lost acreage in the southern part of the Corn Belt might have had less impact on the corn market if farmers in other regions had not set aside 7.5 percent of the land they would normally have devoted to corn. The Government ruled last fall that farmers had to make such a set-aside to remain eligible for crop subsidies. It feared that a bumper crop like that harvested last year would create an oversupply. That would sink prices and increase the sums the Department of Agriculture would owe farmers under the subsidy program.
Looking ahead, farmers and customers alike are now most concerned about the more than 70 million acres that did get planted. Much of the planting took place weeks behind schedule and in poor conditions. The old adage that corn is "knee high on the fourth of July" is true in many areas this year; unfortunately, it is also woefully out-of-date when applied to modern strains that are expected to be waist high at this point.
The crop has come along nicely in the past two weeks but the portions planted in wet ground have poor root structures. That corn is more susceptible than usual to damage from insects and the high winds of passing thunderstorms. And late planted fields will begin the pollination process that creates grain inside the ear in late July or August instead of early this month. Later pollination brings higher risks of heat and dry weather than can reduce the number of kernels per ear.
The late planting also leaves less time for the corn to mature before harvest. "If we have an early frost, we're toast," said William Biederman, vice president for research at Allendale Inc., an agricultural consulting firm.
The soybean crop is also late and likely to produce poor yields in many areas. Because stocks are relatively high though, and farmers may have switched as much as a million acres they originally intended for corn into beans, price pressures have been more moderate.

HEADLINE: Indian Politics Derail a Big Power Project

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 4

 BODY:
A few months ago, it seemed like an ideal match. On one side was India, now open to foreign investment but starved of the electrical power needed for economic growth. On the other was a consortium of major American companies with a contract to invest nearly $3 billion in an advanced power plant outside Bombay.
When paperwork on the contract was completed in January, the consortium, led by the Enron Corporation of Houston, a big natural-gas supplier, was the jewel in the crown of a budding new business relationship between India and the United States. 
 Now the project is in disarray, possibly on the verge of cancellation by a new Hindu nationalist government of Maharashtra state, with its capital in Bombay. Threats by leaders of the state government to "bundle Enron into the sea" have reminded some Indians of the atmosphere in the 1970's, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi forced Coca-Cola, I.B.M. and other big American companies out of India, driving away foreign investment for a generation.
The attack on the current project is based on accusations that the Americans obtained unduly favorable terms from the national Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao that will translate into onerous rates for Indians, an assertion that the parties to the deal deny. Critics have also noted that the contract was awarded without competitive bidding, a break with the tight rules that govern public contracts in India.
For the American companies, and for foreign investors in general, the attack underscores the uncertainty of doing business in developing nations. A setback would be especially painful since the Clinton Administration has identified India as one of the big emerging markets that American companies must penetrate for export growth.
For Prime Minister Rao, who must call a national election by next spring, the attack is a challenge with a strong political subtext: He has built his record largely on an ambitious program of economic change, with a more open environment for foreign investors as a centerpiece.
Indians who have backed these changes fear that a collapse of the Enron deal could set off a chain reaction, with other foreign investors pulling out -- leaving India, one of Asia's poorest nations, to fall still further behind its neighbors. Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, the architect of the changes, has called the Enron project a litmus test for the entire economic effort.
Amid the tide of good feelings that prevailed last year, the Enron project was lauded as an example of all that American investment could accomplish in India. The project, with the General Electric Company's GE Capital unit and Bechtel Enterprises as minority partners, was to be by far India's largest single foreign investment, with $990 million for the first, diesel-fueled phase of the power plant, to be completed in 1997, and a further $2 billion for a second, gas-fueled phase, with the details to be negotiated later.
India needs few things more than electric power. With chronic power shortages that regularly paralyze factories, offices, hospitals and trains, India's state-owned electrical utilities have been the butt of recriminations for years. Under its program of economic reforms, the New Delhi Government has plans to increase total power output by half by the end of the decade, with 60 percent of the increase to come from foreign-built plants.
If India seemed poised to gain from the Enron deal, so too did American companies, many of which had focused on India, with its nearly 900 million people, as a market that could not be missed. During a visit earlier this year by the United States Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, American officials boasted that, in India at least, American companies had stolen a march on Japan, which has led investment elsewhere in Asia.
Now, despite the controversy, Enron's engineers have forged ahead at the power-plant site on the rocky Arabian Sea coast 100 miles south of Bombay. Work stopped for a time in May, when demonstrators attacked the site, slightly injuring three Americans and wrecking vehicles. Since then, the Dabhol Power Corporation, the Indian-registered company founded by the American partners, has laid foundations for the generating plant and begun work on other facilities.
But soon the Maharashtra government, a coalition of two Hindu nationalist parties, will begin a review of the deal it ordered after ousting the Congress Party in an election in March. The nationalists' victory followed a campaign in which they accused the Congress Party officials of guaranteeing windfall profits for the Americans, and of accepting kickbacks. No evidence has been offered to support that allegation.
Still, the nationalists struck deep chords in India's psyche. Gopinath Munde, Maharashtra state's deputy chief minister, told election rallies that the American companies were offering nothing India could not accomplish on its own and that Enron's profits would be paid "on the backs of India's poor."
The criticism has spurred a noisy debate across the country, with a torrent of articles in newspapers and magazines, some defending the Enron deal and many more decrying it. "India's status will be enhanced, not lowered, if it tells the world that it is no pushover, no banana republic ready to accept an atrocious deal," a commentary in the influential Times of India said.
The main Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, known as the B.J.P., has shown signs of using Enron as a trial balloon for a national campaign next year that would make a big issue of charges that the Rao Government had "sold out" India to foreign interests. The Maharashtra coalition is composed of the B.J.P. and an extreme Hindu nationalist group, the Shiv Sena.
In the last week, Enron executives have prepared for the worst. "I'm in grief," Rebecca Mark, the 40-year-old president of the Enron Development Corporation, the subsidiary that concluded the deal, told reporters in Europe. Ms. Mark spoke after Indian newspapers said a Maharashtra review committee headed by Mr. Munde would condemn the Enron project and recommend that it be canceled without compensation.
Diplomats at the United States Embassy here have been ordered to say nothing to exacerbate the situation. But privately, they say that at least two big American companies have put negotiations for major Indian investments on hold. Other Western embassies report a similar cooling among foreign companies.
"Since the days of the East India Company, Indians have always been suspicious of foreign companies," a Western diplomat said. "It's too tempting a target for the nationalists to leave alone."
Hopes for saving the project appear to depend mainly on a last-minute reversal by the Maharashtra leaders, prompted perhaps by hints from Enron and its partners that they could use an arbitration clause in the contract, providing for settlement of disputes in London, to sue for compensation. Enron executives have suggested that claims could exceed $100 million, but at the urging of the United States Ambassador, Frank G. Wisner, the company has toned down some of its tough talk.
Behind the scenes, Enron executives and American diplomats have met with the New Delhi Government, hoping that, if all else fails, Mr. Rao will use power given the central Government in the contract to block cancellation of the deal.
When Enron's negotiations faltered last year, Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary led a succession of Clinton Administration officials to India and persuaded Prime Minister Rao to approve guarantees that New Delhi would pay for the power generated by eight foreign-built power plants, including Enron's, if India's state electricity boards, notorious for their corruption and inefficiency, failed to pay.
One solution suggested by officials in India's power ministry is for New Delhi to compensate Enron and its partners if the project is canceled, and to recoup the money from the subsidies it regularly pays to Maharashtra. Another possibility is that the Rao Government take over the project and transfer it to another state with chronic power shortages, possibly the eastern state of Orissa.
But for the moment, attention is focused on the risks of the Enron dispute torpedoing India's prospects of attracting other foreign investments, including an estimated $50 billion urgently needed to build more power plants, as well as to improve battered ports and roads. Overall investments have been painfully slow, with less than $2 billion coming in last year, a fraction of the amounts foreign companies are investing elsewhere in Asia.
Those who say that Enron and its partners have been given overly generous terms focus on a provision in the contract that guarantees a minimum return on investment of 16 percent, rising to a potential 30 percent if the Enron plant operates at close to its full 2,015-megawatt capacity. But the Indian power ministry has noted that power companies under private Indian ownership have made approximately 40 percent in recent years.
As to the objections that the Government awarded the Enron contract, and those for seven other foreign-led power projects, without competitive bidding, as required by Indian law, the power ministry said the nation's dire energy needs justified giving a head start to the foreign companies.
Ms. Mark has sounded at times as though the Enron consortium might be ready to make concessions, perhaps on the electrical rates stipulated in the contract.
"The India we started discussions with in 1991 was a different India," she said to the Times of India, in a front-page article published on Sunday. "We went there when no one wanted to go. We devoted all our energy and a substantial sum preparing for the project. It was done in a spirit of solidarity with India, not in a self-serving way."

HEADLINE: Camden Aquarium Changes Lures;
Forget the Local Color, Brighter Fish May Attract Visitors

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
For years the accepted wisdom about the mad public love for fish under glass meant that anybody could build an aquarium, and people would turn out in the millions. Then the New Jersey state aquarium tampered with the formula by specializing in local fish.
There are a lot of brown fish in New Jersey waters. Brown flounder. Brown cod. Even much of the water is dun. The aquarium almost single-handedly brought down the national statistics for aquarium attendance and worse, it failed to prove the engine of redevelopment envisioned for this impoverished city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. 
 "I mean, fish in New Jersey are not very interesting, they are kind of drab looking," Wanda M. Bullion, a librarian in the Camden schools, said. "The Nintendo generation wants color, excitement -- you have to get their attention."
This weekend, the aquarium started trying to do exactly that.
Cries of "Shark! Shark!" and "EEEwwwww, look at the eel!" resonated through the aquarium, reopened on Saturday after BRC Imagination Arts, a theme park design company based in California, spent six months and $3.75
 
million remodeling the inside. The "Made in New Jersey" label is all but banished. Caribbean and ocean exploration have arrived.
There are crimson and gold Spanish logfish, purple Creole wrasses and French angelfish striped in blue. Everything from squawking macaws to mariachi bands to piped-in undersea noises to coral reefs is meant to transport visitors to an exotic realm.
"People go to aquariums because they want to see cool fish with neat stripes and neon colors and eyes bulging out of the sides of their head," said Jane Ballentine, director of public affairs for the American Zoo and Aquarium Association.
Although the aquarium's long-term appeal remains untested, the changes do seem to be drumming up renewed interest, with 16,029 visitors over the four-day holiday, compared with 12,617 for the same period last year.
Originally New Jersey legislators wanted to draw on the experience of cities like Boston and Baltimore, where aquariums helped transform decaying downtown sections into thriving tourist meccas. They sought a similar change for Camden, a city of 85,000 that still has a 22 percent unemployment rate and a national reputation for things like the 1991 pre-Halloween pyromania when vandals torched 120 empty buildings.
A 1985 study for building the aquarium anticipated it might draw as much as $500 million in further investment, but only about a third materialized. A 25,000-seat amphitheater, a garage and a corporate building have been completed, while the Delaware River Port Authority is putting up another office tower and a restaurant.
One problem was a poor economy. Dr. Judith L. Wellington, the aquarium president, said the average tourist in neighboring Philadelphia visits the Liberty Bell and then leaves, so the aquarium relies heavily on local visitors. Sitting there alone, the aquarium could not overcome Camden's reputation as a good place to get your car stolen. The locale, even with a $4 ferry from Philadelphia, and the unadorned exhibits did not attract the crowds that would encourage new shops and restaurants.
Aquarium advocates generally blame the state legislators who balked at the original price tag of $53 million in taxpayers' money and had to be mollified with a promise that the exhibits would glorify New Jersey. When it was finished, the state leased the 100-acre site for $1 a year to a nonprofit management corporation, the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences.
Things went swimmingly at first. In the first 10 months of operation in 1992, 1.1 million people showed up. But they did not come back, forcing cutbacks in staff and hours. By 1994, only 511,000 people came and membership plunged to about 8,000 from a high of 19,000.
It was the first such dramatic drop in the nation, according to the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, which has acquired 18 new members over the last 25 years, most since 1990. The crowds at its 26 member aquariums peaked at almost 35.5 million in 1993. Then in 1994 the number fell to 34.9 million.
The New Jersey aquarium did attract something of a marketer's dream -- with an average family income of more than $60,000 -- but the exhibits were deemed too passive. The Maritime Center in Norwalk, Conn., with a record of 482,000 visitors over the last 12 months, also features local marine life, but its exhibits invite children to touch shellfish, build Lego dams and navigate boats.
In Camden, many of the "natural habitats" were not exactly crowd pleasers. A New Jersey jetty exhibit meant a lot of dark water and a few rocks highlighted by a glimmer of movement. The outer walls were unfinished concrete, and walking from tank to tank was as compelling as meandering from exit to exit on the New Jersey Turnpike.
"Before our kids were chasing ahead of us to get out, but this time they seem transfixed," Barbara A. Shively, from Allentown, Pa, said.
The difference in the remodeled aquarium, officially the Thomas H. Kean New Jersey State Aquarium, starts in the front lobby, dominated by a seven-foot-high replica of the jaws of a 50-foot Megalodon shark, mounted with real fossilized teeth.
There are more sharks to touch, and visitors can play with a 12-foot shark statue whose every inch is an interactive exhibit. They can move its dorsal fin with a wheel, inventory the debris in its stomach or lift flaps on its tail that answer questions like, "How are sharks like birds?" (Some lay eggs.)
In the once static hallway that held the 150 New Jersey fish, the exhibits literally leap off the walls as the garish coral and other underwater motifs were incorporated into the oddly shaped walls around the tanks.
The New Jersey fish were not filleted. A few tanks are newly disguised within rainbow-hued satellite maps of local waterways. Most of the fish were recast as anonymous background players in the massive main tank.
Referred to by museum staff as the "Big Wow," the main tank used to be the first thing visitors saw and was known for its reflected view of the Philadelphia skyline. Now it is the finale.
At 760,000 gallons, it holds enough water for one person to shower for 40 years. It has a population of about 2,000, including Bob the sea turtle, whose jaw marks are visible on some fish, and two dozen well-fed, crowd-pleasing sharks. Well, mostly crowd pleasing. A toddler set into a bubble window that gives viewers the sensation of sitting in the tank ran screaming from the room when a shark, jaws gaping, whizzed by his nose.
While scores of the new exhibits are much more hands on, the aquarium also evidently thinks adults wouldn't mind more than just fish.
A woman named Monica Rodrigo introduced a troupe of South American dancers who performed under the new fish mobile and shimmering blue lights of the main rotunda.
"The couples dance separately doing frenetic and erotic movements which are based on jumps, falls, chases and confrontations between man and woman," she said, explaining that the dance was called the mapole after a fish from the waters off Colombia. "The dancers' moves imitate the movements of this fish."
There were no dances named after New Jersey fish.

HEADLINE: Jockeying for Block Grants

 BODY:
The Republicans act like they want to chop the last four words from President Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it." They propose doing away entirely with the 60-year-old entitlement that guarantees Federal and state money for poor mothers. Instead, the Republicans want Washington to turn fixed pots of money, called block grants, over to states to spend on the poor, or slash to inconsequence, as they please.
The block grants are being sold as a solution to the Federal deficit and a deterrent to out-of-wedlock births. Washington would no longer spend more money every time state welfare rolls swell. Nor could teen-agers count on government to help pay the cost of raising children. But the G.O.P. is fast learning that block grants are no magic elixir. The proposal has stalled in the Senate in a battle among states over how to allocate the block grant money. 
 The challenge is to find a formula that simultaneously satisfies states that are rich or poor, fast or slow growing. The G.O.P.'s insistence that Federal welfare spending fall over the next seven years makes the task of allocating a shrinking resource all the more politically daunting.
The House has passed a welfare bill that sets block grants to each state at, roughly, the amount Washington is currently providing to their welfare programs. But when Sun Belt senators took a hard look, they bolted because their states currently get far less Federal money than do Northern states. That is because the South puts up far less money per poor child than the North, and Federal contributions are tied to the amount a state spends on its own. So the Sun Belt senators devised a different formula that would move toward equalizing Federal spending per poor child -- dramatically shifting Federal money out of New York and into Mississippi and other Southern states. Federal welfare spending in New York could fall by half.
All of the Republican block grant proposals pose a grave danger to the poor because the G.O.P. will not insist that states maintain their own contributions at current levels. That leaves them the option of cutting back their own welfare spending entirely. States will be under tremendous pressure to cut spending on the poor to save money in these tight financial times and to drive the poor elsewhere.
To make matter worse, Senate conservatives are flirting with turning food stamps -- an entitlement the House left in place and that is paid for entirely by Washington -- into a block grant. The impact would be catastrophic, according to estimates by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Under current law, when recession hits and welfare rolls rise, Mississippi spends only about $25 per month of its own money to support an additional family on welfare and food stamps, with Washington picking up the rest of the tab. But with block grants, Washington would not spend an extra dime as welfare rolls rise -- leaving Mississippi to cough up, at current benefit levels, an extra $400. New York now spends about $235 of its money to add a family to welfare and food stamps, the balance coming from Washington. Under block grants, New York would have to spend an extra $685 to support families at current benefit levels. So when recession hits, fiscally strapped states would be apt to gut services or deny eligibility to millions of needy families.
The G.O.P. might resolve the North-South feud by devising a complicated formula that took account of current Federal spending but also spent more in states with low benefit levels or fast-growing poverty rolls. But there is a problem. If the Republicans refuse to spend more money, then the money directed to the South will have to come out of the coffers of states in the North. The likely result is further political gridlock.
Even without the feuding, block grants would be an unprincipled reform. Welfare should be provided from Washington, not state and local governments. That is the only way to insure that states set benefits at compassionate levels, rather than ramping down benefits to drive the poor into someone else's lap. Now the Republicans are finding that this unprincipled reform is also politically intractable. It is probably asking too much for the G.O.P. to back down. The only hope is that whatever formula they choose takes account of people in need.

Half A Loaf

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In trying to determine whether the latest U.S.-Japan trade accord on autos is a good deal or a bad one, I'm reminded of what Chairman Mao reportedly said when asked what he thought of the French Revolution: "It's too soon to tell."
To be sure, it is troubling to note how happy the Japanese are with this deal. Any deal Japan is happy with is a deal the U.S. should worry about. Japan is a country with structurally closed markets and a $130 billion global trade surplus. If your negotiating outcome with Japan is "I'm O.K., you're O.K.," then you're probably not O.K. 
 But then, it's not surprising Japanese officials would try to put the best public face on this deal. What is more indicative is what the U.S. car manufacturers are saying in private. Detroit's executives are chronic complainers and they have an enormous stake in opening the Japanese market. What they are saying is that as a result of this deal they will sell more cars and parts to Japan. But, what they are also saying is that this deal, while it wedged the door open for them, has not fundamentally changed the Japanese system, which limits showroom space for U.S. cars and restricts the sale of U.S. auto parts. That's why their bottom line is: this deal creates the opportunity for a stream of new sales to Japan, but certainly not a flood. It's worth supporting, but not celebrating.
If that's the case, what lessons can be drawn from this partial victory?
1. Pain works, and more pain works better. Whatever the U.S. got out of these negotiations came because it credibly threatened Japanese auto companies with real pain, in real time, involving real money -- 100 percent tariffs on every luxury car they sell in the U.S. American officials really don't know how to influence decision making in Tokyo. But Toyota does. Mitsubishi does. Squeeze them hard enough and they will get the right message to the right Japanese bureaucrat.
2. The Clinton Administration put an enormous nine-month effort into organizing that pain. It was the trade equivalent of firing the guns of Navarone. But when you finally fire the big guns, you're supposed to sink the fleet -- you're supposed to fundamentally alter Japan's closed system of interlocking companies. This deal took only the first steps toward that end.
But Washington is not likely to threaten to fire the big guns again soon. It's too unsettling. So how does it keep inflicting pain on Japan to open other closed markets? The only way is to work more effectively with the Europeans, and other open-market Asian countries, to line them up against Japan and create more leverage. The Europeans and Asians share America's frustration with Japan's closed markets, but not its unilateral tactics. Washington has to find a way to work with them in every world organization to relentlessly expose Japan's protectionist practices and to enlist the full force of international opinion against Tokyo.
3. If America is to fully harvest even the limited promises Japan made in this latest deal, it must staff the U.S. embassy in Tokyo with fewer cold war political officers and security types and more Japanese-speaking commercial experts who can follow the Japanese auto market to verify whether Tokyo is living up to its commitments. Right now the Tokyo embassy does not have nearly enough staff to monitor this agreement in proportion to the pressure Washington put on to achieve it and in proportion to the stakes involved in making it work. As the Japanese say: "Shinyo suru ga kakunin suru" -- trust but verify.
4. For now the Japanese have us over a barrel. Either their economy is so weak that they say "How can we compromise?" or their economy is so strong that they say "Why should we compromise?" That vicious cycle will only be broken when Japan redefines its own interests. That is, when it shifts from a nation obsessed with protecting its producers to a nation more concerned with protecting its consumers -- giving them the lower prices and the range of choices that come with real open markets. It's just like arms control with the Soviets. We really only saw a huge reduction in nuclear weapons after Mikhail Gorbachev took office and decided to shift Moscow's relationship with the U.S. from one of adversaries to one of strategic partners.
When might that happen with Japan? Sooner, one hopes, than it took Mao to make up his mind about the French Revolution.

HEADLINE: Clean Water: A Midstream Approach

BYLINE: By Sherwood Boehlert; Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Within the year, the 104th Congress may rewrite the Clean Water Act, the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and portions of the Clean Air Act. In short, it may redesign the entire framework of environmental protection that has been developed over the past 25 years.
That could have salutary results. The laws need to be redrafted to prune red tape, cut back the natural accretion of bureaucracy and, most important, reflect the findings of the latest scientific and economic research. Unfortunately, Congress seems poised to leap far beyond such level-headed revision and instead reverse more than two decades of environmental progress. 
 The vote last month in the House to dilute the Clean Water Act demonstrated what an uphill battle it is to put together a coalition for sensible reform. But the vote also indicated that moderates still could carry the day as the debate over environmental protection moves forward.
Part of the problem is that the terms of debate are being set by those at the ends of the spectrum. On one side are environmental absolutists, who often sound as if they view the restoration of Eden as a reasonable interim goal for environmental policy. On the other is an increasingly strident conservative vanguard, which believes (to update Barry Goldwater) that extremism in the defense of libertarianism is no vice and moderation in the pursuit of deregulation is no virtue.
Both sides grossly misread the desires of a pragmatic and often ambivalent electorate. The absolutists choose to ignore the voters' growing suspicion of the Federal Government and, in the abstract, of regulation. But the libertarians fail to see that the voters still expect the Federal Government to guarantee them a cleaner environment. And, polls show, the vast majority even want the Government to do more to achieve that end.
What is to be done? Congress can satisfy the voters, protect the environment and maintain the nation's ability to compete in the world economy, if its environmental policy is guided by three fundamental moderate principles:
Repeal is not reform. Environmental law can be improved without eliminating the provisions that have made it so effective. This principle has often been honored only in the breach by the current Congress.
For example, in the name of "reform," the clean water bill that passed the House repealed the entire program that limits discharges of polluted storm water -- even though storm water runoff is responsible for more than 25 percent of damage to water quality in the United States.
Was repeal necessary to eliminate the flaws in current law? Absolutely not. An exemption for small communities and small businesses, which contribute little to the problem, could have eased the burden of regulation without threatening water quality.
Instead, the House used a guillotine to cure a headache -- giving aid and comfort to the environmental absolutists by making credible their claim that "reform" is merely a euphemism for backsliding.
States have a role. Centralizing all decision-making, as the environmental absolutists desire, is a recipe for an anti-regulatory backlash. Giving the states a greater role in environmental policy -- the power to carry out Federal law by granting permits for the use of wetlands, for example -- reduces red tape and insures that regulators understand local conditions.
On the other hand, environmental policy cannot simply be delegated to the states, as the libertarians pretend. Air and water recognize no state boundaries. Supporters of the House bill repeatedly said that Maryland could protect the Chesapeake Bay without Federal regulation if the state was genuinely concerned about its recreation and fishing industries. But Maryland would have no way to stop polluted water originating in Virginia or Pennsylvania.
Regulation should be based on science. Scientific research should not be viewed as suspect simply because its findings may be politically uncomfortable. During the House debate on the Clean Water Act, however, proponents of the "reform" bill attacked a report on wetlands issued by the National Academy of Sciences because it inconveniently offered a scientific definition of wetlands that would have required the bill's proponents to preserve far more acreage than they wished. Yet wetlands follow the laws of nature, not the laws of Congress.
At the other end of the spectrum, the absolutists have not helped the cause of science either, sometimes clinging to outdated scientific findings and forecasts if they can be used to paint a picture of looming environmental catastrophe.
A bipartisan coalition is beginning to form around these principles, despite the polarization in Washington and the lobbying clout of the libertarians and their allies.
During the clean water debate, the moderate coalition was able to block the repeal of the program that protects coastal areas from pollution carried by runoff -- preventing untold billions of dollars in damage to beaches and fishing areas. And though a moderate version of the entire bill lost, it drew 184 votes, far more than anyone had predicted.
The moderate effort was truly bipartisan. It was led by Republicans, with significant support from members of both parties. Speaker Newt Gingrich, incidentally, encouraged Republicans to air their differences.
We have demonstrated that moderates in both parties can work together. If we continue to do so, the public may yet get what it wants -- effective environmental protection that does not unduly burden business or individuals.

Running the Offense, When to Run Is Enough

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, July 4

 BODY:
Tomas Murray lost his right basketball shoe but hardly a step as he stopped to retrieve the shoe, slipped it back on and then stole the ball from the player he was guarding.
Those rapid-fire movements during a game held to assess talent at the Special Olympics World Games last Saturday would have evoked cheers at any basketball game. But in this instance, they elicited a roar, because Murray has only one leg and, without a prosthesis, runs up and down the court on that one appendage. 
 Not only that, but the 20-year-old Murray, who usually plays point guard, is one of the best players on the Panamanian basketball team. In an assemblage of athletes who perform wondrous achievements in spite of their varying levels of mental retardation and, in some cases, physical disability, Murray is perhaps the most remarkable.
"He's amazing, absolutely amazing," said Jim Reynolds, the boys' varsity basketball coach at Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven and commissioner of the basketball competition, which has drawn 608 male and female players from 44 nations. "He does things that a lot of two-legged players can't do."
In a sport where balance is important, a one-legged player would seem to be at an almost impossible disadvantage. But the 5-foot-4-inch, 180-pound Murray rarely loses his balance, as he demonstrated while playing forward in a game between Panama and the Dominican Republic this afternoon at Quinnipiac College in nearby Hamden.
"It's hard to believe, but Tomas hardly ever falls down," said Troadio Fernandez, the director of the Panamanian delegation to the games, which run through next Sunday. "He's a very good passer, sets good picks and screens and is the team's best 3-point shooter."
Murray, a fiery and aggressive player, did fall down today, three times in all, once after shooting a 3-pointer. But over all he acquitted himself well as Panama was routed by a far superior Dominican Republic team, 85-52, after having won its opening-round game against a New Mexico team made up entirely of Navajos. Playing a little more than half of the 30-minute game, he made 1 of 5 shots, on a layup in the second half. Murray also dazzled the crowd of about 300 with a behind-the-back pass. And unlike many of his teammates, he never turned the ball over as he quickly hopped about the court.
What makes Murray's dexterity and agility on the court even more notable is that, off the court, he walks with crutches, because he does not have a prosthesis for his left leg.
Murray, who is from the Panamanian province of Bocas del Toro near the Costa Rican border, lost his left leg at the hip at the age of 7 when he was hit by a train. But his disability did not keep him from developing into an all-round athlete, who plays baseball, volleyball and American-style football, in addition to basketball in a regular league in Panama.
Why doesn't he use a prosthetic device, he was asked. "Because of economic conditions," he said through an interpreter, referring to his family's financial situation. "I had two -- one when I was small, and another from 13 to 16 -- which I outgrew."
Even when he used an artificial leg, though, Murray said he usually played without it. A third prosthesis is awaiting the young Panamanian when he returns home. "The club that sponsored my trip is giving me the leg, and I will wear it," said Murray, whose degree of mental retardation is slight and who hopes to study engineering at the university level in Panama. "But I won't use it to play basketball."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
An American Manifesto for a Desirable Future

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

THE NEXT AMERICAN NATION
The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution
By Michael Lind
436 pages. The Free Press. $25
 Excepting the immodest few who run for top public office, not many observers of the passing scene would have the audacity to present their ideas for the collective American future as a "manifesto." It is a measure of his boldness that Michael Lind does just that. 
"The Next American Nation," he writes, is "the first manifesto of American liberal nationalism," which, in essence, is a prescription for prosperity and justice based on what Mr. Lind calls "cultural fusion and genetic amalgamation not just of white immigrant groups but of Americans of all races." Moreover, he writes, only liberal nationalism, by contrast with other, either liberal or conservative counter-manifestoes, "can lead to an America in which you and your descendants would want to live."
If you say that yours is the only way to a radiant future, you'd better be good. Fortunately, Mr. Lind is very good. "The Next American Nation" is a brash, refreshingly unorthodox, always interesting performance by a young man (he is just 32) who defies the usual political categories of left and right, liberal and conservative.
This is not to say that Mr. Lind's book is always compelling or even that it is convincing more than half of the time. It is often both tendentious and dreamy, based too much on pure thought and not enough on any experience with the way the world actually works. Just about every element of Mr. Lind's description of the current national plight and in his prescriptions for the future is debatable. Still, even when he is utopian or dogmatic, Mr. Lind saves himself by his obvious intelligence. His book is one of the best -- certainly it is the most visionary, the most forward-looking -- in the growing library of works on the American identity, multiculturalism and the future.
"The Next American Nation" is organized around what might be called two disavowals. The first concerns the dominant vogue of multiculturalism, which Mr. Lind treats as an unmitigated calamity. He is an enemy of racial preferences, affirmative action and racial labeling, the elimination of which he cites as liberal nationalism's "one nonnegotiable demand."
The second disavowal is of what Mr. Lind variously calls "the plutocracy," the "white overclass" or the "oligarchy," which, he argues, has throughout American history struck a series of grand compromises, all of them aimed at maintaining its ascendancy in American life. His analysis is unabashedly based on economic interest with little room left for other factors, such as idealism or principle. In the first American Republic, the "Anglo-American nation," the compromise was between North and South to keep blacks in bondage. The Second American Republic, what Mr. Lind calls "Euro-America," saw the bargain struck between the oligarcy and the white working class to keep blacks out.
This leads to Mr. Lind's highly critical portrayal of multiculturalism, which he declares "a repellent and failed regime," though not for the reasons normally cited by the critics of such things as racial preferences and the cult of ethnic and sexual authenticity. Conservatives have warned that these practices will lead to separatism, lowered standards and Balkanization. Mr. Lind avers, by contrast, that multiculturalism has become the basis for a new grand and highly conservative compromise. The white overclass has used racial labeling to buy supremacy by co-opting token numbers of blacks and other minority group members and giving them overclass status, leaving the vast majority untouched and unhelped. The real danger, Mr. Lind argues, is not Balkanization but Brazilianization, "a high-tech feudal anarchy, featuring an archipelago of privileged whites in an ocean of white, black and brown poverty."
Throughout much of this, Mr. Lind, swept up perhaps in the grandeur of his vision, engages in overblown descriptions of the current national plight, his constant use of such words as "plutocracy" and "reactionary" summoning up images of a banana republic rather than the world's most prosperous and socially mobile democracy. Multicultural America is, he says, "plutocracy tempered by tokenism," which is a fine turn of phrase, but it does not disguise the author's approach, which could be called overstatement tempered by intelligence.
His notion that such approaches as affirmative action represents a kind of invisible hand of oligarchic power has an old-left pamphleteer's ring to it, but is it true? Mr. Lind, to take one of many possible examples, calls "our castelike educational system" the "final redoubt of oligarchy." His critique of preferences for the sons and daughters of alumni as affirmative action for the rich is compelling. But in 1993, the entering class at Harvard was more than 50 percent Jewish, Asian, black and Hispanic, while at Stanford, Berkeley and many other places those figures were even higher. Something more far-reaching than token gestures by the white overclass seems to be involved.
Mr. Lind's specific proposals for the future demonstrate the same blend of boldness and dubiousness as does much of his analysis. On the one hand, he brilliantly describes the elements of a common American culture. On the other, he lays out a vast government program involving an "unsubtle, crude, old-fashioned redistribution of wealth, through taxation and public spending." In other words, it's the kind of program that the common American culture, if the last election is any indication, has lately been repudiating, and that, by contrast with, say, Scandinavia, it has always repudiated. Mr. Lind would limit immigration, impose a social tax on goods imported from third-world countries (to protect American labor) and engineer an array of programs -- the "ideal would be 'maximum feasible paternalism,' " he writes -- to change the "culture of poverty" at the root of American misery.
Every one of these suggestions raises questions, as does one of Mr. Lind's main articles of faith, which is that in a regime of liberal nationalism "formerly accepted inequities become intolerable." Still, despite its weaknesses and implausibilites, "The Next American Nation" deserves the appellation that Mr. Lind, a bit immodestly, gave it. It is a manifesto, and it deserves serious thought.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE famous pianist and sometime Polish statesman Ignace Jan Paderewski liked zinfandel.
On the eve of World War I and at the height of his fame as an artist, he bought a 2,000-acre property, Rancho San Ignacio, near Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, on the central coast of California. Ten years later, after he had served a term as Prime Minister of the Polish state created by the Treaty of Versailles and had made a triumphant return to the concert stage, he planted a zinfandel vineyard at his California property. When the vines matured, the wine was made for him by the nearby York Mountain Winery, then, as now, one of the best-known wineries between Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
 The central coast, and especially the Paso Robles area, has always lived in the shadow of the better-known wine regions of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, 250 miles to the north. While grape growing and winemaking around Paso Robles (pronounced PAH-so ROE-bulls) are still not as intense as in the northern coast counties, growth in the last 20 years has been considerable.
The number of cabernet sauvignon acres there has increased from about 33 in 1971 to more than 2,600 this year, and the chardonnay area has gone from 29 acres to about 2,500 in the same period. Zinfandel, Paderewski's choice, is the second most important red-wine grape, with about 1,500 acres planted now, up from not quite 300 barely 25 years ago.
Winemaking in the area began at Mission San Miguel in 1797 and became significant in the last half of the 19th century, when immigrants who had come to California for the gold rush moved into the Salinas Valley to take up farming.
Prohibition, however, almost destroyed the wine business in the region. Most of the wineries in the Paso Robles viticultural area -- there are about 25 -- date from the early 1980's. Creston Vineyards, the Eberle Winery and the Martin Brothers Winery are three whose labels are likely to be seen outside the area.
Paso Robles and York Mountain are the two designated American Viticultural Areas in San Luis Obispo County. Paso Robles is an inland valley, desertlike and hot; York Mountain's location, only seven miles from the Pacific and with elevations of 1,600 to 1,800 feet, is maritime, with lots of fog and rain.
Paso Robles is cabernet and zinfandel country; York Mountain has become a source for top-quality pinot noir. Merlot from Paso Robles and from York Mountain has been quite successful. The region produces some fine chardonnay, but much of it goes into commercial wines made by large-volume wineries.
York Mountain Winery, the only winery in the York Mountain viticultural area, was founded by Henry York in 1882.
It has five acres of its own vines but purchases most of its grapes from warmer, sunnier California climes. Most of York Mountain's wines are sold at the winery to tourists on their way to or from the William Randolph Hearst castle, San Simeon, on the coast.
Few of the wineries in Paso Robles are well known outside California, except to a few connoisseurs who will kill to get a case of Peachy Canyon Winery's zinfandel or Wild Horse Winery's pinot noir.
The biggest Paso Robles winery in the region is Meridian Vineyards, just west of the town, on Route 46. Meridian owns some 500 acres around the winery and another 3,000 acres to the south, in Santa Barbara County. Current production is about 100,000 cases a year, but it regularly crushes enough grapes for 10 times that much wine. Meridian is owned by the Swiss food giant Nestle, which also owns Beringer Brothers, in the Napa Valley, among other wineries. And so much of the juice produced at Meridian travels north to Beringer, where it becomes wine sold under the Napa Ridge label. (Meridian was originally a Napa label established by Chuck Ortman. But in 1988, when Nestle bought the Estrella River Winery in Paso Robles and hired Mr. Ortman to run it, the company also bought the Meridian name and bestowed it on the Paso Robles property.)
At Peachy Canyon, also in Paso Robles, zinfandel is king. In defiance of the basic laws of economics, the owner, Doug Beckett, insists he will keep both production and prices low. So far, the winery has produced only a couple of thousand cases a year and, according to plan, will never go above 3,000. After the great succsss of the 1989 and 1990 vintages, customers have been lining up.
Wild Horse Winery, in Templeton, a town south of Paso Robles that is part of its viticultural area, is best known for its pinot noir, made mostly from grapes from vineyards further to the south in the Edna Valley and Santa Barbara County, among other areas. One pinot noir from Wild Horse was a blend of grapes from six Santa Barbara County vineyards.
The blending of grapes from different vineyards seems more prevalent in central and south-central California than it is north of San Francisco. While north coast winemakers eagerly seek out grapes and wine from these more southerly areas, they tend not to blend them. Around Paso Robles, however, wineries and growers seem quite content to work among themselves to achieve what they want in winemaking.
 
Tastings
Edmeades Vineyards Zinfandel (Zeni Vineyard), Mendocino County, 1993. About $20.
Twenty dollars for a zinfandel? For most zinfandels, no. For some, yes. This is one of them. Mendocino County, and particularly the Anderson Valley, is great zinfandel country, as this wine illustrates. It's a big-bodied wine with a deep, garnet red color. The taste is intense, and the flavors are concentrated. The wine has power and a long, lingering finish. The oak is a bit forward, but let's face it, oak is where the action is these days. Keep the wine around a couple of years and the oak will blend in. But who's going to keep it around that long?

HEADLINE: Traffic Moves Surprisingly Well In New Jersey Despite Toll Strike

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 4

 BODY:
The combination of a toll collectors' strike and hundreds of thousands of holiday motorists was widely expected to bring congestion of historic proportions to New Jersey's busiest highways today, but into the evening hours things were surprisingly smooth, with traffic problems less than on many other holidays.
By 10 P.M., highway authorities reported no major trouble spots related to the strike on the New Jersey Turnpike and a "sickout" at the Garden State Parkway, and officials at both the turnpike and the parkway said regular employees were returning to their posts. Traffic was moderate and moving steadily in most places, and the authorities said any delays were caused by the normal tie-ups that come on a holiday, no matter who is operating the tollbooths. 
 It was not clear this evening whether the smooth flow of traffic was a result of advance warnings of the labor disputes, which could have prompted some travelers to begin returning home early. At 1 P.M. today, there was a four-mile backup on the parkway south of the Outerbridge Crossing near Perth Amboy, but it was not clear whether that was related to an accident or to the job action.
Turnpike and parkway officials said they expected the staffing of the tollbooths for the Wednesday morning rush hour to be normal.
Highway officials said they were handling the 600,000 cars that travel the turnpike on a holiday, and the hundreds of thousands more that travel the parkway, with no major problems. But the same could not be said for labor negotiations. At the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, labor and management traded complaints about each other's handling of the strike, while the New Jersey Highway Authority, which oversees the parkway, successfully petitioned a state judge to order workers back to the job.
Although union toll collectors were calling in all day to say that they would return to work for the 10 P.M. shift, neither highway authority had any plans late today to return to the bargaining table to resolve the contract disputes that led to the job actions.
A New Jersey Superior Court Judge, Yolanda Ciccone, ordered toll collectors to return to the Garden State Parkway about 2 P.M. today after 80 workers out of 100 scheduled to work the morning shift called in sick after contract negotiations with the authority broke down.
Lewis B. Thurston 3d, the parkway's executive director, said the judge's order ended the job action at the parkway immediately, although he added that the highway was operating smoothly with temporary workers operating the tollbooths. He said the union employees would be allowed to fill their normal shift if they reported for work on time.
The situation was reversed at the New Jersey Turnpike, where toll collectors tried to return to work late Monday night after a state court judge ordered them to end their strike, but were told to go home by supervisors at the toll plazas.
The union representing the 800 striking turnpike toll collectors, Local 194 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, said all union employees reported for work on time Monday night to comply with the judge's orders. After being turned away at their job sites, workers from today's 6 A.M. shift picketed many toll plazas, waving signs that declared the turnpike management had locked them out.
"We came in at 6 o'clock, and they escorted us out," said Mike Ruvolo, a toll collector at Exit 10 near Edison. "They told us to leave. We showed up in good faith to work, and they won't let us work. If they were going to do that, what did they get the injunction for?"
Roger Nutt, executive director of the turnpike authority, said the union workers were turned away on the shifts that started at 6 A.M. and 2 P.M. today because the authority had already contracted with temporary replacements to fill the slots. He said the authority needed to know how many workers would report for duty well before the start of the shift, and the union did not provide enough notice that the workers would return.
"We need to put a work force in place that we can count on to operate the turnpike," Mr. Nutt said this morning. "You can't run a turnpike without knowing who is going to be there until five minutes before they show up."
In a decision that outraged union leaders, Mr. Nutt said the union employees had to notify their supervisors that they would be at work at least five hours before their first shift. That meant that employees reporting for work at 10:30 P.M. tonight had to call in by 5:30 P.M.
The authority said that employees who did not report as required could be subject to fines or termination. But James Robinson, a turnpike spokesman, said that as of 7:30 tonight all 105 employees scheduled for the shift had called in to say they would report to work.
Nevertheless, people trying for a slot as replacement workers again filled turnpike headquarters in East Brunswick throughout the day. Most were attracted by the possibility of an extra paycheck to help with their bills.
"I just got layed off two weeks ago," said Earl Wilson, a heavy equipment operator from Jamesburg, N.J. "I've got a wife and two kids. Unemployment is not enough. I'm just looking for a paycheck."
The turnpike, which was forced by the strike to allow motorists to travel the highway free between 6:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Monday and again between 10:30 P.M. Monday and 6 A.M. today, estimated it lost about $300,000 in tolls. The parkway, which receives 70 percent of its tolls with automated collection machines, said revenues were not affected by the job action.
Union officials said today that the labor disputes were caused by the Whitman administration's desire to get tough on unions. "It is the whole basis for what is going on," said Frank Forst, a union negotiator.
But officials at both the turnpike and the parkway said the labor disputes were over contract issues and not state labor policy.
"This is a local turnpike issue," Mr. Nutt, the turnpike director said. He said the turnpike, which consistently operates in the red, must reduce its overtime costs. He said the authority paid $10 million in overtime last year while paying about $45 million in total salaries.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, attending a bill-signing ceremony in Milltown today, said it was unfair for public employees to receive better benefits and wages than private-sector workers. The Governor said the priority throughout the dispute was to keep the highways open.

TAX BREAKS: POORER PETER, RICHER PAUL?
At a time when the New York City and State governments are cutting sharply into spending for schools and social services for the poor, they are providing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits to big businesses. The Pataki and Giuliani administrations say the tax breaks are part of a long-term strategy to shore up the local economy by keeping big employers from leaving New York. In other states, they say, such enticements abound. But a growing number of critics question whether a strategy of broadening tax breaks to business makes sense while cities and states are doing some of the most far-reaching budget cutting in decades.

HEADLINE: Engineer's Ice Plant Helps Power County

BYLINE: By DEAN NELSON 

DATELINE: ESCONDIDO, Calif.

 BODY:
In this northern region of San Diego County, residents are accustomed to heat, horses and avocado orchards. But now they are getting used to an incongruous addition -- a complex that creates electricity, steam and hockey rinks.
Therein lies the tale of a power entrepreneur who understands that business, like hockey, is about playing the angles. In this case the angles were his technical knowledge of cogeneration power production, the local utility's begrudging obligation to pay him a juicy premium for this power, and Escondido's willingness to grant him tax breaks if he helps revitalize a blighted area. 
 The result is Icefloe, a $66.4 million power plant with two Olympic-size hockey rinks, a fitness center, a swimming pool and a restaurant. Paul Gerst, 67, an electrical power engineer who has built cogeneration plants around the country for others, built his own after studying industries that would combine well with a cogeneration plant producing nearly 50 megawatts of power. Several plants provide for ice-making businesses or refrigerated storage. He chose a skating rink.
Cogeneration plants create electricity and then, with waste heat, provide additional energy for something nearby. In this case it provides energy for which other ice rinks in the area pay $13,000 a month.
Mr. Gerst said he decided to build an ice rink because "I didn't want to have to truck in a tomato or a turnip, slice it, package it, then truck it out again. The idea of an ice rink sounded good because the ice doesn't go anywhere."
But the real revenue for Mr. Gerst is in the 30-year contract his privately held Arroyo Energy Company has with the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The utility, under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act, is required to buy the electricity he produces. He obtained the contract in 1985 when utility prices were considerably higher than they are now.
San Diego Gas pays 5.38 cents a kilowatt hour to Mr. Gerst, according to the utility, and it recently submitted a rate of 3.12 cents to the Public Utilities Commission for similar contracts in 1996. Mr. Gerst's rate, 72 percent higher than next year's proposed rate, was based on projections a decade ago that utility prices would skyrocket. They did not.
The utility was so reluctant to honor the contract with Mr. Gerst that Mr. Gerst sued and the utility settled.
"Mr. Gerst is a canny investor who took full advantage of a regulatory mistake where rates were set too high," said Greg Barnes, assistant general counsel for San Diego Gas.
Mr. Gerst took advantage of Federal and other Government benefits by building the power plant and the rink in an enterprise zone. The city, with a population 120,000, has seen rapid growth in the last 20 years, creating unsightly areas for the city to remedy.
Escondido officials deferred the collection of property tax from Icefloe, spread a $1.2 million sewer connection charge over 30 years, and moved road and bridge work in the area to the top of the city's public works list to help accommodate Mr. Gerst.
More important, an enterprise-zone project allows the consolidation of the multiple design, planning and public hearings that, in California, can drag on for years.
Mr. Gerst feels that the combination of power plants and hockey rinks is good enough to repeat elsewhere in Southern California.
He financed the complex largely through California Alternative Energy Funding bonds, and said that on the first day of operation his income exceeded his operating expenses.
Predictably, the local utility hopes Mr. Gerst will be satisfied with the complex he has.
San Diego Gas buys 59 percent of its electricity from suppliers, and customers already pay rates 30 percent higher than the national average. The law requiring purchases from cogeneration providers at a locked-in rate for 30 years limits the utility's ability to get lower rates, and works against the idea of a free market, Mr. Barnes said.
"We're delighted to buy power from cogeneration providers, but not when the arrangement is just a subsidy to certain suppliers," he said.
And while the utility thinks Mr. Gerst is a smart entrepreneur, Mr. Barnes said Mr. Gerst was too smart to build any more Icefloes.
"If he looks at the economics of today, he won't do it," Mr. Barnes said.
At that, Mr. Gerst simply smiles. He has plans for five more.
"Anything is possible when you're clever," he said.

HEADLINE: An Educator Who Passionately Believes the Poor Can Succeed

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

 BODY:
In confronting the vast problems of Newark's schools, Beverly Hall is armed with 25 years of experience in urban education, strong leadership skills and -- most important -- a passionate belief in the ability of poor students to succeed, friends and colleagues say.
"Dr. Hall is a perfect example of an administrator who has demonstrated that in fact, all children can learn," Dr. Lester Young, Superintendent of District 13 in New York City, said yesterday. 
 Dr. Hall, New York's Deputy Chancellor for Instruction, will take up her new position as the Acting Superintendent of the Newark school system on July 17. Her first order of business will be to prepare for the opening of school, she said.
"We have to send a clear message in September that this is not business as usual," she said, "that indeed this process has made the beginning of school smoother, that there will be supplies, that there will be materials, there will be textbooks, the facilities will be in better order than they have been in the past."
Dr. Hall was born in Jamaica and came to the United States to pursue her education. She holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Brooklyn College and a doctorate in educational urban policy and administration from Fordham University.
She began her career as an English teacher in Brooklyn and in 1983, she became principal of Public School 282 in the borough. Under her leadership, math and reading scores at the school rose and the school was cited by the state Education Department in 1990 as 1 of 10 "schools that work" in New York City.
In 1992, she became Superintendent of Community School District 27 in Queens, the second largest district in the city system. While there, she involved teachers, parents and community members in a yearlong effort to restructure the middle schools by creating smaller, more personal environments.
Dr. Hall has called middle schools a weak link in the educational chain where too many children lose ground that they will be unable to make up in high school. She took those ideas with her when Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines appointed her the Deputy Chancellor for Instruction in 1994 and helped shape a citywide middle school restructuring that was credited with helping to improve reading and math scores this spring.
She also helped implement Mr. Cortines's plan to raise math and science standards for all students, regardless of race or economic background. "I believe that schools can work for urban students," she said. "I have demonstrated in my own career that if you hold high standards, you have high expectations, then schools can make the difference in a student's life."
Her departure from the New York system comes three weeks after Mr. Cortines announced his resignation and may be the start of an exodus of top educators who were brought into the central system by Mr. Cortines. When asked if she would have left the system had Mr. Cortines not resigned, Dr. Hall declined to answer directly.
"Certainly his leaving played a part in my deliberations to come to Newark," she said. "I went to be his deputy because I believed in his vision for the New York schools."
In a statement, Mr. Cortines praised Dr. Hall as a powerful advocate for quality education. "Dr. Hall has all the right tools for the job of improving Newark's schools: commitment to high standards, deep understanding of urban education and great ability as an administrator," he said.
Dr. Hall said that being an outsider in the Newark system will be a benefit, especially in rooting out the nepotism that has plagued the schools. She expects resistance.
"Whenever you go into a situation with such a mandate you will have some resistance because there are people with a vested interest in the status quo," she said.

HEADLINE: As Affirmative Action Ebbs, A Sense of Uncertainty Rises

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

 BODY:
Eddie Graham senses changes in the air, and he is angry and disillusioned.
"A lot of blacks have gotten to where they are because of affirmative action," said Mr. Graham, a 37-year-old black lawyer, as he stood on a street corner in Philadelphia last week. "For them to say now it's time to end it, that's really a disservice to our younger generation that's coming along." 
 Rich Romano also feels that things are changing, and it makes him hopeful.
"Affirmative action and even welfare, at the beginning, was a great idea, but it got out of hand," said Mr. Romano, 39, a white firefighter in Philadelphia's blue-collar Mayfair neighborhood. "Now it's gotten to be some kind of entitlement. Everybody thinks they're entitled to everything. No one wants to work hard anymore."
Nearly three decades after a series of long hot summers in Los Angeles, Newark, Detroit and other cities helped usher in a commitment to using race-based programs to improve the lives of blacks, talk of race once again fills the muggy air.
But this time the talk is how the 30-year edifice of race-based programs is crumbling -- and some say, along with it, the 30-year commitment to achieving racial equality.
In recent weeks the Supreme Court has issued decisions making it harder to justify giving minorities and women preferences in the awarding of Federal contracts, and harder to draw legislative districts with a majority of minority voters.
In May, the Court let stand a lower court decision halting a University of Maryland program that gave scholarships exclusively to black students. The Court also struck down a school desegregation plan for Kansas City that required Missouri to spend money to attract white students from the suburbs to predominantly black schools in the city.
Meanwhile, the Clinton Administration is re-evaluating Federal affirmative action programs while some lawmakers, including Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, are drafting legislation intended to end special considerations of race in Federal programs.
And a ballot initiative in California to halt the use of racial preferences in hiring, college admissions and contracting is widely expected to be approved next November.
In interviews with politicians, academics, legal experts and ordinary citizens over the long Fourth of July weekend, it became clear that there is a palpable sense of the nation's hurtling toward a future yet to be defined.
"It's the end of an era," said Constance Horner, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and a member of the United States Civil Rights Commission. "What tells us that this is the end of an era is that all branches of government -- the courts, the Congress, the White House, even the state legislatures -- are actively engaged in the same process, and that's a rare event in American politics."
 
Looking Ahead And Gazing Back
But even as they look ahead, supporters and opponents of race-based programs have their gazes fixed on different points in the past. Critics of racial preferences envision a future rooted in what they say is a return to the roots of the civil rights movement and to virtues espoused by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
"It is a positive shift in that it de-emphasizes race in the way we do our national business, and that is healthy for all ethnic groups," said Joe Gelman, campaign manager for the California Civil Rights Initiative, the ballot measure that would end affirmative action programs in California.
"It is consistent with the principles upon which the civil rights movement originally stood," he added, "and it is certainly consistent with the speech given by Dr. King on the Mall in 1963, when he talked about a society judging people on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin."
But supporters of affirmative action say such sentiments pervert Dr. King's message. They look even further into the past -- to 1877, when Federal troops were pulled out of the South, signaling the end of Reconstruction and the resurgence of white supremacy.
"We are at the end of a second Reconstruction," said Janette Wilson, a black lawyer and former executive director of Operation PUSH, a Chicago-based civil rights organizaiton. "The recent decisions say that the Supreme Court has joined together with the Newt Gingrich faction of Congress, and war is being declared on African-Americans and poor people economically, academically and now politically."
 
Impact on Politics And the Economy
Some people were able to move beyond the visceral reactions that often accompany any discussion of race. They wondered how the changes would affect political and business institutions.
Many expressed a belief that pressure would be put on blacks to revitalize a civil rights movement that they said had grown complacent, and to organize politically to hold on to gains that had been won in the Federal courts and by executive fiat but that now had to be protected in legislatures.
Wade Henderson, legislative director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that raising black voter participation was the way to counter the Court decisions, the new mood in Congress and what he called President Clinton's hesitancy about strongly backing affirmative action. In 1994, 37 percent of the blacks who were eligible to vote cast ballots, down from 39.2 percent in 1990.
"If we do not increase our voter participation rate beyond 37 percent, then we will have failed," Mr. Henderson said. "It will be hard for us to complain that we have been locked out of the political process if we fail to seize the initiative and energize our voters."
And while analogies to the end of Reconstruction and a return to Jim Crow policies abounded, some blacks noted a striking difference from that era: The policies of the last 30 years have helped create a level of black political and economic power that is unprecedented.
"If you look at the data compared to 30 to 40 years ago, there has been a stunning increase in the number of middle-class blacks and the number of blacks going to college or to business or trade schools," said Hugh B. Price, executive director of the National Urban League. "Our talent bank is exponentially fuller than it was 20 or 30 years ago."
The Supreme Court decision limiting a state's ability to draw majority black or Hispanic election districts will also put strains on the Democratic Party, some experts say.
Many white Democrats have felt that the drawing of majority black districts has packed the party's most loyal voters into a few districts, leaving adjacent white districts more vulnerable to Republicans. But while carving up these majority black districts and spreading their voters around may help white Democrats, it will be fiercely resisted by many black politicians.
"If blacks in the legislature perceive that they are being weakened through this process, they could link up with Republicans," said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta.
Some experts said the new times would increase pressure on conservatives to develop policies that would help blacks to advance.
Clint Bolick, vice president of litigation of the Institute for Justice, a conservative public interest group that has fought affirmative action programs, said, "The opponents of racial preferences are going to be challenged by people who say, 'O.K, you don't like preferences, what's your solution?' "
Others said that without affirmative action, conservatives might need a new rallying point.
"What is going to happen three or four years from now?" asked Raphael Sonenshein, a professor of political science at California State University at Fullerton. "What does it mean for conservative forces that have used these policies for 25 to 30 years to run against -- what will they be left with? It is like the end of the cold war for the conservatives."
And some noted that Government-required hiring and promotion programs based on race have made the Government an arbiter between corporations, which want to set their own hiring standards, and minorities, who want more jobs. Without such programs, corporations might become vulnerable to heightened black demands backed by protests or consumer boycotts.
"The question is not whether you have goals," said Lawrence Z. Lorber, a Washington lawyer who represents corporations in civil rights matters. "The question is, who sets the goals?"
 
A Fear of Extremism In a Growing Void
Some people express fears that as the nation sorts through its new direction on racial matters, voices of moderation and conciliation may be drowned out by those most ready to tap into black and white anger.
"The pessimist in me senses that we are heading to some kind of social conflagration," said Lani Guinier, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law whose nomination to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department was withdrawn by Mr. Clinton in June 1993 after she came under fire from conservatives.
"The leadership vacuum from both the Supreme Court and the political institutions is creating a void," Ms. Guinier said. "Nature abhors a vacuum, and into that vacuum may move the most extreme voices on each side."
For most blacks, and also some whites, the current shift has its roots in economic dislocations. With per-capita incomes stagnating and corporations trimming their work forces, racial preferences are difficult to sustain.
Perhaps because of, or in addition to, economic insecurities, the current mood also seems to reflect a diminution of the white guilt upon which the edifice of race-based programs was built.
"For a long time, white males were afraid to say anything at all about this," said Frederick R. Lynch, associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. "They didn't want to be called racists, wimps or whiners."
He added: "Affirmative action was a sacred cow. If you even raise a criticism or a question, suddenly the conversation would change to, 'How's the weather?' '
 
A Generational Gap Among Whites
There also seem to be generational differences among whites in how they view the push to end affirmative action. Those born during the baby boom after World War II, who remember crusading blacks fighting segregation, seem more sympathetic. Younger whites, to whom Jim Crow laws are something out of dusty history books, are less so.
As they sat in front of a Philadelphia skyscraper during their lunch hour, David Springer, 53, and Gerald Littrell, 31, two white elevator repairmen, both criticized affirmative action. But they differed on how quickly to end it.
"There are some people who could use that little leg up to get started," Mr. Springer said. "I don't honestly believe we're on an absolutely level playing field yet. If you go halfway between what you had before and what they're proposing, I'd feel fairly comfortable. You're not going to jam people down other people's throats. But you should use it wisely and not just as a blanket policy."
Mr. Littrell would have nothing to do with such gradualism.
"I think it was good in its day, but I think the field's a lot more even now," Mr. Littrell said. "There's a lot less racism, at least at our level. I don't know about higher up. So I don't think any race should get too many advantages. I think people of my generation and the younger generation feel that racism isn't that big a deal anymore."

HEADLINE: Comptroller Sues to Block Pataki Pension Fund Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 5

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall filed suit today to prevent Gov. George E. Pataki from using money in a special pension fund to balance the state budget, a move that could open a $110 million hole in the spending plan.
The fund in question was created in 1970 to augment the pensions of retired state and local workers whose benefits had been eroded by inflation. But the Legislature never touched the money until last month, when it authorized Mr. Pataki to use $110 million of the $360 million account to help close a projected budget shortfall of nearly $5 billion. 
 Mr. McCall, who manages both the special fund and the state pension system, challenged that move in State Supreme Court in Albany today as an "illegal, unconstitutional and unconscionable" raid on the pension fund.
"The pension fund exists for the main and only purpose of providing benefits to retirees," Mr. McCall, a Democrat, said in a news conference. "It is not a slush fund that the state should look to every time it's in trouble to balance the budget."
As the trustee of the pension system, Mr. McCall might have been able to block the pension plan administratively. But he filed suit because he wanted the force of a court ruling behind him. Mr. McCall said his suit is based on legal arguments similar to those he successfully employed two years ago to block a different plan by the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to use pension funds to balance the budget.
At a news conference in New York City, the Republican Governor said Mr. McCall's suit was politically motivated. Mr. McCall is considering running for Governor in 1998. Later in the day, Mr. Pataki's press secretary defended the legality of the plan, saying that while the $110 million would not be used to pay for new increases in pension benefits, it would compensate the state for the cost of past pension increases.
"The legislation is perfectly consistent with the purpose of the fund, which is to supplement pensions," said the spokesman, Robert J. Bellafiore.
But Mr. McCall said: "They are simply postponing to the future obligations they have to face up to this year. If we let them get away with this, if they get an inch this year, they'll want a mile next year."
The pension plan was part of the $63.5 billion budget enacted by the Legislature on June 7. In that spending plan, the Legislature authorized use of $110 million of the pension fund to help close the projected budget gap -- part of $900 million in "one-shots," or nonrecurring revenues, used to balance the spending plan.
The budget also authorized a new pension-payment increase for 402,000 retired teachers and other state and local government workers, starting on Sept. 1. Pension funds totaling $130 million would be used to cover that increase.
The remaining $130 million of the pension fund is to be given to local governments to reduce their pension costs.
Had the Legislature not dipped into the $360 million fund this year, Mr. McCall said, the fund could have financed the new pension increase for 10 years at no additional cost to the state or most local governments. But, he added, the Governor's plan would deplete the special pension fund by 1997, possibly forcing state and local governments to cut other spending to finance the enhanced pension benefits.
The special fund will not cover New York City's increased pension costs, which will be $100 million a year starting in 1997.
Mr. McCall did not offer any suggestions on how the state should close the $110 million hole his suit would create if it is successful. The Legislature and Mr. Pataki fought a bitter battle over other proposed budget cuts earlier this year, and finding an additional $110 million in reductions could prove difficult.
Even before filing his suit, Mr. McCall said he believes the state budget is precariously balanced and could unravel later this year, requiring new cuts.
Mr. Bellafiore countered that Mr. McCall was "trying to have it both ways here." The Governor's press secretary added: "He says he is supporting supplementing pensions, but he won't and can't tell you how he will finance it."
The budget also includes the caveat that if the pension plan is challenged in court, the pension increase will be postponed until the suit is resolved. Under the plan, if the state loses the suit, the pension increase will be delayed one year until Sept. 1, 1997.
Saying that the Legislature included that delay mechanism purely to discourage him from filing suit, Mr. McCall said his suit also asks the Supreme Court to prevent any delays in the scheduled pension increase.
It is not clear why the special pension fund was left untouched during its first 24 years of existence. Mr. McCall said the Legislature allocated $70 million to the fund in the early 1970's, then left it alone. Interest payments over the past two decades allowed the fund to grow to $360 million, and Mr. McCall said he thought it was possible that the lawmakers simply forgot that the fund was there -- until this year.
The Comptroller also said he met last week with Gerald Levin, the president of Time Warner Inc., to express his concerns about the company's role in producing rock and rap music with violent lyrics. The state pension system owns 2.6 million shares in Time Warner worth about $106 million.
Mr. McCall said he made no specific demands on Mr. Levin. But he declined to rule out the possibility of selling the state's holdings in Time Warner if the company did not take measures to deal with the concerns about lyrics.

HEADLINE: Iraq Admits It Produced Germ Arsenal

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 5

 BODY:
Iraq has admitted for the first time that it produced offensive biological weapons in 1989-90, on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf, the chairman of a United Nations inspection commission told the Security Council in a letter today.
The chairman, Rolf Ekeus, told the Council that the Iraqis admitted in a meeting Saturday in Baghdad that they had produced "large quantities" of two deadly biological agents, the bacteria that cause botulism and anthrax. Iraqis maintain that the toxic agents were later destroyed. 
 The admission, which followed four years of denials that Iraq had a secret biological weapons program, will set back by a significant amount of time any hope Iraq may have of an early lifting of sanctions prohibiting the sale of oil.
The sanctions, which first went into effect after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, were scheduled for a periodic review on July 11. As part of a cease-fire agreement in April 1991, after the war, Iraq agreed to destroy or account for all its weapons of mass destruction in return for a lifting of the oil embargo.
"It is important that Iraq has finally admitted what it was denying only a week ago: that it had an offensive biological weapons program," Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative said after the letter was circulated in the Security Council today. "This admission demonstrates again that the Council can get results when it is firm and consistent in demanding Iraqi compliance."
The Iraqis, who claimed to have destroyed the biological weapons they produced by October 1990, as the gulf war approached, will have a month to give the United Nations Special Commission, headed by Mr. Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, full details of the program from start to finish. Diplomats and officials remain skeptical of assertions that all the toxic agents were destroyed.
When the Iraqi report is received, a process of verification will begin. United Nations officials could not guess today how long that might take.
For several years, the inspection commission has played a cat-and-mouse-game with Iraq, forcing admissions on nuclear, missile, chemical and now biological weapons by amassing evidence independently and confronting the Iraqis with it. In April, the commission announced that 17 tons of an imported growth medium that could be used to produce biological agents were unaccounted for, and that the quantities imported were far too large for medicinal or pharmaceutical use.
Mr. Ekeus told the Council that Iraqi officials told him on Saturday in an oral briefing that research on germ warfare began in 1985 at Muthanna, where Iraq also produced chemical weapons.
Research was moved to Salman Pak in 1986 and, in mid-1988, it was decided to begin production of the two agents -- Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus anthracis -- at Al Hakam. United Nations officials say that Iraq rigorously rejected suspicions that biological weapons were being produced, and even took reporters to Al Hakam to demonstrate their innocence.
"This is an important step the Government of Iraq has taken," Charles Duelfler, deputy chairman of the commission, said today.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Out of South Africa, Progress

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 1

 BODY:
At the turn of the century, Cecil Rhodes, one of this country's early statesmen-tycoons, dreamed of building a railroad from Cape Town to Cairo. He never realized his vision.
Succeeding where Rhodes fell short, a South African entrepreneur, Hans Harwinkels, is linking the far corners of the continent with microwave signals instead of steel. In little more than two years, he has built a pay-for-view satellite-television empire whose programming is beamed from South Africa to Egypt and 40 countries in between. 
 "African countries have been liberalizing their markets, and this has allowed us to push north, east and west with pretty good speed," said Mr. Harwinkels, chief executive officer of the entertainment broadcaster Multichoice.
Multichoice has a lot of company. With apartheid dead, South Africa's pent-up entrepreneurial energy is exploding all over Africa. South African industry is rushing in to build railroads in Zaire, sink mines in Ghana, put up hotels in Kenya and provide the entire continent with enough jets and telephone lines to help revitalize its sagging economy. South African trade with the rest of Africa is booming, with exports up 50 percent in two years to nearly $2.5 billion in 1994 and imports tripling to $664 million from $220 million. South Africa's expanding presence is displacing much of the economic and cultural influence long wielded by France and the United States.
Economists say the trend is accelerating, with important implications for the future of a continent that many in the West have written off as hopelessly poor and corrupt.
"Our politicians may not have fully grasped this, but for our business people it is fully realized that the rest of Africa is our hinterland," said Erich Leistner, an economist at the Africa Institute in Pretoria, a private research group. "Already, 25 percent of our manufactured goods go to our neighbors. We are going to become more and more involved, from railways to airlines, from mining and water supply to power, and the politics will just have to follow."
To some, it is ironic that post-apartheid South Africa's impact on the rest of the continent is more economic than political. When President Nelson Mandela took power last year, some supporters abroad expected him to become a bold force for political change, denouncing human-rights abuses and promoting democratic movements elsewhere in Africa. Instead, he has kept a low profile, making it clear South Africa does not want to play big brother to its neighbors.
The emissaries of South African capitalism, by contrast, seem to be everywhere. Representatives of South Africa's huge mining industry are crowding the hotels of West African capitals in a race to tap rich new mineral markets.
The mining companies are prospecting for deposits and contracts in Zaire, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and several other countries in West Africa. Just last month, for example, the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company announced it was teaming up with a Ghanaian mining company to take over a formerly Soviet-run gold, silver and platinum mine at Kalana, in southern Mali. Companies in other industries are also extending their reach:
*South African hotel companies are investing in tourism ventures in Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. Protea Hotels has taken over ownership or management of 82 hotels in 11 countries as far afield as Tanzania and Egypt. "We began discussions in some of these countries as long as six years ago, when there was still a lot of distrust of us," said Otto Stehlik, executive chairman of the company. "Now we have a good laugh about the way we talked to each other."
*South African Airways has begun hiring out management, maintenance and supply services to airlines in Tanzania and Uganda and has opened discussions with others in Malawi, Namibia and Zambia. And South African airplane brokers are selling used aircraft all over the continent to African carriers too poor to buy new jets.
*South African telephone companies are bidding to overhaul national networks with new fiber optic lines or cellular systems. NZ Telecoms Ltd. has been modernizing phone services in Botswana, for example, and Telkom is prospecting for contracts in several countries.
*The electricity company Eskom is rehabilitating the power grids of Mozambique, Angola and Lesotho, and has plans to integrate them with South Africa's electrical network.
*South Africa Railways is working to upgrade the ports of Beira and Maputo in Mozambique to relieve congestion in South Africa's major seaport at Durban.
*South African Breweries last year bought half of Tanzania's formerly state-owned breweries and is building a bottling plant in that country.
One measure of all the commercial activity is the runaway success of Air Afrique's new route linking Johannesburg and Abidjan, capital of the West African nation of the Ivory Coast. After less than a year in service, the flights have higher occupancy rates than the Abidjan-Paris or Abidjan-New York connections.
Most African countries seem to be heartily welcoming South Africa's commercial invasion, coming as it does in the face of flagging interest in the West. Several governments have even begun to advertise their World Bank-mandated privatizations of state companies in South African newspapers, hoping to find bidders in the continent's most powerful economy.
South African businesses take a homey approach in negotiating with African governments: though large by African standards, they argue, they are less threatening than the American and European multinationals. And their headquarters are nearby in case of trouble.
"We want local partners and build joint ventures, and the word has been spreading in Africa that we are good people to do business with," said Mr. Harwinkels of Multichoice. For France, the former colonial power that has maintained the strongest ties to the continent, all this reeks of a plot by the English-speaking business world to supplant it in Africa. The French newsletter Lettre d'Afrique recently warned of "increasingly aggressive financial, industrial and commercial competition, in particular by Anglo-Saxons and Japanese, in league with South African firms."
Indeed, nowhere has South Africa's penetration of new markets in Africa been as spectacular as in French-speaking Zaire, formerly ruled by Belgium. As Western companies have withdrawn from Zaire in exasperation over its corruption and chaos, South African concerns have moved in, seeing its mineral wealth and huge needs for new roads and railways as economic stepping stones to the rest of the continent.
Pointing to a map of central Africa in his office, the eyes of Jan van Deventer, South Africa's Ambassador to Zaire, light up as he speaks, Rhodes-like, of South African companies restoring the Lubumbashi-to-Kananga line in Zaire, a project under way, and of building lines linking that line with the towns of Kalemie and Kindu, a project under consideration.
Taken together, these undertakings would link South Africa by modern rail with every country of the continent as far north as Tanzania, replacing costly truck routes and slow-moving lake barges.
Big South African mining companies are also moving into Zaire. Since De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. got involved in a diamond-mining project known as Birim River in Ghana 14 months ago, production has soared 55 percent. Other mining companies are hoping to resuscitate Zaire's dying copper industry, once the world's largest. The Anglo American Corporation of South Africa said it was considering taking a major stake in the Tinke Fugurume copper mine in southern Zaire. And an international consortium that includes Anglo American, the Engelhard Corporation of the United States, Fimalac of France and Swipco of Switzerland is reportedly negotiating to take control of Zaire's state-owned Gecamines, once the world's largest copper and cobalt mine.
South African companies are also eyeing Zaire's huge hydroelectric potential.
Mr. van Deventer, the South African Ambassador, sees almost limitless opportunity in Zaire and the rest of sub-Sahara Africa. "You are talking about being able to get South African consumer goods to African markets, where there is a strong demand for them, and evacuating African minerals to South African markets, where we have considerable expertise," he said.
"If you've been to Kasai you could cry to see that they don't grow much of anything in some of the best farmlands in the continent," he said. "If Zaire could get its logging industry going, we could take quite a bit of that production. But first you have to be able to get there."
But for South Africa to take full advantage of opportunities like these, experts in regional affairs say, it will have to begin engaging the rest of Africa politically far more than it has done so far.
Under Mr. Mandela, South Africa has shied away from peace-keeping tasks in places like Angola and Rwanda, hoping to avoid being cast in the role of savior. Critics of this approach say that as much as they can understand a desire to avoid becoming the bearer of all of Africa's burdens, Mr. Mandela should use his immense prestige to foster stability and democratic change in Africa.
Of Africa's leaders, only Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, has been received here on a state visit. And earlier this year, officials in many African countries were surprised when South Africa declined to join the African Development Bank, a regional lending institution.
Although President Mandela made a brief stopover in Nigeria last year to plea for the release of the jailed winner of elections there, Moshood K. Abiola, his Government has been mostly quiet about the political crisis there and in Zaire.
"High-profile people like Mandela should be spending as much time in African capitals as in Europe and America," said Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of Witswatersrand. "At the end of the day, we are not going to get much from Washington, or Paris or London. This is where the future lies."

HEADLINE: Budget Battles Undercut U.S. Information Effort

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
When President Eisenhower created the United States Information Agency in 1953, it was the darling of conservatives, a powerful megaphone to undermine Communism around the world.
But with Communism on the run and the cold war over, conservative Republicans are now fighting a different war: the budget war, and the information agency could become one of its victims. 
 The House voted last month to eliminate the 9,000-employee agency and have the State Department absorb its operations. The Senate is expected to do the same next week.
"The agency was founded to counter the most pervasive propaganda organization the world has ever known -- the Communists," said Brent Scowcroft, who was President Bush's national security adviser. "But we no longer have that problem, so things like the Voice of America are no longer necessary. There are higher priorities for spending our money." The U.S.I.A. oversees the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.
Seeing the U.S.I.A.'s $1.3-billion budget as a fat target, several Congressional subcommittees are also seeking to cut off financing of its main activities: broadcasting and educational exchanges. The agency sponsors the Fulbright scholarship program and oversees foreign exchanges of thousands of other students and academics.
The agency runs libraries in 130 countries, provides information to foreign journalists and sends 1,000 experts overseas each year on cultural missions. In recent months, the agency sent Betty Friedan to China to discuss feminism and the poet Philip Levine to Spain to give readings and lectures.
While many conservatives have kind words for agency activities, they nonetheless see them as luxuries today. They point to activities like a conference on "civic education" that brought together 400 Eastern European officials and intellectuals in Prague to discuss how to consolidate democracy. The agency is also sponsoring a $129,000 program in which a dozen Palestinians and Israelis will meet at an Ohio college for six weeks to study how to teach English and how to get along with each other.
"A lot of these are very good programs, but we're $5 trillion in the hole, so we have to start doing things in a different way," said Representative Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican who is a prime sponsor of the Congressional effort to abolish the agency.
Mr. Brownback insists that the private sector should take over the educational exchanges, Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America. But he is so eager to undermine Communism in Cuba and China that he says Washington should continue broadcasting to those countries.
Joseph Duffey, director of the United States Information Agency, asserts that conservatives are taking a myopic view of the role the agency can now play. Its broadcasts may no longer be needed to spread democratic ideas to the former Soviet Union, he says, but they are still vital for such countries as Iran, Iraq, Cuba, China and the former Yugoslavia.
In Mr. Duffey's view, the agency has another role: to show foreigners this country beyond "Pulp Fiction," gangsta rap music, the O. J. Simpson trial and news clips of European tourists murdered in Miami.
"Every advanced democracy in the world has an institution that seeks to convey information about its policies, its values and its national life," Mr. Duffey said.
"I think we are very poorly served by the international mass media when it comes to explaining our national way of life," he said. "And commercial films don't convey much of what I want the world to understand about America."
Opponents suggest that the U.S.I.A. broadcasts are superfluous when CNN is being beamed around the world, and the Internet is reaching into the former Soviet bloc and the Arab world.
But agency officials vehemently disagree. "For people who live in hotels around the world and speak English, CNN is great," said Geoffrey Cowan, director of Voice of America. "But most people don't live in hotels and don't speak English. That's where we come in. We broadcast in 47 languages."
U.S.I.A. officials contend that it will be a disaster if the State Department absorbs their responsibilities because its behind-the-scenes style will clash with and ultimately cripple the agency's role of having Americans communicate in a public, uninhibited way with foreigners to explain what is happening in America.
Mr. Duffey's hope is that his agency will be rescued by a Presidential veto and subsequent negotiations between the White House and Congress. His aides predict that Congressional opposition might be weakened by some conservative Republicans who are having second thoughts.
Indeed, the agency recently received much-needed support from Jack Kemp, the former Housing Secretary, and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former delegate to the United Nations. They sent a letter to Republican leaders saying it was "disheartening and astonishing" that many lawmakers were seeking to abolish the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.
"This stream of information and analysis is crucial to listeners seeking to build democratic societies and free market economies on their own," they wrote.

HEADLINE: Delay in Assistance to Mexico Is Sought by Dole and D'Amato

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Two Republican senators called on Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin today to delay further financial assistance to Mexico.
"We are not aware of any emergencies or contingencies that would justify the release of additional U.S. funds," said a letter from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "The Administration should articulate a clear and compelling justification." 
 The letter was released after markets in Mexico had closed. Earlier, the leading Mexican stock index surged 121.84 points, or 5.58 percent, to 2,306.30, its highest level since reaching 2,354.24 on Jan. 2.
Analysts in Mexico City said investors were heartened by lower interest rates and by President Ernesto Zedillo's remarks that the economy was beginning to recover from the shock it suffered after the peso was devalued on Dec. 20.
Since the financial crisis began, the United States and others have agreed to provide Mexico with loans and guarantees totaling $52.8 billion.
The United States has already contributed the first half of its $20 billion loan and loan guarantee commitment. Last week, Mr. Rubin said the United States would release another $2.5 billion this week.
Mr. Rubin also said the International Monetary Fund will provide an additional $2 billion to Mexico as part of a standby credit agreement.
In their letter, the senators said, "Before the Administration contemplates the release of any additional U.S. funds, we urge you to exhaust other available sources," like the I.M.F.
In exchange for the international assistance, Mexico has agreed to allow the United States a measure of control over the nation's estimated $7 billion in annual income from oil exports, and has embarked on a plan to sell state-owned industries.

HEADLINE: Packard Bell Selling NEC A Big Stake

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 5

 BODY:
Linking the leading personal computer vendors in the United States and Japan, the NEC Corporation said today that it had agreed to buy nearly 20 percent of Packard Bell Electronics Inc. for $170 million.
The relationship gives a crucial financial infusion to Packard Bell, which is privately held. The Sacramento, Calif., company has surged to the lead of the American personal computer market largely by selling machines through mass merchants like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, but has grown at a pace that would be hard to sustain without outside investors. 
 NEC, meanwhile, is seeking to fortify its position in the Japanese market, where its dominance has been threatened recently by I.B.M. and the Compaq Computer Corporation. It also intends to expand its presence in non-Japanese markets, where its performance in personal computers has not been very strong.
NEC and Packard Bell said they would form a wide-ranging alliance that would include supplying components to each other, as well as joint purchases of computerparts, joint product development and manufacturing and the use of each other's marketing channels.
The agreement, to be completed by the end of August, is one of the first major Japanese investments in an American high-technology company since the Japanese economy soured three years ago. Many Japanese companies got burned in the 1980's by expensive investments in American technology companies that failed to live up to expectations.
The purchase will provide needed cash for Packard Bell, which surpassed the three longstanding leaders of the American computer market -- Compaq, Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. -- by selling the most personal computers in the United States since the last quarter of 1994, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm.
The company, which specializes in selling to consumers rather than corporations, will also be able to more readily obtain NEC components like memory chips, CD-ROM drives, liquid-crystal display screens and circuits for displaying three-dimensional images on the screen. Some of these components, particularly memory chips, are now in short supply because of strong growth of PC sales throughout the industry.
"Packard Bell wants to ally ourselves with a strong corporate partner with complementary strengths that will help us bring a new level of technology to the market, allow Packard Bell to maintain its leadership position and help Packard Bell expand into other markets," Brent Cohen, the company's chief operating officer, said at a news conference here.
For Packard Bell, the alliance promises some of the same benefits that a smaller rival, AST Research Inc., hoped to receive by selling a stake in itself to Samsung, the huge Korean manufacturer.
In 1994, Packard Bell and NEC were, respectively, the fourth- and fifth-largest suppliers of personal computers in the world. The two companies will pool their purchasing of some components, forming a huge buying group with estimated combined shipments of 7.3 million PC's this year. Microprocessors, like those made by the Intel Corporation or Intel clone makers, are among the prime components that Packard Bell and NEC cannot supply themselves.
Joint purchases with Packard Bell would help NEC, which has seen its competitiveness hurt by the strong yen, to cut its costs and better compete with the American companies that have invaded the Japanese PC market.
Steven Myers, an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo, said that if NEC could save $50 a computer through the joint parts procurement, it would save $165 million on this year's estimated shipments of 3.3 million machines. That alone would recoup NEC's investment in Packard Bell.
Many aspects about exactly how the companies will cooperate have not been decided or were not disclosed. Moreover, NEC will not be able to realize the full benefit of joint procurement with Packard Bell because the computers NEC sells in Japan use proprietary technology that does not conform to the world personal-computer standard.
Packard Bell was founded in 1986 by three entrepreneurs from Israel who acquired the rights to the name of a defunct American consumer electronics company from Teledyne Inc. The company said that its revenue in the 1994 fiscal year was $2.8 billion and that it was profitable. As a private company, Packard Bell does not disclose specific figures for its profit or losses.
"The implication of this is that Packard Bell is not making money hand over fist," Mr. Myers, the analyst, said.
NEC said it would buy newly issued shares of Packard Bell amounting to a 19.99 percent stake, just below the 20 percent threshold at which it would have to consider the American company a subsidiary. While NEC said this was done to preserve Packard Bell's independence, it could also mean that NEC does not want to have to incorporate Packard Bell's financial results in its consolidated financial reports.
Groupe Bull, the French computer company, acquired 19.9 percent of Packard Bell in 1993, reportedly for about $75 million. NEC owns a 17 percent stake in Groupe Bull. Bull, which owns Zenith Data Systems in the United States, said today that it would invest $30 million more in Packard Bell to keep its stake at 19.9 percent.
NEC has long controlled more than half of Japan's personal computer market with its 9800 series of machines, which does not conform to the I.B.M.-compatible standard prevalent in the rest of the world.
But now, all other Japanese companies that once had their own unique designs have come to support the I.B.M. standard, forming a united front that is winning customers from NEC. Moreover, American companies such as Apple, I.B.M., Compaq and the Dell Computer Corporation, helped by the weakness of the dollar against the yen, have made strong gains. Last year, the American companies controlled about one-third of the Japanese market, according to International Data.
The result is that the NEC's share of the market in its home country dropped to 43.2 percent, the research firm said. But the overall Japanese market is growing rapidly -- it is expected to reach 5 million units this year, up from 3.4 million in 1994 -- so NEC's sales continue to grow.
The alliance with Packard Bell heightened speculation that NEC might plan to abandon its unique system and move to I.B.M. compatibility. Were NEC to do that, it would be able to import low-cost machines from Packard Bell to sell in Japan. But NEC officials denied that.
Packard Bell, which has concentrated mainly on the American market, also sells computers in Latin America and Europe. It has had only a limited presence in Japan but had been planning to expand here.
But Mr. Cohen, the chief operating officer, said Packard Bell would "honor and respect NEC's business activities in Japan." This and other comments seemed to suggest that in return for the cash infusion Packard Bell would forgo trying to become another low-priced American competitor to NEC in Japan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Value Is Little Changed In Advance of Fed Rate Decision

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday in cautious trading as Federal Reserve policy makers met to consider interest-rate changes.
"It's steady because people are mixed in their views about what the Fed will do," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar slipped to 1.3794 German marks yesterday from 1.3799 marks on Monday. It edged up to 84.85 Japanese yen from 84.74 yen. Financial markets in the United States were closed on Tuesday because of the Fourth of July holiday.
A number of economists expect the Fed to lower short-term interest rates after the meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ends today. Lower interest rates typically hurt the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
But other analysts say that recent economic reports have shown enough strength to keep the Federal Reserve from lowering rates now.
"Views about the Fed are mixed all the way across the board," said Graham Broyd, currency-sales manager at National Westminster Bank in New York. "I think the most likely scenario is that the Fed won't cut rates at the meeting, but will give Greenspan authority to cut rates" before the next rate-setting meeting on Aug. 22, he said, referring to Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman.
While Mr. Broyd said a rate cut would hurt the dollar, Mr. Spence of Standard Chartered disagreed. Seven interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the 12 months ending in February did little to bolster the dollar, Mr. Spence noted. He said there was no reason why a rate cut should now depress the dollar.
In other currency trading yesterday, the British pound stumbled after Prime Minister John Major's redesignation on Tuesday as leader of the Conservative Party failed to quell concern about intraparty turmoil. Political instability often depresses a nation's currency.
Although he beat back a challenge from the right wing of his party, Mr. Major still faces problems, analysts said. "It is clear there is a divisive split within the party over policy," Mr. Broyd of NatWest said.
The pound, which rose sharply on Tuesday in European trading in anticipation of the Tory Party vote, declined yesterday against the mark and the dollar. It fell to 2.2025 marks, from 2.2105 marks in London on Tuesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5960, down from $1.5980 on Monday.

Dollar General has been giving investors a bang for their buck.

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
IF it ain't broke, don't fix it is just how the management of the Dollar General Corporation is proceeding as it continues to open more small, low-price stores, focusing on small-town America.
Wall Street apparently likes what it sees, with many security analysts rating the company, which transferred to the New York Stock Exchange in February, as a buy. The stock has been moving upward recently, notching a number of new highs. 
 "The format is simple and consistent," said Steven J. Schuster, an analyst for the First Manhattan Company. "The stores are only about 6,000 square feet, they carry only about 2,500 items and about half of them cost a buck."
Otto F. Grote, an analyst for Derby Securities, added: "Dollar General has come to understand better than any other retailer how to sell to customers who are really strapped for cash. Not only do they know how to price their product, but they also know how to cost it out."
Dollar General, based in Nashville, had sales last year of nearly $1.5 billion and operates a chain of almost 2,200 neighborhood stores in 24 states, with most of them in strip shopping centers in the Southeast and Midwest. Its merchandise is generally sold at discounted prices to what Tom Tashjian, an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, characterized as largely minimum-wage laborers, the elderly and people receiving some sort of government-sponsored income subsidy.
"Their target market is being ignored by most other retailers," he said. "They are very focused on a finite number of consumers they want to serve."
The company announced record profits of $1.07 a share in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, a 49 percent increase from the previous 12 months. Earnings also ran at a fast pace in the first quarter of the current fiscal year -- historically the least profitable after the strong Christmas sales period -- by rising 22 percent, to 17 cents a share.
Analysts are forecasting double-digit same-store gains for the next two to three years. As a result, their average earnings estimate is $1.32 a share in the year ending Jan. 31, 1996, and $1.66 a share in the year ending Jan. 31, 1997, according to the First Call Corporation, which tabulates this information. "They've had impressive numbers, particularly in light of what is going on in the economy," Mr. Tashjian said. "The founding family still manages this company and is focused upon well-prepared growth."
Dollar General intends to open about 300 new stores in the 1996 fiscal year. Most of the products in its stores sell for $10 or less, with even-dollar pricing the norm.
"The company has a very strong connection with its customers, who don't have a lot of shopping alternatives," Mr. Schuster said. "The average Dollar General customer tends to have less disposable income than the average Wal-Mart or Kmart customer. So they sell a lot of basic commodity consumables like soap and shampoo."
At yesterday's closing price of $30.75, near its high of $33, Dollar General is selling at a price-earnings ratio of 23.3, based on estimated earnings in this fiscal year. That multiple is at a 38 percent premium to the 16.9 current price-earnings ratio of the general market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's average of 500 stocks.
"My target price is 50 to 60," Mr. Grote said. "I think they will continue to do well in this environment."

The Real College Champions

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
IF graduating is the premise justifying so-called student-athletes at America's colleges, too many athletes are not students at our institutions of what is apparently higher perspiration, not higher learning.
By itself, that is hardly news. Virtually a century ago educators discovered that, no matter how unstudious the student, a tradition of winning teams in leather helmets translated to a tradition of ticket-buyers and alumni contributions. 
 Winning teams in sneakers created a similar devotion of dollars. Television fees would further rationalize the thirst for triumph that often quenched the thirst for learning.
For all the scandals in college sports, information on individual students is considered too up close and personal to be tracked.
But the colleges can't hide now that the National Collegiate Athletic Association has issued graduation rates at its 302 Division I schools for all the freshman students and student-athletes (men and women) who entered college in the 1988-89 school year.
Some colleges' rates are distinguished. Some are disgraceful. Most are disheartening.
Extenuating factors were ignored in the survey. No breakdown of courses was presented, either pre-med or pre-unemployed. No breakdown of sports was documented, either football or field hockey.
No asterisk is allowed for transfer students with good grades. It's strictly how many entered college for the 1988-89 school year and how many graduated.
But the numbers indicate which colleges are participating in true college sports and which are operating campus pro sports; the numbers reflect which schools are winning with students who graduate.
Based on its graduation numbers, Penn State (77 percent student-athletes, 79 percent all students) deserved to be the top-ranked football team last season, not Nebraska (59 percent student-athletes, 48 percent all students).
Of basketball's Final Four teams, North Carolina had the best rates (76 percent student-athletes, 85 percent all students).
The champion, U.C.L.A., had 56 and 77, Arkansas had 39 and 41; Oklahoma State 38 and 40.
Three colleges graduated 100 percent of their student-athletes in that freshman class: Fairfield, Siena and Oral Roberts. But each had a small number of student-athletes. Of the larger schools, Providence's 98 percent graduation rate of student-athletes was first, followed by Colgate 93, Bucknell 92, Lehigh 91, Duke 90 and Holy Cross 90.
At the bottom of the student-athlete rates were Chicago State and Prairie View, each with a dismal 18 percent, followed by Texas Pan-American at 22, University of Nevada-Las Vegas 23, Texas Southern 23 and Tennessee State 23.
Ivy League schools drew a 0 in the student-athlete graduation rates because they don't grant athletic scholarships per se. But five Ivy League schools dominated the graduation rates among all students.
Harvard was first with 97 percent, followed by Yale with 96, Princeton 95, Bucknell 95, Virginia 94, Duke 94, Brown 94, Dartmouth 94, Fairfield 94, Stanford 93, Notre Dame 93, Holy Cross 93, Cornell 92, Providence 92, Georgetown 92, Boston College 91 and William & Mary 90.
Some schools' rates favored student-athletes rather than all students.
Oral Roberts had only 48 percent of all its students graduated, but 100 percent of its nine student-athletes did; Long Island University's rates were only 24 for all students but 70 for student-athletes.
Other schools had much higher rates for all students. Davidson had an 88 percent rate for all students, only 50 for its student-athletes. Jacksonville had 52 for all students, 25 for student-athletes; U.C.L.A. had 77 for all its students, only 51 for its student-athletes.
Adding the two percentages, the best colleges were Fairfield 194, Providence 190, Bucknell 187, Duke 184, Holy Cross 183, Stanford 182, Colgate 182, Georgetown 181, Siena 179 and Boston College 178. The worst were Texas Southern 34, Texas Pan-American 39, Chicago State 40, Prairie View 47 and Delaware State 48.
More than any game scores, these graduation numbers tell much of the story of college sports in America now. For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in classroom or in stadium.

. . . As We Know It

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Begin by recognizing that welfare is a federally sponsored euphemism; when we talk about helping the helpless, we're talking about charity.
Charity is not a dirty word, though it is treated as such by many of those on the receiving end; they prefer "welfare," because it implies an entitlement with no need for gratitude. On the contrary, the word "charity" -- the tangible expression of generosity toward our fellow humans -- rates right up there with love and kindness. 
 How do we maintain or increase the amount of charity given to the helpless while cutting out the charity that undermines the self-reliance of the able-bodied? Everyone agrees that the dependent are entitled to support, just as the lazy are not; the winnowing of the deserving poor from the undeserving underclass is called "welfare reform."
The Original Clinton came to town talking about ending "welfare as we know it," which appealed to conservatives; the New Clinton, a liberal aberration who lasted 24 months, never got around to it; but the New New Clinton (a keelhauled version of the Original Clinton) now addresses the issue with verve and discipline.
In contrast, Republicans are approaching the ending of W.A.W.K.I. in disarray. Not about freezing the level of Federal funding and delegating its administration to the states, ending the era of ever-rising costs and individual entitlement; that bridge has been crossed.
The scrap within the Republican Party is about how the total is to be split among the states. In the G.O.P. Senate bill, each state would get as much as it previously received from Washington. But that would reward New York and California and others historically openhanded; Southern and Western senators insist the distribution be based on local need, and argue that states are no longer required to spend their own funds to get Federal charity dollars.
"If we get into a big formula fight," says Dole on doles, "it's going to be very difficult to pass any welfare bill." Assuming regional compromise (setting the pattern for larger Medicaid block grants), Republican leaders will then have to roll over right-wingers who want to add conservative mandates -- like denying additional payments to unwed teen-agers accused of breeding for profit. That emotional grabber is undercut by Catholic bishops who fear the Draconian lesson would lead not to abstinence or marriage but to more abortions.
Republican wrangling gave the Great Facilitator his opening. As forecast in this space with inexplicable prescience, Clinton has come out for state experiments leading to the privatization of welfare distribution.
For decades, the idea has been to get able-bodied welfare recipients into jobs; as Nixon put it, "off welfare into workfare." (I thought I coined workfare in 1969, but the civil rights leader Charles Evers had beaten us to it.) Job training programs haven't produced. The much-touted cutoff of benefits after two or five years may provide a needed incentive, but the wailing when it happens will be horrific.
Aptly choosing Independence Day for a speech about unwanted dependency, the President gave a waiver to Virginia to try its own workfare plan: "Like the states of Oregon, Missouri and a few others, it also allows money now spent on welfare and food stamps to go to employers to supplement wages to help create jobs in the private sector."
In this way, states use Federal welfare grants to make it profitable for private businesses to employ welfare recipients. No make-work; the temporary subsidy pushes the employer to hire and pulls the welfaree into an entry-level job.
But we can't expect a mother to report to work with a kid on each hip; "it is pure fantasy," Clinton says, "to believe we can put a welfare mother to work unless we provide child care."
Such job-tied baby sitting makes economic sense to conservatives, drips with compassion to liberals and is nicely laced with local initiative and state control to federalists.
Perhaps it's too soon to put faith in the man from Hope's latest approach to charity. Federal domination by waiver is troubling. But if America's natural generosity must now be accompanied by a satisfying snarl, the tough-minded tender-heartedness of the privatization of welfare is worth a close look.

Prices Climb As Traders Await Fed's Rate Decision

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With trading subdued as investors and dealers awaited the outcome of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Treasury securities moved higher yesterday.
Plenty of market analysts do not expect the committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, to cut short-term interest rates during the meeting, which began yesterday. But if the committee acts, it is likely to do so today. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32, to a price of 113 10/32 , for a yield of 6.60 percent, down from 6.63 percent at the close of an abbreviated pre-holiday session on Monday.
Among the economic reports yesterday, the Mitsubishi/Wertheim Schroder weekly chain-store sales index was unchanged from last week, and the Johnson Redbook survey of large retailers was up 1.4 percent last month from May, continuing the recent saw-toothed pattern in retail activity measures.
"The Mitsubishi report projects June chain store sales will be up around 3 percent to 3.50 percent year-over-year," said James Hale, fixed-income analyst for MMS International in San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm. "This is yet another piece of data that fails to clear up the Fed policy debate among market participants. The Johnson Redbook, like the Mitsubishi report, lacks decisive influence on the policy debate."
The uncertainty over the F.O.M.C. stance was enough to keep trading nearly paralyzed. "There is definitely not much on the buy side of the market, as fund managers hold back," Mr. Hale said. "Some traders are looking to play the yield curve in the wake of any policy decision, especially selling anything with a maturity of under five years versus bonds if the Fed does not ease."
But he said there was "some merit to buying the long maturity" once that initial selloff and the employment report due on Friday were past "because loud cries about recession are bound to resurface."
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Kemper Securities in Chicago, described the market mood as one of breathless anticipation. "Everyone is waiting for the Fed, but I don't think the waiting period will be over until after the employment report," he said. "We think the Fed is best served by waiting for the data."
Mr. Davis said reason was against easing and running the risk that the employment numbers would show surprising strength. As a result, he said, the committee may wait for the numbers and take its cue from them, he said. Any number less than 100,000 in the growth of nonfarm payrolls would put the Fed in an easing mode, he said.
"Right now dealers are taking neutral positions," he said.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices were higher as some investors found yields more attractive than those of other fixed-income investments like Treasury securities. General obligation bonds due to mature in 20 years, and rated double-A, are yielding about 5.87 percent, or 91.5 percent of comparable Treasury securities. Analysts note that investors usually consider the tax-exempt bonds inexpensive when their yield is more than 85 percent of those of government securities.
In the corporate debt market, many companies are delaying bond sales until after the F.O.M.C. meeting. But the Standard & Poor's Rating Group recently reported that corporate bond sales increased 61 percent in the second quarter, as a steep drop in interest rates cheapened the cost of borrowing. It said companies issued $68.9 billion in bonds in the quarter, up from $42.8 billion in the first quarter.
Many corporations have used the proceeds of these debt offerings to refinance short-term debt at cheaper rates.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 7, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the credit markets misstated the average yields this week for participation certificates of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac. The yield for the 15-year certificate was 7 percent, not 7.03 percent; the yield for the 30-year certificate was 7.39 percent, not 7.53 percent. A corrected chart appears today on page D15.

Stocks and Bonds Surge on Fed Rate Cut
The Federal Reserve's quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate lifted the stock and bond markets, as traders became more optimistic about the economy and predicted that the Fed would now cut rates yet again. Treasury prices surged, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.49 percent, from 6.60 percent. The Dow industrials rose to another record, climbing 48.77 points, to 4,664.00, and the S.&.P 500 index added 6.73 points, to a record 553.99. [Page D6.]
 
The rate cut did little to the dollar. In late New York trading, it edged up to 84.96 yen and was little changed at 1.3787 marks. [D5.]

HEADLINE: $15.8 Million Settlement in Fatal '90 Club Fire

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
More than five years after the arson fire at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx killed 87 people, lawyers for families of the victims agreed yesterday to a $15.8 million settlement of all claims stemming from one of the deadliest fires in New York City's history.
The agreement ends more than $5 billion in lawsuits by providing an average $163,000 each for the families of the 92 dead or injured victims, before lawyers' fees and other costs are subtracted. 
 Lawyers in the case said that while the settlement seemed small compared with other high-profile wrongful death awards, the Happy Land case was complicated by questions of insurance liability, the bankruptcy of the building's wealthy owner, Alexander DiLorenzo 3d, and by the death of the club's operator in the fire. The jilted lover who set the 1990 fire in the illegal social club in the Bronx is now in prison, penniless and serving a life sentence.
Michael M. Lippman, counsel to the Bronx Public Administrator, which represents 50 families of the victims, many living in Honduras, said the families did not have a strong case for winning money from insurance carriers for the building's owner and makers of building products that gave off noxious fumes while burning. Further, he said the settlement resulted from wariness on the part of plaintiffs' lawyers about ultimately losing the case, and the defendants' eagerness to avoid costs and uncertainty of litigation.
But the victims' families, who under a 1991 court order had no say in approving the settlement, said they were disappointed. "It's not enough money for what I've lost," said Leticia Gamoneda, who lost two sons in the fire.
The pool of money will be divided among the families and surviving victims based on a formula for economic loss. Though lawyers in the case said the amounts have not been determined, families that lost the sole source of income in the fire would receive more than families that lost a child who was not working. Mr. Lippman said that a disk jockey who survived the blaze but suffered severe injuries is likely to receive the largest amount because his pain and suffering is assigned additional value in the formula.
The social club fire on Southern Boulevard in East Tremont cut an ugly gash in the Latin American community in New York and was the largest loss of life in a city fire since 146 people were killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory blaze on the same date 79 years earlier.
Julio Gonzalez set the fire in the early morning of March 25, 1990, after arguing with his ex-girlfriend, a club employee, and being thrown out of the establishment. Enraged, he returned with a dollar's worth of gasoline and set a fire on the stairs leading to the club -- the only exit -- trapping the victims. Mr. Gonzalez's ex-girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, was one of the fire's six survivors.
Mr. Gonzalez is serving a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
One of those killed in the blaze was Elias Colon, who had remodeled the club and was running it without proper licenses and despite safety violations, including no alarm or sprinkler systems. He rented the space from the building's two leaseholders, Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe.
Though Mr. DiLorenzo, the building owner, and Mr. Weiss pleaded guilty in November 1990 to charges of failure to install a sprinkler system in the building, neither Mr. DiLorenzo, Mr. Weiss or Mr. Jaffe was found criminally negligent in the fire.
Yesterday's settlement, announced by Judge Burton B. Roberts, the administrator of courts in the Bronx, insures that the three men will avoid any further personal financial liability, but there were some doubts as to how much the plaintiffs could have ultimately got had they pursued the cases further.
In the real-estate boom of the mid-1980's, Mr. DiLorenzo and his two siblings owned a vast portfolio of more than 250 New York properties, valued at about $1.2 billion. He used the property as collateral to speculate on commodities and in one year alone, 1988, he lost $21.5 million, according to court papers in a lawsuit.
Justice Douglas E. McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, who assisted Judge Roberts in guiding the settlement negotiations, said in an interview that pursuing Mr. DiLorenzo's money as part of the Happy Land case seemed fruitless. "While once he was a very wealthy man, he now is in involuntary bankruptcy," the judge said. "It was apparent that he was insolvent."
Lawyers for the families were also frustrated in their effort to pursue Mr. DiLorenzo's insurance money. Three real estate insurance companies that insured Mr. DiLorenzo's properties contended that the Happy Land building was not on a list of holdings they insured.
When the families' lawyers tried to sue manufacturers of building supplies used in the club that gave off cyanide and other poisons while burning, they realized that they had no records to prove exactly what companies supplied which materials. If those records ever existed, said Leonard Weinstock, the lead plaintiff's lawyer, they were lost when Mr. Colon died in the fire.
As part of the settlement, Mr. DiLorenzo's 3 insurance companies and 11 producers or distributors of building materials agreed to pay $7.17 million. The insurance broker for Mr. DiLorenzo, Alexander & Alexander, paid $200,000. And the City of New York, which faced possible liability for allowing the club to operate despite violations, paid $250,000 and agreed to waive about $300,000 in fees on settlement disbursements.
The largest single payment was $6.8 million from the Scottsdale Insurance Company, which covered properties for Mr. Weiss and Mr. Jaffe. After the fire, Mr. Weiss sold some personal assets to his wife, the actress Kathleen Turner, Mr. Lippman said. "He made himself judgment-proof," Mr. Lippman said.
Nonetheless, the amount of the settlement drew questions from some lawyers not involved in the case. Stanley Rosenblatt, a personal liability lawyer in Miami, said a murky insurance situation could pose "a practical problem" in large wrongful death cases. But he said lawyers must aggressively try to "pierce the corporate veil" and attack liable parties' personal assets.
But Mr. Weinstock said that "under all the circumstances, we got a good settlement."

HEADLINE: Reduction's Biggest Impact: Fanning Hopes of More Cuts

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's move yesterday to reduce the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, is likely to have only a minor impact on consumers, at least in the near future.
Indeed, the Fed's decision to drop short-term interest rates merely mirrored what has already happened in financial markets. Long-term mortgage rates have already fallen almost one and a half percentage points, to 7.63 percent, since the beginning of the year, and yields on Treasury bonds have also dropped steadily. 
 Regarded as a harbinger of Fed activity to come, however, yesterday's change in direction is likely to signal a longer-term decline in interest rates that could eventually put more spending money into consumers' pockets, economists said. That, in turn, would increase purchases of big-ticket items like cars and houses, leading to the creation of more jobs and spurring the economy forward.
"A quarter-point in and of itself doesn't make any huge difference to the economy or consumers," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "But never in history has the Fed stopped after moving only a quarter-point, so there is a strong suggestion that there's more to come."
Indeed, the financial markets have already factored an even greater reduction in rates into the pricing of items like mortgages and bonds, he said. "Because of the market's expectations, if they hadn't acted, they ran the risk that things like mortgage rates and rates on auto loans would rise," which would have a negative effect on an economy already racked with hiccups, Mr. Steinberg said.
Banks have usually waited until the Fed moved rates by at least half a percentage point, but economists expect them to reduce the prime rate quickly because of the possibility that the Fed will move again relatively soon. The Banc One Corporation, the BankAmerica Corporation, Keycorp and the Harris Trust and Savings Bank yesterday lowered their prime rates to 8.75 percent from 9 percent.
Economists said yesterday that as a result of the Fed's move more banks were likely to reduce their prime lending rates, which would make home equity loans and some credit card debt less expensive.
The University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer confidence has indicated since February that consumers, like traders and investors in the financial markets, have already anticipated a fall in interest rates. "It's not going to come as a surprise to consumers," Richard T. Curtin, director of the university's Survey Research Center, said.
The Fed's move would still send an important signal to consumers, he said. "This does indicate that Federal policy is supporting continued expansion in the economy, and that's an important element in consumer confidence," Mr. Curtin said.
Some economists argue that such confidence in lower interest rates, though, may be misplaced. David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said the Fed's action might end up generating higher rates. He noted that economic data released last week showed a resurgent housing market and stable employment, signals of strength in the economy that were not so apparent a month ago.
"If the Fed's wrong and this economy is coming back and reaccelerating on its own, we may get higher long-term rates again fairly quickly," Mr. Lereah said.
Still, consumers with variable-rate mortgages, which tend to move in tandem with one-year Treasury notes, are also likely to see their costs ease. Interest rates on variable-rate mortgages, taking all charges into account, peaked recently at 9.5 percent, according to David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. He expects those rates to fall to around 8 percent in the aftermath of the Fed's action yesterday.
Consumers on fixed incomes, like retirees, will be affected to the extent that their interest-generating investments are short term. Interest rates on certificates of deposit hit a peak of 6.3 percent at the end of last year and dwindled to an average of 5.9 percent last month. Now, Mr. Wyss expects them to decline to about 5.75 percent.
"If you're in things like short-term C.D.'s, your income is going to take a hit," he said. "But it you're locked in long-term bonds, you're not going to feel anything."
Mr. Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association said that the cut in interest rates would be a boon to the housing market and might also inspire consumers to refinance mortgages. "If the Fed really does ease up on interest rates, that could set off a wave of refinancings that would free up income for spending on other things," he said.
Like cars. Economists said the Fed's move was especially fortuitous for auto makers, which will start delivering 1996 model cars to showrooms in September, just about the time consumers should start feeling the impact of lower rates. Car loans have risen from an average of 8.79 percent in December to roughly 9.75 percent now, according to Mr. Wyss. He expects yesterday's rate cut to push rates on auto loans down by about a quarter percentage point.

HEADLINE: Small-Town Practice Proves Attractive for Rising Number of Lawyers

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: HOMERVILLE, Ga.

 BODY:
When Jeff and Cathy Helms leave their law offices here on their daily stroll to lunch at Harpers Drug Store, they pass a half-dozen clients whose wills they wrote and, on occasion, a logger for whom they won a workman's compensation claim.
At Harpers they eat next to people whose timber leases, real estate closings and personal injury cases they have handled. Passing through the store are the proud parents of students on the Clinch County High School mock trial team, which the couple coached to a regional championship this year. 
Among the lunch crowd are clients of Jeff Helms's father, Jack, who was recruited by business leaders in the 1950's to be this town's first resident lawyer. Before his death in 1991 at 61, he served as municipal attorney, school board lawyer, all-purpose mediator and State Representative while building a lucrative practice that his son and daughter-in-law have taken over.
He also bequeathed them a way of living that an increasing number of practitioners find appealing.
"The setting and pace are conducive to practicing law and practicing life," said Robert Goldsmith, head of the University of Georgia Law School Alumni Association and a lawyer in Albany, Ga., population 78,122. "The caliber of law is every bit as sophisticated, challenging and exciting as anything else."
And like many other small-town lawyers, the Helmses are highly regarded, said Sheriff Winston Peterson of Clinch County, in sharp contrast to their urban colleagues. "We see them in civic affairs, walking down the street together or jogging together," Sheriff Peterson said. "You know, they really seem to like each other's company, too."
 
A Growing Number In Similar Practices
The American Bar Association does not keep statistics on precisely where its 860,000 members practice. But if the size of a law practice is a rough proxy for whether a lawyer is in a large or a small town, the annual survey of law school graduates by the National Association for Law Placement is suggestive: 35.8 percent of 1993 graduates, the last group surveyed, took their first jobs in firms of 2 to 10 lawyers, up from 24 percent in 1989. By contrast 19.1 percent of 1993 graduates took jobs in firms of 100 lawyers or more, down from 29.4 percent in 1989.
In a recent mail survey conducted by Lawyers Weekly U.S.A., a two-year-old publication in Boston, about 20 percent of the 431 lawyers who responded said they practiced in towns of under 15,000 people.
Elaine McArdle, the paper's editor, said the survey showed that the choice was not the only reason for the apparent growing number of small-town firms. "The biggest problem in the law right now," she said, "is that there are too many lawyers, period."
Gone are the go-go 80's, when the large firms descended on the top law schools and wooed the best students with big salaries, Ms. McArdle said.
There is little that is routine about a small-town law practice, which is what the lawyers who take to it say they like.
Robert W. Chasteen Jr., president of the 18,000-member Georgia Bar Association, and a lawyer in Fitzgerald, population 14,000, said, "It's a lot like being a country doctor because you have to engage in a general-type practice and people expect that you should be able to answer questions about patents, trademarks, corporate mergers and everything else."
And with the economies of rural areas diversifying from the farm and feed store to include manufacturing, Mr. Chasteen said, there is no shortage of legal work in rural America. In small towns nationwide, he said, "there is now the infrastructure and income levels to support more lawyers."
The American Lawyer survey of large law firms found that the annual compensation for partners in the nation's top 50 law firms ranged from $350,000 to $1.2 million. While The Lawyers Weekly U.S.A. survey found that a small percentage of small-firm lawyers could earn $500,000 to $1 million a year, the average salary in firms with six or fewer lawyers was $144,036 a year.
Mr. Helms and his wife, taking over an established practice, fall comfortably close to the average: Each earns $100,000 to $150,000 a year from the practice.
The Helmses are but 2 of the 10 lawyers in this south Georgia town of 2,560 people. As small-town lawyers, the Helmses find they are many things to many people: trusted friends and advisers to everyone from local business owners to widows wanting to know about selling their late spouses' small estates; civic leaders expected to volunteer for the library board; legal muscle to bail out someone's relative in the middle of the night, and, by the very nature of their work and locale, repository for intimate details about virtually everyone in town.
 
Unlikely Couple Sharing a Love
For Mr. Helms, his role seemed ordained. Speaking of his father, he said: "I remember being as young as 3 or 4 years old going with him to interview witnesses or to take depositions. It seems that even as a child I knew what was going on with people's legal problems in town. The firm could have been called Helms & My Boy as far as my father was concerned."
Today the firm is called Helms & Helms. One-half of the duo is a 34-year-old magna cum laude philosophy and political science graduate from the University of Georgia who once considered a career as a professional soccer player and who quotes the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein as he drives his pickup truck between appointments with clients and the cattle ranch he and his wife own 10 miles outside town.
Equally improbable in this landscape of slash pines and loblollies on the fringes of the Okefenokee Swamp is the partnership's other half, the diminutive and prim 34-year-old granddaughter of a former Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives who has no trace of a Southern accent and whose interests run toward complex product liability cases, nonfiction books and horseback riding.
Mrs. Helms concedes a tendency on the part of the good ol' boys around the courthouse to condescendingly "pat me on the head because I'm so short" (5 feet even).
And Mr. Helms recently turned red with embarrassment when John Griffin, a beefy, former truck driver for whom the lawyer won a six-figure accident settlement, observed that he "sort of looks like Opie Taylor on the Andy Griffith show."
It is only partly Jack Helms's legacy of trust that elevates the couple in locals' eyes; their involvement in civic affairs, Sheriff Peterson said, makes people feel they are "truly contributing to the community."
Such community work is a virtual requisite for small-town lawyers. "It's a way of meeting people in a town," Mr. Chasteen said, "but also a way of being seen as a regular guy."
It was the ability to give to the community in clear-cut and immediate ways that helped lure Mrs. Helms here. After being classmates with Mr. Helms in law school at the University of Georgia, she worked in construction-law practice in a large Atlanta firm and, as an Assistant District Attorney in Valdosta, near here, before joining her husband. Life for her here, she said, is seamless and less complicated.
"I think we have gotten some new clients from among people locally who hear about our work with the mock trial team," she said, "but I know we got a lot of new friends also."
 
In Small Towns, Additional Rewards
Those friends include Myra Guarino, 62, of Valdosta, who Mrs. Helms represents in a suit against the manufacturer of silicone breast implants. Mrs. Guarino had the implants in 1974 and she believes they caused numerous illnesses until she had them removed three years ago.
"A lawyer in Valdosta referred me to Cathy because she was so well-informed about this subject," Mrs. Guarino said, "and, quite frankly, I was a little surprised to find someone down here who knew so much. She's more cosmopolitan than most small-town lawyers. But you know, I've never driven up to Homerville to see her. She makes house calls and comes here to see me."
Mr. Griffin, the former truck driver, and his wife, Jenny, who often rode with him, retained the Helmses three years ago after his 18-wheeler was struck by another rig whose driver had fallen asleep. Mr. Griffin suffered injuries to his knee, back and shoulder and Mrs. Griffin's back was hurt.
A bear of a man with tattoos emblazoned on both arms, Mr. Griffin said that with his injured shoulder, "I can't go through those 15 gears anymore." Mr. Helms, he said, won him a settlement that allowed him and and his wife to start a feed store, exchange their trailer for a house and buy a pickup truck.
Sitting in Mr. Helms's office recently, Mr. Griffin allowed how he felt about his lawyer. "I was born and raised in these swamps around here and you don't go around loving other men, you know," he said. "But I like Jeff. He's real people."
Mr. Griffin had stopped by with his wife to drop off a few 25-pound bags of dog food from their store for the Helms's dogs: It was their way of paying for recent additional legal work that Mr. Helms had completed for them because, they said, he had refused all other forms of payment since the settlement two years ago.
"I don't have a choice," Mr. Helms said. "Once a client, always a client, and you're my client."
But Mrs. Griffin admonished, "No, we're your friends."
Such encounters punctuate small-town legal practices, said Mr. Goldsmith of the Georgia Law School Alumni Association, and make the practices that much more rewarding.
 
Knowing the Law Can Also Help
The practice of law can be equally challenging in a small town. The Helmses discovered this when they took a personal injury case to the State Court of Appeals, the state's second highest. They won a ruling that extended to Georgia civil cases the same prohibition against striking prospective jurors from a panel solely because of race that the United States Supreme Court had established at the Federal level months earlier.
"We knew about the Federal case and I don't think the opposing lawyer did," said Mr. Helms of the suit he tried in a town north of here. "We knew from past experience what his tactics were, and, since our client was black and his was white, we had an idea what he might do in jury selection. We basically laid a trap."
The Helmses appealed their loss of the case on the ground that opposing counsel had struck some potential black jurors for racial reasons only. Mrs. Helms wrote the briefs and presented oral arguments before the appeals court, and in late 1992 won a decision that sent the case back for a new trial.
"It's not an everyday occurrence to make state law this way," Mr. Helms said, "and we are extremely proud. We went back to retry the case and still lost, but it was a moral victory."
What may set the Helmses apart from other small-town lawyers is something they owe to Jack Helms's success. He became wealthy in his practice and that money has allowed the couple to avoid the incestuous political relationships in which many small-town lawyers become enmeshed just to survive.
Don Dupree, a Homerville automobile dealer and their friend, said he would probably not call them if he got in trouble locally "because Jeff and Cathy just don't play the game."
"A lot of your small towns have small-town justice where the judges know all the lawyers and who's right and who's wrong is less important than who you know," Mr. Dupree said. "So if I was going north of the Macon line, I'd call Jeff and Cathy because they can handle themselves. But down here, I know people who have better connections to the system than them."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges 'Less Combat' By Politicians

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Drawing together many of his recent themes, President Clinton called on the nation's political figures today to have "more conversation and less combat" and to help Americans find some "common ground" as Republicans and Democrats debate the proper role of government.
In a wide-ranging speech, the President vigorously defended his vision of government as an agent to improve the lives of the middle class against the Republicans' call for less government. But Mr. Clinton also denounced "too much extremism of rhetoric and excessive partisanship" and said the way the political debate was conducted was as important to the country as its outcome. 
 "We can't restore the American dream unless we can find some way to bring the American people closer together," Mr. Clinton said. "Therefore, how we resolve these differences is as important as what specific position we advocate. I think we have got to move beyond the vision and the resentment to common ground. We've got to go beyond cynicism to a sense of possibility."
Mr. Clinton spoke for an hour from a stage at Georgetown University, the school he attended as an undergraduate and the forum for a series of speeches he delivered in 1991 setting out the philosophical underpinnings of his quest for the Presidency. And though Mr. Clinton couched today's address in nonpartisan terms, he appeared to be setting out his rationale for a second term.
At times speaking in highly personal terms, and barely glancing at his text, Mr. Clinton used his speech to enter the debate over political values and to thread his way between conservatives, who say the country's problems are rooted in a decline of culture and of personal responsibility, and liberals, who believe activist government is the answer to social ills.
"The best example of all to me that our problems are both personal and cultural and economic and political and social is the whole condition of the middle class economically," Mr. Clinton said. "I think it requires public and private decision-making, family values. Most families have them. But most families are working harder for less, so they have less time and less money to spend on their children. Now that's just a fact. That's not good for family values. And I don't believe exhortation alone can turn it around."
Mr. Clinton's aides said he would be making a series of appearances in the next few months to further explore his themes of citizenship and civic responsibility.
In contrast to Senator Bob Dole, a leading Republican Presidential contender who recently asserted that the entertainment industry was eroding moral values, Mr. Clinton in his speech dwelled at length on the economic trends that he said had eroded "middle-class dreams and middle-class values."
In themes reminiscent of his 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton said that while average income had gone up, the median income in the country had gone down in the past two years, indicating a growing gap between the richest and poorest Americans. Job security has declined in the rush toward corporate downsizing, he said, and more people have become temporary workers.
In the face of such forces, Mr. Clinton called for a "relentless effort to change but not eviscerate government" and made the case for his proposals to balance the budget over 10 years while increasing education spending and providing tax breaks for families with children and new tax deductions for post-high school education. The Republican-controlled Congress recently approved a plan for a balanced budget over seven years with steeper cuts in Government programs and larger tax cuts.
"We have tried weak government, nonexistent government, in a complex industrial society where powerful interests that are driven only by short-term considerations call all the shots," Mr. Clinton said, blaming such policies for leading to the Great Depression.
Mr. Clinton was interrupted by sustained applause from a supportive audience invited from the realms of academia, religion, sports and the media, when he cited gun control and AIDS research as areas where Americans should be willing to contribute to a common social good.
Chastising the National Rifle Association, he disputed the notion that individuals should be punished for gun violence but that guns should not be controlled.
"You don't gripe when you go through a metal detector at an airport anymore," Mr. Clinton said, "because you are very aware of the connection between this minor inconvenience to you and the fact that plane might blow up. And you don't want that plane to blow up or be hijacked. Well, look at the level of violence in America. It's the same thing."
The President also took issue with recent remarks by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who said the Federal money spent on people with AIDS should be reduced because they contracted the disease through "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct."
Mr. Clinton cited the cases of the late Ricky Ray of Florida, a teen-ager whose family was shunned after he and his brother contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and of Elizabeth Glaser, who died of AIDS last year. At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, at which Mr. Clinton was nominated for the Presidency, Mrs. Glaser gave a moving account of her having gotten AIDS through a blood transfusion and having passed it on to her daughter.
Mr. Clinton added that "the gay people who have AIDS are still our sons, our brothers, our cousins, our citizens," and he noted that while smoking caused lung cancer, no one was proposing to stop treating lung cancer or searching for a cure.
The President's tone on these issues was one more of sorrow than of partisan attack as he assumed the same mantle of conciliation that he struck last month in his New Hampshire encounter with Speaker Newt Gingrich. Acknowledging that the electorate has shown itself increasingly tired of sharp partisanship and gridlock in Washington, Mr. Clinton said that political rivals should try "more conversation and less combat" and tone down the rhetorical extremes.
"We need to respect our differences, and hear them," Mr. Clinton said, "but it means instead of having shrill voices of discord, we need a chorus of harmony. In a chorus of harmony, you know there are lots of differences, but you can hear all the voices."
Aides said Mr. Clinton was expected to travel to Tennessee on Monday to attend a conference on family issues sponsored by Vice President Al Gore, and planned additional speeches on civic responsibility to the American Federation of Teachers later this month, religious leaders in September and business executives in October.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the President's Speech at Georgetown University

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton at Georgetown University today. They were made available by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service:
Today I want to have more of a conversation than deliver a formal speech, about the great debate now raging in our nation, not so much over what we should do, but over how we should resolve the great questions of our time here in Washington and in communities all across our country. I want to talk about the obligations of citizenship, the obligations imposed on the President and people in power, and the obligations imposed on all Americans. 
 Two days ago we celebrated the 219th birthday of our democracy. The Declaration of Independence was also clearly a declaration of citizenship. It was a declaration of interdependence. "For the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." . . .
Middle-class values, strong families and faith, safe streets, secure futures -- these things are very much threatened today, threatened by 20 years of stagnant incomes, of increasing inequality of incomes, and increasing insecurity in jobs, in retirement, in health care.
They are threatened by 30 years of social problems of profound implications, of family breakups, of a rising tide of crime and drugs, of declining birthrates among successful, married couples and rising birthrates among young people who are not married. They are threatened by the failure of public institutions to respond. The failure of bureaucracies encrusted in yesterday's prerogatives and not meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. The schools, the law-enforcement agencies, the governments and their economic and their other policies. They are threatened by the sheer pace and scope of change as technology and ideas and money and decisions move across the globe at breathtaking rates. . . .
Politics has become more and more fractured, just like the rest of our lives, pluralized. It's exciting in some ways, but as we divide into more and more and more sharply defined organized groups around more and more and more stratified issues, as we communicate more and more with people in extreme rhetoric through mass mailings or sometimes semihysterical messages right before election on the telephone, or 30-second ads designed far more to inflame than to inform, as we see politicians actually getting language lessons on how to turn their adversaries into aliens, it is difficult to draw the conclusion that our political system is producing the sort of discussion that will give us the kind of results we need. But our citizens, even though their confidence in the future has been clouded, and their doubts about their leaders and their institutions are profound, want something better. . . .
What do we have to do now? First of all, we've got to have this debate that is looming over Washington. It's a good thing. We are debating things now we thought were settled for decades. We are now back to fundamental issues that were debated like this 50, 60, 70 years ago.
There is a group who believe that our problems are primarily personal and cultural. Cultural is basically a word that means in this context, there are a whole lot of persons doing the same bad thing. And that's what people, and if everybody would just sort of straighten up and fly right, why things would be hunky-dory, and why don't they do it? I'll give you two examples. . . .
The N.R.A.'s position on gun violence, the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. Their position is: Guns don't kill people, people do. Find the people who do wrong, throw them in jail and throw the key away. . . .
Second example is the one that dominated the headlines in the last couple of days, what Senator Helms said about AIDS: I'm sick and tired of spending money on research and treatment for a disease that could be ended tomorrow if everybody would just straighten up and fly right. . . .
I would say to you that there are some things that mere exhortation to good conduct will not solve, that require other responses that are public, or that are private, but go beyond just saying these are personal and cultural problems. I also think that if we want to maintain a public response there must be a relentless effort to change, but not to eviscerate, the government. . . .
I believe that a democracy requires a certain amount of common ground. I do not believe you can solve complex questions like this at the grass-roots level or at the national level or anywhere in between if you have too much extremism of rhetoric and excessive partisanship. Times are changing too fast. . . .
Every citizen in this country's got to say, "What do I have to do for myself or my family," or nothing else counts. The truth is that nobody can repeal the laws of the global economy, and people that don't have a certain level of education and skills are not going to be employable in good jobs with long-term prospects. And that's just a fact. . . .
The second thing is, more of our citizens have got to say, "What should I do in my community?" You know, it's not just enough to bemoan the rising crime rate or how kids are behaving or whatever. . . .
We can redeem the promise of America for our children. We can certainly restore the American family for another full century, if we commit to each other, as the Founders did, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. In our hour of greatest peril and greatest division, when we were fighting over the issue which we have still not fully resolved, Abraham Lincoln said, We are not enemies but friends, we must not be enemies. My friends, amidst all our differences, let us find a new common ground.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE TRIMS A KEY RATE; FIRST CUT SINCE '92

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Under mounting political and economic pressure to stave off a possible recession, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates today for the first time since 1992.
But the Federal Reserve's top rate-setting committee made only a small reduction, reflecting its confidence that any downturn would be brief and mild. It trimmed the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. The less critical discount rate, which the Federal Reserve levies on banks for short-term loans, was left unchanged at 5.25 percent. 
 "As a result of the monetary tightening initiated in early 1994, inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetary conditions," Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said in a statement today.
For consumers and business, the decision should mean slightly lower costs for borrowing. Indeed, some big banks began moving after the announcement to lower their prime lending rates, which influence the cost of home equity loans, small business loans and some credit card balances. [Page D4.]
Since interest rate reductions often take several months or longer to affect the pace of economic growth, the immediate impact of the decision is likely to be its effect on the financial markets, which soared on the action. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 48.77 points, to 4,664, while interest rates fell in the bond market. [Pages D6 and D15.]
Investors in the markets had been awaiting this meeting for weeks, as speculation intensified about how the Federal Reserve might respond to a string of Government statistics that showed a sharp slowdown in business activity. Some Fed officials as well as investors had begun to worry that inaction could lead to a plunge in the stock and bond markets that might make a recession more likely.
The news was also welcomed at the White House, which is acutely aware of the damage a downturn would cause to President Clinton's re-election prospects.
More broadly, the decision marks an important point in the nation's business cycle. The Federal Reserve had steadily cut rates from July 1990 to September 1992 as it tried to arrest the recession that destroyed President George Bush's re-election hopes. It then raised them from February 1994 through February of this year to control inflation by braking the economy's momentum.
In the past, the Federal Reserve has tended to keep cutting rates for a while once it starts. Yet in the last few weeks Mr. Greenspan had hinted at his reluctance to stimulate an economy he considers in good shape for the long term. That suggests that further cuts may also be small and slow in coming. And if the economy rebounds faster than the Federal Reserve expects, there is even a chance that the central bank may respond by once again raising rates.
Mr. Greenspan described the move today as a consequence of the Federal Reserve's success in keeping the economic expansion from getting out of hand last year. He declared in his statement that the central bank's seven increases in short-term rates in the last 17 months had kept inflation under control.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, took pains in a statement today to counteract any interpretation of the Federal Reserve's action as a signal of economic difficulty. "Many of the factors behind the recent weakness are likely to operate with less force in the future," they said. "Sales of homes show evidence of a rebound; export growth should pick up in future months; the demand for capital goods remains strong, and businesses appear to be well along in the process of paring inventories."
Both the Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve have a strong stake in maintaining public confidence in the economy. As several Federal Reserve officials said in interviews last month, the biggest threat to the economy would come if millions of Americans suddenly began fearing for their jobs and cut back on their spending, leaving retailers' shelves full of unsold goods and forcing a ripple of layoffs across the nation.
A welter of Government statistics during the last two months have pointed to a slowing economy with little risk of inflation. The Commerce Department said today, for example, that its index of leading economic indicators had fallen by two-tenths of a percent in May, the fourth consecutive drop. Economists consider it a warning of a possible recession ahead when the index falls for three months in a row. That picture has been clouded, though, by recent signs in the housing market and elsewhere that economic activity may perk up again later this year.
At the same time, inflation has only inched up. Despite an economy operating at close to full capacity, consumer price inflation rose during the first five months of this year at an annual pace of 3.6 percent, barely up from last year's increase of 2.7 percent. Inflation in raw materials like grain and industrial materials like steel, which tends to precede rising consumer prices, has slowed sharply in the last year.
Financial markets have soared during the last month on expectations of a cut in rates. The Federal Reserve's top officials, including Mr. Greenspan, may have grown increasingly reluctant in the last several weeks to risk causing turmoil on Wall Street by leaving rates unchanged, analysts said.
Whenever the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it risks driving down the value of the already weak American dollar by making short-term investments less attractive in the United States. Possibly because the discount rate, which is sometimes used to signal the currency markets, was left unchanged, today's rate reduction produced only a small drop in the dollar against the German mark and little change against the Japanese yen.
The goal of the Federal Reserve's seven interest rate increases in 1994 and early this year was to brake inflation. To do that, the Federal Reserve slowed the growth of the money supply and restricted the nation's economic growth so as to prevent the appearance of inflationary bottlenecks in the production of goods and services.
But there were plenty of people today contending that the central bank had gone too far in raising interest rates, needlessly sacrificing jobs to trim a few tenths of a percentage point off the inflation rate. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, quickly criticized today's move as too little, too late.
"This is only a small step by the Federal Reserve in admitting its previous severe interest rate policy was wrong," he said. "It is already too late to stop the economic harm caused by the Federal Reserve's misguided doubling of interest rates."
Republicans were quick to blame the Clinton Administration for the economy's slowdown. "The recent weakness in economic data signal the damage done to the economy by President Clinton's 1993 tax hikes," said Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who heads the Joint Economic Committee.
But most economists contend that tax changes have a very limited effect on the ups and downs in the business cycle, which is more affected by interest rate changes.

HEADLINE: Chemical Aims to Expand Electronic Banking

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Chemical Bank said yesterday that it would expand its electronic banking services beginning in October, including a new push into the home banking arena that it has tried unsuccessfully to develop for more than a decade.
As part of the program, the bank announced an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation to provide money management software linked to Chemical's private computer network. Microsoft will help Chemical market the new services by providing it with names of registered users of Microsoft products in the bank's area, a spokesman for Microsoft said. 
 Chemical, a unit of the Chemical Banking Corporation of New York, becomes the seventh big bank to forge such an alliance with Microsoft. The bank also disclosed plans to deploy 235 new automatic teller machines, including some that will offer advanced features like handwriting recognition and instant verification of deposits. By 1996, the company said, new A.T.M. cards will double as debit cards, enabling Chemical customers to make purchases at more than 12 million merchants worldwide.
Millions of personal computers have been installed in the New York metropolitan area since Chemical began its home banking experiments in the early 1980's, but the bank still has only a few thousand regular on-line customers. And these use their computers for relatively simple banking chores, including checking of account balances and statements, and transfer of funds.
Chemical plans to offer its customers the choice of its own home banking software or a copy of Microsoft Money for Windows 95, a new version of the financial management program that Microsoft recently tried to dump in favor of a more popular rival program, Quicken.
The Chemical deal is the first bank alliance by Microsoft since the collapse of its proposed $2 billion merger with Intuit Inc., the maker of Quicken. To lessen potential antitrust concerns, Microsoft would have sold Money to Novell Inc. had the Intuit deal been completed.
Earlier, Microsoft signed up six other big banks for alliances, including Chase Manhattan in New York and banks in North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota and Oregon. Microsoft is expected to announce similar bank agreements in coming weeks.
William M. Bluestein, a research director at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said Microsoft had "a tremendous marketing problem with Microsoft Money."
"They're weakened by their tacit admission that Quicken was a better product," he said. "Now they're bringing out a new version, but they have to say, 'This product we wanted to get rid of really isn't all that bad.' "
Matthew L. Cone, the business development manager at Microsoft, said such an analysis was unfair. "Microsoft wanted to acquire Intuit not for Quicken, but for Intuit's management team, organizational structure and creative talent," he said.
Mr. Cone said programmers continued to work hard to improve Money even while Microsoft was proposing to sell it to Novell. "They kept working even when they knew they could become surrogate parents and deliver the baby to another company," he said.
Ronald A. Braco, senior vice president in charge of electronic banking for Chemical Bank, said he was impressed with Microsoft Money for Windows 95. He declined to say whether the bank negotiated with Intuit or other makers of financial software as well as with Microsoft.
Mr. Braco said Chemical's own home banking software, called Excel -- which is not related to Microsoft's spreadsheet program of the same name -- will be offered to bank customers who want a simple, no-frills program for basic banking tasks. Microsoft Money will be offered to more advanced PC users, he said, but no decision has been made on whether to give away the software or offer it at a discount.

HEADLINE: In the Line of Fire;
Sights on Clinton, G.O.P. Assails His Economist

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Few operations of the Government are smaller or cheaper than the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. So why are Congressional Republicans so interested in abolishing it?
That question confronts the council's new chairman, Joseph E. Stiglitz, appointed on the same day last week that a House Appropriations subcommittee voted to eliminate financing for the council. 
 Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, the Iowa Republican who is the subcommittee chairman, said the vote to kill the council mainly reflected a sense that President Clinton already had enough economists in other agencies, like the Office of Management and Budget.
"We've got the National Economics Council, the O.M.B. and we have the C.E.A. all dealing with finances and money and so on," he said in an interview. "The question is whether these functions are duplicative, all dealing with money and advice and so forth."
But some Democrats have complained that the Republicans are also using partisan differences with the council's previous head, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, as an excuse to kill it. Although the head of the council has always been a Presidential appointee whose job included acting as a spokesman for an administration's economic policies, the Republicans argue that Ms. Tyson went too far.
"There was that criticism made -- I never made it, but I've heard it -- and I think some of it is justified," Mr. Lightfoot said. "My understanding of C.E.A. is nonpartisan, unbiased interpretation of what is going on -- like the C.I.A. on what is going on politically -- and that line may have been stepped over a little bit."
The question is whether the naming of Mr. Stiglitz, which the White House describes as having fallen by coincidence on the day of the subcommittee vote, will take the steam out of Republican efforts to kill the council.
As chairwoman of the council the last two years, Ms. Tyson emerged as a leading advocate for the Administration's domestic policies. Politically savvy, forceful, with a skill for sound bites that made economics seem simple, she raised the council's visibility. She also rubbed more than a few Congressional Republicans the wrong way.
Mr. Stiglitz's economic views are much like Ms. Tyson's, but his style is very different. Mr. Stiglitz, 52, is literally a graybeard in a White House still dominated by youth. (Ms. Tyson is 48, but looks younger.) While Ms. Tyson has long devoted her attention to the hottest economic issues of the day, Mr. Stiglitz is a theoretician best known for his original ideas and mathematical arguments on issues of interest mostly to other economists.
His delivery is not made for television: he chooses words with care, pausing in midsentence long enough, it sometimes seems, for Newt Gingrich to hold a roll-call vote of the entire House. And he comes across as less confrontational.
But it's not clear whether this will be enough to persuade the Republicans to back off.
Indeed, Administration officials say the Republicans' intent is to annoy the President, not to end economic partisanship, because council chairmen have lobbied for Administrations of both parties. They see the subcommittee's move as breaking down a long-honored understanding that Presidents of whatever party are given a reasonably free hand with the White House budget.
Backing the White House is a bipartisan group of past chairmen of the council, created in 1946 to help carry out the Employment Act, the first big piece of economic legislation after World War II. Herbert Stein, the chairman under President Richard M. Nixon, said he thought that Ms. Tyson's views were within the mainstream of current economic thought and that she was not excessively partisan. "The Council of Economic Advisers is appointed by the President," Mr. Stein said. "He appoints people he regards as sympathetic. He doesn't appoint people he has to fight with all the time."
The council, with a budget of $3.4 million this year, gives the President advice about the impact of Government decisions on the economy. And that advice frequently challenges the views of many of the special interests that dominate decision-making in Washington.
The council has quarreled with career economists at the Agriculture Department, for example, over the value of farm subsidies. Mr. Stiglitz said in an interview today that he viewed the council's role as off-setting established interests of many sorts. "Unlike many other agencies whose charge it is to be attentive to particular aspects of our multifaceted economy," he said, "the C.E.A. takes a national perspective analyzing impacts of economic policies on every major sector and group -- on workers, on firms, on consumers and on financial markets."
For her part, Ms. Tyson acknowledges that she engaged in what she describes as heated exchanges with the Republican-controlled House and Senate budget committees in the weeks before she moved to her new White House job as head of the National Economic Council. But she scoffed at any notion that she brought undue partisanship to the council.
"I have always tried to adhere to the highest professional standards," she said. "Clearly, I don't see the world the way some Republicans do."
Mr. Stiglitz will probably face less such criticism, in part because he has more armor than Ms. Tyson against conservative attacks. He is clearly comfortable among conservatives; before coming to the Administration, he was a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution on the campus of Stanford University (he was also a professor at Stanford). When a visitor came to his office last week, the top magazine on his coffee table was a freshly thumbed copy of the magazine Regulation, published by the Cato Institute, which has a free-market view.
To be sure, Mr. Stiglitz's academic writings show he is clearly a liberal. He has concentrated on issues of market failures rather than on government failures. He is also a longtime advocate of universal health care coverage.
"I would not confuse a certain academic manner of speech with a lack of ideological conviction or a lack of partisan feeling," said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity.
Mr. Stiglitz acknowledged today that he thinks government should play a strong role in the economy. "One of the major responsibilities of government," he said, "is to insure that all of society's resources, and in particular its human resources, are fully utilized."
Yet Mr. Stiglitz, with his air of an absent-minded professor, appears likely to be a much less controversial figure in Washington than Ms. Tyson was.
The council's chairmen have varied in influence, even over the course of a single Administration. Michael J. Boskin was very influential at the beginning of the Bush Administration, for example, but a couple of years later, after his advice had become less welcome, he had to threaten to quit before getting a one-on-one session with President Bush.
Under Ms. Tyson, the council gained influence. That partly reflected the fact that Ms. Tyson communicated well with a President who sometimes talks like an economics-wonk wannabe. But it also reflected Ms. Tyson's close political alliance with Vice President Al Gore.
 A few months after President Clinton took office, Ms. Tyson and Mr. Gore decided in a conversation that the President should be getting economic advice more comparable to his national security advice, Ms. Tyson said. As a result, the council began producing a weekly economic briefing paper for the President, and Ms. Tyson was guaranteed a weekly meeting with him.
Part of Ms. Tyson's influence also reflected her ability to express economic ideas in simple, forceful language, both at White House meetings and on television. By contrast, Mr. Stiglitz admitted, "I haven't done a lot of television."
Mr. Stiglitz has led a privileged academic life, teaching only two or three times a week, pampered by a succession of the world's best universities because of his glittering reputation. Inside the Beltway, he may stand in Ms. Tyson's shadow, but among economists he is an unquestioned star who is widely expected to win a Nobel Prize someday.
After graduating from Amherst College and receiving his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Stiglitz was appointed a full professor of economics at Yale University at age 26. He later held Britain's oldest and most prestigious chair in economics, the Drummond Chair in Political Economy at All Souls College at Oxford.
During his academic career, Mr. Stiglitz focused not on the operation of the overall economy but on the economic decisions of individuals or companies or government agencies. He has been particularly active on problems of operating when information is incomplete, such as the difficulties facing health insurance companies in trying to gauge the extent to which people seeking individual coverage are particularly bad risks.
That interest in so-called microeconomic issues has carried over into the Government. While Ms. Tyson spent much of this spring battling Congress over budget cuts, Mr. Stiglitz was putting a great deal of energy into devising an Administration plan to simplify pensions.
Mr. Stiglitz said in the interview that he planned to be much more active in issues involving the overall economy, but quickly returned to his interest in making specific Government programs work better. "It's an area which I was always interested in, but it's also an area where I think there is really bipartisan consensus," he said.
This seems to suit House Republicans. "From what little I know of him," Mr. Lightfoot said, "I don't expect him to make a lot of partisan remarks -- he doesn't strike me as that type."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rate Cut By Fed Pushes Treasury Prices Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of percentage point.
The move matched the expectations of many in the market, which had already priced in a cut of that size. But many trader and analysts are still uncertain about how far the Fed's new course will take interest rates. 
 The central bank reduced the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. The discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for short-term loans, was left unchanged at 5.25 percent. It is the first rate reduction since Sept. 4, 1992, and represents an about-face in monetary policy. The Fed had doubled the Federal funds rate over seven rate increases beginning in February 1994.
Some analysts had doubted that a rate cut would come at this meeting because of recent signs that the economy was not slowing as sharply as had been previously believed, increasing the possibility of a resurgance in inflation in the months ahead. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. Still, the move by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making group, was a relatively small reduction.
"The quarter-point move was one that I think all members of the Federal Open Market Committee could live with," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities. "A half-point move would have been too much for some, while an unchanged policy would have been too little for others."
The price of the 30-year bond jumped 116/32 , to 11423/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.49 percent, from 6.60 percent on Wednesday.
Prices of shorter-term maturities, typically the most sensitive to changes in Fed policy, also rallied strongly, driving their rates down.The rate for a three-month bill fell 12 basis points, to 5.36 percent, and the rate for a six-month bill fell 17 basis points, to 5.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The yield spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond widened to 98 basis points yesterday from 84 basis points on Wednesday, indicating that investors had indeed been expecting a cut in rates.
And the sharp surge in the short end of the market yesterday suggested that traders expect further cuts this year, said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Mr. Chan said the quarter of a percentage point move by the Fed indicated that among Fed policy makers, neither the anti-inflation hawks nor the recession-fearing doves were in control. "It appears that this was a compromise reached in the 11theleventh hour," Mr. Chan said. "The move in my judgment may turn out to be a shrewd one" for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, he said, if today's employment report for June is weaker than expected. "The compromise may have prevented the F.O.M.C. from cutting rates more sharply if they had waited until they had seen the employment report."
The Labor Department's employment report today may not be quite the market mover it has been in the past.
"Clearly some of the anticipation that normally surrounds these numbers may be lessened because of the Fed's action today," Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said.
"Another point worth thinking about is the fact that the Fed moved right before the release of the payroll number, which should show the market that the number, by itself, is not the be-all and end-all of economic statistics."

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoys Press the I.R.A. To Take Steps to Yield Arms

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, July 6

 BODY:
The United States Ambassadors to Britain and Ireland have reminded Gerry Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, that the Clinton Administration wants him to advance the Northern Ireland peace effort.
The Administration is particularly interested, the Ambassadors say, in the area of decommissioning of arms by the I.R.A., in order to enhance the possibility of convening full-fledged peace negotiations. 
 The diplomatic contacts came before this week's violent protests in Northern Ireland. President Clinton, whose plans to visit Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain were announced today, would like to have peace talks under way by the time he arrives in late November. Irish-American support for Mr. Clinton, which has increased with his involvement in the peace effort here, would help him in the 1996 election.
The United States Embassy in London declined to comment on a newspaper report in today's Times of London that the American Ambassador to Britain, William Crowe, delivered a "strongly worded" message from the Administration on the subject of arms when he met with Mr. Adams here last week. But one official said, "We have no quibble with that story."
The American Ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, said in an interview that she was aware of Ambassador Crowe's conversation with Mr. Adams and that she had sent an official letter to Mr. Adams in Belfast that simply restated American policy: all sides in Northern Ireland should lay down their down arms and enter negotiations.
The policy was outlined by President Clinton last May in a speech in Washington to a conference on economic development in Ireland. But in that speech, the President set no timetable for decommissioning or full-fledged talks including Sinn Fein.
Mrs. Smith, said in an interview that she sent a message to Mr. Adams and that she had not taken a hard or tough line with him. Her message to Mr. Adams, she said, "was encouraging and supportive of the peace process and the talks process."
Mr. Adams and Sinn Fein consider good relations with Washington essential to their immediate goal: being invited by Britain to join all-party talks on Ulster. Sinn Fein hopes that Washington will continue to press the Government of Prime Minister John Major to convene the talks soon.
But Irish officials are worried that American pressure might weaken after this week's rioting, the worst in the 10 months since the I.R.A. declared a cease-fire. British officials and local Catholic residents have said that Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. stirred up the violence, which began in protest of Britain's release on Monday of a soldier who had been serving a life term for the 1990 killing of a Catholic girl in a stolen car that ran through an army checkpoint in 1990.
Sinn Fein has denied the accusations that it orchestrated the riots, in which hundreds of cars and trucks were hijacked and torched. The violence ended on Wednesday, after Mr. Adams called for calm.
Britain has insisted that the I.R.A. make progress on decommissioning before Sinn Fein is invited to full-fledged negotiations toward a settlement of the conflict between the Roman Catholic minority and the Protestant majority in Ulster.
Mr. Adams has said that the I.R.A. cease-fire is adequate evidence of its peaceful intentions and that decommissioning is an unacceptable pre-condition to roundtable negotiations.

HEADLINE: Unraveling of a Land Swap: No School, No Plant Expansion

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Two years ago, it appeared to be the perfect civic deal: a major manufacturer in Brooklyn and the city's School Construction Authority would swap two adjacent pieces of land, allowing a long-delayed school to be built and giving the manufacturer the space it needed to expand its 700-worker plant. And both the city and state would offer financial help.
But now, the deal -- brokered late in 1993 by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- is dead. A lawsuit blocks the construction of the badly needed intermediate school in East New York. The manufacturer, Blue Ridge Farms, is talking about moving its food-processing plant -- and the jobs -- to the South. 
 And the warm expressions of cooperation and goodwill have dissolved into bitter charges of deception, delay and bad faith.
"I don't know who is at fault, probably everyone," said Cesi Mullane, the leader of a local coalition of parents pushing for the school to be built. "It's a shame we have to be for or against the school or the jobs at the plant. But there has to be an end to it."
The people of East New York thought they had reached an end -- a paradise of sorts -- in 1993 when the School Construction Authority, which oversees the construction of city schools, agreed to give up a parcel of land it owned next to the Blue Ridge plant. That would have allowed the company to build a pasta-production annex. In return, the company was to give the school system a larger plot for a new $30 million school.
In addition, the city agreed to contribute several million dollars in tax incentives and capital investments to the company, which employs hundreds of residents in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. And New York State agreed to help with the land-condemnation process and said it would cover the costs of environmental studies and any litigation.
But the deal began to unravel with the election of Gov. George E. Pataki. Alarmed by the details of the land swap, the new Governor's appointees decided they would not honor the terms of the deal.
"It was a blank check they had been given, a sweetheart deal," said Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the State Urban Development Corporation, which rejected the deal. State officials said the deal would have cost the state more than $1 million and exposed it to the potential damage of any litigation.
State officials said they were concerned that the previous owner of the city property -- a man involved in a long personal dispute with Blue Ridge Farms -- might sue if his land ultimately was used by the company. They also said they were afraid that environmental groups might take legal action seeking to block any expansion of the manufacturing plant in a neighborhood that is a mix of commercial and residential areas.
"The terms were outrageous, the risks great," Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the state development agency, said. "It was rejected on its merits."
Before becoming a state official, Mr. Gargano was president of a development corporation run by his son. In 1985, the corporation bought the land that is now owned by Blue Ridge and involved in the proposed swap. Sale records show the corporation made a $1 million profit when it sold the land to Blue Ridge in 1987.
Mr. Gargano described himself last week as a "passive partner" in the corporation and said he saw no conflict of interest in deciding whether the state should be involved in the deal.
On April 25, the state development agency, in a letter sent jointly with the city's Economic Development Corporation, informed Blue Ridge Farms that it would have to accept a modified deal under which the company would assume the risks of potential litigation or settle for expanding on the site it was to swap with the School Construction Authority.
Officials of Blue Ridge Farms -- which makes salads and hot entrees and which had $70 million in revenues last year -- said the ultimatum violated their agreement and said expanding on their own site was unrealistic because the parcel owned by the School Construction Authority prevented it from building a contiguous annex.
In a swift series of subsequent events, the city told the Board of Education to go ahead with plans to build the school on the current site, and the Schools Chancellor told the School Construction Authority to put the contract for the school out to bid.
In answer, Blue Ridge Farms went to court and was granted a temporary restraining order preventing the start of construction. Blue Ridge officials said they are prepared to sue the city for damages and relocate their operation out of state, the very result the initial deal with the former state and city administrations had sought to avert.
"We have no choice," Seymour Siegel, the chief executive officer of the company, said.
And so the scene has come full circle in East New York, and if anything, mutual mistrust has only grown.
Pataki administration officials contend that Blue Ridge should have sealed its deal before Mr. Cuomo left office and that it was the company's lack of organization and fiscal soundness -- the company owes $900,000 in unpaid city taxes -- that prevented it from doing so.
Blue Ridge officials say the city should go ahead and complete the swap without the state's involvement, repeating their long-held position that building the school on a plot of land that stands squarely in the middle of their facility will be a nightmare for the schoolchildren.
The city, which insists that it never backed away from its willingness to commit money and tax breaks, says that legally it needs the state's involvement in order to go ahead with the deal. And the Board of Education says it merely wants to get a school built and will do so at whatever site it is directed to use.
"The city never wants to see a business leave, and it will work overtime to keep them here," said Forrest R. Taylor, chief of staff for Deputy Mayor John Dyson. "But there are times when businesses ask for what it is beyond the city to give."
Mr. Siegel, whose company has an $18 million annual payroll, disputes the Giuliani administration's claim that it cannot legally go ahead with the swap without the state.
"Everyone says that City Hall could get this done if it wanted to," Mr. Siegel said. "I have no idea why it doesn't seem to want to."
Meanwhile, the people of East New York have been left angry and divided, suspicious of Blue Ridge, the city and the state. Juan Lao, a father of three who works as a maintenance supervisor at Blue Ridge, said he finds it unthinkable that a deal cannot be worked out.
Marilyn Camacho, who has worked at Blue Ridge for eight years, said, "We had it all, and now they want to take it all."
The Rev. Patrick Mahoney, the pastor of the Blessed Sacrament Roman Catholic Church, said, "People feel once again backed into a corner. I don't know why it has all come apart."

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Their Sales Were Sluggish Last Month

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Spending at the nation's retail chain stores was sluggish during June, sales figures released yesterday show. Analysts said the lackluster results were consistent with a slowdown in the economy.
Big department stores and discount chains registered the biggest sales gains, as consumers continued to be spend cautiously, gravitating to stores offering markdowns on summer merchandise. 
 Analysts attributed gains at big chains like May Department Stores, Dillard Department Stores and Federated Department Stores in large part to a rise in apparel sales.
Comparable-store sales rose by 4.6 percent percent at May, by 4 percent at Dillard and by 4.8 percent at Federated.
"In June, Americans entered a wardrobe-replacement mode," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retailing Report, an industry newsletter based in Scotch Plains, N.J. "For the first time in a couple of years, they are buying clothing at department stores, which offer low prices and huge variety, things you don't find at specialty retailers."
Goldman, Sachs's retail composite index, a weighted average of the same-store sales of more than 60 retailers, rose 3.4 percent last month, compared with a 6.4 percent gain in June 1994 and a 3.7 percent increase in May.
Same-store, or comparable-store, sales are for stores open at least a year. The measure is considered a better gauge of a retailer's performance because it factors out sales in new stores.
"The sales numbers are pretty consistent with what we have had all year, with the exception of hard specialty goods, like home furnishings and home improvement items, which have softened," Richard N. Baum, a retailing analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said.
Sales of hard goods dropped sharply in June compared with the month a year ago, he said, because the summer of 1994 began with a period of exceptionally hot weather.
"By comparison, this June was unseasonably cool," Mr. Baum said. "As a result, sales items like air-conditioners and lawn furniture were down from a year ago."
The gain in apparel spending at department stores was at the expense of specialty retailing chains like Limited Inc., the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation and Gap Inc.
On a comparable-store basis, Limited sales rose 1 percent in June. But that was better than the performance at Ann Taylor, where comparable-store sales fell by 10.3 percent, and Gap, where they dropped 4 percent.
Ann Taylor also said yesterday that it expected a loss of 8 to 12 cents a share in the second quarter. Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Ann Taylor fell $3.25, to $20.375; Gap lost $2.25 a share, to $34.25, while Limited fell by 12.5 cents, to $21.875.
Even as big department store chains were gaining business that might otherwise have gone to specialty retailers, nationwide discount-store operations continued to take advantage of the move to value shopping, often at the expense of regional chains.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer, posted a 5.5 percent rise in same-store sales for a five-week period ending June 30. And the Kmart Corporation, the second-biggest retailer, had a 6.3 percent gain for a five-week period ending June 28.
By contrast, same-store sales at many regional discounters fell last month. Sales at the Caldor Corporation, a big Northeast chain, were down 6 percent.
"The national chains clearly outperformed the regionals," Mr. Baum said.
While yesterday's decision by the Federal Reserve to lower a key interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point was intended to shore up the economy, retailers have not planned on a quick bounce in consumer spending, analysts said.
"We believe retailers are well positioned for a soft landing," said Jeff Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "Inventories and expenses are very tight."
And though retailers are generally an optimistic lot, Mr. Baum said, they should remain wary. He said two of the three leading indicators he uses to determine future consumer spending patterns -- average hourly wage growth and consumer installment debt as a percentage of disposable income -- were signaling caution. Wage growth has been flat through June, while consumer installment debt is very high.
"We think the consumer is going to be pretty stingy for the rest of the year," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China to Keep Coast Areas' Special Status

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 6

 BODY:
After months of rumors and speculation, Shanghai's Mayor made an announcement today that amounts to a vote to keep promises to foreign investors and not to yield to demands for equality from investment-starved inland areas.
Mayor Xu Kuangdi, smiling broadly as he addressed a room full of reporters, said that after long political debate in Beijing, China's leaders had decided not to revoke the preferential tax status given to East Shanghai, one of China's fastest-growing development zones and a barometer of the nation's efforts to modernize industry. 
 Until a few years ago, East Shanghai was a vast area of marsh and farmland, perhaps best known for having produced the gangster who dominated the Shanghai underworld in the 1920's and 30's, Du Yuesheng. Just across the river from downtown Shanghai, East Shanghai can be roughly compared geographically to Brooklyn a century ago, in the years after the first bridge connected it to Manhattan.
Known here as Pudong, meaning "east of the Huangpu River," East Shanghai was chosen by the city's leaders in 1990 as an area that if it attracted enough foreign investment could help them realize their hopes of again making Shanghai the international trading and finance center it once was.
With the city's downtown area too crowded for new manufacturing or office space, East Shanghai provided an alternative that is close and free of congestion and traffic. In the area along the east side of the city's waterfront, a new financial center was planned as a home for the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the main branches of every major Chinese bank.
Western companies were skeptical at first. But $3 billion of Government spending, in five years, has produced two major bridges, four shipping wharves, a complex of roads and a number of high-rise buildings, as well as water, electric and sewage plants. A new airport is also under construction.
More than 3,000 companies have committed $7 billion in investment since the special zone was opened in 1990, according to the East Shanghai New Area administration and information office. Although some of the 100 foreign companies that have begun operating in East Shanghai complain about high land prices and insufficient electricity, many people are deeply impressed by the amount of construction that has already been accomplished.
One of the prime attractions for foreign companies is the reduced tax rate. The standard corporate tax for foreign-financed enterprises in Shanghai is 33 percent of profit, but in East Shanghai the rate is 15 percent. Moreover, taxes are forgiven for the first two years of profitability, and only half -- 7.5 percent -- is due in the third, fourth and fifth years of profitability.
Earlier this year, as political debate in Beijing included more and more talk of the need to share wealth with China's poorer inland provinces, senior leaders began speaking about "adjusting" tax rates in special economic zones, including East Shanghai.
Although it was not clear what adjusting meant, some businessmen feared that corporate income-tax breaks might go the way of the former exemptions from duty on cars imported through East Shanghai; the exemption was abruptly dropped in 1993.
Last month, before the new decision was announced, Fan Zonglin of the East Shanghai administration and information office explained why corporate taxes might have to be rejiggered.
"The central Government wants to have a fairer tax policy," Mr. Fan said. "Other areas complained about special economic zones. There is a need to balance different areas in the country."
For now, at least, such concerns seem to have taken a backseat to the need to keep promises to foreign investors.
Mr. Xu said specifically that corporate income-tax rates would not change, at least for five years, either in East Shanghai or in China's other special economic zones.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Remains Little Changed After Interest Rate Cut by Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most major currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates for the first time in almost three years.
Lower rates often weigh on the dollar by making United States deposits less attractive, but because the Fed's quarter-point cut had been anticipated by many investors, the reaction of the dollar was muted. 
 "A cut was certainly priced in," said Jim Raphael, currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "I don't think the interest rate differential shifted enough to prompt a global re-evaluation of the dollar."
The policy-making committee of the Fed cut the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 5.75 percent from 6.0 percent.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 84.96 Japanese yen, up from 84.85 yen late Wednesday. It was at 1.3787 German marks, little changed from 1.3794 marks, and 4.8236 French francs, down from 4.8242 francs.
The French central bank also made a quarter-point cut in a key interest rate yesterday, cutting to 7.25 percent the 5-to-10-day bank credit, which establishes the ceiling for money market rates. The move was seen as a response to the economic package announced by the Government of President Jacques Chirac on June 22.
The Bank of Canada also cut its key overnight lending rate by a quarter-point.
With the Fed's committee meeting behind them, traders said they would focus on employment figures being released today for further clues on the strength of the economy and the outlook for future rate moves.
The Fed's rate cut was the first since September 1992, and comes after seven rate increases over the last 17 months.
Jeffrey Yu, chief currency dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York, said the quarter-point cut "is very neutral."
"It just says to the market that they're aware of the slowdown in the economy," he said.
The first test of the wisdom of the Fed's action could come tomorrow, when the Government releases unemployment figures for June, traders said.
The United States economy lost 101,000 jobs in May and 7,000 in April, fostering speculation the economy was heading for a recession. "If there's continuing weakness in the employment numbers people will make noises about more cuts down the road," Mr. Yu said.

HEADLINE: This Time, the Fed Trails the Market

 BODY:
The bankers who set loan and deposit rates and the investors who buy and sell Treasury bonds apparently concluded months ago that the risk of an overheated economy was fading and higher interest rates were no longer needed to protect them against inflation. The Federal Reserve waited until yesterday to ratify that thinking with its first cut in the Federal funds rate after a yearlong series of increases. Many rates that directly affect consumers had already fallen in anticipation of the move, and analysts say long-term rates are not likely to fall further soon, though short-term rates may drop. Articles, pages A1 and D4.

HEADLINE: Grade Inflation Demeans Good Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Congratulations to college administrators ("In a Change of Policy, and Heart, Colleges Join Fight Against Inflated Grades," news article, July 4) who are finally recognizing that grade inflation can only be curbed by policy supported from the top. 
 In my years of teaching at Boston University's School of Management, I refused to lie to students, and like it or not, B-plus or even B class averages are lies. Grade inflation not only constitutes false promises to students whose work is average or inferior, but it also demeans the accomplishments of students who truly excel.
Professors award high grades most often, I believe, to avoid having to deal with angry and self-righteous students and their parents. Over my strong objections one semester, the chairman of my department changed a student's F (32 out of a possible 105 points) to a passing grade. The justification? "Both of his parents are lawyers."
That student now holds the same degree as his peers who earned it.

HEADLINE: Must AIDS Infants Be Punished Too?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was disheartening to read of Jesse Helms's views of the victims of AIDS and his efforts to cut funds to the Ryan White Care Act of 1990 (news article, July 5). As medical director of a clinic for H.I.V.-positive children funded by the Ryan White Care Act, I see daily the positive impact these funds have on the lives of children with H.I.V./AIDS. 
 Ryan White funds help us provide H.I.V.-positive children with comprehensive medical and psychosocial services. The children have access to their doctor 24 hours a day, and we are able to decrease emergency room visits and hospitalization for them.
Senator Helms contends that funds should be cut because AIDS sufferers are responsible for their disease due to "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct."
Does he believe that these children are responsible for their disease through the act of being born, and therefore should suffer?
No one asks to be infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Most of the mothers of the children in my program were infected unknowingly through heterosexual sex and did not find out they were H.I.V.-infected until they were pregnant.
AIDS is the leading cause of death in children 1 to 4 years old in New York City. To consider cutting funds to such a devastating public health problem is not only heartless but also economically foolish. Without primary care programs these children will develop life-threatening infections, which could be easily prevented with medications.
I invite Mr. Helms to visit my program and see firsthand how the Ryan White dollars are being spent to improve the lives of these children.

HEADLINE: Inside Art

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:

Art for Profit
Buying art purely as an investment is an idea commonly frowned upon in the art world today. But 21 years ago, when the British Rail Pension Fund decided to invest 2.9 percent of its assets in Impressionist and Old Master paintings, Old Master drawings, Chinese and European works of art and antiquities, it was a downright scandal.
It was considered outrageous that railroad workers' money was being invested in something as elitist as art, and Sotheby's, the pension fund's adviser, was thought to have a conflict of interest because most of the art was bought at auction. 
 Over eight years, the pension fund paid about $64 million for 2,245 items. The fund later explained that its decision to invest in art was caused by the poor economic conditions at the time; it said that in addition to 30 percent annual inflation, "the London Stock Market had fallen heavily, creating huge losses on many investment portfolios; the property market had collapsed; many leading financial institutions were overstretched, and exchange controls and a higher dollar premium made it difficult to diversify overseas."
In 1987, British Rail began to sell its collections through Sotheby's. It has been auctioning slowly, and the latest sale was on Wednesday in London.
A group of 27 Old Master paintings, which were part of Sotheby's main Old Master paintings sale, performed well. They brought $8.2 million, above the auction house's $7.2 million top estimate. David Adams, who oversees the pension fund's investments, said he estimates that the sale performed at "inflation plus 3 percent, a shade under the average profits from our sales." But the results were about what was expected, he added, given the quality of the works and the current market.
Included in the auction were works that Old Master experts say reflect the safe buying patterns of the pension fund. Acquiring works for investment purposes, the fund's art experts were not adventurous, seeking paintings they thought would remain fashionable.
The results, on the whole, were successful. The biggest surprise was the price for Salomon van Ruysdael's "Haarlem 1600-1670" (1659), a dreamy scene of ships on the Waal River, which Sotheby's had estimated would sell for $318,000 to $477,000. Robert Noortman, a London dealer, bought it for $2.4 million. The price made a tidy profit for the fund, which paid only $406,000 for it in 1978 at a Sotheby's sale in Amsterdam. Another work that did exceptionally well was Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Bruegel the Younger's "Landscape With Pan and Syrinx" (1615), which sold to an unidentified buyer for $1.1 million. Sotheby's high estimate was $795,000.
But most of the works brought prices around their estimates and two works failed to sell. Even so, prices were far above what the pension fund had paid. "The Tiepolo Family," for example, an unfinished portrait whose estimate was $795,000 to $1.1 million, sold for $967,000. Despite some questions about attribution (some experts believe it was done by the younger Tiepolo brother, Lorenzo; others, including Sotheby's, attribute it to Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo), the work proved a good investment. The pension fund paid $175,000 for it in 1976 at Sotheby's in London.
The pension fund still has about a quarter of its collection. "Some antiquities and works of art are likely to be sold within the next year," Mr. Adams said. It still owns many Old Master paintings, about two sales' worth, one of which Mr. Adams said may take place at Sotheby's in New York in January.
 
The Tate Project
 The Tate Gallery in London is inching closer to realizing its goal of transforming the 100,000-square-foot Bankside Power Station on the South Bank of the Thames into the Tate Gallery of Modern Art. Stephen Dorrell, Britain's National Heritage secretary, has announced that the Tate is among the 83 applicants (out of 525) being seriously considered for a grant from the Millennium Fund, which is supported by Britain's new national lottery. The Tate could receive about $80 million, a nice start to raising the nearly $168.5 million needed for the new museum.
But a grant from the Millennium Fund is not a windfall without strings: the museum would be required to match the $80 million. Not surprisingly, Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, said he was talking to several potential donors.
"Most of the projects short-listed by the Millennium Fund were not arts but environmental ones," Mr. Serota said. But in many ways, the new Tate reflects aspects of both categories. The first national gallery to be built in Britain since the 19th century and London's first modern art museum, the project is also expected to help revitalize the run-down borough of Southwark. A marketing survey concluded that the new museum would attract about two million visitors a year and create about 2,400 new jobs.
The completion of Shakespeare's Globe Theater, which is to open next July next door to the new Tate, will also help revitalize the area. And the Manhattan Loft Company, a London-based developer, recently announced plans to convert a warehouse about 200 yards from the Tate into loftlike apartments.
 
A President Is Named
 As the Los Angeles County Museum of Art continues to search for a director, it has decided to take the same route as the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York: it has named a president and chief executive officer to work alongside the director. Andrea L. Rich, the executive vice chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, will fill the new post Nov. 1.
Her job will primarily be administration and raising money, leaving the curatorial responsibilities exclusively to the director. Museum officials hope the director's job, which has been vacant 22 months, will look more attractive to candidates now that the administrative and fund-raising tasks will be someone else's responsibility.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO ESTABLISH FULL HANOI LINKS, TOP OFFICIALS SAY

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Twenty years after the war in Vietnam ended, President Clinton has concluded that the time has come to establish full diplomatic relations with the former enemy and may announce the decision as early as next week, senior Administration officials said today.
The President has not yet signed a formal order granting Vietnam full diplomatic recognition, which would be the United States' most important step towards burying the bitterness of the Vietnam War. But Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, is completing a draft order recommending the policy change, which is expected to be presented to the President within the next few days. 
 In preparation for the announcement, the White House has drawn up a list of leading lawmakers and foreign leaders who will be informed as soon as the President makes his formal decision. White House officials have also begun to prepare arguments that can be used to explain why the move is a necessary step in a four-year process begun by the Bush Administration to provide the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing in the Vietnam War.
The Vietnamese Government has not yet been informed of the President's intentions, a senior Administration official said. Nor has the White House chosen a candidate to become the first United States Ambassador to Hanoi.
The move to establish full diplomatic relations, which has been endorsed by Mr. Clinton's senior diplomatic, military, economic and political advisers, comes after more than a year of debate within the Administration on whether Vietnam has cooperated fully in determining the fate of 1,619 United States service personnel who are still listed officially as missing in the war.
Indeed, The Administration has been steadily moving toward the decision for months, approving quiet visits aimed at resolving problems and broadening ties between Washington and Hanoi.
Diplomatic relations between the two countries will have a direct effect on American companies by allowing them to receive United States-sponsored financing and insurance that will help them do business in Vietnam.
Administration officials acknowledge that establishing full diplomatic relations with Vietnam would be a reward for its cooperation with the United States in releasing documents about missing servicemen and returning the remains of servicemen killed in Vietnam.
Moreover, they said, they hope increased contact with the Hanoi Government may make the Vietnamese even more forthcoming.
"We see this as the most effective way to meet our priority of getting the fullest possible accounting of those Americans missing from the Vietnam era," said one Administration official involved in the process. "Our experience shows that when you cooperate with Vietnam, you get more concrete results than if you just hold them at arm's length."
In establishing relations with Vietnam, Mr. Clinton will inevitably face intense opposition from conservatives and veterans groups, who contend that such a move would betray his past promises to the families of missing servicemen and Vietnam veterans.
Mr. Clinton also faced criticism when he decided in February 1994 to lift the 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam. But that response proved politically manageable and quickly died down -- particularly because the move was widely seen as advancing United States business interests in Southeast Asia.
There was even less political fallout when Mr. Clinton opened low-level diplomatic relations with Vietnam shortly afterward, allowing an official representative of Hanoi to open an office in Washington.
There continue to be political risks for a President who agonized 26 years ago over avoiding service in a war he said he "opposed and despised." In recent weeks, however, White House aides have concluded that these risks are outweighed by the fact that there may be a higher political price to pay if he refuses to establish relations.
Mr. Clinton has received support on the issue from three decorated war veterans in the Senate -- John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat; John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat.
The three senators are poised to introduce an amendment to the State Department Authorization Bill next week urging that the United States grant Vietnam full diplomatic recognition, a nonbinding resolution that is expected to pass. A McCain-Kerry resolution calling for an end to the trade embargo was approved in a bipartisan 62-to-38 vote in January 1994, paving the way for Mr. Clinton to lift the embargo the following month.
On the other hand, two Republicans -- Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire -- plan to introduce an amendment to the same legislation that would withhold financing for an Embassy in Vietnam.
Senator Dole, the leading Republican candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, is scheduled to be the main speaker later this summer at the annual meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, a group that rejects the Administration's assertions that Vietnam is cooperating on the issue.
As a candidate for President, Mr. Clinton told the national convention of the American Legion in 1992 that he would not move toward establishing relations until he received the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing in action.
When he formally announces his decision, the President is likely to praise Vietnam's increasing cooperation over the years. He gave a preview in remarks on Memorial Day while presenting a new postage stamp commemorating prisoners of war and those missing in action in Vietnam. At that time he said Hanoi had been more cooperative "than ever before." Of the effort to account for the missing, he said, "There is nothing like it in all the history of warfare."
Setting up ties wit Vietnam may make it possible for Secretary of State Warren Christopher to visit Vietnam when he travels to Asia at the end of the month to meet with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Vietnam is to join the group at this meeting, and Mr. Christopher wants to have the matter settled by then.
If Mr. Christopher then travels to Vietnam, he will be the first Secretary of State to visit the country since the American-backed Government in Saigon fell to Communist forces in 1975.
Publicly, Administration officials emphasized that Mr. Clinton had still not decided whether to establish relations, but was poised to make a decision soon. There is a reluctance to make such an announcement until veterans' groups and others opposed to the decision have been briefed.
"This is now a question that will shortly be before the President," the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today.
Mr. Burns said the Administration was still assessing new documents handed over recently by Hanoi concerning missing American servicemen. Last week the Defense Department called the recent case of documents the most informative to date on the outstanding cases.
 But those who advocate recognition have pushed Mr. Clinton to announce it as soon as possible, and not wait until the 1996 Presidential campaign gets any closer. Some of these advisers have also argued that Mr. Clinton should get ahead of the issue by acting before the Senate takes up the issue on the floor next week.

HEADLINE: Nikkei Surges On Rates News

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 7

 BODY:
Stocks surged today after the Bank of Japan said that it would push short-term interest rates lower in an effort to revive the economy.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 956.19 points, or 6.27 percent, at 16,213.08. Trading was heavy. On Thursday, the Nikkei rose 426.45 points, or 2.88 percent. 
 "It's an incredible market, stronger than I expected," said Shigeru Akiba, director of yen equity trading at UBS Securities.
Expectations of lower interest rates also helped the dollar surge against the yen. In late Asian trading, it was quoted at 85.70 yen, up from 84.96 in late New York trading on Thursady. The rise in the dollar prompted buying of shares of auto and electronics exporters, which led the stock market higher, traders said.
A weaker yen makes Japanese exports less expensive abroad.
Shares of export companies was also helped by optimism that lower interest rates in the United States would lead to more demand for goods from Japanese exporters.

HEADLINE: Japan, France and Canada Join the Assault on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 7

 BODY:
The Japanese central bank announced today that it would push interest rates lower in an effort to shore up the nation's faltering economy.
The Bank of Japan said it would let the overnight call rate, the rate for overnight loans between banks, fall below the discount rate. But the central bank said it had no plans to lower the discount rate, which is already at a record low of 1 percent. 
 Japanese stocks and bonds soared after the announcement as traders saw it as a sign that a rate cut was imminent.
"This is probably just a warm-up for a discount rate cut," said Chris Calderwood, an economist at BZW Securities here.
In April, the Bank of Japan made a similar announcement just before it cut the discount rate.
The move came after a wave of rate cuts on Thursday in Europe and North America. Both the French and Danish central banks cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
And after the Federal Reserve cut its target for the Federal fund rates to 5.75 percent, from 6 percent, the Bank of Canada followed suit, lowering the upper end of its overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.25 percent. Some banks in the United States and Canada lowered their prime rate.
But Kunio Kojima, a director of the Bank of Japan, said today that the announcement was unrelated to the Federal Reserve's rate cut.
"Today's decision is not intended to prepare for a cut in the discount rate," Mr. Kojima added.
After announcing its change in monetary policy, the central bank added 300 billion yen, or $3.52 billion, to the banking system, pushing down the overnight loan rate. The rate fell as low as 0.85 percent, brokers said.
Lower interest rates could provide a jump-start to Japan's sluggish economy, analysts said.
"It's not the answer to everything but it's a welcome development," Mr. Calderwood at BZW Securities said. "It's not going to change the currency much and it's not going to change the structural problems that plaque the Japanese economy. But it's just a pain killer that makes the adjustment easier."
While the Bank of Japan said in its statement that it still saw forces that support a recovery, the economy was "somewhat at a standstill."
In France, the nation's newly independent central bank on Thursday lowered the 5-to-10-day bank credit, which sets the ceiling for money market rates to 7.25 percent from 7.50 percent.
It was the second slight easing in French monetary policy since the May presidential elections and was widely interpreted as a response to the package of spending cuts, tax increases and steps to increase employment that the Government of President Jacques Chirac announced on June 22.
The new rate cut was foreshadowed earlier in the week by the governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet, who in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde gave a cautious welcome to the Government's mini-budget. His statement also signaled an end to the disagreement that surfaced between Mr. Trichet and Mr. Chirac during the presidential campaign, when Mr. Chirac seemed prepared to abandon France's traditional policy of keeping the franc in lock-step with the German mark to reduce inflation and reinforce its political alliance with Germany.

HEADLINE: Sales Tax Is Wrong Bailout for Orange County

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Orange County's Threat to Us All" (editorial, July 2) chided the voters of California's Orange County ("a very wealthy area") with "arrogance" because they rejected an increase in the sales tax to 8.25 percent. The increase was the centerpiece of a plan making up for losses incurred by County Treasurer Robert Citron's rogue trading in the derivatives market. You explained that the "outrageous" outcome of this vote was due to an "anti-tax ideology," which threatens "the very concept of government as a shared enterprise with benefits for all." 
 Political economists would view the matter differently. Sales taxes are the most regressive taxes yet devised: only the relatively well-to-do pay income and real estate taxes, but even the poorest of the poor have to pay sales taxes. Worse still, sales taxes bite further into the incomes of the poor because they spend a greater portion of their incomes on items subject to sales tax.
The only virtue of the sales tax is that it's easy to collect. Its appeal to those who view government as an equitable enterprise is nil.
As it happens, New York City (also "a very wealthy area") went through an experience similar to Orange County's 20 years ago. New York's bankruptcy was averted by, strange to say, an increase in the sales tax.
Did the voters of New York City humbly vote for this increase? No, it was imposed upon them by their State Legislature.
Would the voters of New York City have approved it if they'd been allowed to vote on it? I think not.

Unemployment Falls As Job Market Grows
The job market showed surprising strength in June as employers added 215,000 payroll jobs, and the unemployment rate eased to 5.6 percent. 
 Still, there were pockets of weakness. Factory jobs dropped 40,000, the third straight sizable decline. Such unevenness blunted the second-guessing by some analysts of the Federal Reserve's decision Thursday to cut short-term interest rates. [Page 1.]
 
By a quirk of the calendar, the Fed's Open Market Committee on Thursday missed knowing by a few hours the details of the unemployment report. [36.]
 
Employment figures for the New York-New Jersey region were stagnant. The jobless rate for New York State fell to 5.9 percent, and the City's slipped to 8.1 percent. New Jersey's rate edged up to 6.6 percent. [36.]
 
Dow Quickly Tops Milestone, Jumps 146.63 for the Week
Just two days after topping 4,600, the Dow industrials soared past 4,700, as the market enjoyed its best week since last August. The average closed at 4,702.73, up 38.73 points for the day and 146.63 points for the week. Technology and banking stocks rose. [37.]
 
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 6.52 percent, from 6.49 percent, as some traders took profits. Many doubted the Fed would cut interest rates again soon. [46.]
 
Stocks Surge in Japan
Tokyo stock prices jumped 6.3 percent, with the Nikkei index closing at 16,213.08. The market was lifted by an unexpected cut in interest rates and investor hopes for stronger measures to revive the economy. [35.]
 
Mexican Stocks Rise Again
The Mexican stock market has regained most of the ground it lost after the peso devaluation in December. Some big international funds are buying again, although stock values in dollar terms are still deflated. [34.]
 
I.B.M. Forms New Division
I.B.M. said it would create a division responsible for expanding the company's offerings to consumers, bringing multimedia computers and desktop software under one roof. The company's shares traded above $100 for the first time in nearly three years, reaching $100.625 before closing at $99.50, up 62.5 cents. [34.]
 
Music Channel Plan Dropped
A tentative plan to start a rival music cable channel to MTV has been dropped by five of the biggest music companies, including Time Warner, Sony, and Thorn EMI. The decision was attributed in part to the dismissal of Robert Morgado as chairman of Warner Music. He was seen as the chief mover behind the plan. [36.]
 
Coors Extends Benefits
Coors Brewing will offer full benefits to the unmarried domestic partners of employees, whether gay or straight. The new policy allows employees to add unmarried, live-in partners to health and life insurance policies, pensions and other benefits. [34.]
 
Nextel Approves McCaw Stake
Nextel shareholders approved a $1.1 billion investment by Craig McCaw of cellular fame and his family to buy wireless licenses from Motorola and a merger with Onecomm. [35.]
 
Greenpeace Shows Its Reach
Greenpeace won a major victory when it got Royal Dutch/Shell to drop its plan to sink an old oil platform in the North Atlantic. The scope of the Shell campaign also reflects the financial strength of the group. In two months it spent more than $1 million on communications and equipment, including chartered boats and helicopters. [3.]
 
Latin America Tied to Cuba
Latin America has increasingly ignored the U.S. trade embargo of Cuba. Mexico is Cuba's largest foreign investor, and the Americas supply half of Cuba's imports and a quarter of the island's foreign tourists. [1.]
 
Coffee Up on Export Limit
Coffee prices rose on signs that Brazil was set to limit exports as part of an effort by Latin American producers to force prices higher. On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the contract for September delivery jumped 8.8 cents, to $1.2985 a pound. [43.]

HEADLINE: Rate Setters Miss Data, Just Barely

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
While Federal Reserve officials were meeting Thursday morning to decide whether to cut short-term interest rates, another agency was quietly putting the finishing touches on the most important set of monthly economic figures published by the Government.
By a quirk of the calendar, the central bank's Open Market Committee missed knowing by a few hours that the Labor Department would report today that employers' payrolls expanded by 215,000 in June and that the unemployment rate edged lower. 
 Despite the Fed's likely frustration, officials insist that no effort was made to depart from normal practice. This meant that the Bureau of Labor Statistics sent the report in midafternoon by encrypted fax to the Council of Economic Advisers, which relayed the information to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, alone. The Fed's announcement was made at 2:15.
"They would not have seen these data," Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said flatly this morning. And if the Fed had tried to get an early peek, the B.L.S. would have refused to respond or even accept a call on the subject, she said. It is all part of jealously guarding the integrity of the statistical system, to insure that market participants and others do not take advantage of advance information for political or financial gain.
There was one exception. The staffs of both the Fed and the Labor Department have more leeway about sharing preliminary data. Sometime on Wednesday, Fed economists were given partial figures, on employment in manufacturing, mining and utilities.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rates Little Changed in Region

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
While the national job market showed signs of strength yesterday, employment figures for the New York-New Jersey region were largely stagnant.
The unemployment rate for New York State fell to 5.9 percent in June from 6.3 percent in May. But New Jersey's unemployment rate rose to 6.6 percent from 6.5 percent, and New York City's rate slipped to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent. The national rate fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.7 percent. The number of people on payrolls remained steady in both states. 
 John L. Wieting, the new regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, said the two states continued in a holding pattern as they lagged behind the national economic recovery. But he also saw some cause for optimism.
"While the economy in New York and New Jersey isn't moving ahead, there aren't any signs either of further weakening," Mr. Wieting (pronounced WEE-ting) said. "There were fears that a slowdown in the national picture, such as occurred in the first two months of the second quarter, might have serious adverse impacts here. And I think that it's somewhat of a silver lining that we didn't see any further weakening of the situation."
Employment figures for Connecticut were not available yesterday. It is not among the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases the national jobs data each month.
Mr. Wieting noted that the 5.9 percent unemployment rate in New York State in June returned the state to where it was at the beginning of the year.
And, he added, the downward movement reflected in the latest rate was an indication of lower labor market activity, meaning that fewer New York State residents were seeking jobs.
"There was no growth in the number of employed," he said. The number was 7.9 million in June, about what it has been in recent months.
Similarly, in New Jersey, the number of employed held steady at 3.9 million.
In New York City, he said, "you've got an economy that is basically flat, and it's not moving ahead."
"While the nation has to date recovered well more than the jobs it lost during the last recession, in this region we haven't made up the losses that we saw."
Mr. Wieting said that the biggest industries in the region, like financial services and particularly banking, were still going through restructuring and consolidation. And, he added, manufacturing jobs are still being lost.
Mr. Wieting said the number of employed New York City residents totaled 2.9 million in June. That is about the same number as has prevailed through the first half of 1995.

HEADLINE: Leading Academic Hospital, Squeaking by, Seeks Merger

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Convinced that it cannot survive on its own in a medical marketplace racked by budget cuts and dominated by managed care, Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city's leading academic hospitals, is actively looking to merge with another medical center.
Executives at Presbyterian, the hospital at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, have begun discussions with two other leading centers, the New York Hospital and New York University Hospital, and hope to cement a partnership within a year, said Dr. William Speck, President of Presbyterian. 
 Presbyterian officials say the affiliation is critical because despite an aggressive campaign to hold down costs, they are barely getting by. And they face further financial troubles as they struggle with Medicare cuts and the rise of competition brought on by managed care.
Even as the hospital courts a partner, the equally acclaimed medical school affiliated with it for the last 65 years, Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, is independently considering joining with another school. Doctor Herbert Pardes, dean of the medical school, says it is facing economic pressures of its own, partly as a result of the hospital's problems. Medical schools are heavily subsidized by payments from their allied teaching hospitals, and when an academic hospital's revenues are threatened, programs at its medical school are often early casualties.
These changes reflect increasing turmoil in a hospital industry desperately trying to cope with demands for cheaper, more efficient care. Those demanding the changes are Federal and state governments, insurance companies and, most important, the increasingly powerful health maintenance organizations that are spreading across the country.
The mergers of major hospitals in New York would mirror a trend in other cities, where health maintenance organizations have gained a significant market share. It would also fulfill the predictions of health economists who have long argued that New York City has too many hospital beds.
Dr. Speck said that merging two hospitals could result in great savings. They would be able to consolidate departments duplicated at both centers, for example, ending up with a cardiology department at one of the hospitals and a neurosurgery department at the other.
Billing, purchasing and laundry service could be combined as well, he said.
These changes are likely to lead to some layoffs, continuing a decline in the city's health care industry, which has been one of its most vital.
"This year," Dr. Speck said, "we realized that in order to compete, our only acceptable option was to merge with another academic health care center. And we've been talking to everyone who would listen."

 Officials of the two possible partners acknowledged that there were preliminary discussions but declined to give details.
Presbyterian is considering this radical change even though it has undertaken a drastic and largely successful program to reorganize and streamline its operations over the last two years, as a way to improve its perennially precarious financial picture.
Its executives have dramatically decreased the time patients spend in the hospital, so much so that the average maternity patient now stays only 36 hours, far less time than at most New York City hospitals. And with shorter stays, it has been able to eliminate more than one-third of its 1,000 hospital beds.
At the same time, Presbyterian has significantly broadened its patient base. It has forged relationships with a half-dozen community hospitals in the suburbs, and allied itself with community medical groups as well as foreign-trained primary-care doctors practicing in Harlem and Washington Heights. .
But the financial gains of these moves have been offset by huge cuts in Medicaid and the state budget, as well as the uncertainty of funding from Medicare and from the National Institutes of Health, the Federal agency that finances major medical research projects. Revenues have also been hurt by the unexpectedly swift rise of H.M.O.'s, which demand deep discounts from hospitals for care.
"If the Medicare cuts and market changes are as great as we anticipate," Dr. Speck said, "simple re-engineering will not be enough. We've closed beds and changed from R.N.'s to the less expensive L.P.N.'s, and we think if we don't do anything beyond that we couldn't compete on cost and would be dead in the water." R.N.'s are registered nurses, and L.P.N.'s are licensed practical nurses.
By all accounts, mergers of prestigious hospitals are likely to be fraught with internal political peril. It would be hard to combine neurosurgery departments, for example, when each considers itself among the best in the city.
The basic problem for Presbyterian as well as the other academic centers in New York is that they are expensive places to care for the average patient. They have vast arsenals of advanced medical machines that are costly to maintain, and they have traditionally charged patients higher prices to subsidize the teaching and research they regard as essential to their mission.
The sophisticated technology -- from positron emission scanners to molecular genetics labs -- is largely irrelevant to the care of a patient who has simple pneumonia. And insurers, particularly H.M.O.'s, have little interest in subsidizing all the equipment.
So the region's H.M.O.'s are now demanding deep discounts from the academic centers. And many are referring their patients to smaller, cheaper hospitals with lower overhead.
On top of problems that span the industry, Columbia-Presbyterian must overcome the fact that it is located in a poor neighborhood in Washington Heights. Its principal competitors in New York City -- New York Hospital, New York University Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center -- all sit in neighborhoods filled with paying patients. But Presbyterian's location means that most local customers are covered by Medicaid or not covered at all. Moreover, many affluent patients are reluctant to go there.
As a result, Columbia-Presbyterian is disproportionately affected by the cuts in Medicaid and Medicare. Thirty-eight percent of Columbia-Presbyterian's patients are on Medicaid; it is the largest Medicaid provider in the state. Twenty-six percent of its patients are covered by Medicare; it is the second-largest Medicare provider in the country.
Doctors at Presbyterian and at the medical school say they are ambivalent about the aggressive campaign to establish financial stability for the future, complaining that their workloads have been expanded in the effort to hold down costs. Doctors-in-training who say they came to Columbia to learn cutting-edge medicine, express resentment at being sent to work at the community hospitals that are Columbia-Presbyterian's latest affiliates.
As a doctor who completed his training last month put it, "The primary concern is not how are we best going to train the next generation of internists, but how are we going to pay the bills?" He spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
Although Dr. Speck acknowledges that physicians now face a more rigorous workload, he says it is the price of survival, adding: "We're asking the housekeepers to sweep more floors and the dietary people to deliver more trays. Now it's the physicians' turn." He said that state regulations on how many hours a resident can work -- known as the Bell Commission laws -- might have to be bent to create greater efficiencies.
The academic centers that Dr. Speck has tried to woo are circumspect about the prospects.
Paul Macielak, vice president and vice provost of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said, "The medical center has had and continues to have discussions with Columbia-Presbyterian." But he added that the discussions were not about "formal mergers in the legalistic sense" but about other types of joint ventures and business relationships.
Theresa Bischoff, executive vice president and deputy provost of the New York University Medical Center, said: "In light of changes in the health care environment there are many conversations going on between various medical centers, including continuing discussions between Columbia-Presbyterian and N.Y.U."
Health economists have predicted that the struggle for survival over the next five years will result in numerous hospital closings in New York and that Columbia-Presbyterian might well number among the extinct.
But Dr. Speck insists that despite its financial problems, Presbyterian, in its new, more cost-effective incarnation, would make an attractive partner. .
"People look at our neighborhood and go 'yuck,' " he said. "But frankly, 500,000 people live here who have nowhere else to go, and if we can capture their business we can succeed."

HEADLINE: Slide From Riches for Landlord in Happy Land Case

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The building housing the Happy Land Social Club, where 87 people died in a 1990 arson fire, was owned by Alexander DiLorenzo 3d, scion of a real estate empire that at one time put him in the same league as Donald Trump or other New York tycoons. But lawyers for the victims who filed suit over the tragedy, which was caused in part by conditions in the building, found Mr. DiLorenzo so deeply enmeshed in financial problems that they gave up on seeking damages from him.
 "If we had gone after DiLorenzo, we would have spent 5 or 10 years trying to to figure where his money was, or if there was any left," said Paul E. Bleifer, who represented the families of 17 of the victims. 
 The story of Mr. DiLorenzo, whose holdings were once valued at $1.2 billion but who is now mired in bankruptcy, is marked with a series of failed investments, foreclosures, tax problems and a string of lawsuits -- including one by his own brother and sister.
 While many details of his finances are unclear -- he and his lawyer declined to be interviewed -- it appears that his financial fall was precipitated by unsuccessful purchases of distressed buildings, large losses in the commodities market and the fallout from the recession.
 On Thursday, lawyers for the Happy Land victims and their families agreed to a $15.8 million settlement of all claims stemming from the fire in East Tremont, the Bronx. The settlement, providing an average of $163,000 for each family or injured victim, was far less than the total of $5 billion that they had originally sought, and a tiny amount compared to the awards in some other high-profile wrongful death cases.
 Although lawyers for the Happy Land plaintiffs said they were handicapped in many ways, one of the chief roadblocks in winning large damage awards was the dire financial condition of Mr. DiLorenzo, they said. "In the end, we had a gun to our heads," said Susan Karten, who represented five of the families. "We saw what was going on with DiLorenzo, and did what we could."
 In 1975, along with his brother and sister -- Marc and Lisa -- Mr. DiLorenzo inherited a portfolio of more than 200 New York City buildings and commercial lots from his father, the late Alexander DiLorenzo Jr. The elder Mr. DiLorenzo had assembled his holdings in a partnership with the late Sol Goldman, a developer.
 The properties included some of Manhattan's most valuable. The choicest were a parcel of land under the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South; other lots under prominent buildings on Wall Street, Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue; and an entire block of Greek Revival brick houses facing Washington Square Park.
 Alexander DiLorenzo 3d, known as Alex, was named in his father's estate as head of the family real estate trust. He immediately set an eccentric course among the city's major landowners and investors, several people in the real estate industry said. As far back as 1990, one real-estate broker, speaking in an interview on condition of anonymity, summed it up: "Alex buys funny things."
 Mr. DiLorenzo's financial problems appear to have culminated on Aug. 20, 1993, when court records show that some real estate assets owned by himself and his family trust were ordered liquidated under an involuntary bankruptcy filing. That bankruptcy filing was cited by several of the lawyers for the Happy Land victims' families as their biggest impediment in collecting damages from Mr. DiLorenzo.
 The current status of Mr. DiLorenzo's finances was unclear yesterday, and he declined comment through his lawyer. "In view of ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate for Mr. Alexander DiLorenzo 3d or his counsel to make comment at this time," said his lawyer, Carl R. Hollander.
 Nor was it clear exactly what finally precipitated the bankruptcy case. But according to court records reaching back into the 1980's, and people in the real estate industry, Mr. DiLorenzo's financial problems began to accumulate long before the Happy Land fire.
 A private man, who has always sought to avoid publicity and rarely has socialized with others among New York's elite real estate families, Mr. DiLorenzo set a course soon after receiving his inheritance that diverged sharply from most other large real estate investors.
 Instead of investing in well-established and highly valuable Manhattan lots and buildings, as his father had, he bought block after block of fading apartment houses on Riverside Drive in Harlem, dozens of buildings in the Bronx and other properties in blighted sections of the city.
 From 1975 to 1985 -- a time when a real estate boom bestowed fortunes on others who invested in the most sought after areas of Manhattan -- Mr. DiLorenzo's newly acquired properties lanquished.
 Then, in October 1988, he was sued by his brother and sister, who sought to wrest control of 250 properties, which court papers at the time valued at $1.2 billion. The lawsuit charged him with "squandering" the family's holdings, and alleged that Mr. DiLorenzo had borrowed heavily against the trust's real estate to speculate in the commodities market. In one year, 1988, he had lost $21.8 million, according to financial records submitted in the lawsuit.
 The suit "goes so far as to claimed that Alex is pursuing a 'scorched earth policy,' " said the presiding judge in the case, Justice Harold Baer Jr. of State Supreme Court. But the judge refused to remove him as head of the family trust, and ordered the DiLorenzo siblings to work out the differences among themselves.
Since then, records in State Supreme Court, bankruptcy and other courts show that the problems facing Mr. DiLorenzo have multiplied.
 In 1991, hurt by a deep recession in the New York City real estate market, he and the DiLorenzo family trust were sued in a foreclosure proceeding by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency responsible for dealing with the assets of failed thrift institutions.
 At the time, Resolution Trust and the B.R.T. Realty Trust Company, based in Great Neck, held a $68 million mortgage on properties controlled by Mr. DiLorenzo, who had missed three monthly payments. The outcome of the 1991 foreclosure suit could not be determined last night.
 Other legal problems followed, leaving the court records replete with judgments against Mr. DiLorenzo for failure to pay his lawyers and creditors, to make timely payment of mortgage loans and to pay his taxes. From 1989 to 1992, the judgments totaled over $3 million.
 Lawyers representing the Happy Land fire victims said yesterday that they had been unable to sort through the complexities of Mr. DiLorenzo's financial problems, but had concluded that they were so severe that trying to collect damages from him would have been futile.
 Even determining what lawyers have represented Mr. DiLorenzo in his various legal tussles has proved daunting, they said.
 One of the lawyers for the victims, Jay Weinstein, said, "DiLorenzo is someone who goes through more lawyers in a week than I go through underwear."

HEADLINE: PAYROLLS SWELLED BY 215,000 IN JUNE; JOBLESS RATE FELL

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The job market perked up in June as employers added 215,000 payroll jobs while the unemployment rate edged down slightly to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
Despite a stronger overall performance than most analysts expected, there were some pockets of weakness. Factory jobs -- which tend to be better paying than most -- dropped 40,000, the third straight sizable decline. Such unevenness blunted the second-guessing by some analysts and investors of the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday to reverse course and cut short-term interest rates for the first time since 1992. The Fed acted before it was fully aware of the latest report, which suggested that the current economic slowdown is unlikely to turn into a recession. 
 Still, many economists say they expect the Fed to cut rates further, though not necessarily right away.
"It is incumbent on the Fed to support confidence of consumers who retain jobs so that spending does not start to slip again," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at CS First Boston in New York. "Another interest rate cut will be part of the process."
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan, apparently responding to the Fed's quarter-point cut, trimmed its own already low short-term interest rates and joined with the United States in a coordinated effort to support the dollar on the world's currency markets. [Page 17.]
Lower American rates tend to make the dollar less attractive. And without a comparable move by Tokyo, they would have tended to push the yen still higher, making Japanese goods more expensive in world markets.
The dollar surged, as did stock markets in this country, but interest rates moved modestly higher as some traders concluded that another rate cut was not imminent at the Fed's next rate-setting meeting in August.
The White House called the labor-market report, which included revived growth in the dominant services sector, "a welcome sign" that the economy's abrupt slackening this spring will not worsen.
"While too many working families are still struggling, the current economic slowdown is likely to be temporary," Joseph E. Stiglitz, recently elevated to chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
The Government's report late this month on total output of goods and services is expected to show scarcely any economic growth -- and possibly a slight decline -- for the quarter that ended last week. Gross domestic product advanced at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1995 and at a 5.1 percent rate in the final quarter of 1994 -- the kind of torrid growth the Fed had in mind when it engineered a series of interest rate increases over the last 18 months to forestall inflation.
But private analysts tend to agree with the Clinton Administration that the economy may have already bottomed out, with excess inventories now pared enough to spark resumed growth.
"We've probably already moved out of the decelerating phase of the expansion and are back into moderate growth," said Joel L. Naroff, senior vice president and chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia.
In California, where the job market improved significantly last month, John O. Wilson, chief economist for the Bank of America, agreed, predicting a 2 percent growth rate for the nation in the second half of the year. The jobless rate in California retreated to 7.6 percent in June from 8.5 percent in May.
The expansion of payrolls by 215,000 in June was about twice that of the consensus prediction and was in addition to upward revisions for both April and May that showed the job market had not been as weak this spring as had been thought at the time.
May's job shrinkage is now put at 46,000 instead of 101,000, while April's 7,000 decline was transformed into a gain of 8,000.
On the other hand, the June survey period was later in the month than is typical, and the additional time to capture workers in the statistical net swelled the gain by 50,000 to 100,000, according to a rough estimate by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
After two months of relatively sluggish growth, service jobs climbed 114,000 to move back into line with the trend during the current business expansion. The amusement and recreation sector was particularly strong, but sizable gains were also posted in engineering and management services and in health services.
Construction, aided by drier weather, added 42,000 jobs, partly recouping declines in April and May, but the temporary help category showed little change for a second straight month and remained down by 57,000 since February. State and local governments added 35,000 jobs last month.
The separate household survey, which the Labor Department relies on to calculate the unemployment rate, reflects a strikingly large divergence from the job data provided by the payroll tally. After a 926,000 decline in May followed by a feeble 58,000 rise last month, the number of people with jobs, or actively looking for them, averaged 179,000 fewer in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.
Since employment, as measured by the household survey, also fell in the quarter, the jobless rate has not risen. In fact, it eased in June by a second straight one-tenth of a point.
Although there were no big swings among demographic groups, a rise in the jobless rate for blacks, combined with a lower rate for Hispanic workers, returned the two groups to a more traditional relationship. In May, for the first time in two decades, the Hispanic jobless rate, at 10 percent, was slightly higher than the black rate.
Geographically, unemployment in the West fell five-tenths of a point, to 6.6 percent, last month while the rate in the Midwest fell three-tenths of a point, to 4.3 percent. But the rate edged up to 6 percent from 5.9 in the Northeast and to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in the South, the department also found.
Among the most populous states, the only significant changes were a 1.4-point drop in the jobless rate for Illinois, to 4.1 percent, and California's improvement of nine-tenths of a point. The jobless rate in New York fell to 5.9 percent, from 6.3 percent in May, while the rate inched up in New Jersey to 6.6 percent from 6.5.
Mr. Wilson of the Bank of America said the June rise of 54,000 payroll jobs for California, whose recovery has lagged behind the national rebound by two years or more, was one of the biggest in recent memory.
Still another element of today's report was a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in average hourly earnings, a development that troubled some analysts still worried about potential inflationary pressures. But Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, dismissed the move as inconsequential.
"I don't see any sign of wage-price pressure," he said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Japan Joins U.S. to Block Fall by Dollar

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Seeking to prevent the Federal Reserve's Thursday interest-rate reduction from weakening the dollar, the Japanese Government pushed down interest rates slightly in Tokyo today and then intervened in American currency markets with the United States to prop up the dollar.
The combined effect was a sharp rise in the dollar's value against the yen, as many traders concluded that Washington and Tokyo were more closely coordinating their economic policies and would prevent any further fall in the dollar. In late trading, the dollar had surged 1.80 yen, to 86.76 yen to the dollar. 
 The Japanese stock market soared in response to reduced interest rates, with the most widely watched index rising more than 6 percent. [Page 34.]
The dollar was also up against other currencies, although not so sharply. It was at 1.3925 marks today from 1.3787 marks late Thursday, to 1.1580 Swiss francs from 1.1427 and to $1.5951 to the British pound, compared with $1.6007 on Thursday.
David F. DeRosa, the director of foreign exchange trading in the New York offices of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said the United States and Japan appeared to have coordinated their interest rate cuts because "they both happened within hours and were followed by an intervention in which those two intervened and nobody else."
A Treasury spokeswoman confirmed that the intervention had been coordinated with the United States. "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York operated in exchange markets on behalf of Treasury and the Federal Reserve System, jointly with Japanese monetary authorities," the spokeswoman said.
Still, it was unclear whether the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had coordinated their interest rate cuts. Bank of Japan officials denied any coordination, Bloomberg Business News reported. The Federal Reserve declined comment.
Not even Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, could have known for sure in advance whether the Fed's top rate-setting panel would vote as it did to shave a quarter of a percentage point off its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans.
And when central banks have coordinated interest rate reductions, the central bank of the country with the stronger currency has traditionally gone first. A rate reduction tends to weaken a country's currency by reducing the return on investments.
But Mr. Greenspan did attend a meeting on June 11 in Basel, Switzerland, at the headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements, a secretive agency sometimes referred to as the central bank of central banks. The heads of other big central banks attended the same meeting and in the past have exchanged detailed hints at these meetings of their future policies. Indeed, central bankers have sometimes told each other more in Basel than they say about their plans to treasury or finance ministry officials in their own countries.
In any case, the Federal Reserve's rate reduction clearly put Japanese authorities in a difficult position by potentially undermining the dollar and strengthening the yen. The yen's sharp rise this year has already limited Japanese exports and restrained the country's emergence from five years of economic stagnation.
The Bank of Japan responded today by announcing that it was adding money to the Japanese financial system, driving down the interest rate for overnight loans among banks. This interest rate hit a record low of 0.75 percent before recovering to 1.06 percent -- still down from 1.24 percent on Thursday.
William R. Cline, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research group here, said, "The Japanese economy remains extremely weak -- the United States' cutting the interest rate is sort of an ideal time for Japan to cut its rate."
Conspicuously absent in today's currency market intervention and in this week's rate reductions was Germany's central bank. Despite some recent signs of weakness in the German economy, the powerful Bundesbank has been reluctant to cut interest rates because of lingering signs that German inflation may not fully be under control.
Yet many officials in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been irritated by the United States' willingness until now to let the dollar slide, which has made American goods cheaper and more competitive in European markets.
The American and Japanese rate cuts will put pressure on the Bundesbank to follow suit when its top rate-setting panel meets next Thursday. But Kevin J. Lawrie, a foreign exchange manager at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said, "The Germans don't like to be pressured by outside sources -- they'll adjust their monetary policies as and when they see fit."
The United States and Japan limited their intervention to trades involving the dollar and the yen, but the dollar's rise against the yen dragged the dollar's exchange rate up against the German mark as well, traders said.
Stephen Flanagan, a currency trader in the New York offices of Credit Agricole, estimated that the United States and Japan each swapped about $250 million worth of yen for dollars today. That is a modest amount by currency intervention standards.
But the dollar, nonetheless, surged for three reasons, Mr. Flanagan added. The United States and Japan appeared to be cooperating closely. Currency traders were taken by surprise. And the dollar was already rising even before the intervention, in response to a Labor Department report this morning that employment rose strongly in the United States last month.

HEADLINE: Gulliver's Japanese Travels;
Hitting the (Narrow) Road in Two U.S. Behemoths

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 7

 BODY:
The attendant, his eyes squinting and his head cocked to one side, peered at the car from the front. He walked around to the back and peered at it from there. He consulted with a co-worker.
Then he crossed his arms in front of him to form an "X." The Cadillac Concours was not going to be allowed into his department store parking lot. 
 As the driver, I protested indignantly that the lot was closed to American cars. No, the attendant replied, the car was simply too wide. The elevator that carries automobiles to the upper floors of the garage is only 5 feet 9 inches wide. The Cadillac, I later checked, was about 8 inches wider than that.
The question of the Cadillac's width has a new relevance, if partly symbolic. Now that the United States and Japan have reached a trade agreement to open the Japanese market, will some American vehicles still be locked out because, as Japanese officials have long contended, they are too big or too fat or otherwise ill suited for that market?
To get to the bottom of this billion-dollar question, I drove a couple of American cars around Tokyo for 10 days.
Besides the Cadillac, chosen because it is the archetypal big American luxury car, I also drove a Ford Explorer XL, typical of the sport utility vehicles that are popular in the United States and, increasingly, in Japan.
While far from doing a scientific survey, I found many situations in which these cars, built for the American open road, seemed decidedly out of place.
During those 10 days, I was denied access to a couple of parking lots and had trouble parking in others. I saw crowds of pedestrians part in awe -- or was it scatter in terror? -- as my burly Cadillac or powerful Explorer plowed down narrow shopping streets. And I drew dirty looks from other drivers when I blocked traffic, trying -- but failing -- to make narrow turns on residential side streets.
Still, over all, it was possible to take the cars almost everywhere, and the rides were comfortable.
First, the issue of steering wheels. Typical of American vehicles sold here, the Cadillac and the Explorer had steering wheels on the left. In Japan, where people drive on the left side of the road, the wheel is usually on the right.
I found the left-side steering wheels to be no problem when driving or passing other cars. In fact, in some ways, I found it easier than having the wheel on the right.
Driving in Tokyo is like running a slalom. Except on main roads, there are no sidewalks. Pedestrians, utility poles and parked cars jut out from the left, forcing cars to weave around them. Sitting on the left side of the car, I found it easier to keep track of these obstacles.
The main difficulty with left-side driving was in paying tolls or leaving parking lots, because the booths are invariably on the right.
It did not take long to encounter the problem: To get the Cadillac out of the parking garage near General Motors' offices, I had to open a gate by holding up an electronic card against a detector -- on the right side of the car. I had to shift into park, slide across the seat and stick my hand with the card outside the window, then slide back and start the car before the gate went down again.
Fortunately, to help make the task of paying tolls easier, both Ford and G.M. equipped the cars with coin holders next to the driver's seat. Unfortunately, the coin holders were designed for American coins. They could not hold the big 500-yen coins, which are needed because even a short trip on a Tokyo expressway costs 700 yen, or about $8.25.
It is not that the companies have ignored adapting their cars. Masato Fukui, manager of engineering and quality control at the Japanese unit of the Ford Motor Company, ticked off more than 15 changes made in the Explorer to conform to Japanese regulations or to make the cars more suitable for the Japanese market.
These included installing retractable side-view mirrors to help the cars fit into tight spaces, and having the dashboard gauges labeled in kilometers instead of miles. To meet Japanese regulations, Ford has changed the tailpipe so it points straight backward instead of diagonally backward and installed turn signals on the sides of the front and rear fenders.
Except for the entry-level XL, the Explorers sold in Japan also come with running boards to help the shorter Japanese climb into them. "For a Japanese lady wearing a kimono, it's almost impossible to climb up into that high-floor vehicle," Mr. Fukui said.
Yoshikazu Hojoh, who is in charge of adapting G.M. cars for Japan, said more than 30 revisions had been made in the Cadillac. But somehow both companies did not change the coin holders, simple pieces of plastic that no doubt could have been obtained from any number of Japanese vendors.
The most obvious characteristic of the American vehicles is their size. Parked side by side with Japanese cars at a restaurant, the Cadillac stuck out like a basketball player in a room full of jockeys.
The Concours is big, even when compared with Japanese luxury cars. The 1995 Concours is 17 feet 7 inches long and 6 feet 5 inches wide. The Toyota Lexus LS 400 is 16 feet 5 inches long and 6 feet wide.
Detroit offers some vehicles here that are smaller than the Cadillac and Explorer, but are hardly subcompacts. Cars that analysts say might fit well, like Chrysler's Neon and G.M.'s Saturn, are not sold here yet, though they will be. There are no American-made cars sold here by the Big Three with engine sizes smaller than 2 liters, even though such cars account for 80 percent of the market.
When I first brought home the Explorer, my wife, Kasumi, who is Japanese, looked out the window at it and practically screamed.
"I'm so embarrassed!" she exclaimed. In Japan, people do not like to call attention to themselves, and she was afraid that the neighbors would see this monstrosity sitting in front of the house. "This is terrible," she said.
In reality, though, it wasn't. If any neighbors noticed, no one said a word. (Even if you call attention to yourself, many people will pretend not to pay attention.) And my wife soon realized that there were many Japanese vehicles of similar size and shape on the roads.
Moreover, once she managed to climb into the Explorer -- our model lacked the running board -- she found it comfortable.
The Explorer's problem was not its length as much as its height. That prevented entry into one parking lot that used an elevator rather than ramps to move cars in and out. This type of garage is common in narrow buildings in Japan.
But many Japanese vehicles also have a height problem. Mitsubishi Motors' Pajero, the leader among Japanese sport utility vehicles, can be a little taller, at about 6 feet 2 inches, versus 5 feet 9 inches for the Explorer. The Pajero, however, is not as long or wide as the Ford.
The Explorer, with a 4-liter engine, is listed at 3.295 million yen, or about $38,700. A similarly equipped Pajero, with a 3-liter engine, sells for 3.438 million yen, or $40,400. Ford sold 1,877 Explorers in Japan last year. A right-hand-drive model is scheduled to reach the market here before the end of the year.
Parked in a neighborhood frequented by young people, the dark-green Explorer drew some good reviews. "Compared with Japanese cars, it looks tough," a college student said. Another student was able to identify the vehicle by sight as an Explorer.
Hajime Hatanaka, a businessman, said, "I like the way it looks." But he added, "I don't have that much interest in American cars."
The Cadillac had many buttons for moving the front seats every which way and for storing the position in memory. The seat even had a heater. Such features might appeal to the gadget-loving Japanese -- or be lost on them.
"It's just like a toilet," a Japanese passenger said when she saw the seat-heating button. In Japan, a high-tech toilet seat that can be pre-warmed is a popular product.
Parked near a family park, the shale-beige Cadillac received mixed reviews. None of about a dozen passers-by recognized it as a Cadillac; one young man guessed it was a Lincoln.
Ikuko Kameyama, a 32-year-old housewife, said, "It's a splendid-looking car." But she added: "I drive only small cars. I think I'd get a lot of attention if I drove a car like that."
Reiko Aoki, who is 31, said: "It's large. I can see it's an American car."
Her companion, Yuichi Nakata, added, "I want to ride in it but I don't want to drive it."
Some said they would rather buy a Japanese or European luxury car, if they could afford such a vehicle at all. The Concours has a list price here of 6.65 million yen, or more than $78,000. The Lexus LS 400, which is called the Celsior here, sells for 5.1 million to 6.5 million yen, or $59,900 to $76,300.
Fuel costs are another potential problem. The Cadillac gets about 16 miles to the gallon, according to Japanese ratings. With premium gasoline selling for about $6 a gallon, it could cost about $118 to fill the tank. The Explorer gets about 15 miles to the gallon.
G.M. sold 1,850 Cadillacs in Japan last year, up 14.3 percent from 1993. Mr. Hojoh said G.M. was trying to reduce the price of the smallest Cadillac sold here, the Seville, to the level of Japanese luxury cars and introduce a right-hand-drive version, possibly by 1998.
And can it be that the Cadillac suffers from an image as the vehicle of choice for Japanese mobsters? Several people said that this image was fading and that the mobsters, apparently in search of better price or quality, had switched to Mercedes-Benzes.
Mr. Hojoh said the Cadillac was also losing this class of traditional customer to Japanese luxury cars. With the economy slumping and a crackdown on organized crime under way, many mobsters can no longer afford the Cadillac, he said. Moreover, he said, a Japanese car does not attract as much unwanted attention. "It's very easy to camouflage," he said.

HEADLINE: Latin America Now Ignores U.S. Lead in Isolating Cuba

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 7

 BODY:
One Brazilian company has a contract to paint the peeling Havana Libre hotel, long a symbol of Cuba's revolution. Another is shipping an entire cigarette factory to Cuba to revive tobacco production.
Once an obedient follower of the United States trade embargo on Cuba, Latin America increasingly ignores Washington, choosing to develop full economic and diplomatic relations with the Communist Government. The United States is the only country in the Americas with a trade ban on Cuba and one of only five that do not have formal ties with it. 
 Mexico is now Cuba's largest foreign investor, and the Americas supply half of Cuba's imports. As tourism supplants sugar as Cuba's leading source of foreign exchange, Latin America supplies one quarter of the island's foreign visitors.
"The rapprochement between Latin America and Cuba is completely normal," said Ney Sroulevich, who imports Cuban cigars to sell in Brazil. "The countries are closer, the shipping costs are cheaper, and Latin America now produces good products."
Latin America's new independence from Washington is a product of several factors: a strong drive toward regional economic integration, the end of Cuban support for leftist guerrilla groups in the area, and the disappearance of Cuba as an ideological challenge with the collapse of its economy.
Although Latin trade and investment are too small to bail out Cuba's floundering economy, the emerging unanimity in the hemisphere has left American diplomats helplessly watching the tide turn against United States policy at a time when Washington is reassessing the wisdom of trying to isolate Cuba.
After foreign ministers at an Organization of American States meeting in Haiti last month called for reinstating Cuba's membership in the group, Alexander F. Watson, the State Department's top official for Latin America, said, "It's absurd to think today of admitting a country with a Stalinist Government to an organization which increasingly makes efforts to consolidate democracy in the hemisphere."
Harriet C. Babbitt, United States representative to the group, said in an interview today: "We agree that engagement with the Cuban people is useful. But we disagree that increased engagement with the Cuban Government would be useful."
While the Clinton Administration debates loosening travel restrictions on Cuba, free travel to the island is already a reality for almost all of the rest of the Americas. Cuba's airline, Cubana de Aviacion, flies to 10 Latin American countries, and about 220,000 people from the region expected to visit Cuba this year.
Thirty years ago, Mexico was the only country in the region to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba. Today, among all the Latin American nations, only Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Honduras have not moved to restore ties. But Honduras's new President, Carlos Reina, has received Cuban officials, signaling that he intends to normalize relations.
In Paraguay, South America's last holdout, the Senate voted in May to renew diplomatic relations with Havana.
"We have full relations with virtually all of Latin America," said Orlando Bogur, first secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Brasilia.
A diplomatic offensive by Cuba has paid off with votes in favor of United Nations resolutions condemning the United States embargo. With Latin nations no longer abstaining, supporting votes jumped from 59 in 1992 to 101 in 1994. In the last vote, only three countries from the region abstained -- Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala. The only country that supported the United States was Israel.
"Until now, the policy of all or nothing has not gotten us anywhere," Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, said last month. "The debate on the present and future of Cuba has been monopolized by the most extreme positions."
Cuba's opening to Latin America is also part of its own turn to foreign investment and free-market policies after the collapse of its patron, the Soviet Union. A decade ago, 85 percent of Cuba's trade was with the Soviet bloc. From 1989 to 1993, Cuba's foreign trade plunged by 72 percent to $4.1 billion.
Now, regional trade and investment have become increasingly important.
With Cuba starting to sell state companies, investors from Argentina and Mexico have an edge because their countries have accords that allow investors to swap shares in Cuban state companies for trade debts. Cuba has run up large trade debts with Latin America: $1.3 billion to Argentina, $340 million to Mexico, $50 million to Colombia, and $30 million to Brazil.
While Latin American multinational companies enter Cuba attracted by the lack of American competition, they are edgy about the threat of expanded United States sanctions. A bill pending in Congress would penalize foreign companies and their executives that do business in both Cuba and the United States. In a meeting in May, foreign ministers of 14 Latin America countries declared their opposition to the bill.
Jorge Mas Canosa, the hard-line Cuban exile leader in Miami, recently sent letters to Latin American and European ambassadors in Washington, urging them to stop investing in Cuba.
"You are taking a major risk and will incur major losses by doing business in Cuba during the tenure of the dictatorship of Fidel Castro," said Mr. Mas Canosa, chairman of the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. "Any entrepreneurial, commercial or economic undertakings in Cuba are illegitimate activities, as illegitimate as the system that allows them."
Despite these and other threats, dozens of investors and exporters turned out for conferences held last week in Brazil's four most important cities by Ernesto Melendez Bachs, Cuba's Minister of Foreign Investment and Cooperation.
"We are going to paint the Havana Libre," said Mauro Saccomani Moreira, export manager for Brazil's largest paint company, Tintas Renner, S.A. In addition to sprucing up the newly privatized hotel, the company, which dominates Cuba's paint market, is competing against Spanish and Venezuelan companies for a contract to repaint much of Havana's historic center next year.
To revive Cuba's flagging cigarette industry, Cuban officials have signed a deal to place most of local cigarette production in Brazilian hands. Under the deal, Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of British American Tobacco, is to plant 1,730 acres of Virginia-type tobacco in Cuba and to ship to Havana machinery for a factory capable of producing 6 billion cigarettes, half of Cuba's annual consumption.
"Our intention is to eventually export, first to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then later to the United States," Milton C. Cabral, the Souza Cruz financial director, said today at his officer here. "Diplomatically, we don't see any problems for our association because both countries, Brazil and Cuba, enjoy harmonious diplomatic relations."

Tokyo Stocks Soar by 6.3% on Unexpected Rate Cut

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

 BODY:
Tokyo stock prices jumped 6.3 percent yesterday, lifted by an unexpected cut in interest rates and investor hopes that the Government would take stronger measures to aid Japan's sagging economy. But some analysts said they doubted the market's buoyancy would last.
The Bank of Japan surprised financial markets by announcing yesterday that it would lower a key short-term interest rate. The announcement gave further momentum to the stock market, which had risen during the three prior sessions. 
 The initial impetus came from Government officials who had begun to give new assessments of Japan's troubled economy, acknowledging that it remained weak. The market had been so depressed in the last few weeks that the mere acknowledgment of economic weakness by the officials gave stocks a surprising lift.
"They might finally take the proper policy measures," said John F. Bahrenburg, a market strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. "Now it seems they have a greater appreciation of the risk of a deflation spiral and the economy entering into a recession again."
The Nikkei index of 225 shares, the benchmark stock indicator, jumped 956.19 points, or 6.3 percent, to close at 16,213.08 yesterday. That was its highest closing level in nearly two months.
In its announcement yesterday, the central bank said it would add funds to the money market, pushing down the interest rate that banks charge one another for loans overnight. It said it would allow the rate to fall below the discount rate, which is charged on loans that banks obtain from the central bank.
The overnight rate had already been slipping in the last few weeks. It declined to a record low of 0.75 percent at one point yesterday, below the discount rate, which at 1 percent is at its lowest level ever. The overnight rate settled at 1.06 percent, down from 1.24 percent on Thursday. Analysts said the central bank had set a target for the rate of around 0.75 percent.
The Bank of Japan said it was not yet considering a cut in the discount rate.
The central bank's announcement, made late in the morning in Tokyo, followed by less than eight hours the news of a similar step by the American central bank. The Federal Reserve announced in Washington on Thursday afternoon that it would allow the Federal funds rate, which like the Japanese overnight rate reflects the cost to banks of raising funds in the money market, to decline to 5.75 percent from 6 percent.
One reason for the Japanese rate cut was apparently to offset the potential impact on the currency market of the Fed's cut. In general, interest rate cuts lower a currency's value because they reduce the returns available from investments denominated in that currency. By lowering its own interest rates, Japan hoped to offset any downward pressure exerted on the dollar by the Fed's rate cut.
The rate cuts in the two countries were not carried out as part of a coordinated effort. But Japan did join with the United States yesterday in intervening in the currency market, buying dollars and selling yen. The strong yen has hurt Japan's economy.
More important than its impact on the currency market, the Bank of Japan's rate cut indicated that the central bank was decisively easing monetary policy to help spur investment and stimulate the economy.
Japan's economy has been sagging since the beginning of the 1990's. Economic output rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1995 from the prior three months, and some economists believe the economy contracted during the second quarter.
Government economic officials had been saying that the economy was on its way to recovery. This week, however, they began to concede that the economy was still weak and hinted that strong measures were needed.
While traders were encouraged by today's market activity, equity strategists and economists were cautious. Some said the market's rise could be a technical gain that might be erased by profit taking.
"It remains to be seen if this liquidity-driven bull is sustainable," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. "It's probably a technical rebound."
Others said that while stocks might gain further, the rise might be marked by periodic dips. A major factor would be whether the Government did, in fact, take concrete steps to aid the economy and address a mounting number of economic woes.
Many in the financial community have been calling for measures to further deregulate the economy.

Mexican Stock Exchange Is Regaining Lost Ground

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 7

 BODY:
The battered Mexican stock market has managed to regain most of the ground it lost after the peso was devalued in December, although stock values in dollar terms are still far below previous levels.
Today, the leading index of the Mexican stock exchange rose for the 11th time in 13 trading days, gaining 54.10 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,457.18, a high for the year. While in pesos the market has gained a little more than 1.1 percent since the beginning of the year, in dollars, the exchange is still down more than 18 percent. The dollar has risen 21.28 percent against the peso for the year. 
 Market analysts here and in the United States said local investors in Mexico were principally responsible for the recent surge, which took many people by surprise. More recently, they said, some big international funds dedicated to Mexico and Latin America have started to buy again.
Scott Kalb, managing director of Smith Barney's International Asset Management fund, said that since the devaluation, the Mexican market has been propelled primarily by local investors.
"Some foreign money has gone in and come out quickly and there's been a little bit of buying of fundamentals, but not a lot," Mr. Kalb said. "Even this week there might have been some institutions that recognized it would be dangerous to be too underweighted in Mexico. But I don't think many of them are convinced that they need to be waiting in line to get back into Mexico in a big way."
Some of the recent activity may also have been due to hedge funds that had to buy before prices rose too high. Hedge funds are big investment partnerships that make big bets on bond, commodity, currency and stock markets.
The decision on Thursday by the United States Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates for the first time since 1992 also appears to have given the Mexican market a boost. Lower interest rates in the United States should allow Mexico to reduce interest rates as well, eventually making it cheaper for Mexican companies to borrow money.
The Mexican economy has recently shown a number of signs that investors see as positive. Inflation rates are dropping and the Government has re-entered the international debt market for the first time since the devaluation, offering $500 million in notes that will be handled by Citibank and Credit Suisse.
Despite such signals, however, most analysts were reluctant to declare an end to Mexico's economic emergency.
"The optimism now is too great," said Rodolfo Navarrete, assistant director of analysis for the Vector Casa de Bolsa brokerage firm in Mexico City. He worried that the market surge had come even as most companies continued to be battered by a deep national recession. "I get the distinct impression that the rise could be temporary," he said.
No matter how long the current rally lasts, the stock market's strong recovery within months of the worst economic crisis in a decade has been unexpected. The day before the peso was first devalued on Dec. 20, the stock exchange index stood at 2,231.11. After the devaluation, the market sank steadily, reaching a low, on Feb. 27, of 1447.52.
Mr. Kalb of Smith Barney said that after the devaluation Smith Barney's international equity portfolio reduced its Mexico holdings to 2.5 percent from around 6 percent. They remain at that level.
Jeffry H. Taylor, an analyst at NatWest Securities in Washington, said that when Mexican stock prices dropped sharply over the first few months of the year, some investors found them attractive despite the overall weakness in the nation's economy.
"But cheap prices are enough only if you're looking at good quality," he said. Shares of Telefonos de Mexico, the national phone company, were a good buy when prices dropped because the telephone company's market was secure, he said. "But to just go in and buy a weaker company because prices are low means taking a big risk," he added.
Many investors say they want to see company earnings for the second and third quarters before deciding whether Mexico's economy has really hit bottom. Government officials have said they expect the economy to drop as much as 5 percent in the second quarter, with a light recovery coming only in the final quarter of the year.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Fall on Data Showing Jobless Rate Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday after a stronger-than-expected employment report raised concern that the Federal Reserve might not again cut rates any time soon.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in June from 5.7 percent the previous month. The report even led some bond traders to question if the Fed was justified in cutting short-term interest rates on Thursday. The Fed lowered its Federal funds target rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by 25 basis points, to 5.75 percent. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Traders said the surge in new jobs combined with Thursday's reduction in interest rates had shaken even those investors most optimistic for lower yields. But the market bounced back in the afternoon, with intermediate maturities especially strong. It prompted one securities trader to describe the five-year note as "almost bulletproof" since it was virtually unscathed by the strong employment report. Analysts said the strength of the five-year maturity had buoyed the prices of other maturities.
But the late recovery in bond prices prompted some investors to take profits and sell. By the close of the New York market, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond was down 14/32 of a percentage point, to 11411/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.52 percent, from 6.49 percent on Thursday. The price of the five-year note edged down 2/32 , to 10018/32to yield 5.74, up only a basis point from Thursday.
 "It appears that a near-term top may be in place in the Treasury market," said Margo Evashevski, a Treasury analyst with MMS International in San Francisco. "The September bond in the futures market was able to set a new 1995 intraday high at 1166/32 this morning on post-rate-cut euphoria. But the much-stronger-than-expected employment report sent the bond lower in a hurry. The report also brings further rate cuts into question, which suggests that the short and intermediate securities have more down side left."
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said that the ability of the market to bounce back from the bearish payroll data suggested staying power at these price levels. "Portfolio managers are behind the eight ball once again starting out the new quarter," he said, "and you can expect some forced buying as they look to catch up to their benchmarks.
"Add the fact that the Treasury is expected to cut the size of the next couple of auctions by $2 billion, and rate cuts overseas -- which will probably force some overseas investors into our market searching for yield -- and you have all the makings in place for a decent run higher, with increasing demand chasing decreasing supply."
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices were little changed, as fund managers saw investors add cash for the first time in four weeks. In the corporate debt market, analysts expect corporate borrowing will pick up soon because Government bond yields plunged after the cut in a key lending rate. As a result, managers expect a supply of new issues will hit the market in response to the lower borrowing rates.

HEADLINE: Why Banks Have to Remain Impartial Lenders

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In opposing evaluations of the Glass-Steagall laws, Marc Intrater ("Banking Laws Keep an Industry Down," letter, July 2) and John W. Moscow ("Bigger Banks, Bigger Problems," Op-Ed, June 28) focus solely on safety and soundness. The safety and soundness of our banks and banking system may be important, but it is a peculiarly defensive ground on which to justify or condemn regulation. 
 There always have been other considerations behind the separation of commercial and investment banking in this country.
"Safety and soundness" look to the survivability of banks and banking systems in times of stress. Failure here is the major hazard toward which bank regulation has been directed since the 1930's.
But the Supreme Court and the regulators have recognized a range of subtle hazards against which the Glass-Steagall barriers also defend. In any reassessment of banking law, these should not be ignored.
Our banking system -- including not only commercial banks but many near-bank institutions that have been encroaching on their turf -- functions ultimately as a conduit of money from underspenders to overspenders.
Resources not used by those who spend less than they earn are aggregated and made available to those who can use them for development of capital and entrepreneurial projects, to the general benefit of all.
Ideally the market for that aggregated surplus should be free and unbiased: those projects that offer the best combination of certainty and size of return, those projects that society in all its consumption roles most wants, should have highest priority.
Lending decisions should be made on the basis of creditworthiness alone.
If commercial banks were allowed to hold ownership interests in capital-consuming enterprises, their lending decisions would no longer be made solely on the basis of creditworthiness of applicant projects.
Suppose a bank had an ownership interest in a construction company: would it be inclined to lend to a rival construction company, even if that rival had the more creditworthy projects?
If banks held stakes in the entities that provide the demand for scarce capital, their lending decisions would be biased in favor of their own holdings and against their competitors.
Preserving an unbiased market for borrowed capital by preserving the role of creditworthiness as the sole basis of lending decisions is sufficient ground for preserving the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking.
And for a sound economic future, it is reason for restricting the increasing encroachment of other financial institutions into the conduit role that used to be almost exclusively the preserve of our commercial banks.

HEADLINE: Your Attention, Please

 BODY:
Republicans have a right to their suspicions about President Clinton's calls for an end to harsh partisanship. Mr. Clinton never hesitated to slug them in the eye back when he had the Congressional majority to back him up. But a President without votes on the Hill must placate more often than threaten. So Mr. Clinton's "common-ground" speech at Georgetown University can be read by political realists as an attempt to make a virtue of necessity. The necessity, in Mr. Clinton's case, was created by his party's collapse at the polls in 1994. If 1996 is to be any different for the Democrats -- and more to the point, their standard-bearer -- Mr. Clinton needs Republican help in establishing himself as a bipartisan leader.
Even allowing for this most cynical reading of the politics of his speech, the President is right on its core ideas. The ills afflicting American society do not flow from the fact that the middle class no longer possesses the moral perfection of, let us say, Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm. Mr. Clinton is closer to the truth when he points up that "middle-class values and strong families" are threatened by a consistent economic battering for which no end is in sight. 
 Any student of postwar history can grasp Mr. Clinton's point that decent family incomes are crucial to progress in education, health and general social stability. The favored doom-signs of the new Jeremiahs -- crime, illegitimacy, drug abuse -- flourish in environments of expanding poverty. The proliferation of middle-class values requires the existence of a middle class that is thriving rather than threatened, prosperous rather than pinched.
Yet there is no relief in sight for the economic squeeze that Mr. Clinton described for students at his alma mater, and that is not simply a matter of the changing global economy. The middle class, while incessantly praised by Beltway orators, has few friends in Washington. Representative Dick Armey and the flat-taxers are pushing new tax schemes that will hit the middle class harder than the wealthy. Corporations are taking as profit money that once got plowed back into higher wages and new jobs. Meanwhile, business and financial-community influence in Washington are at a 50-year peak, and that was true under the deposed Democratic Congressional leadership as well as with the lobbyist-loving Gingrich-Dole team.
Mr. Clinton has spotted a strong issue, but it may not be an easy one to exploit. Senator Bob Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich are whizzes at stroking the middle-class voters with cultural issues while punishing them economically.
Then there is always the question of how long Mr. Clinton can keep his attention on the important themes he defined at Georgetown. He spoke there of the "obligations imposed on the President." Central among those is the obligation to believe in -- and preach about -- a few important things for a long time instead of believing in virtually everything for at least a few minutes.

HEADLINE: A Mover of Markets

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell; Saul Hansell writes about finance for The Times.

 BODY:
The red digital clock pulses 12:30:00, and Dan Dorfman's image beams into this smooth and sterile control room of the CNBC cable network like some sort of wayward space alien disrupting a NASA launch. It's six minutes until Dorfman, a columnist for Money magazine, presents his daily dose of stock market news, rumors and tips on CNBC.
A technician has switched on a remote camera in Dorfman's office at Money, and the small, balding man with black electric tape eyebrows appears on a control-room monitor scribbling furiously on a legal note pad. At 12:34, Dorfman is writing away as CNBC gives its regular update on the O. J. Simpson trial. When the clock blinks 12:36, Kevin McCullough, the gray-haired anchor, introduces Dorfman. 
 "Our story here: Giving U.S. Shoe the boot," Dorfman pants into the camera, bobbing and weaving while holding his pad in front of him.
Dorfman quotes "a bear analyst," Jeffrey Stein, with the Cleveland brokerage firm McDonald & Company, who says shares of U.S. Shoe Corporation are "dead money" and "should be sold now." Dorfman explains Stein's reasoning, racing through a staccato stream of sentences, punching up about every third word.
"Stein's six-month target: 16 bucks a share, a decline of 16 percent from current levels," Dorfman concludes, allowing himself what appears to be his first breath in three minutes.
Back to the controlled world of McCullough the anchor. "While you were talking, Dan," he says, "we looked up the latest quote on U.S. Shoe. We now have it down 1/2 at 18 3/4."
It's a throwaway line, but it's essential to understanding why Dan Dorfman earns $900,000 a year from the column and the television spots, probably the biggest salary of any financial journalist. It explains why this two-minute daily segment is CNBC's most popular business feature, drawing an estimated audience of 500,000 people, both amateur investors at home and pros on trading desks, and why Money lured him from USA Today in December. It's why Dorfman has raised the ire of more than a few corporate chieftains and why many traders and other journalists worry that Dorfman is manipulated by some of his sources on Wall Street for their own gain.
Simply put, Dan Dorfman moves markets.
Invariably Dorfman's television reports set off a flurry of trading in the stocks he mentions. By the end of this day, 537,000 shares of U.S. Shoe traded, 60 percent more than usual; the price dropped by 62.5 cents. Often, the stocks move by several dollars.
"There are lots of people who make statements about the stock market, but there is no one who has the direct effect Dorfman has," says Homer Livingston Jr., the recently retired president of the Chicago Stock Exchange. "Whenever he talks, he disturbs the market." Waves of orders for stocks mentioned in Dorfman's reports proved so disruptive to traders on the Chicago trading floor that the exchange passed a rule last year permitting the temporary removal of stocks he mentions from its electronic trading system.
Daniel Donald Dorfman, 63, has been moving markets for more than three decades. In the late 1960's, he shot down hundreds of high-flying stocks while writing The Wall Street Journal's trademark Heard on the Street column. He continued to cultivate some of the most plugged-in sources on Wall Street, writing a series of financial columns for The Journal, then later New York magazine and USA Today. Along the way, he broke some of the most important stories in finance, like the impending merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications, and he punctured the balloon of overvalued stocks like College Bound, a once high-flying test firm that ultimately went bankrupt. Yet Dorfman's power only hit its current heights in 1990, when he began appearing on CNBC right in the middle of the trading day.
Of course, long before anyone dreamed of 500 channels, before cops chased robbers across the Internet and before media were multi, the stock market was -- in today's parlance -- an interactive, multiplayer game. For more than half a century, the average stockbroker's office lured contestants into electronic Monetary Kombat with nothing more than a telephone, a ticker tape and a Dow Jones news teleprinter.
But now CNBC merges these into a smooth blend of news, gossip and prices. The tips and trends still call out to investors big and small, luring them to run to their broker or pick up the phone and trade. Instantly, the new prices scroll across the ticker tape that snakes along the bottom of the TV screen, updating the state of play. Next move, the viewer.
With his Mickey Mouse ties and squeaky voice, Dorfman pops into this play like a bug-eyed monster on a video-game machine. With each report, different players jump, pull back or lunge, take a loss or seize an opportunity. Dorfman says he's democratizing the market, delivering information to the masses that has been available to the elite. Critics say he's used by sources to spread rumors that make the game all the more unfair for those out of the know.
Yet both fans and foes agree that if you trade stocks, you have to know what Dorfman is saying. Most big brokerage firms have CNBC playing on their trading floors. Pros tend to view Dorfman's reporting with a healthy dose of skepticism but they still use it: some to take a Dorfman-inspired rally as a way to get out of a position, others to take advantage of Dorfman's following among small investors, buying the stock as soon as he spits out the name and selling it the next hour or the next day before the demand subsides. Even small investors who are wary of Dorfman's tips are nonetheless drawn by his seeming access to the inside track. On a recent sunny Thursday afternoon, Albert A. Furst, wearing white sneakers and a polo shirt, sits in a seat arranged airplane-waiting-room style in the middle of the low, long storefront office of Shochet Securities, one of a dozen stockbrokers lined up along 41st Street, the financial center of Miami Beach. Shochet calls it the "board room," but the office looks more like a tropical outpost of OTB, with a stock ticker and TV playing CNBC in front of the seats and brokers to take orders in the back.
It is 12:35, the O. J. report ends, and the anchor introduces Dan Dorfman. His story today is that Scott Black of Delphi Management told him that Plains Petroleum will be bought out within six months for at least $31 a share. (By the end of the day, its stock will jump 50 cents to $23.50 on 18 times its usual trading volume.)
Furst, a former New York stockbroker, shakes his head, and says he promises not to trade another Dorfman story again. "I've traded some of his picks and most of them were losers," he says, glancing up regularly at the stock ticker. Furst says he bought California Federal Savings a year ago, after Dorfman said it would be taken over or its stock would rise to $21. The savings-and-loan's stock fell from $15 to $9.75, and it remains independent.
"You get fooled once, twice, three times, after that you watch your step," Furst says.
As it happens, Plains turned out to be a winner. Two months later, it agreed to be bought by Barrett Resources Corporation for $30.22 per share.
Dorfman and his assistant, Karyn McCormack, occupy a corner of Money's sleek gray quarters. Most Money editors work in private offices, but Dorfman actually had a wall taken down in a somewhat vain attempt to be in an open newsroom. For a reporter, Dorfman keeps his desk oddly free of paper.
Dorfman shows me two of his tools, the small shopping bag of pre-tied neckties to be easily donned just before air time, and a 20-year-old, overflowing, red leather phone book. "A lot of the people in there are dead," he sighs.
Without prompting, he starts to talk about Coca-Cola and Quaker Oats. Last January, Dorfman reported that stories were circulating among traders that Coca-Cola had offered $60 a share for Quaker, which owns the Gatorade sports drink line. Suddenly, Quaker shares jumped up $4.50 to $36.50. And the normally staid Atlanta soft drink company issued an unusual statement:
"It is the policy of the Coca-Cola Company not to comment on rumors about acquisitions or divestitures. That remains our policy. However, today we would like to elaborate on our statement and observe that Dan Dorfman does not have a clue."
CNBC stood by Dorfman and the story. But the incident seems to bother him. "The Coca-Cola thing is kooky." he says. "I thought it was a dopey reaction from a classy company." Dorfman recites, tensely, what he sees as the litany of criticisms of him and his work. "They say I'm long on rumor and short on fact-checking; that's what offends me. I know I have achieved some success and I'm visible. But the one thing that bothers me about some of these stories is that I wish they wouldn't paint me as some sort of loose cannon. I spend more time checking than anyone could possibly imagine."
The Coca-Cola company was actually the most recent of a number of possible suitors for Quaker Oats that Dorfman had mentioned over the last six months. "I heard the rumor three times in a two-week period," Dorfman explains. "So I called up the co-head of mergers at a major brokerage firm. He said, 'You must be calling about Coke.' " Dorfman asked the banker what he thought of the story. "He says, 'I think it's not true, but I don't know,' " Dorfman says. McCormack, his assistant, did call up Coke before the broadcast, but the company didn't comment.
On the air, Dorfman distinguishes between things he has "heard" -- rumors about which he is often quite skeptical -- and those he has "learned" -- facts from company insiders or government documents.
His first column in February for Money was one of the latter; he wrote that Larry Tisch was looking to sell CBS. But even with something he learned, Dorfman insists that readers should not trade on the basis of his reporting.
"Should someone buy CBS stock?" Dorfman says. "Absolutely not. People I checked with at CBS say CBS is gone. I firmly believe that. I don't know when. I don't care if people buy or sell CBS. That's not what I'm here for. I'm telling them what I hear."
Actually, most of Dorfman's reports are neither rumor nor fact. They are what he calls "one man's opinion" -- the case for or against a stock by a money manager or analyst. Dorfman is looking for unusual, interesting views, and he doesn't care if they are consistent. Three weeks after reporting the rumor that Coke was going to buy Quaker Oats for $60 per share, for example, he quoted an analyst, William Leach of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who figured Quaker would fall to $19. (The stock dropped $1 that day, to $34.)
Dorfman says one of his best stories of the last year was about Spectrum Information Technologies, the once high-flying Long Island technology company now in Chapter 11. In January, Dorfman heard a tip that John Sculley, the former Apple Computer C.E.O. who had just joined Spectrum, would quit.
"I called Sculley, and he denied it," Dorfman recalls. "Then Dan Dorfman, the reporter, begins to go to work. My source says, 'Sculley's lying,' but he is short the stock, so who do you believe?" Dorfman knows well that traders who sell stocks short -- that is, bet that their price will fall -- often have the best information on companies' weak spots. But they also stand to profit by spreading rumors that drive down the price, whether they are true or not.
Dorfman says he made one call to check out the story, but as usual, won't say to whom. "Somebody in the computer business said, 'Dan, he's going.' " Several days later, Sculley quit.
I ask Dorfman why he thought that his source would know more about what Sculley would do than Sculley himself?
"People always know," he says, repeating his lifelong mantra. "People always know."
DORFMAN BEGAN HIS PURSUIT OF knowledgeable insiders when he covered retail management for Women's Wear Daily in the 1960's. He says he quickly figured out the value of cultivating sources on Wall Street. "There are some people who get information first, and those are the ones I want to know," Dorfman says.
He started life in 1931 very much the outsider. He bitterly tells of getting beaten up during his two years in an orphanage after his parents divorced, being ignored by his mother when he returned to her in Brooklyn and being beaten up again in the rough hallways of the New York School of Printing on 34th and Eighth.
"I was scared, worried, and angry at the world, angry for my upbringing," he says. "If the pool room burned down, I would have been homeless."
He wanted to go to college and law school, but his mother thought a trade was more stable. The Army helped bail him out of an unhappy career as a printer by giving him some experience on a base newspaper in Germany. After he returned, he finagled a job as a copy boy at Fairchild Publications, the parent of Women's Wear.
His friends see Dan Dorfman's life as a one long sprint away from his bitterness of his childhood.
"No one looked at Dan Dorfman in high school and said this guy will be the highest-paid financial journalist in the history of the profession," says Beth Belton, an economics reporter for USA Today and a friend of Dorfman. "They looked at him and said he isn't so brilliant, he has no family connections, he'll be lucky to have a job. Now he's a player. Dan isn't any more complicated than that. That's what drives him."
Dorfman works so much that he rarely takes a vacation. He is divorced and has a grown daughter. None of his friends have ever seen his east midtown apartment.
Dorfman's relatively simple life style is adorned by a penchant for expensive restaurants, where he invariably ignores the highly touted menu to order a dry grilled piece of fish, and a fondness for rare aperitifs, which he invariably spills on his jacket.
"When I have dinner with Danny, I frankly tell the waiters you may have the worst experience in your life," says Richard Stern, one of Dorfman's close friends and a former editor for Forbes. "Food goes back to the kitchen all the time. Wine goes back all the time."
Dorfman was equally fussy at USA Today -- not for privileges of power, but simply for accommodation of his drive. "He would want the air-conditioning on Sunday because he would work all day," Belton remembers.
Dorfman agrees: "They call it N.I.N. -- for News Immediacy Now -- it's like an orgasm. I need it."
More than ever, the daily CNBC appearances, which Dorfman started in 1990, make his life a high-wire act. He wakes up each morning most often not knowing what the topic of his 12:36 report will be.
He casts his net first at an 8:15 breakfast with a source. Then he works the phones madly through midmorning until he comes up with an idea he can use.
"Dorfman's calls are usually quick," says a money manager who talks to him regularly. "Do you know this, what do you know about it? What else is going on? Yes, I do. No, I don't. Boom boom boom. Goodbye."
Once Dorfman finds an idea, his assistant checks the facts and figures and calls the companies in question for comment (to their frustration, often with just minutes until air time). Lunch is at his desk, so he doesn't miss any phone calls. Dinner with sources is at 8 P.M.
Some traders and analysts -- even top corporate executives -- seek out a breakfast or dinner with Dorfman to promote their views. Others have become friends with him over decades in the business and enjoy swapping the latest gossip. Dorfman, of course, is trolling for ideas he can use and to get sources to let him use their names along with their views. Some regret the experience.
"I got so much grief from my friends," says a money manager quoted by Dorfman about why he liked a stock. "They said to me, 'What are you doing, trying to bail out of a position?' "
Of course, that is precisely what many traders and other stock-market journalists figure is on the mind of more than a few of Dorfman's sources. Indeed, over the years Dorfman's editors have not always been convinced that he was being skeptical enough of his sources' motives. In the heat of the takeover frenzy in the late 1980's, for example, several USA Today editors criticized Dorfman for being too ready to print that putative raiders had bought blocks of various companies' stocks, recalls Tom Petruno, Dorfman's editor then and now a columnist for The Los Angeles Times.
"Raiders would often run up to 4.9 percent," Petruno says, just under the 5 percent limit that the S.E.C. requires for positions to be disclosed. "The next thing you know, they would be out when the stock was up 2 or 3 points. We would ask: 'Is this person for real? What does he really want to do?' Dan would say, 'I just report what I know.' " Ultimately, the paper told him not to print those stories about raiders' positions.
The ethical mine field of stock-market journalism was illuminated by the criticism aimed recently at a column by James J. Cramer in Smart Money magazine, a personal-finance publication of Dow Jones & Company. Cramer, an investment manager, praised four small stocks that he said his funds owned. Their prices surged after the column was printed. That's all fair game, but Cramer was criticized because he bought more shares in the companies while the magazine was on the presses.
Dorfman himself rebuked Smart Money and Cramer, who says he did nothing wrong, with the banner of its archrival Money over his shoulder. "Did readers get a fair shake?" Dorfman asked. "The answer clearly is no." He said Cramer had an obligation to say he was buying more of the stocks.
And that is Dorfman's main response to those who criticize him for promoting the positions of others. (Dorfman hasn't bought a stock for himself in four years, he says.) He will simply tell viewers that his source has a position in the stock that he is talking about.
He knows well that he is caught in a war between the "touts" spreading rumors to boost prices and the "shorts" doing the same to profit from price declines. He argues that the only way to sort out the truth is to search out those who have the most incentive to find out what is really happening, and that those are usually people who have a financial stake in the situation.
"I use the user," Dorfman says.
The bottom line for viewers, however, is not who is used, but who is right. The few studies done on Dorfman show that stocks he praises do tend on average to rise and those he criticizes are more likely to fall.
But conducting such a study is no easy task. Take U.S. Shoe, for example, the stock to which Dorfman gave the boot, quoting one money manager that it would fall to $16 a share. Just a month before, Dorfman quoted another analyst who called the same company "a stock to own" because it was worth at least $36 a share.
Should anyone who bought U.S. Shoe on Dorfman's first bullish report feel used? Not at all; just two weeks after Dorfman's dour report, an Italian company made a hostile bid for U.S. Shoe. They ultimately bought it for $28 a share.

As a Beat, Business Is Booming

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
IRVING R. LEVINE STILL shivers at the memory of Jan. 8, 1971. That was the day NBC News asked him to try his hand at business reporting. Mr. Levine had just completed a lengthy tour as a foreign correspondent in Moscow, Rome and London. He wanted to cover the State Department next. But his bosses handed him the economics and business beat.
"It was a barren time," Mr. Levine, who is 72, said the other day. "Producers just weren't interested in those stories." 
 Today, he still plies his trade as NBC's chief interpreter of the Federal Reserve, the Dow Jones index and other bastions of the business world. But now Mr. Levine, whom many journalists regard as the dean of television business news, competes with hundreds of journalists from dozens of programs. Although the ratings would hardly threaten Peter Jennings, financial news has become the growth industry of the medium.
Four years after acquiring its troubled rival, Financial News Network, CNBC broadcasts 14 1/2 hours of talk shows and business-news updates every day. Executives at the cable channel, which is owned by NBC, said it would earn $50 million in pretax profits this year. And Cable News Network is about to throw the brightest spotlight yet on business: if all goes as planned, CNN will start an all-business news network, with 12 hours a day of financial news reporting and analysis, on Jan. 1.
"Business news has been accorded a status it never had before on television," said Everette E. Dennis, the executive director of the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. "People now regard business news as more important to their lives than political news."
That may be more true of people in Silicon Valley than those in Sarajevo. But major American media companies like NBC, Turner Broadcasting System and Bloomberg Business News are scrambling to develop news programs -- even entire networks -- devoted to business, in Europe and Asia as well as the United States.
As financial news becomes pervasive on television, it is also becoming more sophisticated. Lou Dobbs, the mellifluous anchorman of CNN's primary business-news program, "Moneyline," is host of a show that differs little in style or substance from "CBS Evening News."
"We want to be the viewer's principal source of business and market news worldwide," said Mr. Dobbs, who is overseeing the development of CNN's new network, which will be called CNN Financial News, or CNNFN.
Such ambitions would have seemed ludicrous in the early 1980's, when CNN, FNN and other networks first got into financial news. In those days, business news still appealed to a narrow audience of Wall Street traders and other professional money managers. They watched business programs to get the latest pronouncements from the Fed chairman -- or other events that could drive the capital markets up or down.
Now, several trends have conspired to make financial news a hot commodity: the growth of a global economy has propelled trade and commerce to the top of the nation's political agenda, and the explosion of mutual funds has turned millions of Americans into armchair investors.
Ron Insana, an anchorman at CNBC, recalled that when he started out at Financial News Network in 1984, he served as a one-man news department. Mr. Insana had to keep track of the news-agency wires, edit taped footage, schedule stories and write the introductions for those stories.
One day, in May 1985, FNN's two anchors both called in sick. Suddenly, the 24-year-old Mr. Insana found himself delivering the news. "I was ad-libbing about stuff I knew nothing about," he said.
These days, Mr. Insana trades quips with top corporate executives and Wall Street analysts on his midday talk show, "Inside Opinion." He has been nominated for major awards and is finishing his first book, a compilation of stories about life on Wall Street.
Save for a receding hairline and a slightly nerdy appearance, Mr. Insana would be every inch the network anchor. But he said his job requires more than blow-dried looks.
"Look, none of us will ever sit in Brokaw's chair," he said. "But this is a different gig. It's a skill position."
Mr. Insana, Mr. Dobbs and other financial journalists are proud of their ability to discuss the arcana of interest rates or shifts in the commodities markets. Some would not trade it for anything.
NEIL CAVUTO, A 36-YEAR old anchorman at CNBC, said he has turned down offers to switch to more conventional broadcast beats like politics, social issues and crime. "Covering the latest mayhem on the streets of the city is not my cup of tea," said Mr. Cavuto, who is host for the daily "Money Wheel" and "Market Wrap" programs on CNBC.
Mr. Cavuto and other up-and-comers, like David Faber, the 31-year-old Wall Street correspondent at CNBC, believe that their specialized knowledge will make them coveted employees as CNN and Bloomberg begin scouting talent for their fledgling services. (Last week Bloomberg began a 90-minute business news program, from 5:30 to 7 A.M. on USA Network.)
Indeed, some business reporters have already become prized properties. Kitty Pilgrim, a CNN correspondent in her late 30's, recently became the host of her own program, "Your Money." Colleagues of Ms. Pilgrim said she was courted by other networks when her contract came up for renewal recently.
As CNN and CNBC seek to expand their fairly narrow audiences, though, some broadcast executives are starting to ask whether business reporters need to speak less like M.B.A.'s and more like laymen.
IN 1993, NBC HIRED ROGER Ailes, the acid-tongued Republican image consultant, to be president of CNBC. His mandate is to broaden the network's appeal beyond its traditional audience of traders and retirees who play the stock market from their easy chairs.
Among his most visible changes, Mr. Ailes removed the "ticker," the stock tape that scrolls across the bottom of the television screen, during CNBC's personal-finance programming, which is on from 7 to 8 P.M. "By 6 in the evening, people just aren't watching it anymore," he said.
Mr. Ailes said his move was part of a bigger effort to make CNBC palatable to younger viewers. He has sharpened the look of the network by improving lighting and camera angles, and by coaching the anchors on how to jazz up their interviews with corporate executives or money managers. Dan Dorfman, CNBC's famously jazzed-up market watcher, has resolutely resisted any efforts to improve his on-camera appearance.
Mr. Ailes said CNBC would also experiment with more general-interest programming, including a business program devoted to entertainment.
Some veteran financial journalists believe that television should worry less about appearances and more about covering business overseas.
"Our preoccupation with domestic navel-gazing has distracted us from paying attention to events outside the U.S.," said Louis Rukeyser, the host of "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser," a PBS public-affairs program about business that is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.
Mr. Dobbs, whose department already produces 10 business programs for CNN, said that foreign news will be a key component of CNNFN. He already has 100 editorial employees in his midtown Manhattan studio. Employees at CNN said he may hire another 40 to fill out the new network, which will be based in New York. Mr. Dobbs declined to discuss his plans.
Mr. Ailes and Mr. Dobbs have sharply different views of CNN's motives in starting a new channel. Mr. Ailes said CNN is worried by the growing prominence of CNBC. He said Mr. Dobbs is gunning for CNBC's audience of professional money managers and at-home investors. But Mr. Dobbs contended that CNN appeals to a much broader news audience and that its new network will, too.
No matter how one slices the television business audience, the numbers are far from spectacular. CNBC's business programs are watched by an average of 206,000 viewers a day and CNN's "Moneyline" is seen by 353,000 a day, the A. C. Nielsen Company said. Those numbers represent a fraction of the viewership for even the last-place network newscast. Indeed, the crucial question for executives at CNN and CNBC is, Are there enough viewers to justify all this business news?
Mr. Levine of NBC pointed out that when push comes to shove on television, financial news still gets shelved in favor of more dramatic stories. Right now, for example, the O. J. Simpson trial has squeezed many business stories off "NBC Nightly News," he said.
"When you get an O. J. Simpson or an Oklahoma City or a Bosnia," he said, "financial news is pretty much at the bottom of the list -- because it usually lacks the visual qualities of these stories."

Grand Canyon of Spain
 
Q. In 1978 my wife and I went to Spain and visited El Chorro de Gargantua, or the Grand Canyon of Spain, north of Malaga, and found it to be an extraordinary experience. But no one we speak to has ever heard of it. Were we in the Twilight Zone? -- Harold Alan Pincus, M.D., Chevy Chase, Md.
 
A. Your memory has got it almost right. 
 What you have in mind is known as La Garganta del Chorro, and sometimes as the Gorge of Los Gaitanes.
It is essentially a canyon that has been created between two mountains by the River Guadalhorce, with deep, perpendicular-sided ravines that can be reached only by way of a narrow footpath known as the King's Way. Access to the path, which has been worn away over the years and and should be approached with caution, is made by crossing a wooden footbridge that spans the canyon. The reward for your efforts -- the hike is considered of medium difficulty and takes about three hours to complete -- comes at the canyon's inner valley, an area of quiet waters and green pastures.
La Garganta is near a town called Alora, which has Roman and Moorish remains, and is 30 miles from Malaga. But the hiking path is reached from the village of El Chorro, 30 miles north of Malaga on Route 332. El Chorro can also be reached by train from Malaga.
Next to El Chorro railroad station is Refugio del Chorro, a center that organizes half-day and full-day tours of the area. You can also sleep there for about $4 a night, calculated at 125 pesetas to the dollar, if you take your own sleeping bag. Half-day tours are $8, full-day $12.
Horseback riding is also available for $10 an hour or $50 for a day and climbing lessons are given throughout the year. For more information call (34 95) 249 72 19.
A reservoir and camping area, called Camping de los Ardales, is some four miles north of Garganta del Chorro. More information: (34 95) 245 80 87.
The Alora tourist office can be reached at (34 95) 249 83 80 and the Malaga tourist office at (34 95) 221 34 45.
 
Passage to Panama
 
Q. I have long desired to sail through the Panama Canal, but the thought of having to take a long cruise to accomplish this has not appealed to me. Are there any feasible alternatives not involving a cruise? -- Richard J. Delaney, the Bronx
 
A. There are a couple of ways of doing it, both involving ships run by Argo Tours of Panama City.
Panama Discovery Tours, which acts as the agent in the United States for Argo, specializes in tours to Panama.
Most consist of activities centered around Panama City and the canal and most include a full or partial transit of the waterway.
For your purposes it would probably be best to concentrate on what the company calls its Panama Discovery Tours, which run from three to eight days. The three-day tour consists of two nights in a hotel and either a partial transit of the canal and a guided tour of Panama City or a full transit of the canal.
Prices for a double range from $240 a person in economy class to $363 in deluxe. Prices for a single go from $306 to $510. Air fares and meals are extra.
The longer tours add such features as a train ride through a rain forest, a day of swimming and exploring on Taboga Island, visits with Embera Indians or a visit to Drake's Island, burial place of Sir Francis Drake.
Prices range from $369 for a double in economy for the four-day tour to $1,295 for a deluxe double on the eight-day trip. Singles run from $468 to $1,959. Some meals are included.
Tours will run from July 27 to Aug. 3, Aug. 24 to 31, Sept. 28 to Oct. 5, Oct. 26 to Nov. 2, Nov. 23 to 30, Dec. 21 to 28 and Dec. 28 to Jan. 4, 1996.
More information: Pacific Discovery Tours, Post Office Box 130, Clarita, Okla. 74535; (405) 428-3476, fax (405) 428-3499.
If you want to make your own canal transit arrangements, Argo's two ships, the Islamorada, which holds up to 125 passengers, and the 500-passenger Fantasia del Mar, make full transits every other month from Dock 17 in Balboa, on the Pacific Ocean, to Cristobal, on the Atlantic. Passengers are taken back to Balboa, a distance of about 45 miles, on an air-conditioned bus.
The trip, which takes from six hours to eight hours or more, depending on canal traffic, costs $90, children 12 and under $69.
The partial transits are made every Saturday starting at 7:30 A.M., when one of the ships leaves Balboa and sails through the Miraflores Locks.
It then cruises the Miraflores Lake up to Pedro Miguel Locks. At that point it goes back past Balboa to beyond the harbor breakwater. After cruising off the coast it heads back to Dock 17, arriving at about 11:30 A.M.
The cost of the partial transits is $45 a person, $25 for children 12 and under. The price includes brunch.
More information: Argo Tours, Apartado 9662, Panama 4, Republic of Panama; 011 (507) 228-6069, fax 011 (507) 228-1234.
 
Nepal and Bhutan
 
Q. I am off to Nepal and Bhutan in October. Where can I get tourist information for these two countries? -- A. Bottenhorn, Flushing, Queens
 
A. Official tourist information on the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal can be obtained from Nepal's Mission to the United Nations or from its embassy in Washington.
Write or call the Nepal Mission to the United Nations, 820 Second Avenue, Suite 302, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 370-4188. The embassy is at 2131 Leroy Place N.W., Washington D.C. 20008; (202) 667-4550.
Bhutan, also a Himalayan kingdom, has had no official tourism office in the United States since 1987. But a privately run company called Bhutan Travel, which specializes in trips to that part of the world, says it would be happy to send out information. It can be reached at 120 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y.; (212) 838-6382.
 
Ireland on a Tandem
 
Q. My husband and I are planning a trip to Ireland and would like to do some sightseeing by tandem bicycle. Could we arrange to rent one for our arrival? -- Emily Miller, Ann Arbor, Mich.
 
A. There is only one store renting tandems in Dublin, according to the Irish Tourist Board. Contact Joe Daly Cycles, Main Street Lower, Dundrum, Dublin 14, Ireland; (353 1) 298 1485. Rates are $25 a day, calculated at $1.67 to the pound. Daly's has three tandems but reservations are strongly advised.
In other towns the local tourist board offices will be able to help. For a list of their addresses and phone numbers contact the Irish Tourist Board, 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10154; (212) 418-0800 or (800) 223-6470. TERENCE NEILAN

HEADLINE: Manhattan Renters Find Tighter Market

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
MOBILITY is theoretically the beauty of renting. There's no need to worry about selling in order to relocate. But what if there's nothing much out there to rent?
Inveterate renters who insist on staying in Manhattan -- to say nothing of outsiders relocating to the city -- are finding shrinking availabilities and higher prices these days. The situation was foreseeable, and widely foreseen, even five years ago during the depth of the doldrums in the real-estate market. It was a buyer's market then in sales as well as rentals. But gradually vacancies were absorbed. 
 Meanwhile, new construction came almost to a standstill -- and hasn't revived yet. The supply-demand balance has turned.
One result is a brisk renting pace at West End Towers, formerly known as Manhattan West, on the West Side and the Brittany on the East Side, the only major new apartment projects on the market this year. At West End Towers, a nearly completed development with 1,000 apartments on West End Avenue between 61st and 63d Streets, the Brodsky Organization, the owner-builder, expects the entire rent-up to take a year, compared with the more typical year and a half in a project of that size.
"It's a hot market -- we've already rented 500 apartments," said Daniel Brodsky, the developer.
The Brittany, a 273-unit building at York Avenue and 92d Street, rented out between October and May, according to Glenwood Management, the owner. One line of one-bedroom apartments had six prices increases during the rent-up period. They were offered at an average rent of $1,800 a month at the start and at $2,000 a month at the end, Glenwood said.
Another consequence of the tightened market is that owners no longer offer brokers a payment to rent out apartments, thereby increasing the pressure on brokers to collect a full fee from tenants -- usually 15 percent of a year's rent.
Many tenants feel they cannot afford such a fee, even if they get a quality of service that seems to justify it, which is not always the case. At 15 percent, a tenant renting a $1,200 apartment has to be ready for an initial payment of at least $4,560 by move-in time -- $1,200 for the first month's rent, $1,200 for a security deposit, and $2,160 as the fee.
The level of brokerage costs has brought forth a competing form of middleman service, offered by the The Apartment Store, operating from loft premises on East 29th Street. At a fixed rate of $125, it provides customers with a fax or e-mail of available Manhattan apartments that fall within a client's rent ranges, size and desired location. The faxes are dispatched regularly until an apartment is found. A staff of nine keeps in touch by phone with 920 owners or managing agents to get listings, said Barry Feinsmith, the owner. There are none below $800 a month.
Still another effect of the tighter market is the slowdown in turnover in existing housing. With fewer availabilities and higher prices, more people stay put. At the Rivergate, a 700-unit rental built in 1985 between First Avenue and the East River from 34th to 35th Streets, about 250 apartments were vacated and rerented each year from 1992 through 1994, said Gene Waggelman, the director of leasing. This year, half that many will be rerented, he said.
"The move-outs have slowed," Mr. Waggelman said. "There's no new construction. The apartment glut has been absorbed."
Figures supplied by city officials show a substantial drop in new construction by historic standards. Last year building permits were granted for only 560 housing units in Manhattan, 428 of them in the private sector. The five-year average from 1990 through 1994 was 1,250 units a year.
In the 80's, housing completions averaged 3,600 a year in Manhattan in the public and private sectors. In the 70's the 10-year average was 4,500 a year. In the more ebullient 60's, the average was 10,200 units a year.
In the 1992 book "Scarcity by Design," Peter D. Salins and Gerard C. S. Mildner contend that the shortages and high prices apartment seekers find are the inevitable consequence of public policies involving housing. They cite the price controls and occupancy protections of rent regulation, the city's strict land-use controls, the high degree of public participation in housing ownership and management and a property-tax system that favors single-family housing over multifamily housing.
ROOT causes aside, the Manhattan residential market appears to be marching into familiar territory, with greater rental shortages and higher prices, but with a new twist. More than in past cycles, there are availabilities in the for-sale market. This is the result of widespread conversions in the 80's, and the sharp decline in the sales market in 1990. Many owner-occupants have moved and kept their units as rentals, though co-op boards resist long-term rentals.
Feathered Nest, one of the city's most active rental agencies, with a staff of 90, reports that two-thirds of the apartments it finds for renters are in co-op or condominium buildings. These are primarily listings from individual owners.
In addition, conversion sponsors or their investor-successors have tended to rent out rather than sell vacancies in apartments that have never had an owner-occupant, making these apartments, at least until the sales market strengthens, part of the rental housing supply.
Younger renters in Manhattan often say they eventually intend to leave the city, especially when they are ready to buy rather than rent and may have children to raise. They recognize that the longer they stay put in one residence, the stronger the case becomes for ownership rather than renting. With the help of a mortgage loan, the buyer can acquire a growing stake in an asset that under normal circumstances will appreciate in value by an amount that will at least have kept pace with inflation.
Nonetheless, the shift to home-ownership also involves the assumption of responsibility for the property -- or, in the case of a co-op or condominium, a share of the responsibility -- that many individuals feel unprepared to accept. For them, renting may be the best alternative even in the long term.
The desire for housing flexibility -- mobility -- and the consequent dedication to rental life is clearly on view at West End Towers. It has made a confirmed renter of Dennis S. Walker, for example. A 35-year-old native of Kansas, Mr. Walker became president of the Givenchy Corporation's North American operations last December. He came to the city in 1984, three years after graduating from Kansas State with a business and accounting degree.
During a varied career on the business side of the design world he lived in seven Manhattan apartments -- a $750-a-month studio on West 47th Street; a $1,000 floor-through in a brownstone on West 96th Street, shared with a roommate; a $250 sublet on West 45th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues; a $925 studio with a skylight in a renovated 27th Street walk-up; an $1,850 one-bedroom duplex at Second Avenue and 17th Street; a $1,100 subleased one-bedroom co-op on West 92d Street, and a $1,200 furnished one-bedroom on East 88th Street. In between, he moved back to Kansas City for six months in 1993.
Now he lives in a sunny 16th-floor one-bedroom with a long terrace facing east at 55 West End Avenue. The rent is $1,875. "I'm the kind of person who moves around," Mr. Walker said. "I need flexibility. If I need to move to Paris or somewhere else, I could do it. But actually I see myself staying where I am for a while, maybe four years."
In the same building, Patricia McCaffery, a mezzo-soprano, teaches opera singers. She came to New York from Florida at the age of 21 in 1970, and since then has sung and coached in New York, Michigan, Arizona and Connecticut. "Over 25 years I've rented or sublet seven apartments," she said. Now she lives in a $2,500-a-month two-bedroom in a line of apartments in which the living room abuts no other apartment and lies below an open terrace, assuring no objections to singing lessons from neighbors.
About 50 percent of the one-bedroom renters at West End Towers have been sharers, said Sandy Rotkoff, the leasing director. In a typical situation, they have just finished business school, earn about $40,000 a year with prospects of a 15 percent year-end bonus, and can afford a $1,700 rent, she said. Two-thirds of the apartments are studios or one-bedrooms.
Apartment seekers with lesser means have bigger problems. Success goes to the dogged, the ingenious, the patient and the lucky, or some combination thereof. Some have turned to a newly published volume called "Gabriel's Apartment Rental Guide," by Michael Gabriel, a former Glenwood Management leasing agent, which is available in bookstores. It lists the features of more than 300 buildings and the phone numbers to call for rental information, and gives neighborhood and other housing-related information. Others use agents and newspaper ads (often leading them to brokers), or shoe leather, or tips from friends.
"Finding an apartment in New York is one of the most debilitating, demeaning, horrible experiences anyone can go through," said Terri Semper, 35, who arrived from California last year and took a job as assistant to the president of a record company. "In North Hollywood I paid $765 a month for a huge two-bedroom in a courtyard building. Here I pay $1,250 a month for a studio."
Ms. Semper found the inability to present an unblemished credit record a major hurdle in renting an apartment. As a teen-ager 17 years ago she had too many credit cards and was late in some payments. She had no problems renting in Los Angeles, and no further credit problems, but she was rejected in six buildings in Manhattan when she acknowledged her credit history, she said. West End Towers accepted her with a two-month security deposit.
"Even a minor blemish on your record and you can't get an apartment!" she said. "I wish someone had stressed that to me when I was a kid."
Susan Platt, 25, had her employer's help. She was transferred to New York from Denver by an insurance brokerage, Rollins Hudig Hall, which picked up the brokerage fee of Marc Lewis Realty. She rented a $1,000 studio at 88th Street and Lexington Avenue. The search took two days.
MARC OROMANER, 24, was earning about $35,000 a year working as a production associate at CBS and living with two roommates on East 52d Street near First Avenue. He wanted to move into his own apartment. "My idea of a studio apartment was $600 a month," he said. "Everybody said, 'Yeah sure.' " He pounded the pavements between Third and First Avenues from 35th Street to 59th Street, back and forth, looking for signs. That led him nowhere.
He finally rented a second-floor studio in a five-story walk-up around the corner from his old apartment on First Avenue for $770 a month, using the Marc Lewis Realty firm and paying, reluctantly, almost the entire brokerage fee of 15 percent of a year's rent. "I got them to knock off $100," he said.
Many management companies now want renters to be earning 50 times their monthly rent, a tougher standard than they required a few years ago. It means that an individual renting an $800 studio should be earning at least $40,000. Starting salaries for college graduates are often lower than that, which is why so many young people live with parents or roommates.
But the 50-times standard is not universal. Rose Associates, for example, says it uses 43 times the monthly income (a $34,400 income acceptable for an $800 studio). "The tightening market is no reason to raise the multiplier," said Adam R. Rose, executive vice president.
At Normandie Court, a 1,477-unit development at 95th Street and Third Avenue, about three-quarters of the roughly 500 two-bedroom apartments are occupied by sharers, according to Stephen Dolnick, director of residential leasing for Milstein Properties, the owner. Three occupants each earning about $35,000 a year can take on a two-bedroom apartment renting for about $2,100 a month. If one or two leave, replacements arrive. Parents often guarantee the rent.
But in the longer term, tenants expect that rising income will enable them to move on to their own apartments, whether or not they pair off through marriage or a partner.
West End Towers has tapped into that vein, too. One of its new tenants is Lorin Konner, 23, a production coordinator for MTV, who had been sharing with two other young women on East 86th Street. "I wanted to live alone," she said. After moving in with her parents for a while in Wyckoff, N.J., she moved into a fourth-floor studio last January at $1,175 a month in rent.
The newly married Elizabeth Herbert and Dr. Jerald Vizzone are moving tomorrow into a 22d-floor one-bedroom renting at $1,760. Mrs. Vizzone said she has lived in five different rentals over nine years. "Word of mouth is the most successful way of looking," she said, but she found her way to West End Towers via The Apartment Store, the eight-month-old fax service.
Mr. Feinsmith, of The Apartment Store, said he had a database of 227,000 apartments in about 1,200 buildings in Manhattan, from Columbia University to the Battery on the West Side and from 96th Street to the Battery on the East Side. The availability rate in these apartments ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 percent, he said.
A computerized breakdown of availabilities on June 21 by location indicated that apartment hunters looking for larger apartments (two bedrooms and more) would have to pay at least $2,000 a month on the Upper West Side (defined as north of 60th Street) and upwards of $1,500 on the Upper East Side. But the one-day snapshot showed East Side two-bedrooms ranging as high as $20,000 a month; the upper edge was $6,800 on the West Side.
It is probable that the most experienced young apartment-shoppers -- with financial resources -- do best in the search. Joshua Mondschein, 30, is a Manhattan native and a self-employed life insurance and employee benefits consultant whose business grosses in six figures. In the last seven years he has lived in Tudor City; at 201 East 12th Street; at 111 Fourth Avenue between 11th and and 12th Streets, and at Broadway and 76th Street. Now he rents a $1,350 studio with a terrace at 75 West End Towers.
"Each move helps me to re-evaluate how I'd like to live," he said. "Every apartment has been different. Ultimately when I buy, I'll have a perspective on different types of buildings. I expect to live in Manhattan the rest of my life."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Sheepshead Bay;
Should There Be a Fishing Village or a Loehmann's?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT seemed like a great idea, way back when. Take Sheepshead Bay, with its active deep-sea fishing fleet, broad promenade and protected bay; add a few more seafood restaurants and nautical shops; keep mundane stores out, and voila: A nautically themed magnet for fishing buffs and tourists, right on Brooklyn's southern shore.
At least, that's what city planners envisioned in 1973, when they created the Special Sheepshead Bay District, a 20-block tract from Sheepshead Bay Road to Knapp Street. Emmons Avenue, running along the water and home of Lundy's seafood restaurant, was to be the district's cultural heart. 
 Well, it never happened. Irving Lundy, who owned much of the land in the district, died in 1977, and Lundy's closed two years later. Although the city has rebuilt several piers, the fishing fleet, once more than 40 boats strong, is down to about 20 boats. Indeed, the area is known more for its high rate of car theft than for its fishing boats.
"We've just got to accept that the district's goals were never realized," said Mitchell Corby, director of the City Planning Department's Brooklyn Office.
Now Sheepshead Bay lies at the heart of a brewing controversy over whether the fishing village idea should be given a second chance, or whether the city should just cry uncle on the idea of quaintness and opt instead for conventional development.
On one side sit the Bay Improvement Group and the Sheepshead Bay Fishing Fleet Association, which insist that city bureaucracy, developer shenanigans and bad economic timing -- not anything fundamentally wrong with the concept -- has kept the fishing village from becoming reality.
"Special districts have characteristics that outweigh the need for short-term development," said Steven M. Barrison, president of the Bay Improvement Group. "A protected harbor is such a characteristic."
But his opponents, including Community Board 15 and several real estate developers, have lost their taste for endlessly delayed gratification. They want to put conventional retailing on Emmons Avenue.
"Maybe this isn't the best use for waterfront property, but no one is knocking on our door offering to do other things," said John E. Nikas, Board 15's chairman.
It is no academic argument. Emmons Avenue Development wants to build a retail center, anchored by a 28,000 square-foot Loehmann's fashion discount store, on a weed-strewn lot at Emmons and 21st Street that it bought in 1986 with the idea of building condominiums.
The Loehmann's building is prohibited by the special zoning, which restricts stores to 35 feet of frontage and 3,500 square feet of total space.
EMMONS was turned down for a zoning variance, but refiled, saying that new findings about the difficulties of building on the land qualify it for a hardship variance. Even those opposed to the building expect the variance to be granted when the Board of Standards and Appeals votes on July 18.
The developers say the arguments against the building are specious. "The same building, with a bunch of 3,500-square-foot stores instead of one Loehmann's, would be pretty close to what would be allowed, even with the existing zoning," said Jay A. Segal, a lawyer with Rosenman & Colin who represents the developers.
Anthony Clemenza, Emmons Avenue Development's president, also says he does not understand all the fuss. "This site is in dire need of development, the community board loved our project, and it can bring year-round jobs and people to an area where for 10 months a year you can roll a bowling ball down the street and hit nothing," he said.
Even without Loehmann's, the Emmons Avenue tide is turning toward conventional retailing. Lundy Management Corporation, an investor group, is converting the long-empty landmarked Lundy's restaurant at 19th Street into a covered mall, anchored by a much-smaller version of the original Lundy's and an oriental restaurant on Emmons, and up to 50 small shops inside.
The Department of City Planning also seems ready to give up on a fishing village. A few months ago Mr. Corby's staff issued proposed modifications to the zoning that would allow 50 feet of frontage on stores and would widen the types of stores allowed.
"The district must be made more flexible to mesh with the times," Mr. Corby said.
He certainly gets no argument from George Hofman, who is putting up an 11,000-square-foot retail building at 23d Street and Emmons. Mr. Hoffman says his building is 60 percent rented, but he has had to forgo tenants who would pay higher rents.
"They won't let me put in a bank or a pharmacy or a doctor's office," Mr. Hofman said. "It is the height of absurdity, the tyranny of the few. They've tried for this fishing village for 20 years, it just hasn't worked, and it's not going to work."
Not surprisingly, such talk infuriates the fishing-village proponents. They insist that inadequate parking facilities in Sheepshead Bay have sent would-be anglers and fishing boats to the Jersey Shore and Long Island, and that better parking and touristy-type shops would quickly bring them back.
They insist that Loehmann's and other conventional retail stores could find ample inland space to build. (Mr. Nikas says other available sites are too small.) They want the city to condemn the land along the waterfront and use it to create parking and the type of retailing that would support the fleet.
"A building of the size and scale of the Loehmann's is the worst thing that could happen to the waterfront," said Anne O'Driscoll, president of the Fishing Fleet Association. "What we need is parking, and small stores where you can buy a cup of espresso and a T-shirt for the kids."
That would help the entire district, Mr. Barrison insists. "A fishing village with entertainment and tiny shops will bring more people than a women's discount store," he said.
Maybe so -- provided those people are not wooed away by City Island, that Bronx area near Orchard Beach. The island, once a major shipbuilding center, is replete with seafood restaurants and tiny shops. Le Refuge, an inn, opened there last year. Several community activists want to turn the area into what Jackie Kyle, a local realtor, calls "the next Mystic Seaport," referring to Connecticut's successful nautical tourist spot.
NOT every City Islander loves the idea, though. The island is plagued with traffic congestion, and many residents fear that any influx of tourists, without adequate parking to absorb their cars, would make their streets even more impenetrable than they are now. But there are no developers vying to put up retail behemoths in City Island, and Georgina E. Soccodato, vice president of the Northeast Bronx Coalition, says she is pretty sure that local land owners can be persuaded to convert some of their vacant land to parking.
"City Island is the star of the Bronx; it should be turned into a year-round tourist attraction," she said.
For now, City Island's spruce-up plans are politically stalled. Bronx Assemblyman Stephen B. Kaufman says that the state Urban Development Corporation had committed funds to redo some of the facades of City Island's stores, but the project went on hold when the administration changed.
"My goal is still to get that money and make this a truly beautiful place," he said.
Even city officials admit that City Island has a better chance of making a go of it than does Sheepshead Bay.
"City Island already has the restaurants, the nearby beach and the physical insularity," said Henry J. Stern, the city's Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. "Sheepshead Bay is geographically awkward."
It is also, it seems, a place where only the retail developers are ready to spend money. Mr. Stern's agency recently asked for bids to build a $1.4 million playground and parking lot on some city-owned waterfront property. He figured that in an area where everyone complains so bitterly about inadequate parking, the parking fees would pay back the cost.
There were rumors that Lundy Management would spring for the project, but the June 9 deadline for bids came and went without one submitted bid.
"With all the grand plans, the Loehmann's folks are the only ones who have come up with money for anything," Mr. Stern said.

HEADLINE: NEWS AND TOPICS: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Saving a Wilderness for Tourists,and More Endangered Species

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: MAURICE RIVER TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine a landscape of more jarring contrasts. A river thick with organic debris zigzags slowly across a lush, marshy plain teeming with life. Less than 1,000 feet away, behind a stand of pines, sits a vast, blasted-out desert, humps of exposed sand surrounding a crystal-clear dredging pond that glows an unearthly bluish-green in the sun.
This is the Manumuskin Preserve, 3,257 acres of primeval river, pine-oak forest and abandoned sand mines near the state's southwestern edge. A month ago, after a long and tangled land-use struggle, it was acquired by the Nature Conservancy, the environmental group that buys land all over the country to preserve it forever. 
 Its dedication on June 9 marked the preservation of a gem -- albeit slightly compromised -- that biologists say is home to the largest assemblage of rare and endangered species in the state. In recent years, it was slated first for a hazardous waste dump and then housing with an industrial park.
But the preserve is more than just a fenced-off beauty spot. As the sand mines revert to nature, officials who initially resented the Nature Conservancy's entry into local politics now hope to make the park a centerpiece of a move to bring more nature-based tourism to this scenic but chronically depressed township.
In a community where land use is already severely restricted by state pinelands and coastal zone regulations, local officials seem to be letting go of their dreams of attracting big business and setting their sights on bird-watchers and hikers instead.
"Eco-tourism is the future as we look at it," said Mayor Jack Feltes, who is also public works director for Cumberland County. He added that the township was also trying to persuade the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife to build a $4 million interpretive center in the hamlet of Leesburg.
The township's Delaware Bay coast already draws legions of birders every spring, but this relatively affluent group of tourists have few places to spend their money.
"We certainly have the resources, but we don't have the restaurants and the shops," said Leslie Ficcaglia, chairman of the township planning board and a vocal environmental advocate who envisions a local economy built around bed-and-breakfasts, antique stores and river tours.
Not everyone is so optimistic. "I hang in there because I do hope this area is beginning to develop," said Harry Whitlam, owner of the Port of Call restaurant, just down Route 47 from the preserve. "All I can say is I hope it happens down the road."
Still, such shifts in long-range economic planning are getting a push from Trenton these days. State tourism officials held regional workshops on rural tourism and eco-tourism for local officials and the travel industry in Cape May and Warren Counties this spring.
"Many counties are looking to eco-tourism as a way to develop their assets in a way that is harmonious with the environment," said Linda Conlin, director of travel and tourism in the State Commerce Department. "It encourages both residents and visitors to develop an appreciation of our natural resources while generating a revenue stream to help protect those resources."
The land and water that are now the Manumuskin Preserve have been at the center of a decadelong tug-of-war. In 1986, the state decided that the property -- owned and mined by the Warner Company, now a subsidiary of the global waste-handling giant Waste Management Inc. -- would make an ideal spot for a site ominously known as a hazardous waste entombment facility. But it didn't reckon with the sensitive joint vetch, an endangered relative of the sweet pea that proved to be New Jersey's spotted owl.
The vetch, which bears a delicate yellow flower with a brush of sienna, is not merely a coup for environmental scorekeepers. It is a botanical coal-mine canary, sensitive to the slightest impurity in water or soil, and it grows in only four other spots on the planet. Its presence -- along with that of 31 other rare plants; 15 threatened or endangered birds, including bald eagles, and the pine snake, corn snake and dotted skipper butterfly -- was enough to banish the dump.
Then the landowner proposed expanding its mines and building up to 300 homes and an industrial park. This touched off a three-way litigation brawl involving Waste Management, various environmental groups and the township. Along the way, the Manumuskin and another tributary of the Maurice, as well as the Maurice itself, were designated for Federal protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
Finally, last December, Waste Management sold the tract to the Nature Conservancy for $2.4 million, half the appraised value of the land, and donated the other half. The tract is by far the largest of the conservancy's 23,000 acres of preserves in the state.
On an early summer morning, the Manumuskin smells like its name and looks like the kind of place where you might expect a brontosaurus to come lumbering around the next bend. Its low marsh of spade-leafed arrow arum, purple-spiked pickerel weed, pink swamp rose and fledgling vetch seems to stretch on forever. Marsh wrens twitter from nests hung in the cordgrass, and every 50 feet or so, red-bellied turtles stand like sentries at the edge of the water, sunning themselves on mud banks dotted with holes for muskrats and river otters. The towering and indestructible phragmites, or foxtail grass, that chokes most of the state's less pristine marshes is nowhere to be seen.
Even the former sand mines, which supplied South Jersey's glass industry, have their own stark beauty -- picture a 20-acre pondful of Caribbean dropped down in the middle of a miniature Badlands of wind-sculptured dunes. The water in the dredging ponds is actually pure, exposed groundwater from the 17-trillion-gallon aquifer that underlies most of the Pinelands, and looks green only because of diffracted sunlight.
Jay Laubengeyer, the Nature Conservancy's bioreserve manager, led the way to one of the smaller ponds, undredged for 15 years, where layers of natural sediment have already started to build up, providing habitat for the insect-eating sundew plant on the shore and sunfish and bluegills in the water.
"If that big pond is the 'before' picture," he said, "this is kind of halfway to the 'after.' "

HEADLINE: Junior Achievement

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY and JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE power and influence of New Jersey's delegation to the House of Representatives is etched in stone, literally: dozens of important buildings erected over many years with Federal dollars and the federally subsidized roadways that helped define the state.
The delegation's members were also immortalized by Congressional longevity of legendary proportions and their ability, year after year, to herd billions of dollars to their home turf. 
 But the buildings, the roads and the legends are almost all that remain of such heady days. For the current members of the delegation, Washington and their role bear almost no resemblance to the past and the parliamentary giants whose sometimes dictatorial hold on power meant money and jobs in their districts and assured them of re-election and greater seniority.
The eight Republican and five Democratic House members from New Jersey -- three of them freshmen and two others in just their second term -- came to a brand-new Washington in January for the start of the 104th Congress and its Republican Contract With America. The 1990 Census had reduced their number by one, and a wave of retirements placed the group's seniority at the lowest point in a quarter-century.
Perhaps more significant, it is a group whose moderate bent makes it seem almost liberal in a sea of hard-right conservatives. And for the first time in a generation, the delegation lacks the comfort of a major committee chairmanship.
Despite it all, it is a group that has shown -- at least in the early going -- that it is well suited to thrive in Washington's new, Republican-driven environment of smaller government, tax cutting and less spending.
"People recognize that the New Jersey delegation is not going to be playing second fiddle to anyone," said Representative Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a freshman Republican from Harding, in Morris County.
There was a time when that would not have been an issue.
The Federal office building in Newark bears the name of Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., who became powerful as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and achieved national fame during the 1974 Watergate hearings. The Public Works Committee was headed by Representative James J. Howard, a Democrat who died in 1988 after more than 20 years in Congress. In his career, he doled out billions for construction projects, and Interstate 195, which cuts across the central part of the state, was dedicated to his memory.
"It's arguable that up to a few years ago, New Jersey had the most powerful delegation in the United States," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli of Englewood, the dean of the state's Democratic delegation. "We had three full committee chairmen, and every other Democrat was at least chairman of a subcommittee."
But retirements during the last six years cost the delegation more than a century's worth of House seniority -- Mr. Rodino (40 years), Robert A. Roe (25 years), Matthew J. Rinaldo (20 years), William J. Hughes (20 years), Frank J. Guarini (14 years), Bernard J. Dwyer (12 years) and Dean A. Gallo (10 years) -- and the committee positions and political muscle that longevity traditionally brought.
brought.
Whatever vestige of traditional clout that New Jersey commanded after the retirements between 1988 and 1994 was further eroded by the overwhelming Republican victory that not only stripped Mr. Torricelli and other Democrats of their leadership on subcommittees but also redefined power in Washington.
"Are we as powerful as New Jersey delegations have been historically?" said Representative Bob Franks, of New Providence in Union County, a Republican who began his second term in January. "I don't think anybody is as powerful anymore.
"But there has been a wholesale change in the attitude about what power is around here," he went on. "The definition of an effective congressman before we got here was the biggest pig at the trough, the one who could bring home the most bacon. Now we are about cutting the size of government and spending and that has meant some major adjustments."
What the New Jersey delegation might have lost in individual influence, however, it has made up in a political realignment on Capitol Hill caters to newcomers who are sworn to term limits, budget reduction and tax cuts. With the first Republican majority in 40 years and 73 freshman Republicans, the realignment is nearly revolutionary.
One of the first tasks set by the new Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, was to rewrite House rules so that committee chairman may not serve more than three terms or six years before relinquishing the gavel. Mr. Gingrich also applied the rule to himself.
"It's a different Congress, and more and more of its members don't believe the way to get re-elected is to become Washington insiders," said Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a Republican consultant.
Despite its moderate tilt, the New Jersey delegation has fared well in general under the new conservative House leadership by staking out a centrist position.
"This puts them in the middle in a negotiating role and enables them to gain leverage for New Jersey's interests," Mr. Salmore said.
That point was driven home by a recent debate in the Appropriations Committee over whether to extend the moratorium on offshore drilling. The committee's Republican leadership opposed the extension, but the California and Florida delegations appealed first to New Jersey and then to other coastal states for support and were able to extend the ban.
"The New Jersey delegation did a good job opposing the Clean Water Bill because of its impact on wetlands and by supporting continuing the moratorium on offshore drilling, two pretty important issues for the state," Mr. Salmore said.
IN the delegation, Representative H. James Saxton, an 11-year veteran from Mount Holly, in Burlington County, is the closest to the new center of power. He is vice-chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, the congressional counterpart of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and wrote the Republicans' talking points -- a kind of briefing paper on the points they wanted to emphasize -- in defense of their Contract With America.
But the Speaker ignored seniority in handing out committee assignments.
To the annoyance of some veteran Republican members, Mr. Gingrich bypassed dozens of them in favor of underclassmen who he felt would be less resistant to change and more reliable foot soldiers -- a move that placed three junior members from New Jersey on powerful committees.
That strategy, however, has not always worked to Mr. Gingrich's liking.
In March, Representative William J. Martini, a freshman Republican from Clifton, in Passaic County, was one of the leaders of an uprising against the proposed $500-per-child tax credit that was one of the centerpieces of the Contract With America. Mr. Martini and about 100 Republicans and 23 Democrats were able to force the Speaker to accept an amendment to withhold the credit until Congress guaranteed it could balance the budget.
Although Mr. Martini and the other seven Republicans in the delegation -- including its two other freshmen, Mr. Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo of Vineland, in Cumberland County -- have voted in lockstep with the leadership, the freshman bloc has also exerted some independence.
"We have a fresher point of view that has not been softened by years in the Legislature or by the process, which tends to make incumbents not as forthright," Mr. Martini said. "For this I credit the leadership, which has encouraged us to speak out."
In a shift that was no less profound, the Republicans have made it their mission to cut spending drastically, spending, a move that would shut off yet another measure of traditional power in Washington: pork-barrel politics, or the ability of even low-ranking members to bring millions or billions of dollars home for projects and programs.
"I think we in the New Jersey delegation reflect what has happened to the Congress," said another Republican, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, of Delaware Township in Hunterdon County.
Three terms as the representative for the 12th District in central New Jersey make him senior to more than half of the members of the House.
"It doesn't take as much to be senior anymore," said Mr. Zimmer, who won a seat on Ways and Means, the powerful tax-writing committee. He is the first member of the Ways and Means Committee from New Jersey since Representative Robert Winthrop Kean ( the father of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean), who was a member of the House from 1939 to 1959.
Two other junior members of the delegation have seats on major committees -- Mr. Franks on Budget and Mr. Frelinghuysen on Appropriations.
Despite the changes in Washington politics, the delegation is still tightly united behind the meat-and-potatoes issues of New Jersey politics -- the coast, mass transportation, military-base closing.
"Historically, the New Jersey delegation has pulled together on a bipartisan basis for the good of the state when a broad issue presents itself," said Marge S. Roukema, a Republican from Ridgewood in Bergen County who was elected in 1980.
Mrs. Roukema's 14 years in Congress make her not only the dean of the delegation but also the longest serving of all 49 womenin the House of Representatives.
The Republican majority's largely conservative agenda has given rise to more frequent and much sharper differences than with some of the previous delegations.
"They walked too much in lock step with the leadership in supporting the Contract With America," said Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat from Hudson County who in 1992 became the first Hispanic member from New Jersey. "The delegation as a whole is younger and more conservative in my view, but it is energetic and has several reflective individuals."
Members nowadays are apt to be identified more with the issues that they champion rather than the delegation bloc.
For example:
*Mr. Torricelli, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemispehere of the International Relations Committee and a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, has made foreign affairs, the military and intelligence gathering his domain.
*Representative Donald M. Payne, a four-term Democrat from Newark and the delegation's only black member, is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and a leading expert on African affairs.
*Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat from Long Branch in Monmouth County, with seven years in Washington, is the ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and a leader in the drive to end ocean dumping of sewage sludge.
*Representative Christopher H. Smith, a Republican from Washington Township in Mercer County, has risen to national prominance because of his strong anti-abortion views. From his new position as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, he has introduced legislation that would limit the availability of abortions.
*Mr. Menendez, of Union City, represents one of the most ethnically diverse and urbanized districts in the United States. He has staked out immigration and mass transportation as his specialities.
Seven terms in the House have made Mrs. Roukema a recognized expert on banking issues -- she is chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee -- but not the kind of with the political renown that some of her predecessors had.
"We don't have a lot of marquee names in the delegation anymore," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Bellmawr in Camden County who has spent his five years in Congress preaching budget cuts. "If you were writing about this delegation 10 years ago you would have been talking about the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the chairman of the Public Works Committee and other significant members of the House."
Indeed, the marquee name associated with the New Jersey delegation nowadays is not even a member, but the Governor -- Christine Todd Whitman, a popular Republican who has been talked about as a possible vice presidential candidate in 1996 and was picked by Mr. Gingrich to deliver the party's response to President Clinton's budget message.
That is not to say that the delegation is without its would-be stars.
Mr. Andrews, 37, succeeded Jim Florio -- who left Congress in 1989 to make a successful bid for Governor and was defeated in 1993 by Mrs. Whitman -- and has made it widely known that he is considering a run for the governorship in 1997. Mr. Torricelli, 43, is considered another of the state Democratic Party's rising stars and has also been mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate.
On the Republican side, Mr. Zimmer is seeking the party nomination to challenge the state's senior United States Senator, Bill Bradley, a Democrat, next year. And Mrs. Roukema at least toyed with the idea of a Senate race last year but decided against it.
Compared to the "sagebrush rebels," -- the nickname that Mr. Frelinghuysen and others have assigned to the firebrand conservatives from the West and Northwest who have helped define the new Congress -- even some New Jersey members who are considered conservative back home are viewed in the new Congress as "squishy" Republicans, soft and ill-defined.
But Mr. Frelinghuysen says it isn't ideology but old-fashioned personal contact that enables lawmakers to line up allies in a fight. "I've developed a close working relationship with a colleague on the Budget Committee from California and have been able to ask him for help on legislation when I needed it," he said.
"I've found things much more complex down here than I did when I was a State Assemblyman back home. But one thing that is valuable everywhere in politics and government is the personal touch."

Expect the Unexpected: Spread the Risk

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
WHAT if the optimists are wrong? What if the economy crash lands? Or what if it booms -- and the Federal Reserve jacks up interest rates again, instead of easing them as it did Thursday?
And, to raise a specter that is haunting millions of Americans, what if another stock-market meltdown interrupts the Dow Jones Industrial Average's seemingly unstoppable march to 5,000? 
 The reigning bulls on Wall Street scoff at such fears as doomsday talk. But investors have a right to be nervous for the simple historical reason that bad news usually takes the market by surprise. Few foresaw the 1987 crash, and few anticipated 1994's interest-rate run-up and consequent bond-market disaster.
"The conventional wisdom is so often wrong," said Stephen Savage, the editor of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey. "People just tend to follow it."
To protect themselves against the three great threats to their portfolios -- a surge in interest rates, a bear market and a recession -- analysts urge investors to avoid putting too much money into mutual funds that are overexposed to any one of them.
But that can be tricky. General stock funds are often much less diversified than the investing public imagines, and are thus more vulnerable to economic reversals. More than four-fifths of the Copley fund, for example, is invested in utility stocks, which tend to go down when interest rates go up. Last year, it fell 8 percent as the Fed tightened credit, more than most bond funds.
To find the funds most likely to give investors an unpleasant shock, we sorted through the 1,066 diversified domestic stock funds with assets of least $30 million tracked by Morningstar Inc., a Chicago fund-research firm. We studied their portfolios and history to determine which ones were making the kind of outsized bets that should give investors pause. (The information about the portfolios was the most recent available but in some cases may have been outdated.)
Here, then, is a look at the potential dangers of investing in mutual funds that are overexposed to sudden shifts in the economic landscape.
 
Interest Rates
 Say interest rates head back up -- whether due to a resurgence of anxiety over inflation or a sinking dollar. While anyone who owned a bond fund last year remembers how much those funds can suffer if a manager bets the wrong way on rates, plenty of stock funds can also get hurt. Watch out for any balanced or income fund that has invested heavily in bonds, warned Martin Skala, an editor for Outlook, the investment newsletter published by Standard & Poor's, the New York research firm.
Investors might also want to be cautious about any stock fund with large positions in industries that are traditionally affected by interest-rate moves. Utility companies, which borrow heavily, and financial services like banking and insurance companies are among them. Most funds try to diversify across industries, but many are heavily invested in those areas.
Among the funds that seem to be exceedingly vulnerable to an interest rate swing is the Stratton Monthly Dividend Fund. Although it changed its name from the Energy and Utility Shares a decade ago, this equity-income fund apparently hasn't changed its strategy. Its portfolio is composed entirely of stocks in utilities like Oklahoma Gas & Electric and financial services like real estate investment trusts. To be sure, these stocks are paying the kind of high dividends that shareholders looking for income want. But there is a risk to principle: In 1994, as interest rates rose, the fund fell 12 percent.
Of course, this year's lower rates have already helped some of the funds with sizable holdings in financial services, among this year's best-performing industries. Two funds with more than half of their stock portfolios in bank and insurance stocks, the Vontobel U.S. Value and Weitz Value funds, had gained nearly 20 percent at the end of June. Vontobel, one of the World funds, bet big on financial-services stocks, which made up nearly two thirds of the 36 stocks it owned at the start of the year. While Vontobel didn't fare badly last year, Weitz Value was down nearly 10 percent.
 
Recession
 Investors may also want to make sure their favorite funds aren't betting too heavily on a soft landing. Despite the Fed's best efforts, including Thursday's quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates, there's always a chance the economy will slip into a recession.
If that happens, funds that invest in cyclical industries like heavy manufacturing, which tend to decline in a weakening economy, could perform poorly. And those without much in the way of foreign stocks would lack the protection of gains in countries with growth economies.
Morningstar found that 29 diversified stock funds had invested at least a third of their portfolios in cyclical industries. CGM Capital Development, for example, which is closed to new investors and therefore not on our list of recession-vulnerable funds, had roughly two thirds of its holdings in cyclical stocks at the beginning of the year. The same bet by Ken Heebner, the fund's manager, cost the fund dearly in 1994 when cyclical shares fell out of favor. The fund lost 23 percent of its value, making it one of the year's worst performers.
Funds with a strong geographic emphasis towards America's heartland, such as the Roulston Midwest Growth and Victory Ohio Regional Stock funds, have invested heavily in cyclical stocks, filling more than a third of their respective portfolios.
But a fund's bias isn't always so obvious. The Babson Enterprise II Fund, for example, invests in the stocks of fast-growing small companies, but more than a third of its portfolio is filled with cyclical stocks like Modine Manufacturing or Kennametal. Those stocks, although less expensive than many of the usual high-flying technology issues owned by its peers, helped contribute to a loss of 7 percent last year.
 
Bear Market
 If the Dow ever reverses course from its dizzying 22.6 percent climb this year, including a 38.73-point spurt Friday to 4,702.73, funds that have exhibited the most volatility and have the highest price-to-earnings ratios will probably be hit hardest, analysts say.
One measure of a fund's performance, its so-called beta, is seen as a fairly reliable indicator of how it will fare in both good times and bad with respect to the wider market. The higher a fund's beta, which compares its historical returns with an index, usually the S.& P. 500, the more likely it is to exaggerate the stock market's moves. Morningstar calculates the beta after deducting the T-bill rate from the returns of the fund and the index and comparing those adjusted returns. A fund with a beta of 1.5, for example, is expected to beat the market by 50 percent in a bull market and trail it by 50 percent in a bear market.
Take the Smith Barney Special Equities Fund. It returned a spectacular 32 percent over the year ended June 30. But when the market sputters, the same fund often sinks; in 1990, when the S.& P. 500 fell by 3 percent, the fund nosedived 25 percent. Only investors who don't mind a rollercoaster ride will be able to stomach the next downturn.
Many high-beta funds are also betting heavily on volatile technology stocks, which have had an incredible run this year and have been the subject of continued speculation about when they'll stumble. Oberweis Emerging Growth and Dean Witter Developing Growth have roughly half of their portfolios in these stocks.
A crash wouldn't be pretty. While Oberweis managed to come out of 1990's downturn unscathed, some of the other funds have had some sizable losses during previous bear markets. For example, MFS Managed Sectors fell 14 percent in 1990 and IDS Growth lost 19 percent of its value in 1984. Ancient history? Maybe -- but history has a way of repeating itself.

HEADLINE: Do the Movies Get New York Right?

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
"I ACTUALLY feel pretty comfortable in New York," says a man with a tumble of curls and a deadpan delivery, as he leans against the counter of local cigar store. "I get scared, like, in Sweden." He has his reasons. Sweden is that frightening country where "it's kind of empty" and "everything works." What self-respecting New Yorker would want to live in a place like that?
That unnamed man has an attitude city dwellers can identify with, and the strange thing is that it comes from a movie. "Blue in the Face" (opening in October) is a spinoff of the current "Smoke," set in the same congenial store in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. A plotless series of anecdotes, "Blue in the Face" is a valentine to the voices of New York. That the local man is played by Lou Reed (whose voice is more familiar for singing, "Hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side") only enhances his credentials as a guy with a broad view of New York's possibilities. 
 The city on screen is not usually so easy to recognize. In the movies New York is the place where Holly Golightly traipses through Tiffany's because, she explains, "nothing bad could ever happen" to her there. Who knows how many glamour-struck young women she inspired to come to New York?
But big-screen New York is also the place where, if you step into the subway, you risk getting caught in the crossfire between Charles Bronson and some killer the police don't have a clue how to handle. "Death Wish" is more than the name of the 1974 film that kicked off the Bronson-as-vigilante series. Some movies still imply that "death wish" applies to anyone foolish enough to live here. The Godfather's whole family and all of Woody Allen's alter egos feel at home in New York. Sizing the city up from its appearances on screen, is there any way to know what it's really like to live here?
Not from any one film there isn't. Playing now or coming soon are a half-dozen films set in and largely shot in New York. Following tradition, they portray the city as either benign or vile, New York as Jekyll or Hyde. There is the corrupting New York of "Kids," which opens on July 21 and has already been hyped to death. A fiction film with a documentary look, it trails teen-agers too young to drive, who spend a day scoring drugs in Washington Square Park and comparing sexual conquests. "Kids" is the kind of movie that makes parents across the country want to chain their children to the bedpost at the very mention of New York City. So are "Die Hard With a Vengeance," as Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson pursue a mad bomber all over town, and "Little Odessa," in which Tim Roth plays a home-grown hitman in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.
That perilous vision competes with the glamorous, happy-ending New York, though. In the current comedy "Party Girl," a young woman drifts through the downtown drug and club scene, only to emerge with a passionate desire to become a librarian. "Party Girl," "Smoke" and "Wigstock: The Movie," about the annual drag festival in downtown Manhattan, determinedly depict the city as a place where good outweighs bad.
Terrorists, party girls, mobsters and ordinary folks are all over New York on screen: they just never turn up in the same scenario, the way they do in life. But put the current movies together, like a jigsaw puzzle, and the composite offers a slightly exaggerated but essentially true picture of the complex city real New Yorkers know.
One reason such a composite is possible is that film production in New York is on the rise. It fell disastrously in 1990 when Hollywood studios boycotted the city because of contract disputes with the film-craft unions. New contracts were worked out, and production began to rebound by the end of 1993, resulting in the current influx of New York stories. (Feature film production brought more than half a billion dollars into the city last year, from 157 projects, the highest number ever.) But no one said it would be easy. The filming of "Die Hard with a Vengeance" tied up traffic everywhere from Washington Heights to Wall Street last summer. And just a few weeks ago the trade magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" ran a special New York issue, a huge promotion for production in the city. Its lead article carried a subheading that expresses a typical view of New York: "Actors, directors, producers and other peculiar breeds thrive in the capital of the neurotic and the powerful." I think they meant it as a compliment; take that, Sweden!
But in a small way, there is increased realism in current New York movies. Even the movies that depict New York as glamorous and enticing suggest that living here is not a breeze: high rents and many locks on the door are the admission price to New York's party. And most current movies display a pronounced sense of the city's ethnic mix, though in typically bifurcated fashion. The films about "bad New York" emphasize racial tension while the "good New York" stories suggest a happy melting pot.
The city's official opinion is that any New York movie is a good New York movie if it brings in money. "It's always been our position that we don't censor scripts," says Patricia Reed Scott, the city's film commissioner.
Each of the current films offers a particular vision of the city. The questions are: How realistic are those depictions? What do they say about New York that the movies haven't said before?
 
 
THE ROTTEN APPLE
 In "Kids," New York is the ultimate bad influence, the country's center of corruption. Urinating against a wall and stealing beer and fruit from a local deli are among its characters' more harmless activities. Having unprotected sex, and becoming vulnerable to AIDS, is also an adolescent way of life. Full of hostility, these kids take the downtown No. 6 train from 77th Street (jumping the turnstile, of course), and in Washington Square Park beat a black man with their skateboards for no reason.
Despite its depiction of New York as kiddie hell, though, "Kids" is less a movie than a Rorschach test. That is the secret behind its apparently endless hype. Because the film itself offers no point of view, each audience member can interpret it at will, choosing to see a cautionary tale or documentary realism, choosing to blame New York or merely see the city as a backdrop. The film offers a narrow, exaggerated depiction of a genuine problem that it doesn't try to analyze.
The characters in "Kids" are lower-middle class, but economic status doesn't seem to be the cause of their dissolution. They beat the black man in the park but are part of a friendly crowd that includes black, Hispanic and white kids. In the film's least realistic choice, the characters live in a world without visible parents, as if they were the "Peanuts" gang run amok. The only parent seen is a mother who appears in a single scene, nursing her baby while smoking a cigarette. The supposed realism of "Kids" has more to do with the way it looks than it's New York setting. The close-ups, the jittery documentary style, and the film's universal title (It's not called "Kids in New York.") suggest to the rest of the country, "This is real and it's heading your way."
As for originality, though "Kids" is simply the updated version of "Dead End," the 1937 movie (based on a Broadway play) that introduced the delinquent Dead End Kids and spun off a series of films. In movies of the 30's and 40's, the Lower East Side was a criminal influence on youth who didn't know any better. The characters in "Kids" are the Dead End Kids of today, New York's rotten apples threatening to spoil the rest of the country.
 
 
THE OBSTACLE COURSE
 In the third of the "Die Hard" films, New York is the ideal backdrop to the action formula because the entire city is a ready-made obstacle course. It's difficult to guess what the movie thinks is worse: the fact that someone has planted a bomb on the IRT as it pulls out of the station at 72d and Broadway, or that the two heros are having such a hard time getting through traffic so they can beat the train to Wall Street and prevent the explosion.
There is a whiff of reality that the movie exploits. The bomb that goes off on a subway platform echoes the World Trade Center explosion. On a less serious level, anyone who has ever been stuck in gridlock will feel a certain glee at the way Bruce Willis cuts through Central Park, driving on the grass instead of the road. And the interracial buddy team of Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson comes about reluctantly, when the bomber forces Mr. Willis's character to stand at the corner of 168th and Amsterdam wearing a sign with an ethnic slur on it, and Mr. Jackson saves his life.
But the realism -- racial and otherwise -- is no more than a whiff. This New York is a carnival world where good and evil are played out on a large scale. And though the heros save themselves, the city and the world, "Die Hard With a Vengeance" remains in the "Death Wish" tradition of "Don't go near that subway!"Though most of the movie was shot in New York, the subway crash, in which a bomb causes a train to skitter across the platform, was filmed in a studio in South Carolina.) It's a film that asks, "Why would anyone want to live there?"
 
 
THE FAMILY BUSINESS
 At the start of the small, smart "Little Odessa," Tim Roth walks up to a man sitting on a park bench in broad daylight, shoots him, and calmly walks away. All in a day's work for a member of the Russian-American mafia. New York, after all, is a city of niches and neighborhoods, some of them preserved for mobs.
As Joshua Shapira, a Brighton Beach native, Mr. Roth has been banished from his home turf because he has crossed a local boss. But he's forced to return to do some business and to confront his family: the father who has disowned him, the mother who thought he was dead, the younger brother who admires him. This is a neighborhood story in the tradition of Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets," which means the neighborhood is a place of family unity and deadly violence. Like Mr. Scorsese and his vision of Little Italy, James Gray, who wrote and directed "Little Odessa," puts his home ground on screen in a dramatic way that humanizes its criminals. And like "Mean Streets," "Little Odessa" doesn't pretend to give a comprehensive image of the city, just a convincingly precise one. By the end, the film gives the concept of neighborhoods a chilling new meaning. When a shootout takes place in the back yard of a tract house, under a clothesline where sheets dry in the breeze, the safest places begin to seem sinister.
 
 
BREAKFAST AT MUSTAFA'S
 But the most nerve-racking city lives can still be turned around on screen, though with a trace more difficulty than in earlier movies. Though "Party Girl" has been compared often and obviously to "Breakfast at Tiffany's," the life of Mary, the film's 23-year-old heroine as played by Parker Posey, is less carefree from the start. The film begins with Mary giving a rent party in her Chinatown apartment and being arrested for it.
"Party Girl" puts a contemporary spin on the seductive vision of New York as an all-day-all-night gala. Though Mary has no money, she has a way of gathering up stylish clothes -- a pilfered Chanel jacket here, a Gaultier dress there and lots of leather shorts. A true woman of her times, when she decides to get serious about her job as a library clerk, she smokes a joint and settles down to learn the Dewey Decimal system.
And following a new-movie trend, she has cultivates a perfect balance of multicultural friendships. She has a gay best friend; her male Latino roommate falls for a black woman; Mary herself falls for a Lebanese man named Mustafa, who runs a falafel cart and tells her, "My life here is like Sisyphus."
Obviously, breakfast at Mustafa's is different from breakfast at Tiffany's. In "Party Girl" New York is a place where bad things can happen, but finally don't. "I'm serious about graduate school," Mary wails at a surprise birthday party, as a male stripper dressed as a cop performs for her. Library science is not what entices most people to New York, and Mary's turnabout is the least convincing aspect of the film. But the movie updates the idea that New York can be fun, it can be survived, it can even be conquered.
 
 
DRAG QUEEN FOR A DAY

A real-life party featuring men in big wigs and dresses, "Wigstock" is a documentary about the 10-year-old drag festival that takes place over Labor Day weekend. Filmed in 1993 in Tompkins Square Park and 1994 at the Christopher Street Pier, it, like all documentaries, assumes a point of view. "Wigstock" presents New York as a city of harmless eccentrics who like to dress funny.
Though many performers talk freely about their homosexuality, this is a film that is clearly taking a day off from homophobia and strife. The result is a cheery movie that suggests New York is the place to come if, male or female, you want to be feel comfortable walking down the street in a huge purple wig, and that it is the place to avoid if seeing men in dresses upsets your sense of world order.
 
 
 
ORDINARY NEW YORK

When a young black man named Rashid saves a white novelist named Paul from being hit by a truck, Paul offers him a place to stay. "People don't do that kind of thing," says Rashid. "Not in New York." "Smoke" sets out to prove him wrong.
Written by Paul Auster and directed by Wayne Wang, the film has barely a glimmer of a plot. Instead it is an excuse to invent characters who hang around the Brooklyn Cigar Company, run by a local named Auggie, played by Harvey Keitel. William Hurt, as Paul, is the focus for the film's few strained pronouncements about the city. We hear that Paul's pregnant wife was killed in a bank robbery several years earlier, providing the film's acknowledgment that New York is a randomly violent place. From then on "Smoke" works overtime -- often gracefully but overtime -- to depict New York as an ordinary, friendly neighborhood.
There is a drug-addicted young woman who will presumably get treatment at the end; Rashid's dangerous run-in with criminals has a happy ending too. "Smoke" glosses over the perils of the city too easily, but at least it acknowledges them. Few films even attempt to be as balanced, or to portray ordinary people going about their everyday lives.
Not until "Blue in the Face," is there a sense that this old neighborhood way of life is vanishing. Filled with small parts played by big names like Michael J. Fox and Lily Tomlin and one-names like Madonna and Roseanne, the film's main conflict is that the cigar store might be sold out from under Auggie. As in "Smoke," the problems in "Blue in the Face" are resolved too blithely. But what counts is that this film, built entirely of grace notes, hits some that speak to New Yorkers with an unmistakable aura of truth. As Lou Reed's unnamed character says at the start, capturing the love-hate paradox that may be the heart of the city's identity, "I don't know very many people who live in New York who don't also say, 'But I'm leaving.' I've been thinking of leaving for . . ." and he ponders this before saying, "Thirty-five years. I'm almost ready." No, he's not. What would he do anywhere else?
 
 
 
Celluloid Gotham: Four Takes on the Best New York Films
 CHAZZ PALMINTERI
 
Writer of "A Bronx Tale"; co-starred in movie with Robert De Niro.
 
"For me the greatest film shot in New York, actually shot anywhere for that reason, was 'Raging Bull.' Bob De Niro as Jake LaMotta changed the course of acting for the next generation as Marlon Brando changed the style of acting in the forties."
 
Mr. Palminteri, who grew up in the Bronx on 187th Street and Belmont Avenue, said, "Basically the story was about this medieval village in the Bronx, but it was so truthful and so real about the Bronx."
 
Another favorite: "Midnight Cowboy." "This told this great story of two people and how they connected in New York. It was a gritty, truthful story; it showed the best and worst of New York with a pimp and a derelict and how they met up. Not that New York is all about that.
 
"But the richness of New York is the characters. You can't find them anywhere else like you find in New York. That is why all these people love New York movies. I think obviously because people don't see anyone like this anywhere else. I sit down and tell stories at parties about the people I knew growing up, and people listen for hours and are amazed."
 
One more: "On the Waterfront." He said, "I think it was shot in New Jersey, but it's truly a New York movie."
 
ANDREW SARRIS
 
Film critic for The New York Observer
 
"I think one of my favorite New York films is 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' Well, the idea of it is actually. It has the New York spirit before New York became a Disney theme park, the bright sparkling side of New York that you can partake in without being too rich."
 
Also: "Sweet Smell of Success" and "Dog Day Afternoon." " 'Dog Day Afternoon' because it captured a lot of the gritty quality of the city."
 
"I'm not that crazy about movies shot in New York, but the movies that portray New York, like many of the Astaire-Rogers movies. 'Swing Time,' for example, is the one I love. You have the man looking out on a skyline with a girl and saying, 'Someday this will all be yours.' That's what a New York film is all about. My favorite New York line was in 'Tarnished Lady' with Tallulah Bankhead and Clive Brooke. The Tallulah Bankhead character is married to the character played by Clive Brooke. He loses all his money, and she leaves him and becomes a prostitute. When one of Clive Brooke's friends, played by Osgood Perkins, tries to explain why Tallulah did all this, he said, "Living in New York is very expensive."

JOAN MICKLIN SILVER
 
Director of "Hester Street" and "Crossing Delancey"
 
"The one I love the best is 'Sweet Smell of Success' with Burt Lancaster. He plays a Walter Winchell-type gossip columnist, and Tony Curtis plays a press agent who wants to get his clients' names in the paper. It's about power and celebrity and the people who have it and the people who want to get close to those who have it. What I like about it is that there are gorgeous glistening black and white night shots of New York by the cinematographer James Wong Howe in back of the sort of cynical, marvelous story. The combination is unbeatable.
 
"There is something rhapsodic about the film with the tension of the story line and the gorgeous New York streets at dawn."
 
Another favorite: "Goodfellas." She said, "It has the juice, vitality and the energy of New York in spades."
 
Also: Woody Allen movies about Manhattan. "He's hard on the characters and easy on the city. His movies are beautifully photographed, and the city is so beautifully presented."

J. HOBERMAN
 
Film critic for The Village Voice
 
"In a sense the movie industry started in New York -- it started on 14th Street. There were studios in Brooklyn, upper Manhattan and the Bronx. Film makers just went outside their studio to film on the streets."
 
His favorite movie is "Musketeers of Pig Alley" with Lillian Gish, filmed in 1912. "They just went outside their studio and filmed in 1912, right outside of the studio on East 13th Street. The movie has this immediate quality of being shot on the streets. Even though the story is contrived, it gives a sense of urban life at the time. It's one of the first gangster films.
 
"There are New York movies that aren't even made in New York but are inspired by an imagery of New York. " 'Metropolis,' for example, was made in a studio in Germany in a super skyscraper. It is such a delirious film. The amazing views of New York were all shot indoors. It was inspired by Fritz Lang and his perception of the logic of New York, having the rulers of Metropolis live in the highest skyscraper. The story is kind of silly but you get swept into the sets..
 
"Also I like some underground films like: 'In the Street' by Helen Levitt. She went out into East Harlem around 1946 and documented the children. And that in a way was a precursor to personal street films."

WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
Teen-agers beat black man with their skateboards.
 KIDS
 
BRIGHTON BEACH
 Full of convienent body-burning locales and public benches where a midday murder goes unnoticed. Lots of smoky backrooms and grimy storefronts just right for meetings of hardened and apprentice mafiosi. Immigrant families make their way with traditonal small businesses -- i.e., newsstands, jewelry shops.

 Depicted as the home of plain spoken cigar shop philosophers and squinting, kindly writers. Everybody has mellow, Sunday afternoon air. Even the victim of a violent break-in seems non-plussed.
 SMOKE

 Portrayed as the last refuge of the neighborhood eccentrics
 BLUE IN THE FACE

 CENTRAL PARK
 The streets are packed with impossibly congested traffic, so much so that a 30-minute trip from 72d Street to Wall Street is inconceivable. Thus a roller-coaster detour through the park.
 DIE HARD 3

 WALL STREET
 Victim, again, of a bombing, though the cleanup is quick and the return to relative calm in the movie is almost instantaneous. In the aftermath, there are no gawkers but there are lackadaisical security staffs at local buildings (like the Federal Reserve).
 DIE HARD
 
 HARLEM
 Empty streets except for a group of stoop-sitters ready to assault a man over a placard with a racial slur written on it.
 DIE HARD
 
 Despite a well-timed evacuation of a Harlem elementary school that is the target of a bomb threat, the police misplace three children and must rush back in to rescue them. Bomb threat is bogus.
 DIE HARD
 
 THE BRONX
 Home to teams of vigorous, bustling construction workers building a masive water mains to bring water down from upstate.
 DIE HARD
 
Notes From the Underground
 
The subway images in current films are far from benign.
 In "Die Hard With a Vengeance, " a bomb explodes outside a train and the last car jacknives onto the platform, plowing down people (no one is killed).
In "Kids," a group of teen-agers jump a turnstile at Lexington Avenue and 77th Street. On the platform a beggar sings "Danny Boy." Then, on the the No. 6 train, a beggar with no legs and a T-shirt that says "Kiss Me I'm Polish," comes through singing "I Have No Legs."
In "Little Odessa," Tim Roth, the cold-blooded hitman who snuffs out lives without blinking an eye, is appalled that his ladyfriend plans on taking a subway. "You can get killed," he advises her. (pg. 11)

The Magic in Bad Penmanship

BYLINE: By JOAN NASSIVERA 

 BODY:
THE two bookstores could not be more different.
Barnes & Noble, at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, boasts some 150,000 computer-inventoried titles. Shelves brim with best-sellers, investment guides and celebrity biographies -- staples of a chain synonymous with superstore. 
 Twenty-four blocks north, on Madison Avenue, Jeanette Watson isn't even certain how many books cram the dark wood shelves along Books & Company's exposed brick walls. Hundreds of volumes focus on philosophy and critical theory.
Barnes & Noble caters to the masses; Books & Company to the neighborhood. But they share at least one ingredient for success: "Signings" -- personal appearances by authors -- are a crucial, and growing, part of their business. They aren't alone.
"Book signings are making a comeback," says Claire Schoen, editorial director for Book Publishing Report, an industry newsletter. "More competition among bookstores -- smaller independents versus superstores and superstores against each other -- has led to many more signings."
Lisa Herling, Barnes & Noble's vice president for corporate communications, says signings "get the customer excited and feeling more a part of the store." In Manhattan, she says, the chain will showcase a celebrity like radio shock-jock Howard Stern who can do "straight signings," scribbling his name in book after book. But few writers are fab or famous enough for that so Barnes & Noble is stressing "events tied to authors, like readings and discussion groups."
For an author early signings in the right places can be a path to a best-seller list. "No one wants to be quoted," said Ms. Schoen of Book Publishing report, "but we've had publishers tell us that they do their best to target signings for stores that report to The New York Times and other important lists 'cause once they're up there, sales jump."
Ms. Watson says her customers -- "less media-driven than the superstores' " -- prefer events to straight signings. She longs for the 80's economy when she could afford to do only "readings and signings I believed in." Now, she tries "to maintain quality signings but make sure I sell 40 to 50 books."

HEADLINE: Get Rid of Corporate Welfare

BYLINE: By John R. Kasich; John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, is chairman of the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Not since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969 has the Federal budget been in balance. Inertia propelled Apollo 11 through space to the moon. The Federal budget is similarly subject to the forces of nature.
 Once set in motion, Government programs tend to keep on going, regardless of their utility, fairness or importance. Achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002 depends on an unyielding commitment to scrutinize each program every year. 
 Once Washington creates a program, debate focuses on how much more money it should get, not whether it should exist. The challenge posed in the balanced-budget plan Congress passed on June 29 is to root out the indefensible, the questionable and the nice-to-have-but-unaffordable programs that abound.
 One such program is the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides a form of welfare to United States corporations, including some of our largest, that want to invest in developing countries.
 Compared with the big-ticket Federal outlays -- Medicare, Medicaid, the Defense Department -- the corporation's $58.2 million budget in the 1995 fiscal year is a pittance by Washington standards. But the corporation is a potent symbol of Big Government.
 Established in 1961, the corporation began operating a decade later and is now active in 144 countries. It finances investment through loans and loan guarantees. It insures investment against political risk, expropriation and political violence. And it finances trips abroad by potential investors.
 By many accounts, the corporation is doing a fine job. Not surprisingly, its clients give it high marks. The nations that attract investments gain technologically and economically. American foreign policy objectives are served. The conventional wisdom is that it turns a profit. So what's the problem?

For one thing, the corporation (like Amtrak) offers a service that the private sector should provide.
 Second, many corporation functions are provided at below-market cost, the Congressional Research Service reports, and thus constitute a subsidy. Companies are more likely to use the corporation than private banks and insurers because the Government's services cost less and involve lower risks.
 Third, the corporation skews investment decisions that should be based on free-market principles.
 If the corporation works as well as its business beneficiaries and other proponents proclaim, it should be privatized. But that is not easy to do -- even in a Republican Congress. The House Budget Committee has urged that the corporation be weaned from taxpayers' dollars.
 But the Appropriations Committee actually increased the subsidy for certain loans in a way that would foil privatization. An amendment on the House floor reversed that action.
 The battle over the corporation's future is just one of many battles ahead to reduce the Federal budget.
 During the supposedly lean Reagan years, overall spending jumped from $746 billion in the 1982 fiscal year to $1.1 trillion in the 1989 fiscal year -- a 65 percent increase.
 The balanced budget plan Congress just passed calls for $1.6 trillion in spending in the 1996 fiscal year, growing to $1.9 trillion in fiscal 2002 -- a 19 percent increase.
 Balancing the budget by 2002 will require an unparalleled taming of spending. In part, that means privatizing the Overseas Private Investment Corporation -- and eliminating its corporate welfare.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Eye-Popping Technology Led a Grand First Half for Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund investors are suffering an embarrassment of riches, and they are praying that the pain never stops.
In a stretch that could have made even the most conservative managers positively giddy, mutual funds turned in a roaring second-quarter performance and have had a stellar year in only six months. Judging by the early returns to last week's action by the Federal Reserve, which trimmed a key short-term interest rate by a quarter point, even more good times may be ahead. 
 Let's get out of the way the not-insignificant disclaimer that most fund managers again failed to outperform the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. The average diversified domestic equity fund gained 8.91 percent in the quarter, lagging the 9.5 percent gain in Vanguard's Index 500 fund, which tracks the benchmark.
That said, consider the good news. Equity fund investors were just about assured of making money last quarter, provided that they didn't own a fund specializing in gold or Japan or health maintenance organizations. The average equity fund's second-quarter return beat its first-quarter performance by 1.5 percentage points. International stock funds reversed a six-month slide, finishing the three months with a total return of 5.84 percent. The strength in stocks is best portrayed by an astounding statistic gleaned from the reams of data crunched by the mutual fund trackers at Morningstar Inc.: of the 1,085 funds that make general United States equity market investments -- that is, that aren't "bear market" funds, designed to benefit from an unfavorable climate, or that don't specialize in a single sector -- exactly two lost money in the quarter.
Buyers of bond funds fared well, too. The average domestic taxable bond fund jumped 5.25 percent in value, while municipal bond funds suffered a tougher quarter, rising only 1.96 percent.
All of those returns pale next to the white-hot profits of technology funds. Two Fidelity Select funds -- the electronics and the computer portfolios -- jumped 32.2 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively, capturing the No. 1 and 3 spots among all domestic stock funds. Seligman Communications and Information, which is among the best performers over just about any time period, was No. 2, tacking a 29.7 percent return onto a 14 percent first-quarter performance.
Two questions rest on nearly every fund investor's lips, of course: When will the technology rally end? And when will the Fidelity Magellan fund start selling? The answer to the latter question, many think, holds the answer to the former.
Jeff Vinik, manager of the $46 billion Magellan fund, 40 percent of which is in technology stocks, addressed that issue in a recent speech in New York. "Every time technology stocks go through a correction, everyone wonders if I'm selling," Mr. Vinik said. "They must have said it 10 times in the last year. It's ridiculous."
Mr. Vinik has taken a hard look at the alternatives and likes technology best. "The best companies with the best fundamentals and with the best valuations are in technology," he said. "I think the best technology stocks could go up for 5 to 10 years in the 1990's. We're only 2 years into that rally."
 
Comes the Second Half
 The first half of 1995 has been a grand one for virtually all types of funds, not just technology. The funds most widely owned by American investors, diversified funds that buy domestic equities, jumped 17 percent in the first half. Domestic taxable and municipal bonds rose 9.1 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. And international stock funds have rebounded from losses, finishing the first half up 2.8 percent.
Given those returns, the question worth asking is what a fund manager does for an encore in the second half.
Ronald E. Elijah, manager of the Robertson Stephens Value and Growth fund, said he didn't think three-or six-month periods mean much. "What we're trying to do is find the best growth companies for the next three years," he said.
Right now, Mr. Elijah sees those companies in one place: technology. Close to 70 percent of his fund is invested in the sector, and that heavy concentration brought the fund a return of 22 percent in the second quarter and 40 percent in the first half.
Mr. Elijah contends, however, that all the technology companies he owns don't fit so nicely into one category. "I own Nokia and Ericsson, which are cellular phone companies. I own Compaq, a PC manufacturer. And I own Parametric Technology, which makes computer-design software." The point, he said, is that different factors affect each companies, although they are lumped together under technology.
"If you do that to me, you have to do it with any manager who owns interest-rate sensitive companies," he said, lumping together, for example, auto makers, banks and insurance underwriters.
Not all of Mr. Elijah's favorites are computer-related. His third-largest holding is Amgen, the biotech company. "It's the drug company of the future," he said. "It's cheap, and it has a good pipeline of products."
And he still likes health maintenance organizations, a sector that was crushed in April when U.S. Healthcare warned that tougher competition and a rise in medical costs had hurt its first-quarter earnings.
The Value and Growth fund owns four H.M.O.s, Mr. Elijah said, and he uses the sector to provide a peek at how he manages portfolio turnover to minimize the fund's capital gains payouts. That especially benefits investors who have non-I.R.A. money in the fund. Last year, for example, the Value and Growth fund had a 23 percent gain but paid only 20 cents a share -- roughly 1.2 percent -- in capital gains to its investors.
Mr. Elijah explained that after the H.M.O.s were beaten up, he sold a lagging position in United Healthcare, another H.M.O. whose earnings disappointed investors. That gave him capital losses to offset gains racked up in a number of other stocks. After a required 30-day waiting period, he again bought United Healthcare.
If Mr. Elijah isn't interested in changing course, Alfred Harrison, manager of the Alliance Premier Growth fund, is not so sanguine. "If I were a nine in bullishness for the last several years, I've dropped down to a seven in the last two weeks," he said last week, before the Fed's rate cut.
He is also taking profits, "at the margin, out of things like technology." While the sector will remain the fund's largest, Mr. Harrison is buying "teddy bear stocks" -- companies he can sleep with at night. Among those he likes are McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Gillette.
While both technology and big consumer companies have been popular for several quarters, a potentially more interesting corner of the stock market lies with companies that have small capitalizations.
Small stocks have lagged significantly. The Russell 2000 index, the benchmark for small-cap stocks, gained only 13.3 percent in the first half, well below the 18.8 percent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 24.1 percent gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index. Investors have found that small-cap funds have performed smartly -- provided they owned plenty of tech stocks.
 
Off the Beaten Path
 That's the case with Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity, a $35 million fund that recorded a 20.5 percent return in the second quarter. That followed a mediocre first quarter, however, so the fund is up only 23 percent since the beginning of the year.
Just about everything you need to know about the Navellier fund is in its name. It is managed by Louis Navellier, a newsletter writer based in Incline Village, Nev., near Reno. Mr. Navellier leaves the beaten path in search of stocks, often buying thinly traded issues that are subject to wide price swings, sometimes because of his actual or suspected presence. And the manager likes small companies, typically those with market values of less than $500 million.
Mr. Navellier explains that he tries to diversify his fund, rarely having more than 4 percent of assets in a single company and no more than 20 percent in one industry. But he has a trick calculator: 20 percent of the fund is in the semiconductor industry, 17 percent in communications and a similar chunk in software and peripherals. In total, Mr. Navellier acknowledges, 55 percent of the fund is in technology.
Mr. Navellier's methods -- as well as the great variation in first- and second-quarter performance -- warrant some cautionary notes. A stock's attractiveness depends heavily on its momentum. "The better things work, the more we emphasize it," Mr. Navellier explained.
Buying more of the stocks in your portfolio that have performed the best has potential pitfalls, however. When enough other investors follow you into the same stocks, ownership can become dangerously concentrated. When it's time to sell, therefore, there might be no buyers.
For his part, Mr. Navellier says he has plenty of places to put the fund's money. The fund holds only about 70 stocks at one time, out of about 1,700 companies on which Mr. Navellier tracks financial information.
The small-cap universe is big enough for all types, and with varying results. That's aptly demonstrated by the Crabbe Huson Special fund, which, like Navellier, favors companies further down the food chain. The fund, managed by James E. Crabbe, posted a gain of a mere 1.13 percent in the second quarter. Thanks to a more respectable first-quarter performance, the fund is up 7.6 percent through the six months.
There is one good reason for the recent poor performance: Mr. Crabbe is shorting technology stocks. In the last month, the manager said, the fund has allotted 25 percent of its assets, the maximum allowable portion, to a bet that stocks will fall. Not just any stocks, mind you, but technology stocks.
"So far, that strategy has cost us seven to eight percentage points" in the rankings, Mr. Crabbe said. But he still questions the fervor with which funds and institutions have embraced the sector. Much of that enthusiasm rests on the introduction, expected in August, of Windows 95, Microsoft's new computer operating system. "It's going to be a great product," he said, "but I think we'll have a fair distance to go before it is suitable for everyone's machine."
In the meantime, Mr. Crabbe remains convinced that the sector is overpriced. "When funds like Fidelity Magellan have close to 50 percent of their money in technology stocks, those are the kinds of things of which corrections are made."
If a correction comes, Crabbe Huson Special fund will be ready.

<HEADLINEA Champion of the Technically Challenged and Overwhelmed

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY 

DATELINE: FOSTER CITY, Calif.

 BODY:
AT first blush, it's your basic Silicon Valley success story: brash, 30-something executive markets breakthrough product and leads tiny company to fame and profit. Then again, there's a lot in the tale of John J. Kilcullen and the " . . . for Dummies" publishing phenomenon that could have come straight from Broadway.
For starters, take the concept itself -- a line of how-to computer and personal finance books written specifically for people willing to admit, indeed to glory, in their own ignorance and technophobia. Major booksellers and publishers, who said readers wouldn't buy books about their inadequacies, now clamor to stock or to imitate the bright yellow and black paperback volumes that take the side of people challenged by the complexities of modern life, making the series "a reference for the rest of us." 
 And there's Mr. Kilcullen -- a working-class kid from the Bronx, a former altar boy with a Type A personality, with an instinct for promotion and packaging that would have shamed P. T. Barnum.
Then there's Mr. Kilcullen's ascent. Five years ago, as part of the small team that started IDG Books Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Boston-based International Data Group, Mr. Kilcullen's job was directing sales and distribution. But when the top man was yanked away early on to head another IDG subsidiary, young Mr. Kilcullen, like the proverbial Broadway understudy, stepped in to the leading role.
Out of that early chaos came two nondescript books on computer games, and then the runaway hit "DOS for Dummies," Dan Gookin's sassy, irreverent reference book that became the prototype for the "Dummies" series. But like most history, the particulars are in some dispute. IDG's "official" version is that Mr. Kilcullen was visiting a computer store in 1987 and overheard a customer ask a clerk for a very simple computer primer -- something, the customer pleaded, like "DOS for Dummies."
Mr. Gookin and Michael McCarthy, a former editor in chief for IDG Books, say the idea sprang from Mr. McCarthy's Uncle Huey, a chemist who complained that books on computer operating systems were either insulting or impenetrable.
In any case, as president and chief executive of IDG Books, Mr. Kilcullen, 36, oversees a company of more than 200 employees, with annual revenue last year of $50 million -- about 70 percent of it from the "Dummies" books. That gives IDG Books about a third of the computer trade book market. Another third belongs to archrival Macmillan Computer Publishing, a division of Simon & Schuster that jumped on the technophobe bandwagon with "The Complete Idiot's Guide."
"We probably didn't recognize that there were so many new computer users," says Macmillan's vice president and publisher, David G. Israel. "We had tried various forms of cartoons and humor in books for casual users, but without success. The market grew and Dan Gookin wrote a really good book. IDG hit gold."
IDG, meanwhile, keeps cranking out "Dummies" titles on topics that range from camcorders and V.C.R.'s to taxes and mutual funds. More than 18 million copies have been sold, and there are translations of the more popular titles in 26 languages. In the wings is a whole line of general interest "Dummies" volumes, including "Sex for Dummies," by Dr. Ruth Westheimer, set for release in August.
So what does a young publishing executive who has turned the computer book industry on its ear do for an encore? "You're always looking for T-N-B-T," Mr. Kilcullen says. "The Next Big Thing."
At the moment he is flicking specks of dust from his immaculate black conference table and chatting on the speakerphone with his corporate shrink. They are planning this year's management retreat, which will focus on something about enhancing managers' ability to communicate with the staff.
"Silence," Mr. Kilcullen tells a visitor, "is anything but consent. Right, Dr. B?"
"Dr. B" is Stephen Berglas, a Boston-based psychologist who helps executives cope with stress. Mr. Kilcullen hired him two years ago to consult on personnel matters and to ease the company's transition from a freewheeling start-up to a more disciplined, hierarchical organization.
The doctor is helping Mr. Kilcullen to make a similar transition. Apparently, for this enormously successful salesman and promoter, The Next Big Thing is to learn to be the boss. He has the traditional C.E.O. trappings in his spacious office -- congratulations from Patrick McGovern, IDG's chairman, a plaque proclaiming "4th Quarter 1992, Greatest Improvement in Profit Margin Over Plan" -- but he knows he needs to change to succeed in the job.
The psychologist has presented a variety of knickknacks to Mr. Kilcullen as reminders of his managerial role. One is a brass mirror that carries a tiny plaque that reads, "You Are the CEO, You Are the CEO."
Another is a drawing of the biblical story of King Solomon ordering the infant to be cut in half to settle the dispute between two women claiming to be its mother. It was, Mr. Kilcullen explains, the doctor's way of reminding him "to let the system tolerate conflict while you take the heat."
But for all the reminders of his executive responsibilities, Mr. Kilcullen can't seem to pry himself from the smallest details of "Dummies" promotion. "He's very much a graphic-oriented person, definitely left brain," says Polly Adams Papsadore, marketing director for IDG Books. She has come to Mr. Kilcullen's office to show him plans for an exhibit at an upcoming book sellers' conference, and he pores over the details.
And when he struck his deal with Dr. Ruth, Mr. Kilcullen, ever the salesman, wanted to print T-shirts with her picture on them. The sexologist said no.
HE has another trait incongruous for a boss: a populist identification with the underdog. "I like to hire people who have a point to prove," he says, "people who have great ideas like I did in New York City. I left because I wasn't being heard in that kind of dictatorial environment."
Mr. Kilcullen, who is married and has a young son, graduated with a degree in communications from Fordham University and spent 14 years working his way up the sales ladder in the technical books divisions of Bantam, Prentice Hall and elsewhere.
"Editors," he snorts. "I think most of the editors I knew back East were effete snobs who showed an acute disdain for the sales and marketing side. It made me sick."
This is the Bronx kid talking, the son of Irish immigrants who shared his parents' three-bedroom apartment with seven siblings and is proud of it. His mother, a retired waitress, pushed them all through Catholic school and on to professional careers. His father was a truck driver.
The chief executive's sympathies for the underdog may be the secret of his success with "Dummies." True, he and others say that his resemblance to the nerdy cartoon character in the "Dummies" logo is entirely a coincidence. But there is no denying that Mr. Kilcullen encourages his authors to take an iconoclastic tone toward the computer industry and their other subjects, and that this attitude reflects his own world view.
"I'm a user, not a programmer," he says. "I'm probably one of the least technically adept people in the company."
The heart of the "Dummies" books, he says, is their appeal to "people who are working two jobs, to single parents, folks who've been downsized out of a job and know they lack the skills to get a new one."
A love of risk sets Mr. Kilcullen apart. "My mother used to say: 'John, go work for the telephone company. You'll get a pension and you'll be set,' " he recalls. "I've always had a risk orientation."
The gambit with Dr. Ruth proves the point. While the "Dummies" strategy works for books on technical subjects, nontechnical ones are iffier, especially one on sex.
Mr. Israel of Macmillan Publishing saw the risk -- and backed off. "We tossed around the idea of a sex book last summer, and we just couldn't believe you could cross that line," he says. "Who walks up to the cash register and says give me a book about sex for dummies?"

HEADLINE: Affirmative Reaction;
For the Civil Rights Movement, A New Reason for Living

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DEFEAT can be demoralizing; setbacks can rejuvenate. After a string of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court, civil rights groups and their political allies are now trying to figure out whether they have opportunity or only despair.
 As they do, a small number -- mind you, a very small number -- of liberal strategists and thinkers, black and white, are moving beyond the hand-wringing that has greeted the Court's decisions last month limiting Federal affirmative action programs and the drawing of election districts to concentrate minority votes. To these contrarians, the decisions may give a new sense of urgency to a movement whose influence and membership have waned and whose leadership has often been ineffective. 
 The setbacks also may help, the argument goes, by narrowing the scope of the battle and focusing attention on the programs that are still legally acceptable but that conservatives want to abolish. And finally, some political scientists said, the Court's redistricting decision may force blacks into more multi-ethnic coalitions and end up widening the political influence of minorities, which in many places has been bottled up by concentrating them in a few electoral districts.
 "The movement generally has worked best when there is a certain and definable target," said Gwen Daye Richardson, editor of the magazine National Minority Politics, who is critical of affirmative action programs but acknowledges that they can serve as effective political rallying points. "Part of the reason why it has appeared to be less focused in the last several years is that there hasn't been one."

 
 
The Counter-Argument
 And some political and social scientists say the movement can now move away from affirmative action programs like numerical set-asides that have proven most difficult to defend. These, the argument goes, have allowed opponents to batter the movement with a compelling moral counter-argument -- the case for color-blindness.
 Stripped of the claim on righteousness that gave the civil rights movement its historic authority, the movement has been painted by its opponents as just another interest group, not so different from the American Association of Retired Persons or the American Grocers Association.
 Given this, and given the economic uncertainties that many whites feel, the fate of affirmative action has become "solely and completely a political question," said David Bositis, a senior researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, an organization that studies issues regarding race. "It has nothing to do with whether there is still discrimination in the United States."
 For some, the Court's decisions do more than provide an incentive to organize. In Adarand Constructors v. Pena, for example, the Court sharply limited the Federal Government's authority to give minorities special preferences in awarding Federal contracts. While civil rights leaders decry the decision, they note that the Court did not prohibit race-based programs, as some Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Representative Charles Canady of Florida, have proposed.
 In essence, the Court has given civil rights groups more clearly marked ground to defend; they can make the case that ending all preference programs is more than a conservative Supreme Court says is necessary or desirable.
 "I really do think that Adarand has been helpful in shifting the terms of the debate on affirmative action in Congress," said Wade Henderson, legislative director for the N.A.A.C.P. "Bills like Dole's and Canady's now become the extreme. That is certainly going to be our tack, anyway."
 Some political scientists also argue that the Court's decision in Miller v. Johnson, which restricted the ability of states to carve out majority black or Hispanic election districts, might increase minority influence in the electoral politics rather than reduce it. These political scientists assert that for minorities to salvage policies like affirmative action they will have to exert political pressure on white lawmakers who may be wavering. That can most effectively be done, they say, not by packing black and Hispanic voters into a few districts but by spreading them around.
 Carol M. Swain, associate professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University and author of "Black Faces, Black Interest: the Representation of African Americans in Congress" (Harvard University Press), believes that concentrating blacks in a few districts "wastes black votes and black influence."
 "White voters tend to be more conservative, and when a politician's district is 20 or 30 percent black, they have a mediating influence," Ms. Swain said. "Last time, candidates said things they would never had said if they had a large minority population."
 Ms. Swain and some other civil rights experts say that reducing the minority population in a district to 30 or 40 percent from 50 or 60 percent will not necessarily mean the end of black representation, either. Instead, they argue, it could force black politicians to move more toward the center and to work harder at building multi-ethnic coalitions.
 "It will force people to look at getting what they want in a different way, using the system differently, focusing less on guarantees and more on negotiations and coalition-building, which I think is a good thing," said Ms. Richardson. "I think that whole guarantee business makes people lazy and makes people operate under a false assumption. It just doesn't force people to operate in a larger arena."
 Many people argue in response, of course, that the specially drawn districts are needed to elect blacks and Hispanics since whites will not vote for them. But the victories of Representatives Gary Franks of Connecticut and J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, both Republicans, in overwhelmingly white districts, and the 1989 election of L. Douglas Wilder as Virginia's Governor raise questions about that view.
 Among Democrats, another prototype of the new black politician may be Sanford D. Bishop Jr., a centrist from Georgia who was elected in 1992 with the strong backing of the white business community. Blacks are a slim majority, 52 percent, of the voting-age population in Mr. Bishop's district.

 
 
The Dropouts
 Whether the civil rights movement will grasp the opportunities flowing from last month's decisions, or whether it would make any difference if they do, is anybody's guess. But nearly everyone on the left -- and some on the right -- agree the modern-day civil rights movement could use a restorative. In recent years, many people feel, it has grown intellectually flabby, organizationally creaky and politically irrelevant.
 The once-mighty N.A.A.C.P. is virtually bankrupt financially and during the last year has been engaged in internal bickering and allegations of financial chicanery on the part of its leaders. According to internal documents, its rolls have fallen to a projected 310,000 members, a far cry from the nearly 500,000 people who belonged to the organization in the 1960's through the mid-1970's.
 Other mainstream civil rights groups like the National Urban League continue to struggle; some, like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference -- the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s old organization -- exist in name only.
 In Congress, although the number of blacks has risen to 41, its highest level ever, last November's Republican takeover of both houses has left the Congressional Black Caucus marginalized.
 Once again, some feel that the perceived assault on affirmative action may help mobilize support. In the last few decades, organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. have had a difficult time recruiting young African-American professionals, while black professional and trade organizations made up of accountants, lawyers, doctors and technicians have proliferated.
 Such groups have provided the type of career opportunities, mainly through personal networking, that broad-based civil rights groups cannot. But they lack the size and potential clout that a group like the N.A.A.C.P could bring to bear. With affirmative action under attack, black professionals may return to the fold.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
New Hampshire, First Again

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

 BODY:
FOR as long as there have been Presidential primaries, New Hampshire has insisted on having the first. And for as as long as New Hampshire has been first, other states have sought to challenge its primacy, moving up their own primary dates. 
 This year, the pressure is particularly intense. For the first time, there will be one Presidential primary -- Delaware's -- within a week of New Hampshire's, a development that has been greeted here with a steady stream of invective. New York has advanced its primary, and so has California. Indeed, over the last few months, so many states have shifted their electoral calendars that the 1996 Presidential primary process promises to be by far the shortest ever.

 
 
Not Enough Time
 Yet as other states move up their primaries to challenge New Hampshire's influence, the changes seem to be having precisely the reverse effect.
The fast pace of the race means that candidates won't have time to campaign actively in other states, or even to figure out which states they would be best off campaigning in. It also means the only news most voters will hear before they go to the polls is the story coming out of New Hampshire. And so, most political analysts agree, by advancing their primaries, the other states have unwittingly given New Hampshire voters that much more power.
 Next year, New Hampshire's primary is scheduled for Feb. 20 and Delaware's for Feb. 24. New Yorkers, who used to go the polls in April, will vote on March 7, and Californians, who used to wait until June, will vote on March 26. By April Fool's Day, roughly three-quarters of all the Republican delegates will have been chosen.
 "I think New Hampshire will be more pivotal than ever," said Tad Devine, a Democratic political consultant who has worked on several New Hampshire primary races. "There will be this slingshot effect: whoever does well in New Hampshire is just going to be propelled out of the state."
 By all indications, the Presidential candidates think so, too. On any given day, it seems, at least one of them is here.
 Both Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas were in the state last week, rushing from parade to parade and sharing the stage at a pig roast. Gov. Pete Wilson of California also visited over the holiday weekend to press some flesh. Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee was here much of last week, walking 18 miles from Concord to Manchester.
 New Hampshire's ever-expanding influence is especially striking because this is such a small, quirky and in many ways unrepresentative state. It has no major cities, and its population is almost entirely white. It is one of only two states in the country -- the other is Alaska -- that has neither a sales tax nor a personal income tax.
 Nor are New Hampshire voters shy about making their quirkiness count. The state's politicians speak openly about the need for candidates to tailor their message to New Hampshire, and most candidates have special advisory committees to alert them to issues of local importance.
 Robert Rabuck, a member of Senator Gramm's New Hampshire steering committee, delicately refers to the state's parochial concerns as "peculiarities." Among the advice his committee has given Mr. Gramm is to play down the issue of immigration. "We border on Quebec," he noted. "So that's not an issue that has a lot of resonance." On the other hand, he said, the committee had urged Mr. Gramm to play up his support for gun owners' rights.
 "Every state tells you they're different," said Alex Castellanos, Senator Gramm's media consultant. "In New Hampshire, they mean it."

 
 
Making National Policy
 New Hampshire's "peculiarities" can have profound, though generally unpredictable, effects on the eventual governance of the country. Four years ago, for example, candidate Bill Clinton came here prepared to stress welfare reform, but early sampling of public opinion convinced him this was a losing issue in a state still suffering from a lingering recession, where many voters worried that they could soon need the Government's help. Mr. Clinton shifted his message and began to talk about topics like health care reform, which became a centerpiece of his successful campaign (and, of course, led to the creation of the sweeping health care plan that was defeated by Congress last year).
 If New Hampshire voters exert an undue influence on the selection of the President, though, they also take seriously the responsibilities that come with that influence. They are famous for insisting on contact with the candidates -- Mr. Castellanos recalled meeting one elderly New Hampshire woman who said she would not vote for any candidate she had not danced with -- and many take the time to meet them face to face.
 "New Hampshire has a very informed, involved electorate," said Stuart Stevens, media consultant to Senator Dole, who is widely seen as the New Hampshire front-runner. "I can't see anything but good in that."

HEADLINE: The World;
Everyone's Too Busy To Be Africa's Leader

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
IF continents placed want ads, Africa's current listing might read something like this: Needed, economic power center with strong political commitment to the African neighborhood and healthy democratic instincts, to help build continental prosperity.
 But there would be a problem: Nobody would be applying for the job, even though the continent is not without candidates whose resumes are available. 
 Since their own rivalries quieted, it is obvious that the United States and Russia have lost virtually all interest in helping the continent build a future.
 More surprising, perhaps, nobody in Africa is stepping forward to fill the vacuum -- even as slaughters unfold, elections are stolen, human rights are trampled and millions of lives are blighted by the prospect of perpetual misery in various corners of the continent.

 
 
Reluctant Giants
For a long time now Nigeria and South Africa have stood out as the most natural respondents to Africa's call of distress. But Nigeria, which until recently openly aspired to continental leadership even though it has never been successful at maintaining a democracy, has now stepped completely into the shadows. And South Africa seems reluctant to pick up the role.
 On the surface, the two countries could hardly seem to share more sharply contrasting fortunes: Nigeria is locked in a revolving door of military dictatorships that have sunk it in deep decay even as South Africa rises powerfully on the wings of an expanding economy and the global prestige of President Nelson Mandela.
 But on the continental stage, both remain giants who anchor the northern and southern regions of black Africa, respectively. And to the distress of many African intellectuals, both seem either unwilling or unable to fulfill their leadership potential.
 "If you look at Asia or Latin America, you can see the contours of a continental vision," said Makau wa Matua, a Kenyan who is director of the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School. "But with a Nigeria that is collapsing and a South Africa that is uncertain of its continental destiny, you have no one to articulate any kind of continental vision. There are no targets, no common objectives and no one to emulate anymore."
 Increasingly since the death of apartheid, economic influence has been emanating from South Africa's entrepreneurs -- they are making investments abroad, building communications headquarters and forging rail links with their neighbors -- and someday, it is clear, this is likely to translate into political influence. Similarly, Nigeria's current torpor has not stilled its neighbors' yearning for a more responsible government there, if only because Nigeria represents the region's largest commercial market and its political turmoil is the greatest threat to regional stability. So there is reason to think both countries will be under pressure to assume political leadership someday -- to become the voices that work for economic growth and integration, promote human rights and encourage honest election practices.
 The point is that they are not doing so now. And African intellectuals say they are as shocked by Nigeria's demise in this role as they are disappointed by South Africa's reluctance to fill it. Almost since attaining independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, with 100 million people, sought to project its power and influence. And during the last two decades, when it was taking in as much as $60 million a day in oil revenue, it pursued a sort of checkbook diplomacy that clashes strikingly with prevalent images of Africa as a helpless beggar continent.
 Nigeria helped underwrite the struggle against apartheid in South Africa and sent troops to places like war-torn Liberia, footing a $2 billion bill for peacekeeping efforts there. And when the man who was then Foreign Minister, Bolaji Akinyemi, spoke in 1987 of Nigeria becoming the defender of black people the world over and obtaining nuclear weapons, many might have worried, but few laughed.
 Mr. Akinyemi's fortunes sadly mirror those of his country. Today he is in exile in London, where he lobbies against the dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha and sounds a note that reflects the scarcely concealed jealousy of much of his country's political elite over South Africa's ascendancy.
 "In South Africa, the economy, the civil service and the military are still dominated by whites who would object to their country taking on greater commitments in Africa," Mr. Akinyemi said. "Nigeria is the only country that has the historical vision to play that role."

 
 
Deeper Isolation
 But Nigeria's oil revenues are now down to $9 billion a year from $22 billion a few years ago because of a combination of mismanagement and falling prices. Meanwhile, under General Abacha, the military's unabashedly venal and power-obsessed brand of politics has thrust Nigeria into deepening isolation. So few people are holding their breath.
 South Africa's recent trajectory is almost the exact opposite of Nigeria's. Each month, new business deals spread the country's economic tentacles wider. Meanwhile, Africans by the thousands who are sick of arbitrary rule and economic stagnation are streaming to the new promised land, not just as squatters from war-devastated neighbors like Mozambique, but as professors, doctors, lawyers and businessmen from faraway West and East Africa.
 But Mr. Mandela seems to want none of the continental leadership franchise. Voting with his own feet, in a gesture that was widely noted around Africa, he chose to prepare for a trip to Asia last week rather than attend an annual Organization of African Unity summit meeting in Ethiopia, where the main order of business was peacekeeping and conflict resolution.
 "South Africa has been far too timid in sounding its voice and condemning human rights abuses elsewhere in the continent," said David Welsch, a professor of political science at the University of Cape Town. "We are acting out of an outmoded African view of solidarity with the continent that is being abandoned everywhere else. And in the meantime we are wasting a tremendous opportunity to use our newfound prestige as a force for change."
 For Mr. Matua, however, South Africa's rise to political prominence on the continent will naturally follow the country's own political consolidation and spreading economic influence. The only question, and it is a major one, is whether this will all happen quickly enough to make a difference in arresting the slide toward disintegration in countries in every region of Africa.
 "Mandela does not want to be seen by his peers as the child who was born yesterday who is preaching to the elders," he said. "South Africa is bound to settle into Africa; after Mandela passes from the scene, his successors will inevitably pursue a more aggressive policy."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
An Awful Milestone for the Golden Gate Bridge

BYLINE: By JEFF STRYKER; Jeff Stryker is a health policy analyst.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
THE chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge, Joseph B. Strauss, predicted that his master work, finished in May 1937, would be "practically suicide-proof."
 Mr. Strauss has been proved wrong a thousand times over -- or thereabouts. 
 The world's most beautiful bridge is, alas, also a suicide shrine, a powerful lure for those not content with merely shuffling off this mortal coil. The bridge acts as what tort lawyers would call an "attractive nuisance," a magnet to those inclined toward self-destruction, including many who might not otherwise kill themselves.

 
 
A Grand Opportunity
 Any fan of detective novels will tell you that murder requires both motive and opportunity. Suicide is no different. Much of suicide prevention is concerned with reducing opportunities for suicide, cutting down on what epidemiologists call environmental risks, like loaded firearms and ledges without rails. The Golden Gate is one hulking monster of an environmental risk, looming some 250 feet over the churning waters.
 It is not the only architectural marvel to draw the suicidal. In the 1930's and 40's, 16 people leaped to their deaths from the Empire State Building; finally, an insurmountable fence was put on the observation tower.
 Should the Golden Gate be fixed, too? That question has been debated for a half century, pitting esthetics against economics, autonomy against paternalism. The debate is at once both practical and profoundly philosophical. Can a barrier be erected that won't be ugly? Is it always right to try to stop adults who wish to commit suicide?
 The Golden Gate Bridge had been open for barely three months when the first suicide took place. Harold B. Wobber, a 47-year-old bargeman, took a bus to the bridge, along the way befriending a vacationing college professor from Connecticut. Together they strolled across the 1.6-mile span. Mr. Wobber tossed his coat and vest to his new acquaintance and said: "This is where I get off. I'm going to jump." The professor grabbed Mr. Wobber's belt, but he slipped free and leapt into the San Francisco Bay.
 Today, the grim tally approaches 1,000. The California Highway Patrol refuses to assign a number to any individual death, because they see the countdown as a bit of a lure itself. The official numbers are murky anyway, and there are probably scores or even hundreds who have been swept anonymously into the Pacific. So the chance of accurately identifying No. 1,000 would be like trying to name the trillionth customer at McDonald's.
 The San Francisco Public Library maintains a sad file of yellowed newspaper clippings on Golden Gate Bridge suicides. Front-page attention is reserved for the rich or famous, the oldest (87) or youngest (5), or those leaving the strangest notes. (One person left this explanation: "Absolutely no reason, except I have a toothache.")
 Not all the dramas are neatly resolved in a few paragraphs. In June 1948, the 100th fatal leap was reported. A handbag was found belonging to one Dianne Black with a suicide note inside addressed to her husband, Lowell. A few days later, local papers reported that Mrs. Black had called her husband to say she was safe, that she had, as the papers put it, come "back from the dead."

 
 
Burial Instructions
 The centenary notoriety then shifted to Fortunato O. Anguiano of Mexico City, a 53-year-old dishwasher who left a note requesting, "Just bury me in my own land, the one you people take away from us."
 After what was believed to be the 499th suicide, in 1973, 14 people vied for the distinction of becoming No. 500, including one who was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with "500." All 14 were dissuaded or thwarted. But finally, Steven Houg, a 26-year-old resident of a Haight-Ashbury commune, eluded bridge workers and jumped. His note pleaded: "Do not notify my mother. She has a heart condition."
 In 1973, local TV stations trained cameras on the bridge 24 hours a day, in an unsuccessful attempt to record the 500th leap. And that was before "Hard Copy" or "Inside Edition."
 Now, bridge officials are understandably wary of a countdown to 1,000.
 The milestone deaths have been occasions for eloquence about the siren call of the bridge as well as excuses for highfalutin speculation. The fact that "virtually every person jumps . . . from the side facing land, and people" rather than from the side facing the ocean was cited as a "sociologically diagnostic fact" in a 1991 letter to The New York Times Book Review. A subsequent letter dismissed this as "sociobabble," and gave a more prosaic (and likely) explanation: the side facing San Francisco is more frequently open to pedestrians.
 Some ideas for stopping suicides have been downright bizarre. In 1948, for example, after the death of a Hollywood stuntman who had planned on surviving his jump, a law against committing suicide from the bridge was proposed.
 Some proposals have incorporated reverse psychology. A Maine woman suggested that a diving board, a hook for hanging one's jacket and a mailbox for suicide notes would "remove the drama and make bridge suicides look silly."
 Over the years, barriers have been tested, but no single design has garnered much support. Generally, economic and esthetic considerations have trumped public health concerns.
 Opponents of barriers (the majority, according to opinion polls) believe that no type of structure would really work, that those deterred from jumping would simply find other means to self-inflicted ends.

 
 
Well-Chosen Words
 Yet many who commit suicide are in the grips of a transitory depression. For them, a well-chosen remark can make all the difference, though a comment that saves one jumper may be another person's taunt. In one instance, a bridge policeman threatened, "Come down or I'll shoot!" and the would-be jumper obediently clambered from his perch. On another occasion, a patrolman taking a similar tack said to a man standing on the bridge's rail, "Ah, go ahead and jump, see who cares." On cue, the man jumped. The strut below broke his fall.
 Bridge workers and highway patrol officers say that for every person who leaps, two are talked out of it. And of those who are dissuaded, apparently very few go on to commit suicide by other means.
 One Golden Gate Bridge survivor defined suicide as a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But it was Edwin Shneidman, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles, informally known as the dean of "suicidology," who best captured suicide's tragic logic. "It is not a thing to do while one is not in one's best mind," he said. "Never kill yourself while you are suicidal."

HEADLINE: Union Goal of Equality Fails the Test of Time

SERIES: Affirmative Action: Labor's Faltering Experiment

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
By 7 A.M., nearly 30 men have gathered in the hiring hall of the Iron Workers Local 401. They talk quietly in groups at small gray tables, like diners in a restaurant waiting to be served. Several who are black sit apart. All are waiting for a glass window at one end of the hall to slide open and the hiring boss to call out jobs.
Six times this year, the window has opened for Michael Sharpe, one of the black men. But none of the jobs lasted long, and he has averaged only eight days of work a month, half the number this year of most white members of Local 401. The others at his table tell similar stories. 
 "I have often wondered whether I don't last on jobs because I don't work hard enough or I lack skill," Mr. Sharpe said. "I have concluded that the problem is I am black."
Mr. Sharpe, a tall, thin 32-year-old, says his Christian faith reassures him that he will get ahead eventually. "God is just," he said. But that is not much solace today. Local 401 recruited him in 1987, as part of the Federal Government's "Philadelphia Plan," to help raise its minority membership to meet the goals of affirmative action. That was a boom time for construction in Philadelphia, with enough work for everyone, white and black. But now, in harder times, when Mr. Sharpe works, a white man does not.
The Philadelphia Plan, American labor's longest-running experiment in affirmative action, is faltering. More than 25 years after the Government set about trying to break the white monopoly in this city's construction industry, renewed struggles over a shrinking pie and constant changes in the rules of the game are eroding the program's initial gains.
At one time the plan was a model for similar efforts elsewhere in the country. But the backsliding here has now become another symptom of the national decline of affirmative action, once viewed by blacks and other minorities as a Federal commitment to their economic progress but now seen increasingly as something of a hollow victory.
The Philadelphia Plan, based on an executive order issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was put in place by the Nixon Labor Department in 1969 to increase jobs for minorities, mainly blacks, in high-paying skilled trades, which were tightly controlled by the unions. The goal was to employ them in proportion to their numbers in the area's work force.
For a while there were gains. The unions opened their ranks and pitched their apprenticeship programs to train more blacks. The ironworkers, electricians, carpenters, heavy-equipment operators and other skilled trades unions now have a black membership of about 15 percent, up from zero in the 1960's.
But like Mr. Sharpe, who graduated from Local 401's apprenticeship program, the blacks do not obtain much work these days. A recent tour of construction sites in Philadelphia turned up very few members of minorities working at skilled jobs. And Government officials say the picture is the same in other cities.
Keeping blacks out of union jobs is potentially damaging for organized labor. Nationwide, black workers join unions more frequently than any other group, Labor Department data show. One of every five blacks employed in America belongs to a union. For them, union jobs are a path to middle-class incomes. But the skilled trades unions, which control nearly one million jobs that often pay $18 an hour and up, still resist their presence.
The economy gets some of the blame for this resistance. "Many unions have made significant efforts to increase black membership, but in a shrinking job market, blacks have a very hard time keeping jobs," said Bernard E. Anderson, Assistant Secretary of Labor for employment standards.
The unions themselves acknowledge the resistance, but also shift part of the blame to the decline of blue-collar work. "Minorities have been trying to enter the skilled trades just as opportunities have shrunk," said Robert A. Georgine, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Resistance has been great because too many tradesmen have been sitting on the bench. At times, there has been resentment they might lose out."
For Mr. Sharpe, that translates into arms-length treatment by white foremen, who decide who stays on and who gets laid off when work tapers off. Mr. Sharpe may get his share of hiring-hall assignments, but once on the job he is in a foreman's hands. Twice this spring, he says, he has been "pushed aside."
"There were 14 of us erecting a department store at a shopping mall," Mr. Sharpe said. "I was the only black, and when the work slacked I was laid off with two whites. Two weeks later I was back on that job, and when the work slacked again I was again laid off, and all the whites went on working."
Local 401, which is affiliated with the International Association of Iron Workers, occasionally sends out black foremen. But the vast majority are white. For Mr. Sharpe, that spells discrimination. "We are not the cousins and uncles and nephews of these foremen," he said. "And in this union, family and friends come first."
 
The History
A Long Resistance To Black Workers
Organized labor, in all its public statements, shuns discrimination. When the subject comes up, Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., produces a list of 11 resolutions and reports issued since 1981, each declaring the labor federation's unwavering support for civil rights and affirmative action.
"The union movement has tried very hard to bring about diversity at every level," he said.
History tells a different story. Until after World War II, unions were virtually closed to black workers except for those made up almost entirely of blacks, like the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. As recently as 1964, the International Association of Machinists allowed its local chapters to exclude blacks. And the United Automobile Workers, a pioneer in organizing blacks, was plagued until the early 1940's by what were described then as "wildcat hate strikes" by whites protesting working alongside blacks.
Not until World War II did the strikes stop, and only then because the Federal Government made its first incursion into promoting integration in unions and threatened to prosecute the strikers. The next incursion came in the 1960's, with the rise of the civil rights movement and President John F. Kennedy's executive order authorizing unions to sign up Federal workers, a huge source of black recruits.
Increasingly, blacks also took jobs in private industry once held by whites, and joined unions representing secretaries and receptionists, health and child-care workers, clothing and textile workers, clerks, janitors, cooks and waitresses, meter readers and insurance adjusters.
But the high-paying skilled trades -- the main targets of affirmative action -- remained white, male strongholds. "Before the Philadelphia Plan," said James Jones, a lawyer who drew up the plan, "affirmative action was a farce."
 
The System
Pointing Fingers At the Hiring End
Affirmative action, still a Federal requirement despite recent Supreme Court decisions that have diluted it, kicks in if a project involves Government financing -- and most construction work in Philadelphia does. Contractors who bid for this work are asked to make a "good-faith effort" to give minorities enough hours to meet goals set by Federal as well as local requirements. These goals are based on the available pools of white and black workers in the area. Contractors usually shift the burden of meeting the goals to the unions that supply their workers.
That prompts sarcasm from Edward Coryell, president of the Metropolitan District Council of Carpenters. Pulling a folder of letters from contractors out of the clutter on his desk, he says they all make the same request -- that he refer qualified minority workers for possible employment in future projects.
"I have my secretary call them and ask how many minorities they want tomorrow and where to send them," Mr. Coryell says. Do they ever request any?
In reply, Mr. Coryell summons his secretary, Maureen McGovern. "They all say, 'Thank you, we'll make a note of it,' " she said. "None has ever called back, and I have been doing this since 1981."
The tenacity of white resistance to change can be gauged in a court action that dates to the early 1970's. At that time, several contractors joined Local 542 of the International Association of Operating Engineers in a legal challenge to the Philadelphia Plan. One charge was that it set quotas, which are impermissible, rather than goals. Later, the contractors dropped out of the suit, and Local 542 finally signed a consent decree promising to recruit and train blacks as heavy-equipment operators.
That was in the mid-80's, and the Federal District Court here is still riding herd on Local 542, which riles Thomas P. Danese. He is a 40-year-old former backhoe operator who took a union job as business representative two years ago. At the suggestion that Local 542 is backsliding, Mr. Danese jumps for his manila folders and the papers inside with columns of numbers detailing the local's progress in meeting the court's affirmative-action goals.
Even so, progress over the years has waxed and waned. By 1989, a court-appointed outside expert, Marc Halpern, decided that the union had fulfilled the goals. The court withdrew from the case -- only to reappoint Mr. Halpern in 1993 after blacks filed new complaints that they could not get work.
Mr. Halpern agreed with these complaints. "The last four years completely wiped out the arduous effort" that had been made in the 1980's, "and set this union back to a percentage of minority hours worked not seen since 1985," he wrote in a 1993 evaluation.
Mr. Danese says it is not quite that simple. He came into office as part of an elected slate of six new officers, all white, who blamed the incumbents for the backsliding. The insurgents got enough support from black members to win the 1993 election by 21 votes in a union that has 3,200 active members. Now, for the first time, two of the local's nine executive board members are black.
Seated at a conference table and sporting thick metal cuff links and a tie clasp with "542" in raised numerals, Mr. Danese listed data from the quarterly reports that he sends to Mr. Halpern. Twenty-one percent of the membership in Philadelphia is minority, he said, and there are similarly high percentages for the local's four other districts.
Moreover, he said that "30 percent of the people we send out on jobs are minorities." And then came the caveat: "They represent only 16 percent of the hours worked. The contractors aren't keeping the black workers more than a day or two."
Mr. Halpern, troubled by this pattern, finally decided that the contractors, not the union, were resisting, and promised last December to put pressure on the contractors. But they insisted that many black operators were not sufficiently skilled.
"The resistance at the hiring end is a resistance based only on qualification," said John R. Smith Jr., general manager of the Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania.
Mr. Halpern's solution was to identify 75 minority operators whom the union considered skilled. He invited the first 25 to come to the local's training sites for a week or two to brush up their skills, and said he would then push the contractors to hire them. Only 3 of the 25 agreed. "That says something about lack of interest," Mr. Danese concluded.
The black members offered a different view. "White or black, people don't want to train for free," said Clifford Brock, one of the two black members of the local's civil rights committee. "They want to train and get experience the way whites did, on the job. And chances are the people who got those letters have other jobs on the side, and can't afford to retrain now for free."
For Michael Sharpe, the ironworker, there is another reason that blacks are skeptical. Local 542 and his own local, 401, once maintained mandatory hiring halls, which meant that all job assignments came through the halls. But as construction declined, Local 401's white majority, like those in some other unions, voted to permit contractors to bypass the hiring hall and hire union members directly.
To Mr. Sharpe, that meant that white foremen were free to hire their white friends, without any oversight from the union, and give them more hours than blacks.
"I have been at this work nine years now, and I have tried to walk onto jobs and I have been unsuccessful, although the person doing the hiring knew my work," Mr. Sharpe said. "A mandatory hiring hall system would put pressure on a union to give everyone a share of the work."
David Missar sees it differently. He is a 41-year-old white man whose father, grandfather and three uncles were ironworkers. "I was welcomed with open arms into this union, and I guess in that respect, I have had it pretty easy," he said.
He has been a foreman for a decade, and he has worked with Mr. Sharpe, whom he considers a skilled ironworker. Still, Mr. Missar says he resents affirmative action.
"I have always felt that it is reverse discrimination, forcing employers to hire some blacks who are not qualified," he said. "And when there aren't enough jobs to go around, people get difficult."
When Mr. Missar recruits directly, bypassing the union hall, he invariably calls whites. "They are the people I know best," he said. But then he adds, "I would not want to trade shoes with Mike, even if he were more skilled than I am, because I know it would be harder."
 
The Struggle
Racial Wage Gap Embitters Blacks
Affirmative action's failures have contributed to a racial wage gap among union members. White unionists, because they hold most of the better-paid jobs, have got closer to a middle-class wage than blacks. Whites earned $514 a week on average last year, the Labor Department reports, compared with $405 a week on average for black unionists. That was barely above the average weekly wage of $385 for all non-supervisory workers, union or not.
Those figures gall black workers, who have warmly embraced unions as an avenue to higher pay and benefits. Twenty-one percent of black workers in the United States today belong to unions, far more than any other group, the Labor Department says. And at a time when union membership is declining, mostly because whites are dropping out or are reluctant to join, black recruits are the main hope for reversing the labor movement's diminishing power, some union leaders say.
"Black workers are more struggle-oriented than whites," said Joseph Uehlein, a white A.F.L.-C.I.O. official active in organizing campaigns.
But gaining power in the union movement through recruitment is likely to be a very slow process for blacks. Nearly 17 million Americans belong to unions, but black Americans account for only 15.5 percent of the total, far short of enough voting power to shape union policies or demand the best jobs.
"We might be well into the 21st century before this changes," said Barry Hirsch, a labor economist at Florida State University who specializes in union demographics.
Lacking the clout of overwhelming numbers, blacks have a hard time getting into the top union posts. In Philadelphia, while some blacks hold lower-level positions, the top officers in each local are white.
They could name blacks to their slates, but Joseph J. Dougherty, who runs Local 401, explains why he does not. "If we tried to designate some slots for black officers, that would split the union," he said. "You can't push this too far."
Still, Kevin Lumpkin, a 34-year-old black ironworker, ran twice on his own for Local 401's executive board, and the first time, in 1987, he lost by only 24 votes. "I got white votes then," he said.
But as the economy weakened and the competition intensified among the union's 680 ironworkers for a shrinking pool of jobs, votes slipped away. When Mr. Lumpkin ran again, in 1993, he lost by a wider margin.
"I spoke out on on tough issues, like sending out African-Americans as foremen, and I lost some of my white support," Mr. Lumpkin said. "What we need is someone to represent minorities on the executive board and raise our concerns a lot harder than they are raised now."

HEADLINE: Clinton Tries to Ease Effects of Base Cuts

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Looking for ways to lessen the economic pain that base closings would bring to California and Texas, President Clinton directed Pentagon officials today to provide more answers about the prospects for shifting military jobs in the two states to the private sector.
Mr. Clinton met for 90 minutes with Defense Secretary William J. Perry and other top officials to discuss the latest recommendations from an independent panel on military base closings. 
 The panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, has recommended that maintenance centers at McClellan Air Force Base in California and Kelly Air Force Base in Texas be shut down and that the work be parceled out to other bases. In the case of Kelly, the commission left privatization as an option.
Mr. Perry has yet to give the President a formal recommendation on the commission's plan, but he has made it clear that he favors shifting some military work to private employers as a way to preserve jobs. At today's meeting, Mr. Clinton asked for more information about prospects for moving jobs to the private sector at both bases, aides said.
McClellan's future has become a hot political issue because of the effect of previous base closings on California and because of the importance of that state's 54 electoral votes to Mr. Clinton's re-election hopes.
Mr. Clinton has until July 15 to decide whether to accept or reject the commission's latest recommendations.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Schools Go in Summer

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 8

 BODY:
While many students were enjoying the uninterrupted liberty of long summer days, students here at Garfield High School began the '95-'96 school year on Wednesday.
July and August are no different than October and November here. 
 Two-thirds of the students are always attending classes.
Like 200 other schools in the city, Garfield is on a year-round calendar, sacrificing summer freedom for the utility of easing overcrowded classrooms and hallways. The same calendar is being considered by other crowded school systems across the country, notably New York City, which expects to begin an experiment within a year at two to four schools to cope with a budget that does not provide money for building new schools.
At Garfield, Adela Hernandez, a 14-year-old freshman, finished eighth grade just two weeks ago and began high school on Wednesday. "I didn't like just having six days of vacation," she said. "I wanted to have more. We didn't get to enjoy anything."
But students accustomed to the schedule see advantages. "This school has so many students," said Alma Ortiz, 16, a senior. "If they put in the kids who are on vacation now, the campus would be totally crowded."
Most schools on year-round schedules -- 1,200 out of about 2,000 nationwide -- are in California. A recession and dearth of voter support for classroom construction has left the state little choice.
In the giant Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest after New York, more than 270,000 children, 42 percent, are on a year-round calendar. Neighborhoods with swelling immigrant communities, like Garfield's Hispanic east side, are most likely to have such schedules.
Year-round education can effectively expand a school's capacity by 25 percent, or even 50 percent, depending on the system used. While air-conditioning and administrative costs are higher, the expense is far less than than the cost of building and maintaining new schools.
In Garfield's case, the schedule allows 4,200 children to be taught on a 3,200-desk campus. To achieve this, the student body is divided into thirds. At any time, one-third of the school's students and teachers are on one of two eight-week breaks. This replaces the traditional 10- to 12-week summer vacation.
Once they get used to it, said the Garfield principal, Maria E. Tostado, "kids love it. And my parents, they're so used to year-round now that they don't think about it much."
Maria Quiles, a 15-year-old sophomore, said that summer courses do not get in the way of social life. "After school we go somewhere like the beach or go see friends who are on vacation, so it's the same thing," she said.
But Gabriel Cabrera, 18, who graduated on June 27, complained that all through high school, he never really had a vacation. To stay in the band (he played tuba), he had to show up for practice every day at 6:30 A.M. -- even during his eight-week breaks.
"I didn't get a decent vacation," Gabriel said. "I haven't been off since the 10th grade. Sometimes I wanted to sleep in, but I couldn't."
In fact, anyone in the music program, on a sports team or taking an advanced placement course must continue to show up at school during their eight-week breaks. Without such a policy, the band might march in chaos during the football half-time show. Some basketball team members would miss pre-season practice. And students in advanced placement courses who are off in March would be ill-prepared for the standardized tests, given in the spring.
Proponents said year-round scheduling has some benefits beyond eliminating crowding. Steven H. Walters, a coordinator for year-round schools in Los Angeles, said frequent breaks are an advantage to failing students. They usually would wait until summer school to retake courses or earn credit for extra work.
"What we're doing now with the traditional calendar is saying, 'Hang in there Johnny. In June, we'll get you some help,' " Mr. Walters said.
Charles E. Ballinger, executive director of the National Association of Year-Round Education, described an added advantage, saying "students forget less" in an atmosphere of continuous learning.
But Thomas E. Hutton, a math instructor at Garfield, said the reverse is true. To make the rotating schedule fit within 12 months, instructors work and students attend school for 163 days instead of the traditional 180 (though days increase to 7 hours and 40 minutes from the usual 7). This gives students more time to forget, he said. "For my personal life it's great," Mr. Hutton said. "But from the point of view of education, it hurts."
Louis Tapia, a 16-year-old junior, said he liked the extra weeks away from class. "I would rather be going year-round anyway because we get more time off."
Across the city, parents and some teachers were not easily swayed by supporters when the city experimented in 1991 with having all schools go to a year-round schedule. While more than 200 overcrowded schools like Garfield continue on a year-round calendar, parents and teachers at 540 mainly affluent and spacious suburban schools rebelled and returned to a nine-month calendar in 1993.
Gilbert Lozano, a 15-year-old sophomore said that given the choice, he would choose Garfield's year-round schedule over a traditional calendar, even though he admits having a pang of regret when he sees other students on vacation. "When they're doing fun stuff, I'm just here at school learning," he said.
His revenge, he says, will come during his eight-week break in November and December. While his friends are doing algebra and English, he'll be learning to ski.

HEADLINE: Aid Packages For Retailers In Poor Areas

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Hoping to replicate New York City's success over the last decade in rebuilding abandoned housing, the Giuliani administration for the first time will offer packages of vacant land and financing to develop retail stores along some of the city's most blighted commercial strips.
The administration wants to spur the opening of dozens of neighborhood businesses -- groceries, pharmacies, video stores, laundries and restaurants -- that officials and housing experts say are essential to the revival of poor neighborhoods where the city has built thousands of affordable homes for working families. 
 New York, like other cities, has offered abandoned properties for commercial development in site-by-site negotiations, but that approach has done little to revive beleaguered shopping areas. With the new effort, the city intends for the first time to take a more comprehensive step, creating development zones and offering public and private dollars for construction, as well as vacant land and tax abatements.
In all, $25 million will be spent in five zones to develop 250,000 square feet of commercial or retail space, creating an estimated 1,000 jobs over the next few years. The administration has already selected the first zone: 270 square blocks in Brooklyn bisected by Broadway, a shopping strip that has yet to recover from arson and looting in the 1970's.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is to announce tomorrow that the city has cobbled together the money to finance the new stores from Federally guaranteed loans and grants, private contributions and city construction funds.
The pot includes the first contribution -- $2.5 million -- from the New York City Partnership, a private group whose members include top executives of the city's largest companies. The partnership will coordinate the project and search for potential developers in much the same way its subsidiary, the New York City Housing Partnership, has helped the city rebuild housing.
Deborah C. Wright, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said the administration's new program reflected a realization that the city must rebuild retailing as well as housing or put the new homes at risk.
"The operating assumption has always been if you build the housing, the retail will come," she said. "It's taken us 25 years to figure out it's not coming back by itself. There's a real cost in leaving these strips vacant."
For Mr. Giuliani, the project represents his most significant proposal so far for urban renewal, one that aims to fulfill his campaign pledges to rebuild as many businesses as homes in poor neighborhoods. And it underscores the Mayor's drive to tap private financing and support as much as possible at a time when the city faces nagging budget problems and has reduced its spending on capital construction projects.
In fact, the city's contribution to the project is modest: $2.5 million in capital funds that will pay for improvements to abandoned properties that have fallen into the city's hands through tax foreclosures.
The bulk of the financing will come from Federally guaranteed loans and from grants the city was able to secure from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The administration's effort aims to follow the model the city has used to finance and oversee the creation or renovation of more than 50,000 homes over the last decade. In that effort, the city gave away the vacant properties to nonprofit organizations or private developers who then used a variety of city subsidies, bank financing and Federal guarantees or credits to build the housing.
For the new project, the city has joined with the partnership, which has agreed for the first time to contribute its own money for economic development and has already secured commitments from five banks to help finance the construction of new businesses.
"It's a logical sequence to what the partnership has been doing in the area of housing over the last decade," said Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer Properties in Manhattan and chairman of the partnership.
The first of the five zones (called Partnership Plazas) is an irregular octagon where Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant come together, bounded by sections of Flushing Avenue at the north, Wilson and Bushwick Avenues on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south and Malcolm X Boulevard on the west.
The zone includes about a dozen commercial properties, totalling 370,000 square feet, that defaulted into the city's hands in the 1970's and have remained abandoned. In roughly the same area, the city has overseen the development of about 2,600 homes, many of them through the Housing Partnership.
Richard J. Schwartz, the Mayor's senior adviser, said that the city hoped to encourage developers to open at least a handful of stores on those sites, which range from 12,000 to 60,000 square feet, to create "a critical mass" of retailing that would ultimately attract others.
The new retailers could eventually own their stores themselves, receiving a full exemption on property taxes for 12 years. The city has also pledged to improve services -- from street lighting to policing -- in the new zones.
The task now is to find businesses willing to start up in a neighborhood that has lain fallow for two decades, although officials said the package of financing already in place increases the chance for success.
Roderick B. Mitchell, the president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, a nonprofit organization that has supported retail development in the neighborhood, said the city has had the capacity to finance retail projects for years but has so far failed to use it well.
Mr. Mitchell said the part of the $25 million dedicated to the Brooklyn zone did not represent "a lot of money" for development. But, he added, "anything that will encourage economic development is a good thing."

HEADLINE: California's Squabbling Legislature Just Stumbles Along

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, July 8

 BODY:
There was a time, 20 years or so back, when the Legislature here was considered one of the most professional, innovative and productive in the nation, a major force in leading California to its pre-eminence after World War II as the richest and most powerful state in the Union. Other states looked to the Golden State for legislative example and guidance.
And then there is today's California Legislature, more specifically the lower house, the ideologically sundered, procedurally stumbling, squabbling, wobbling California Assembly. 
 The uncivil national political discourse bemoaned a few days ago by President Clinton in a speech in Washington can be found here in full-throated cry.
All the usual causes are present, and then some: hard-right and hard-left agendas with no middle ground, programmatic needs that far exceed economic means, powerful and selfish special interests, a breakdown in party discipline and allegiance, term limits, recall elections, ballot initiatives, Presidential ambition and just plain meanspiritedness
"It's the same stuff that you find in a lot of states, only bigger and worse here," said Tony Quinn, a veteran Sacramento lobbyist and former legislative aide. "Well, this has always been a cutting-edge legislature. Trouble is, now it's also a dysfunctional family."
In the California Assembly in the summer of 1995 -- the state Senate, thus far, is much less troubled -- Republicans and Democrats are not satisfied simply to fight one another in the age-old accepted manner. There is a get 'em tone in a great many of their exchanges.
One day last week, a Republican member gleefully referred to a Democratic member's recent hospitalization for cancer, then expressed "hope" that the surgeons also had managed to "cut the malignancy out of his heart."
Equally serious is the spectacle of Republicans fighting Republicans and Democrats fighting Democrats.
When the longtime Democratic Speaker, Willie L. Brown, outmaneuvered Republicans and kept control of the Assembly despite technically being outnumbered by the opposition, Doris Allen, the Republican Assemblywoman from Orange County who sided with him on the crucial vote, was pilloried as the equivalent of a Nazi collaborator.
Faxes distributed by her furious party colleagues said she would have been a perfect fit in the Vichy Government that the conquering Germans set up in France during World War II.
When Mr. Brown subsequently gave Ms. Allen the Speaker's job, at least in title, the next round of faxes suggested a dog was her chief political adviser.
Finally, when Assembly members are not fighting with each other these days, they are ganging up on Gov. Pete Wilson, who has himself added considerably to the tension and confusion in Sacramento by entering the contest for the Republican Presidential nomination.
Democrats are doing all they can to derail his proposed 1995-96 budget, especially his call for a tax cut. As a result, serious legislative action in the Assembly is all but nonexistent.
Should the cut ever pass, it would be something Mr. Wilson could boast about out on the Presidential campaign trail, possibly offsetting criticism of him for supporting a tax increase in earlier years.
Sherry B. Jeffe, a former Asssembly aide who now teaches political science at the Claremont Graduate School, near Los Angeles, considers political decorum in Sacramento today, particularly in the Assembly, to be the worst in modern memory.
"This once great deliberative body," she said, "has sunk to the level of a petulant sand-box fight, except little kids aren't as mean and hateful as some of these folks."
In her view, term limits have increased pressure on legislators to move faster and with less caution and comity to complete their agendas before they must leave.
At the same time, she said, a tendency has developed to resort to recall elections to punish wayward legislators and to rely on ballot initiatives to win passage of measures that legislators will not act upon.
On a day to day basis, the California Assembly's sessions have become so raucous and unruly -- the incessant gavel pounding and calls for order go ignored and only add to the din -- that the Sergeant-at-Arms has quietly assigned extra personnel to the floor, just in case the hotheads spiral totally out of control and go from flipping obscene finger signs at one another to actual fisticuffs.
Raising the ad hominem ante in one exchange on Friday, Assemblyman John Burton of San Francisco, insisted, over the Chair's repeated objections, on referring to Governor Wilson, a relatively slight man, as "the little fellow downstairs."
Given a final admonishment by the Chair to desist, Mr. Burton deadpanned, "I'm not talking about the Governor, his excellency. I'm talking about the shoeshine boy downstairs."
At that, Assemblyman Peter Frusetta of Tres Pinos, in the Monterey area , rose and managed, somehow, to make himself heard above the tumult. Noting that some television stations now broadcast Assembly sessions, he said, as the members finally quieted and turned to listen:
"I feel sorry that the people of California have to witness this buffonery. It wouldn't be accepted in a high school auditorium. It's a terrible disparaging of this body. I didn't come here for laughter or mockery."
There was some scattered applause as he took his seat. And also some laughter and mockery.
"Oh, he's shocked that there's gambling going on here," someone quipped in one corner of the Assembly chamber, alluding to the timeworn line from the movie "Casablanca."

HEADLINE: The Whitman Effect

 BODY:
In political terms, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has had a sensational first year and a half in office. With a recently enacted $16 billion budget, she has cut income taxes as promised in two years instead of three, without shredding local aid or social programs. Small wonder that she is being talked about for the national Republican ticket. But these achievements are accompanied by genuine risks to the long-term financial health of the state. Looked at closely, Mrs. Whitman's fiscal practices reflect less of a Republican revolution in downsized government than the same old game of spending now and paying the price later.
 The Governor's first year in office was marked by a reduction in annual payments to the state employee pension fund, which allowed her to implement the first phase of her promised 30 percent cut in the income tax rate. This page was critical of that move as certain to raise the state budget liability for pensions drastically in future years. But Mrs. Whitman persuaded the legislators, if not the bond-rating agencies, that the pension system was "overfunded" and that it was a matter of equity that current taxpayers not have to foot the bill for future retirement costs. She was unfortunately employing a dubious practice to which desperate governors and mayors across the country have been turning in these years of fiscal stringency. 
 This year, however, Mrs. Whitman has expanded the practice of incurring obligations without providing the means to pay for them. A multibillion-dollar transportation program is to be funded by new and newly refinanced bonds that are going to drive up the cost of debt service. It would have been much more courageous and fiscally sound for Mrs. Whitman to level with the voters and say that this expense should be met by a modest increase in the state gasoline tax.
 The Governor also "paid" for the tax cut by inflating tax revenue projections and by optimistically assuming that there will be savings from her privatization programs. In fact, efforts to reduce the size of the work force have lagged behind her initial plans, and the privatizations have not achieved any real savings at all.
 But budgets are more than bottom lines, and Mrs. Whitman does deserve credit in key areas. She has responded to court orders by increasing state education aid to poor districts at the expense of wealthier districts, although an even greater effort will be needed if the demands of equity are to be met. Democrats charge that the small increases in school aid these last two years will drive up local property taxes, and many independent analysts agree. But it is too soon to tell if that will happen, and Mrs. Whitman is right to demand that local school districts do more to cut their own exploding administrative costs.
 Even more impressive, Mrs. Whitman has resisted the impulse of Republicans in New York and elsewhere to try to cut welfare benefits. Her eloquent arguments that such cuts hurt families and children should be heard by fellow Republicans, along with her appeals for moderation on abortion and other social issues. But those looking for Mrs. Whitman to have a national impact should be watching the economic indicators carefully to see whether the gambles she is taking on taxes and budgeting end up costing taxpayers more money and hurting the state's future financial health.

Clinton Shopping Network

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Attention, D-Mart shoppers!
 The Democratic National Committee has put out a catalogue with its exciting new fall collection from the White House. (Political-machine washable and made in the U.S.A.) 
 It's a fresh, fun approach to a classic product: access.
 For $100,000 a year, you can become a "Managing Trustee" of the Democratic Party, which entitles you to all kinds of goodies, including two meals with the President and two with the Vice President, two issue retreats, "private, impromptu meetings" with Administration officials when they visit your hometown, an upgrade to "Honored Guest Status" at the '96 Chicago convention and your very own D.N.C. staffer to assist with your "personal requests."
 You also get to tag along with party leaders on a foreign trade mission. (For a bit more, do you get to talk tough to the Japanese?) The D.N.C. briefing will be faxed to you every day, with insider tidbits like this from July 6: "Priorities? Wilson skipped base closing hearing to honor fat cat contributor."
 Bargain hunters can go to the women's department, where, for a $1,000 contribution, you get a reception with the First Lady, Tipper Gore or top female Administration officials.
 The catalogue was designed by Christopher Dodd and Donald Fowler, the Democratic Party chairmen, to raise $66 million for the '96 elections. Since this was reported in The Chicago Sun-Times by Lynn Sweet, the capital has been awash in moralism.
 Republicans have long believed in pay-per-view. For $100,000, businessmen in Team 100 could go to a black-tie dinner with President Bush after enduring a don't-worry-be-happy economic policy briefing by Dick Darman and Michael Boskin. But Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chief, scorned the D.N.C. "price list" as "crass." "What would it cost to fly in the cockpit of Air Force One?" he drawled.
 I think I detected a note of envy in his voice. But Mr. Barbour is right. Crass it is. The Democrats are supposed to be the party of average working Americans, the party of campaign finance reform. And Bill Clinton did run on a promise -- echoed during his New Hampshire meeting with Newt Gingrich -- to fight "big money interests" and break up those "cliques of $100,000 donors."
 White House officials protest that they cannot "unilaterally disarm" and that they are only "stylizing" G.O.P. fund-raising techniques. Actually, they are unilaterally perfecting the black art they protest, bringing it to new heights of tawdry sophistication.
 Senator Dodd was unapologetic when I called him. "We're very honest," he said drily. "We like to tax 'em and we like to raise money from 'em if we can. Anyway, the Republicans charged $92,000 for a picture with George Bush. We give dinner and a picture with Clinton for that." Asked what sort of "personal requests" the D.N.C. staffers were prepared to fulfill, he laughed and said, "I wondered that myself."
 So what does an ordinary citizen get in return for a vote? "Hopefully," Mr. Dodd replied, "good government, as Huey Long would say."
 Right. Enough about ethical anxiety. Let's shop!
 Perhaps the D.N.C. should think really big, as in "1996 GOING-OUT OF-BUSINESS SALE -- EVERYTHING MUST GO!" It is easy to conjure up hot sellers.
 * For $50,000, Al Gore will come over and help you choose your long-distance service.
 * For $20,000, the dapper Warren Christopher will instruct you in the art of accessorizing.
 * For $15,000, a seminar on money management by Ron Brown and Pamela Harriman.
 * For $10,000, Bruce Lindsey will tell you what he does for a living.
 * For $5,000, Paul Begala will explain how the press is undermining the Clinton Presidency.
 * For $4,000, Dick Morris will explain how Paul Begala is undermining the Clinton Presidency.
 * For $3,000, George Stephanopoulos will explain who Dick Morris is.
 * For $1,000, a trip to the Super Bowl with Don Tyson.
 * For $500, Henry Cisneros will reflect on "Why Really Good-Looking Men With a Whole Lot Going for Them Make Really Dumb Choices."
 * For $100, a trip to the Super Bowl with Mike Espy.
 * For $10, Ira Magaziner will help you choose your H.M.O. For $10,000, he won't.
 Act now. Supplies are limited. Not void even where prohibited.

THE ECONOMY
 
Rates: Can't They Get It Right?
You'd think that with today's computers, which can land a space ship on the head of a T-bill, economists could simply figure out where interest rates should be -- and leave them alone, for heaven's sake. But no: it's up and down, up and down, with incessant speculation beforehand and the actual changes heralded by 1,427 trumpets (adjusted for inflation). So it was that on Thursday the Fed, having decided that all those rate increases over the past year and a half may have tipped the economy toward recession, sent one key rate down a notch. It took its time, though: the free market had started sending things like bond yields and mortgage rates down some time ago. 

But wait! The very next day those recession warnings seemed way off target, for new figures showed that the job picture was a lot better than expected. Payrolls grew by a healthy 215,000, and the unemployment rate slipped to 5.6 percent from 5.7. What do you think, Mr. Greenspan?
 
MILITARY SPENDING
 
Please, Have Some More!
Logic would suggest that when the Pentagon held out its tin cup to this pinch-billion Congress, it would get less than it asked for. But if you want logic, get a computer. For not only is Congress not denying the military folks anything, it's trying to give them more than they asked for. That's right, $7 billion more next year alone. The rationale: combat readiness must be shored up, new threats must be met. The criticism: the budget's a throwback to the long-gone cold war. And here's one of those astounding coincidences that keep popping up in Washington: of 31 states represented by members of the relevant House panel, 26 got nearly $500 million in barracks and other construction goodies the Pentagon never requested.
 
DRUGS
 
Kudlow Didn't Lick It After All
It was a compelling tale: At the top of the Wall Street game as chief economist at Bear Stearns, Lawrence Kudlow made a dramatic public confession of a drug problem, said he'd licked it, and started fresh. That was 15 months ago, and his rebirth certainly seemed the real thing when, for one thing, he shared a dais with Alan Greenspan recently. But reality did not turn out so tidy. Last week Mr. Kudlow entered a six-month drug-treatment program, his wife said, after three shorter treatments failed. She just sued for divorce to keep him from draining their retirement account to feed his cocaine habit, she said, and this helped convince him to seek help. "It came down to saving his life," she said.
 
AUTOS
 
Electric Cars: Not So Fast
It was oh-so-simple to decree that 2 percent of 1998 cars sold be electric, as California, New York and Massachusetts have done. The trouble is, those cars are due in two short years, and the cars aren't nearly ready -- at least ones people would actually buy. Something had to give, and recently, sure enough, a distinct cracking sound could be heard. Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts offered Detroit a deal: the electric mandate wouldn't kick in until two years after someone, somewhere, built an acceptable vehicle. There's another compromise being discussed: equip "hybrid' vehicles with small gasoline engines to recharge the batteries -- since recharging is a huge hurdle. But don't hold your breath for that fleet of clean electric cars.
 
ENTERTAINMENT
 
Another Blockbuster
Remember when movies, if they were big enough hits, eventually achieved blockbuster status? Those days are long gone. Today's summer films have blockbusterdom thrust upon them from the start; they cost such ridiculous sums that anything less is unacceptable. With blockbuster season officially upon us, just look at these numbers: "Pocahontas" cost $45 million to make, "Apollo 13" $51 million, and "Batman Forever" $95 million. But you almost have to add those together to get to the $175 million that "Waterworld" (due July 22) reportedly cost. Is it possible that such a movie, now matter how many zillions of tickets sold, could actually earn money? If so, they'll have to think of a new superlative; "blockbuster," the word, will have been washed away.
 
PRODUCTIVITY
 
Independence, Squared
You can bet that American business will never let another holiday be labeled with a number, not a name. If the Fourth of July were known just as Independence Day, it would have long since been shunted to a Monday. A neat three-day weekend, than back to the grind. But face it: you just can't say, "July 4 will be observed on July 3 this year" -- even in a society so lax it allows words like "Lite." So with July 4 impudently falling on Tuesday last week, the nation pretty much ground to a halt on Monday -- in a productivity sense, that is; people at the beach or reading a book surely thought the day progressed very nicely indeed.
 
HINDSIGHT
 
Did Iacocca Burn His Options?
Suppose someone owed you $32 million. It wouldn't be a great idea to irritate that person, would it? And Chrysler, understandably, is quite irritated indeed at an ex-employee named Lee Iacocca, who linked up with one Kirk Kerkorian in a failed effort to take over the company. Mr. Iacocca happens to have a whole lot of stock options he has yet to cash in -- options that would give him an instant $32 million in profit. But he got a rude surprise last week when, after trying to exercise some of them, Chrysler informed him that a former executive forfeits those options if he acts "in a manner adversely affecting the company." Trying to take the place over would seem to qualify.
 
PUBLISHING
 
Just Another Humble Scribbler
 
The book tour -- it's simply part of the book-selling business. "I'm just thinking of how to sign books," Newt Gingrich said, answering some silly question about whether he was running for President. And sign he did last week at Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue -- more than 650 copies an hour of "To Renew America" -- as part of a 25-city tour. Yes, some impertinent souls shouted things like "Stop the war against the poor." But more typical was a woman who, hugging the newly signed book, cried: "I love you! I love everything you do!"
 
ADVERTISING
 
United Critics of Benetton
It's always seemed like a bizarre way to sell clothes: "H.I.V. positive" stamped on a human body, an oil-soaked bird, a bloody uniform from the Bosnian war. It gets Benetton attention -- no doubt about that. But what's it all about? Is it, as Benetton says, a way of highlighting social ills? Or is it, as critics assert, an "exploitation of suffering" that goes too far? A German court sided firmly with the critics last week, saying that exploiting feelings of pity "violates competition law" and ruling that the ad campaign was illegal.

HEADLINE: July 2-8: It's the Economy, Stupid;
The President Watches As the Federal Reserve Turns On the Heat, Sort of

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates last week in what was the latest turn in the up-and-down, arms-length relationship of a Democrat and a Republican who find their fates intertwined: Bill Clinton and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
 Both men, of course, want a healthy economy. But they also have a strong interest in seeing a healthy economy next spring: Mr. Greenspan will be up for re-appointment; Mr. Clinton will be up for re-election. 
 The Fed chairman has said that he expects a slowdown or possibly a recession this summer and a rebound by the end of the year, rate cut or no rate cut. But it is not a bad insurance policy to enact a rate cut now whose effects might show about the time his second four-year term expires in March.
 The action -- so slight it hardly guarantees a boom -- still reduces the likelihood of any serious effort to challenge Mr. Greenspan's reappointment on the ground that he puts the fight against inflation ahead of economic growth, as many Democrats charge.
 For Mr. Clinton, nothing usually matters more to a President's prospects for re-election than the condition of the economy. Since the Civil War, virtually every time the economy has been in a recession the opposition candidate has won the Presidency. One note of caution: the growing economy did the Democrats as a party no good in 1994, when the Republicans swept them out of control of the House and the Senate. RICHARD L. BERKE

HEADLINE: Price of Loyalty?

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
When the Devils moved to New Jersey and sought to develop a fan base there, the team required all new season subscribers to pay an upfront fee of at least $2,000, refunded at the rate of one-tenth per year, to obtain their season tickets. Those fans who shelled out their cash for a pig in a poke showed how fan passion and loyalty for a team and its players can sometimes defy common sense. Now that the Devils have won the Stanley Cup, those supporters may suffer the indignity of their team leaving town before they have the opportunity to revel in their championship. 
 Any business requires the taking of risks. Pro sports team owners hedge their risks by leveraging their threats to leave town against the mouthwatering offers made by hungry cities seeking to entice them with taxpayer-subsidized economic goodies. Obligating the public to provide for the owners' economic well-being, while public funding for so many social needs is disappearing, is obscene.

HEADLINE: Summary of Major Actions in the Legislature's 218th Session

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 8

 BODY:
The 218th session of the New York State Legislature opened in January with a plea from Gov. George E. Pataki for more open government and bipartisan cooperation. It ended at 5 A.M. on June 30 after 26 weeks of backroom maneuvering and sustained partisan squabbling.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, scored an early victory when he signed the death penalty into law on March 7 after several weeks of difficult negotiations that soured his relationship with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat. 
 The next four months were dominated by a bruising battle over Mr. Pataki's proposals to shrink state government, sharply reduce welfare and Medicaid spending and cut personal income taxes. The Legislature eventually restored many of his budget cuts and trimmed the size of the tax cut. But the new Governor could still claim victories in having engineered one of the largest tax cuts in state history and having reduced general fund spending, albeit by just a hair, from the previous year.
The long budget fight left little time to debate other issues. When the session ended, the Legislature had failed to reach agreement on bills that would have expanded interstate banking, increased criminal penalties for bias-related crimes, required notification of mothers with H.I.V.-infected newborns and increased the minimum wage.
The session's other major accomplishments included an overhaul of state sentencing laws, first passage of a constitutional amendment that would allow casino gambling and the first increase in automobile insurance minimum limits in 38 years.
The Assembly passed 1,439 of the 7,814 bills introduced in that House; the Senate passed 1,459 of the 5,575 bills introduced. A total of 774 bills passed both Houses. Of those, Mr. Pataki has as of today signed 135 and vetoed 13.
These are the major actions of the Legislature this year:
 
The Budget
Few in Albany seriously believed that Mr. Pataki could deliver on his campaign pledge to obtain the first on-time budget in 11 years, but few thought the fight would be as bitter or long as it was. When it was enacted on June 7, the budget was the second latest ever, missing last year's record by five hours.
The Republican Governor initiated combat on Feb. 1 by proposing a plan that would have cut general fund spending by $1.1 billion, or 3.5 percent, while reducing personal income taxes by $6.8 billion in 1998.
Bitterly opposed to Mr. Pataki's deep proposed cuts to health care, higher education and welfare, the Assembly Democrats joined labor unions, hospitals and advocates for the poor in waging a costly advertising campaign against his budget. Mr. Pataki, whose popularity dropped below 40 percent in several polls during the conflict, replied with his own advertising blitz, accusing Democrats of being tax-and-spend liberals.
In the end, the Legislature rejected Mr. Pataki's deepest welfare cuts, reduced from $1,600 to $750 an increase in state college tuition and trimmed the tax cut to a three-year plan worth $3.6 billion by 1997. The legislators added $50 million in business tax cuts. And they restored more than $100 million in pork items that Mr. Pataki had originally opposed, including spending for stadiums, hunting clubs and scouting troops.
The final budget cuts general fund spending by $334 million, or 1 percent, to $32.8 billion. However, total state spending, which includes Federal money, will actually rise this year by $1.5 billion, or 2.5 percent, to $63.5 billion.
After the budget fracas, the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Mr. Silver each proposed legislation to prevent late budgets by lengthening the amount of time for negotiations. But they could not agree on a plan.

HEADLINE: Committee in the House Prunes the Budget Tree

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
As the House Appropriations Committee passes the halfway mark in writing spending bills to fulfill Republican pledges of a leaner Federal budget, the House's ruling right wing is expressing delight at what has been cut. But it is what survives that ruffles them.
The National Endowment for the Arts, which sponsored Robert Mapplethorpe's contentious photographs of the human anatomy, is bloodied in the legislation being churned out of the appropriations panel, but the endowment is still standing. So is the Legal Services Corporation, the Federal law firm that conservatives accuse of promoting a liberal agenda in the courts. 
 So are the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission, icons of the New Deal and the New Frontier, respectively. So are loans to Russia, and the Energy Department, the Education Department, Interior Department land purchases and a host of other agencies and programs that raise the blood of hard conservatives to a rolling boil.
That they should prove so hardy in so deeply a conservative Congress, at least so far, may be surprising. But their survival illustrates a political rule that transcends party dogma and the transfers of Congressional power: when it comes to spending, the Appropriations Committee marches to its own drummer. And it can do without excessive kibitzing, thank you.
"Everyone's entitled to their opinion of whether we should cut one program or another," the panel's chairman, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, said. "All these bills are going to the floor. They can change them if they've got the votes."
Some surely will try. "We're certainly looking for further action," said Mike Russell, a spokesman for the Christian Coalition, a conservative religious group that plans to press lawmakers to end the arts endowment, the Legal Services Corporation and additional education programs.
As Mr. Livingston notes, any rifts between his committee and other legislators or lobbies have little to do with the deficit. The Congress that returns Monday from a week off will find that the House Appropriations Committee, once the packinghouse for Federal pork, has transmogrified into something of a slaughterhouse.
Seven of the 12 main spending bills in its jurisdiction have now been sent to the House floor. Gone from the proposals are the markers for highway "demonstration projects," new courthouses and many other political favors that were legislative staples in years past. Dozens of Federal panels and programs, like the modest $318,000-a-year Susquehanna River Basin Commission and the not-so-modest $340 million-a-year Advanced Technology Program in the Commerce Department, are headed for extinction.
When the House and Senate Budget Committees drew up a broad framework for Federal spending last month, they gave Congress's appropriations panels a kitty of roughly $532 billion -- a third of the entire 1996 budget -- to spend on discretionary programs like roads and education and environmental protection. To date, every spending bill produced by the 13 House Appropriations subcommittees has come in below the budget committees' ceilings: $13 million below in farm spending; $202 million below in foreign affairs spending; $272 million below in energy and water projects spending, among others.
"Fact is, we're trying to cut harder than they want us to," Mr. Livingston said. "These guys are busting their backs to work within the budget allocations and do their job. There's not one subcommittee chairman who hasn't picked up the mantle of responsibility given in the Contract with America, and toed the line."
Arithmetically, Mr. Livingston is right. But as a matter of political philosophy, rightward-leaning Republicans fault the appropriations panel on two counts. First, they say, it has not wiped out the vestiges of liberalism in social spending. And second, it has kept alive wasteful but politically popular programs whose budgets might mushroom.
The social crusaders -- the religious right and many of the House's newer members -- are unhappy that spending on the arts, public television and other Democratic creations would merely be reduced under the Appropriations Committee's proposals, rather than disappear entirely. The arts endowment, for example, would lose $51.6 million of its $133.8 million budget; the Legal Services Corporation would get $278 million, a cut of $122 million, and a sheaf of restrictions on its activities.
Mr. Livingston scoffs at the notion that his subcommittee chairmen have gone soft on such programs. Some have constituencies that simply outweigh the hard right, while others are merely taking a slower course toward extinction than conservatives may like. For example, both the arts endowment and the National Endowment for the Humanities would be eliminated in three years under the House Budget Committee plan.
"That's not exactly a tap on the wrist," Mr. Livingston said.
Perhaps the larger question is raised by fiscal crusaders, the so-called deficit hawks, who worry aloud that the Appropriations Committee is trimming too many programs but not abolishing nearly enough. Led by the Budget Committee chairman, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, they argue that any program not wiped out now, while the Republicans have the political momentum, will thrive again in a less frugal Congress.
Mr. Kasich tried an unsuccessful end run around the Appropriations Committee early this year, seeking to shift some of its decision-making power to his committee. He and Mr. Livingston profess to have good relations now, which is not the same as saying they are in agreement.
The Budget Committee's staff director, Rick May, said this week: "We need to start tearing programs out by the roots instead of trimming them around the edges."
Mr. Kasich and his supporters, including much of the House's freshman class, want to swing the big stick. It was they who proposed wiping out the Energy and Education Departments, closing the T.V.A. and the Surgeon General's office and eliminating export subsidies, the Maritime Administration and most new Federal land purchases.
Mr. Livingston's troops have given them some victories. As a prologue to an effort by the leadership in both houses to abolish the Commerce Department, the House appropriations committee would save $340 million a year by wiping out a longtime Kasich target, the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program, which gives research grants to corporations. A host of minor agencies and commissions would also bite the dust, saving scores of millions.
The appropriations panel boasts of canceling 60 agencies or programs so far, with many more to come, though some of its claims, like the closing of a House parking lot, seem a bit strained.
But many of Mr. Kasich's larger targets have escaped, though rarely unscathed. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a mid-South power producer long criticized as past its prime, loses a quarter of its $142.9 million budget; the Appalachian Regional Commission's $282 million anti-poverty budget is halved. Deficit hawks wanted to kill the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which spends $34 million a year to guarantee loans for American businesses trading abroad. But its budget would double under appropriations committee legislation now heading toward the House floor.
The Small Business Administration budget would drop from $923 million to $590 million a year; the Economic Development Administration, a perennial target, would lose only $90 million of its $440 million budget.
That political patrons have saved many of these programs is beyond doubt. The T.V.A., the Appalachian commission and the Economic Development Administration were largely rescued by Representative Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican who runs the subcommittee that approves Commerce Department spending. Some business trade subsidies were preserved by Representative Sonny Callahan of Alabama, who heads the subcommittee on foreign operations spending.
Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said: "The chairmen and subcommittee chairmen up on the Hill tend to be the representatives who've been here for 15, 20 or more years, and so they're the ones least likely to have noticed the rumblings" from the last election. "Some of the appropriators just aren't part of the revolution."
But, Mr. Mitchell noted, it is impossible to take politics out of politicians, and maybe not all that desirable, either.
Mr. May pointed out that Mr. Kasich's budget panel set only broad spending guidelines, was able to look at the long-term fiscal picture and was not besieged by lobbyists and constituents seeking to save their piece of the pie. "Appropriators, by their nature, only look year to year," he said. "They know next year they'll be back again," facing the same angry lobbyists and voters.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about Republican efforts to reduce Federal spending omitted part of the House Appropriations Committee's budget proposal for the National Endowment for the Arts. When an allotment for matching grants is included, the proposed budget is $99.5 million, or $62.9 million less than was allotted in 1995; the proposed budget is not $82.2 million.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
A 30-Something Tower Tries So Hard for a 90's Look

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
IT SEEMED, AT FIRST, LIKE THE best idea in the world. Why not reface 320 Park Avenue, the bland 34-story tower of glass and aluminum that since its completion in 1962 has rarely been thought of as anything other than a black mark on the street? Nobody much liked this dreary box: indeed, the building, across from St. Bartholomew's between 50th and 51st Streets, and its virtual twin next door epitomized the banality of postwar corporate architecture.
 Spiffing it up with some granite, a few ornamental moldings and a fancy top would be an easy way to turn this into a more serious building. And surely a post-modern tower would be a lot better on the great boulevard that has suffered so mightily at the hands of modern architecture than the commercial mediocrity of the origninal Emery Roth & Sons structure. 
 Anyway, so it appeared in 1993, when the architects Swanke, Hayden & Connell were commissioned by the Mutual of America insurance company to renovate 320 Park as a new headquarters. (The company purchased the building from the ITT Corporation, which had long used it as its headquarters.) Now, two years later, the work is done, the chrysalis of scaffolding has come off and the new 320 Park has been revealed to the world.
 Alas, $75 million worth of cosmetic surgery is not enough to give this 33-year-old body the youth it so clearly desires. In fact, as with a person whose face lifts reveal rather than hide true age, there is a sense of desperation to this whole venture that only makes the building look worse. In one step 320 Park has been transformed from a run-of-the-mill piece of commercial modernism to a shrill, overanxious piece of post-modernism. Which is worse, honest 1960's cheapness or disingenuous 1990's attempts at art?
 Since 350 Park Avenue, the mate of 320 Park, remains in more or less its original form (a new marble lobby was recently added) it is possible to compare before-and-after versions, a rare chance in the real world. I leave it to you to make up your own mind as to which building inflicts the least damage on the cityscape: the one that tries not at all or the one the tries much too hard.
 Why is this whole effort so disappointing? Part of it is the matter of fashion. We like to think that if buildings bespeak of the fashions of their time, at least they are there for the long haul, and that unlike hemlines, they don't change with the wind. Of course, they often do: this is far from the first time a new building has been built over the skeleton of an old one, though more often this change of architectural garb goes in the opposite direction and is a matter of replacing an ornate masonry skin with a modern glass one. Up the street, for example, the glass-fronted 430 Park Avenue was once a stone-faced apartment house; across town, the garish white One Times Square was once the handsome stone Times Tower.
 But when the owners of a building give in so quickly to the whims of fashion, one of the most enticing phenomena of architecture is lost -- the way in which the sense of a single moment, present at a building's conception, can mellow into something more lasting over time. The original version of 320 Park, mundane though it was, represented, as clearly as any book or film, a particular sensibility of the late 1950's, the heady postwar years of pragmatism and optimism when the building was designed.
 To think of this sensibility as existing only for a generation -- which is all that it has been -- suggests that ther was something flimsy, shallow, about the whole concept underlying the original design. Of course there was something pretty flimsy and shallow about the original design, and nothing would be worse than to pretend that 320 Park Avenue was a serious work of modern architecture in the manner of its great neighbors, Lever House or the Seagram Building, erected just a few years before. The 320 Park buikding was quick and cheap, put up as nothing but an enclosure around rentable space, without any illusions of architectural merit.
 But if it's dangerous to romanticize the original impulses behind 320 park, its's equally wrongheaded, I think, to treat this ordinary architecture as completely expendable. As the passage of time gives a certain patina to everything in the cityscape, even the banal buildings of the 1950's and 1960's possess a growing ability to evoke a moment of history, to be a kind of collective memory, which is, in the end, among the greatest gifts any work of architeicture, good or bad, can convey to us.
 THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF 320 Park Avenue was born of practicality more than great vision, but the new design, for all its pretense at grandeur, emerges out of a no less pragmatic instinct. There was a powerful economic incentive to renovate this tower rather than replace it, even though everything about the building was dated as its architectural style, and given the total reconstruction necessary on the original frame, a completely new building could have been cheaper.
 But it sould have had to have been roughly 40 percent smaller, since both 320 and 350 Park were started before the city's 1961 zoning ordinance took effect and did not have to comply with provisions that reduced the size and bulk of building permissible on these sites. Had 320 Park been torn down instead of renovated, a new building would have had to meet today's tighter zoning requirements.
 The "wedding cake" shape of 320 Park has always been rather graceless -- a bulky bottom, then a band of setbacks out of which is extruded a narrow, boxy tower. Sadly, putting post-modern clothing on this shape (changed slightly in the new version) makes the proportions no more natural and, if anything, calls attention to the awkwardness of the building's overall form. The original version at least had the decency to be quiet; the new one, with its six separate kinds of sheathing -- stone and glass in every kind of combination -- just shouts. This building aspires to dignity but comes off only as a piece of facile decoration. Is it classical? Modern? A kind of post-modern riff on Art Deco? None of these, or all of them? Take your pick. And the awkward triangular top, a gable topped by a strange metal sculpture-mast, does the one thing I never thought possible, which is to make me yearn for the pleasure of flat-topped buildings on the skyline.
 To give the building its due, the reworking of the mechanical systems has permitted ceiling heights that are eight inches higher than the mean original ones, and the new, two-story lobby is a big improvement on the low-ceilinged old one. It has some nice light fixtures, too.
 But the most telling detail of the whole enterprise is the way in which the northeast corner of the building, which contains the BMW Gallery, has been handled. Gray granite pilasters, which have been plunked onto the facade in a glib attempt at classical formality, obviously didn't fit with a German automaker's idea of sleekness. So the granite on this corner stops at the second floor, seeming to dangle 12 feet up.
 It looks absurd and renders this attempt at classical symmetry hollow. In the end, the clunkiness of it all clearly demonstrates that the fast, no-nonsense style of the original 320 Park had no monopoly on cynicism; there is plenty of it behind the new design, too. It just depends on whether you like your architectural exploitation plain or with all the trimmings.

HEADLINE: More and More Are Living Alone

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
UNLIKE the bustling family nests of old, new households on Long Island are just as likely to consist of people who live alone.
For the Island, which developed largely around growing families, the implications of the change are far reaching, according to specialists in health, housing and government affairs. 
 The experts paint a picture of an increasingly isolated populace in ever greater need of affordable rental housing, home care and other services. "It's mind boggling to think about," said the Nassau Commissioner of Senior Citizen Affairs, Rena Iacono.
Although Long Island are still larger than the national average -- 12 percent larger -- they have declined in size by 17 percent, to 2.96 people last year from 3.58 in 1970, according to the Long Island Regional Planning Board. In that period the number of households has increased 24 percent, to 870,000 from 700,000, the board said.
Many of the newly formed households consist of men and women who live alone. From 1980 to 1990 one-person households increased, to 142,000 from 113,000, and as a proportion of all households, to 17 percent from 14, the board said.
Although many of the new one-member households are unremarkable, increasingly they are being formed by troubled people who have moved from New York City to reduce expenses, said Dr. Max Cohen, a psychiatrist in Garden City for 40 years and a staff member of the Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research at Columbia University.
"New York City," Dr. Cohen said, "has been a magnet for people from all over the country who came here and lived essentially isolated, anonymous lives. A significant proportion of them had social problems. A significant number were what we'd characterize as schizoid. With economic pressures and the increase in rents in the city, there has been a movement of some of those people out into the immediate suburban area."
An increasing number of new one-member households are made up of people leaving psychiatric institutions whom the authoritieshave encouraged to live alone, said Marie McDermott, director of research and evaluation in the Nassau County Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities.
Over the years the department has placed in housing thousands of people whom the state ordered released from the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Hospital in West Brentwood. Since the 50's the patient load has declined, to 1,000, Ms. McDermott said. It was once 16,000.
She said 1,000 people lived in housing that the county kept track of, most are in some form of supervised homes. But 20 percent are in standard apartments. No records are available on how many of those are alone, but the number is rising, she said.
"There are," Ms. McDermott added, "definitely people in the system who need to be alone, because when they're teamed up with a roommate they're more likely to get into problems because of their mental illnesses. These people don't have the capacity to live comfortably with someone else."
Mental-health agencies, Ms. McDermott said, "are now developing more apartments where these people can live alone because of this problem."
The agencies are trying to establish additional one-person arrangements for formerly institutionalized people, even though living alone itself can be a source of stress without proper monitoring, she said, adding:
"Most of the data in the mental-health literature support that people who are living alone and do not have a support network are more vulnerable to the stress of life. So if they have a mental illness, too, and they're not getting the kind of support they need, naturally they're more vulnerable to having the problem exacerbated."
The evidence is anecdotal, Dr. Cohen said, but he said he saw a connection between living alone and mental illness. "In the old days," he said, "we saw people who had at least by and large been successful and well enough to establish and raise families. It's a different kind of person who lives alone out here. They tend to be more isolated, have more difficult or serious problems emotionally."
Whether a patient receives support services when living alone depends in large part on a willingness to cooperate with the treatment authorities, if the services are available. "We need a good 1,000 more beds just to handle what we expect will be the need in the next five years," Ms. McDermott said.
Isolation can be worse for the elderly, more of whom are living alone. The Planning Board reports that as the number of one-person households grew in the 80's, so did the elderly living alone, to 69,000 from 56,000, a 23 percent increase.
One way that old people who live alone fight isolation is by going to centers for the elderly for meals and opportunity to socialize.
For Dorothy Krash, 86, who lives alone in a ranch house in Massapequa, the companionship that she finds two days a week at a center in Farmingdale helps, she said, adding, "It's better than group therapy."
For Libby Boch, 72, the county center in New Hyde Park is where she relieves anxiety that she feels when she is alone. Ms. Boch, who is blind, goes to the center three days a week and, on other days, to private centers. Ms. Boch, who lives in a house that her sister owns, wonders what would happen if the centers were not there. "I think I'd go crazy," she said.
Many elderly people who live alone resist selling their houses, even if the maintenance has become difficult, said Ms. Iacono. "They prefer to stay in their own homes for as long as possible," she said.
Because her health has declined a bit, Ms. Krash has given up social activism, and a trip overseas did not turn out well because she was unable to keep up with the younger people. She continues to fret over a son who died many years ago at 19. Her husband died 10 years ago, and her daughter had a liver transplant. Ms. Krash, who now sees a psychotherapist, plays her piano and recorder and tends her garden, and she vows to keep her house, even though the upkeep is a burden.
Old people who want to keep their houses are becoming more knowledgeable about how the law could affect them, said George Roach, chief lawyer for the Senior Citizens Bureau of the Suffolk County Legal Aid Society. There was a common misconception, he said, that if a spouse, usually the husband, went to a nursing home his wife would have to divorce him to keep the house. "That really doesn't happen and shouldn't happen," Mr. Roach said. Under the law, he said, the spouse may keep the house, as well as other assets and apply to Family Court if additional income is needed.
Many elderly people, Mr. Roach said, have moral reservations about living unmarried with members of the opposite sex. Many also preferred not to live with members of the same sex, said Margaret Christy, Director of Community Development in Southampton.
A county program to promote house sharing for economic purposes a few years ago did not generate much interest, she added.
But the number of unmarried elderly housemates might be greater than it appears, contributing in part to an increase in the number of nonfamily households. Such arrangements are often kept confidential, Mr. Roach said, adding that the participants often do not report that fact to Social Security.
If, for example, a wife received benefits based on her late husband's income and that income was greater than her companion's, her benefit could be reduced.
Mr. Roach said another typical problem for an elderly woman who moves in with a man, whether or not they are married, is a failure to have her name on the house's deed. The man might, without her knowledge, sign over the property to his children. "He goes into a nursing home, and when he dies, his kids are on the doorstep saying: 'Hey Mabel, pack your bags. You're out of here.' And she doesn't have a leg to stand on."
Barring financial problems, many older people who live alone are able to hold onto their houses as long as they are healthy. "The big issue is health-care concerns," Mr. Roach said. "You don't have a spouse now or a companion, or you don't have a child to come in and look in on you. That old, 'I've fallen and I can't get up,' is very true."
That is why home care is so important, said Maureen Porta, Senior Citizens Program Administrator in Suffolk County. "We see a very great increase in the demand for in-home community-based services," Ms. Porta said, "because not only are more people living alone, the greatest population increase is in the old-old. These people have multiple and chronic health conditions. Many are unable to drive and they need extensive community support to remain at home."
The County Office for the Aging provides 850 people over 60 with services like shopping, light housekeeping and grooming, assigning case managers who assess the handicap. All the in-home programs are oversubscribed, Ms. Porta said, adding that 500 are on a waiting list from which they will be chosen based on how severely they are impaired.
Some towns provide home services. In Southampton, where one-fourth of the population of 45,000 is older than 60, the town delivers 150 hot meals a day and serves a total of 150 at its three centers for the elderly, Ms. Christy said. The program is financed mostly by the State Office for the Aging.
For the elderly who want to live alone but cannot maintain their houses, affordable rentals are scarce, said Patricia Lunetta, Director of the Suffolk County Office for the Aging.
In Suffolk the number of elderly living alone grew 31 percent, to 30,000, from 1980 to 1990.
Modern planning calls for housing to fit a community's "life cycle," Ms. Christy said, adding:
"You have small apartments for the newlyweds. You have small homes when they are ready to upgrade, when they have one or two children. You have larger homes for larger families. And then the elderly finish the cycle and move back into apartments. Unfortunately, Suffolk wasn't planned that way."
The area has an oversupply of single-family detached homes, she said.
One of the few developments with rentals for the elderly is being built by the Long Island Housing Partnership in Bay Shore. Each of eight three-bedroom houses under construction on the western side of East Third Avenue will have attached a subsidized accessory apartment reserved for the elderly. "There's definitely a need," said Peter J. Elkowitz, vice president of the partnership.
The complex is one part of the group's activities. Most of the houses that it builds are aimed at families, focusing on the smaller ones typical of today.
Nationally, demographers say, households with children under 18 account for fewer than half of all families.
"Most of our homes are the 1,200-square-foot three-bedroom type," Mr. Elkowitz said. "We find that sufficient. Maybe years ago that would not have been sufficient if you have a family size of four or five or six."
The growing number of vacant schools is visible evidence of the shrinking households. Some developers are turning them into housing for the elderly.
"The need is definitely growing because the demographics are there," said Wayne L. Kaplan, a partner in the Kapson Group of Woodbury, which operates four adult homes on the Island.
One project, the 106,000-square-foot former Larkfield School on 12 acres at Cheshire Place and Larkfield Road in East Northport, is being rebuilt as a so-called assisted-living facility. Construction on the 200-bed home, which began in February, is scheduled to be completed in the winter, Mr. Kaplan said.
Kapson has also converted a former elementary school on 14 acres off Beverly Road in Huntington Station into a 200-bed adult home that was fully occupied four months after it had opened, and the home maintains a waiting list. Kapson is developing other adult homes on and off the Island.
Other developers are converting former schools into adult homes, as well, and others are converting buildings to other uses for the elderly. The center in New Hyde Park is a former school.
Most adult homes are aimed at people who do not need full nursing-home services but cannot continue to live alone. More comprehensive, so-called life-care communities, are being planned for elderly people who are still able to live alone but want lifetime security.
Residents sign a contract under which they move into independent living units that are essentially standard apartments. As they become increasingly debilitated, they move into adult homes and then nursing homes, all usually on or near one site.
The government-approval process for such developments is extensive, including reviews by building agencies and the state's Departments of Health, Social Services and Insurance, as well as the Attorney General and Office for the Aging. None has been built on the Island.
A plan for a life-care community on 104 acres in Southampton was recently turned down by the Town Board because of local opposition, said Mr. Kaplan, who is on the New York State Life Care Community Council, which approves the projects. William G. Thompson, a local builder and trustee for the project, said he intended to seek a new site.
A life-care community being developed by Episcopal Health Services in Smithtown was recently approved to accept deposits in an attempt to test the market, Mr. Kaplan said. Unlike the Southampton plan, the Smithtown project would use existing buildings, including the St. John's Village housing complex, the Lutheran Center for the Aging and the Bishop Jonathan G. Sherman Episcopal Nursing Home on the grounds of St. John's Episcopal Hospital.
Most adult-living developments with health-care components require substantial assets, as much as several hundred thousand dollars up front and thousands a month. Some elderly people, unable to afford the price or preferring to live with their families, move in with their adult children and grandchildren, Mr. Roach said.
But, he said, those who have neither money nor willing relatives are facing the bleaker prospect of life in a community hospital. "You see whole wings of elderly geriatric patients who are there essentially convalescing," Mr. Roach said. "They need nursing-home care. But there aren't any beds for them to move into because they don't have the financial resources."
Ms. Lunetta said the budget of the Suffolk Office on Aging had declined, to $8 million from $11 million in the early 80's. "If the trend continues," she said, "services will definitely be decreased." The congregate-meals plan, which receives $4 million a year, might serve four, rather than five, hot meals a week. A frozen dinner might function as the fifth.
In Nassau, failure to increase the $14 million budget for the Senior Citizen Affairs Department could mean reduced services. "Funding has not kept pace with the growing numbers of older people," Ms. Iacono said. Although she supports the goal of balanced budgets, she said, "We're concerned that the kinds of changes made are carefully thought out."
