HEADLINE: Canada Sets Goal to Cut Car Emissions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
Two top Canadian ministers said Wednesday that they had resolved to cut global-warming emissions of cars and trucks sold in Canada by 25 percent by the end of the decade.
 The commitment means that the auto industry faces steep cuts in greenhouse gases in Canada as well as in California and the Northeastern United States, a geographic expanse that encompasses nearly one-third of the cars and trucks sold in North America.
 The Canadian ministers said they expected to conclude soon several years of negotiations with the auto industry over the government's 25 percent emissions reduction goal, and they made clear in an unusual joint interview Wednesday that they would not settle for a lower reduction number.
 ''We're very clear where we want to go,'' said John Efford, Canada's natural resources minister. ''We are not backing off from our position. Are we going to say 10 percent is O.K.? Fifteen percent? No. Twenty-five percent is our goal and the auto industry clearly understands that.'' 
 Stephane Dion, Canada's environment minister, said ''the fact that California has moved, the fact that some northern states like Maine and New York are saying that they are considering to take the same regulations as California, if you add Canada to that, it's a third of the market. I don't see why North America can't be a leader instead of a follower.'' 
 Seven Northeastern states follow California's air quality regulations, and in a meeting earlier this month representatives from those states indicated they were likely to follow California's new greenhouse gas regulation, adopted in September, which lays out a 30 percent emissions reduction by 2016.
 The California regulation still faces an almost certain legal challenge from the auto industry.
 Mr. Dion and Mr. Efford also met Wednesday with Fran Pavley, the California assemblywoman who sponsored that state's greenhouse gas regulation. Ms. Pavley brought a letter from a top official in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration seeking to work cooperatively with Canada on the issue. Mr. Dion has said he planned to visit the state to further study its plan. 
 ''We can drive the market forces,'' said Ms. Pavley. ''We can leverage the market forces if California joins with some states in the United States and Canada, which will help encourage the automobile manufacturers.''
 Automakers strongly oppose the proposed curbs on greenhouse gas emissions because they would be forced to substantially improve the fuel economy of the cars and trucks they make. 
 Mark Nantais, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said a 25 percent emissions reduction would require a costly reinvention of Canada's vehicles in a very short time. 
 ''Basically, it means that roughly 95 percent of the passenger cars in Canada won't make the cut,'' he said. ''We've told the government that we don't think their intent was really to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a fashion that's not sustainable, or place an undue burden on one sector over another. We're hoping we'll have a reasoned approach on this.''
 Regulating greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane is a separate issue from regulating emissions of smog-forming particles that come from the tailpipe, which can be filtered by using a catalytic converter. No such device exists to filter carbon dioxide, so automakers will have to substantially improve fuel economy to cut those emissions. 
 Environmentalists regard the California regulation as increasingly important after the re-election of President Bush, who has opposed greenhouse gas regulations, including the Kyoto agreement, a global pact aimed at cutting emissions. They also say that technologies like hybrid electric cars, including the Toyota Prius, are proof that the industry already has the technology to exceed the proposals. 
 Because California's air quality rules predated those of the federal government, California is allowed under the Clean Air Act to set its own rules. Other states can either follow all of Washington's air rules or all of California's more stringent rules. Earlier this month, representatives of the seven Northeastern states that follow California's air regulations met.
 ''The indication was that none planned to alter their adherence to the program,'' said Ken Colburn, the president of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which hosted the meeting. The states that currently follow or plan to follow California's air rules are New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Raise Federal Debt Limit

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of a government unable to pay its bills, the Senate voted on Wednesday to raise the federal debt limit by $800 billion.
 Though an increase in the debt ceiling was never in doubt, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress postponed action on it last month, until after the elections, to deprive Democrats of a chance to accuse them of fiscal irresponsibility.
 The bill, if approved by the House in a vote expected on Thursday, would authorize the third big increase in the federal borrowing since President Bush took office in 2001. Federal debt has ballooned by $1.4 trillion over the past four years, to $7.4 trillion, and the new ceiling would allow borrowing to reach $8.2 trillion. 
 With no end in sight to the huge annual budget deficits, which hit a record of $412 billion this year, lawmakers predicted on Wednesday that the new ceiling would probably have to be raised again in about a year.
 Democrats, still stinging from their election defeats, voted against the measure and argued that it should be accompanied by rules that would force Congress to pay for new tax cuts with spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.
 ''I don't remember anyone during the elections making a promise to raise the federal debt to $8.1 trillion,'' Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said. ''What we're doing here is just writing another blank check and saying to this administration, 'Go ahead, continue to run record budget deficits.'''
 Administration officials have been pleading for an increase in the debt limit since last August, and the Treasury Department has been tapping into Civil Service retirement accounts since Oct. 14 to avoid breaching the limit.
 On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow warned that the administration had ''exhausted'' all the previously used financial maneuvers. The government can probably keep paying bills until early next month, but the Treasury Department would have to postpone an auction of new Treasury securities scheduled for Monday.
 Raising the legal borrowing limit has long been more political theater than substantive decision making, because lawmakers ultimately have no choice in the matter if the government is to stay in operation.
 The 52-to-44 vote was almost purely along party lines, with one Republican, Senator John Ensign of Nevada, voting against a higher ceiling. 
 Two Democrats, Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia, voted in favor of the measure.
 Some Republican lawmakers had hoped to bury the measure in a broader spending bill that would attract less attention and that many Democrats would feel compelled to support. But Senate leaders decided to vote on a stand-alone bill in exchange for a commitment from Democrats to limit the debate.
 ''We've come to a general agreement to move ahead today,'' Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, said. ''The House literally is waiting for us to act.''
 In a muted floor debate, Democrats did almost all the talking -- all aimed at castigating the administration and its Congressional allies for indulging in ''borrow and spend'' policies -- while Republicans grimly waited for the debate to end and the vote to begin.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, in his first appearance on the floor since losing the presidential election, said the growing debt threatened economic security.
 ''To pay our bills, America now goes cup in hand to nations like China, Korea, Taiwan and Caribbean banking centers,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Those issues didn't go away on Nov. 3, no matter what the results.''
 Administration officials contend that the annual deficits are undesirable but necessary to help stimulate an economic recovery and fight a global war on terrorism. 
 Mr. Bush has promised to reduce the deficit by half over five years, though the administration is fighting to make its tax cuts permanent and may need more than $70 billion in extra money next year to support military operations in Iraq.
 House Republicans said they would schedule a vote on the bill for Thursday evening. 
 ''We'll get it done,'' John Feehry, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said. ''We have an obligation to keep the government in operation.''

HEADLINE: The Architect Behind Kmart's Surprising Takeover of Sears

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
About 10 days ago, Edward S. Lampert placed a call to his newest hire, Aylwin B. Lewis, whom he had installed as the chief executive of Kmart only a week earlier. 
 Then he dropped a bombshell: he planned to buy Sears. ''Oh my God,'' Mr. Lewis said he replied. 
 Mr. Lampert, known as Eddie, loves to surprise people. Indeed, he has made a career of it. Mr. Lampert, a 42-year-old hedge fund manager whose business idol is Warren E. Buffett, is the largest investor in Kmart, the chairman of its board and the architect of the bold takeover of Sears. 
 After a tottering Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2002, Mr. Lampert began buying its bonds, making a contrarian bet that if he could take control, he could turn the company around. 
 He also noticed something that most other investors did not: the value of Kmart's real estate might be worth more than the business itself. 
 So, for slightly less than $1 billion, his investment company bought control of Kmart, a stake now worth about $2.5 billion.
 The Sears acquisition will be a gamble, but Mr. Lampert, who once worked at Goldman Sachs for one of Wall Street's greatest masters of risk, Robert E. Rubin, seems to love to roll the dice. 
 ''I am comfortable with uncertainty,'' he said yesterday with a sense of bring-it-on confidence during an interview in Midtown Manhattan. 
 Having slowed Kmart's sales decline and returned the company to profitability by overhauling management and selling stores, he has upped the ante with another high-stakes gamble, this time on Sears. But, as with Kmart, the value of Sears's real estate should provide a financial safety cushion should the combined company continue to lose ground to rival Wal-Mart.
 Mr. Lampert is likely to turn his intense focus to integrating the combined Kmart-Sears.
 ''He will be pretty engaged,'' said John Phelan, a former partner at Mr. Lampert's firm, ESL Investments, and now a managing principal with MSD Capital, which invests money on behalf of Michael S. Dell. ''He has taken a very big bet on this company and it's clearly in his economic interest to work it.''
 The deal catapults Mr. Lampert, a virtual unknown several years ago, to one of the most powerful people in retailing and a major player on Wall Street. Until recently, he was perhaps best known outside the financial world for having been kidnapped for ransom in 2003, and talking his captors into releasing him.
 Mr. Lampert got his start trading takeover stocks at Goldman Sachs in the 1980's. In 1988, with backing from the investor Richard E. Rainwater, he set up ESL Investments, starting with $28 million in capital.
 Sixteen years later, ESL manages about $10 billion, and Mr. Lampert is worth an estimated $1.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. ESL and its affiliates will own more than a third of the new company after the deal is completed.
 He has one of the best track records in the investment business, with returns averaging 29 percent a year since 1988, and a blue-chip roster of investment clients, including the Ziff family of publishing fame, the entertainment mogul David Geffen and Mr. Dell, the computer billionaire. Last year, ESL had returns of more than 50 percent; this year the fund is up some 40 percent through October, people briefed on its results said. Kmart is the latest in a string of successful big bets by Mr. Lampert. His funds have also earned high returns from long-term stakes in AutoZone, an auto parts retailer, and AutoNation, a car dealership chain.
 In the latest deal, Mr. Lampert is betting that combining Kmart with Sears will solve problems at both companies, even though many Wall Street analysts expressed skepticism about the pact. Kmart, he said, needs access to better, higher-margin products like Sears's Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools. 
 And Sears, which has long been the anchor tenant of shopping malls, is seeking to expand into stand-alone stores, like many Kmart properties. Such stores have been a great success for rivals like Wal-Mart. He said he sees ''significant opportunities'' to convert some Kmart stores into Sears stores and also bring Sears products into Kmart.
 And, taking a page from Mr. Buffett, he said he only cared about the long-term business and would not worry about the consistency of the combined company's quarterly earnings, at one point saying they may be ''lumpy.''
 ''We will be able to manage the business strategically,'' Mr. Lampert said, ''and for the long term without having to worry about figuring out how to make monthly same-store sales, hit a specific target, and without giving any type of quarterly earnings guidance and then trying to manage the business for that guidance.''
 Mr. Lampert's interest in Sears accelerated after Kmart sold some 54 stores to Sears for $621 million over the summer. The sale had been a learning experience for both Kmart and Sears, executives involved in the deal said. Talks began in earnest in late October and went into overdrive about two weeks ago, the executives said, after it seemed another investor might make a Lampert-like move on the retailer. On Nov. 5, Vornado Realty Trust disclosed that it had bought a 4.3 percent stake in Sears, sending its shares up some 18 percent, as investors began revaluing the company based on its real estate.
 With Sears's stock jumping -- and Kmart's shares moving higher, too -- Mr. Lampert knew he had to move fast, the executives said. A bevy of marathon conference calls and meetings between Mr. Lampert, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and Alan J. Lacy, the chief executive of Sears, ensued.
 By last Wednesday, Mr. Lampert and Mr. Lacy signed confidentiality agreements that allowed each company access to the other's confidential financial information, the executives said. An army of bankers and lawyers holed up at the Midtown Manhattan offices of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, the law firm advising Sears. A team of bankers from Lehman Brothers and lawyers from Simpson Thatcher Bartlett, who were working for Kmart, combed through Sears's records over the weekend, while bankers from Morgan Stanley, working for Sears and along with Wachtell, did the same with Kmart's records. 
 After negotiating on Sunday and Monday, the companies reached an agreement on price, the executives said. And though they planned to wrap up the deal later this week and announce it next Monday, the decision was made to announce the transaction yesterday, to avoid the possibility that news would leak and send the companies' stock prices on a roller coaster ride.
 Yesterday, Mr. Lampert was out selling his deal with the zeal of a salesman and the conservatism of his idol, Mr. Buffett.
 Would Mr. Buffett have made this deal? Mr. Lampert was asked. 
 ''You've got to ask him,'' he replied.

HEADLINE: A Good Deal Goes Begging

 BODY:
Last week, President Bush professed a desire to see a true peace in the Middle East, one where Israel can live alongside its Arab neighbors in serenity and harmony and all other good things. So why in the world is his administration holding up a trade deal between Israel and Egypt that could increase economic cooperation between the two countries? 
 Back in 1996, Congress passed a law giving Jordan and Egypt duty-free access to some parts of the American market if those products included some Israeli content. The point of the law was to encourage commercial ties between Israel and the Arab world, and to weaken the Arab boycott of Israel. Jordan embraced the law and set up special industrial zones for textile exports that included Israeli content, like zippers and fabric lining. Egypt, for its part, dallied for years; Egyptian officials cited the Palestinian intifada as one reason why they didn't want to be seen as embracing Israel.
 But this year, Egypt finally came to its senses. The coming end in December of the United States quota system that has protected textile manufacturers from Chinese competition may have had something to do with the Egyptian turnaround. But whatever the cause, Cairo has agreed to establish special trade zones for duty-free exports to the United States. Such exports -- mostly clothing and textiles -- would include 11.7 percent Israeli content. Israel and Egypt quietly signed the pact in September. Great news, right?
 Wrong. United States trade officials haven't approved the deal, citing concerns that it could hurt American textile and apparel companies. Apparently peace in our time isn't quite so important after all, especially not when measured against protecting important political constituencies.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's column against construction of the New York Sports and Convention Center (''Feed the Billionaire, Starve the Students,'' Nov. 15) implies that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been influenced by contributions from Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. In fact, the mayor has never taken a political contribution in his life.
 Mr. Herbert, in suggesting that the city's plan to invest $300 million in the project would deprive New York City public school students of needed facilities and resources, doesn't mention that Mayor Bloomberg has increased the city's school capital budget by $2 billion and that the mayor's $13.1 billion capital plan for schools is more than 40 times larger than the city's contribution to the Sports and Convention Center.
 Despite Mr. Herbert's suggestion that we can afford to invest in education but not economic development, Mayor Bloomberg knows that we must do both. Along with an ambitious school capital plan, building the Sports and Convention Center over unused rail yards, creating thousands of new jobs, is one of the smartest investments we can make in our future.

HEADLINE: For City Official and Developer, Close Ties Mean Close Scrutiny

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, has been a friend of the city's largest developer, Stephen J. Ross, since 1997. They are former business partners, each having owned a piece of the New York Islanders. And Mr. Ross took over a loan Mr. Doctoroff had made to the city's Olympic bid committee, relieving Mr. Doctoroff of a conflict that could have jeopardized his move into public service.
 So it might not have been surprising that when Mr. Doctoroff joined the Bloomberg administration in 2002, he often turned to Mr. Ross for real estate advice on big projects, like the development potential of the Bronx Terminal Market and retailing at the World Trade Center site, just as he had sought help in 2001 with the financing plan for a proposed Olympic Village in Queens.
 And when Mr. Doctoroff needed help selling his ambitious plans for building an Olympic stadium and redeveloping the West Side to the powerful Real Estate Board of New York, Mr. Ross led a spirited defense of the plan, winning over key board members who had raised questions. 
 But when the Bloomberg administration was disappointed by progress at the South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan, it agreed to a plan in which Mr. Ross's company, Related Companies, would assume control of the Seaport and substantially redevelop the area, without using a competitive bidding process. The company also won a lease to redevelop the Bronx Terminal Market without competition, one of only two projects outside Lower Manhattan for which the city is recommending the use of tax-free Liberty Bonds, which are meant to help rebuild New York after the attack on the World Trade Center.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's press secretary, Edward Skyler, said that the city's dealings with Mr. Ross were in the best interest of New York, and that there was no evidence his company got preferential treatment. There have been no suggestions of financial impropriety. 
 But the relationship between Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Ross illustrates the problem that can result when former business executives move into high-ranking government roles. The knowledge and relationships gained in the business world can often be of great benefit to the city, saving the taxpayers money and producing significant new projects. But they can also lead to charges of favoritism and raise questions of conflicts of interest. 
 Mr. Ross and Mr. Doctoroff are already quite wealthy, and Related's work on city projects pales in comparison to its private portfolio: building the $1.8 billion Time Warner Center complex at Columbus Circle; acquiring the $150 million, blocklong Manhattan Plaza complex near Times Square; constructing a squadron of residential towers; and proposing a Nascar race track and shopping mall on Staten Island.
 When Mr. Doctoroff took office, he voluntarily announced that because Mr. Ross had taken responsibility for his loan to the city's Olympic committee, he would not engage in negotiations with Mr. Ross or with Related, where Mr. Ross is the chief executive. But both men now acknowledge that they have had several business conversations. For example, Mr. Doctoroff said he had suggested to the city's planning team last year that it talk to Related on a ''pro bono'' basis about an alternative to the original underground mall concept at the trade center site.
 The relationship between the two men has been the subject of much behind-the-scenes debate and discussion in political and real estate circles. The loudest grumbling, unsurprisingly, comes from Related's competitors, some of whom are openly wondering whether Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Ross share such similar visions of major projects that other voices go unheard.
 ''There are always reasonable explanations for what's going on, but when you look at the pattern of behavior between the city and Related, one suspects that there is more going on than pure public policy considerations,'' said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for some of Related's competitors who clashed with Mr. Doctoroff and Related over a project in Harlem. ''In my experience, Related has a favored-nation status.''
 Critics say the city should have invited competitive bids rather than simply handing over to Mr. Ross's company the Bronx Terminal Market, a residential and retail project at the Gateway site in southeast Brooklyn, and, if the deal is completed, the South Street Seaport. 
 ''Steve Ross is a big, reputable, and successful developer,'' said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, who has occasionally tangled with Mr. Doctoroff. ''All major development decisions end up on Dan's office; he's not a guy who delegates a lot. Given their past personal and business relationships, it's vitally important that these transactions be above board, and whenever possible, subject to competitive bidding.''
 One councilman, Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat from Queens, said the City Council should look into their relationship.
 Some of Related's competitors have grumbled that Mr. Ross's company often gets special treatment, as when the city backed Related's request for $44 million in Liberty Bonds for a small development project in Bronxchester in the South Bronx. 
 Although it is impossible to put a price tag on what the various city-related projects could mean for Related, some of the projects have the potential to be quite lucrative if developed in full.
 Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Ross vehemently denied any suggestion that their friendship led to special treatment for Related. In several cases, they said, Related or its partners had begun city projects well before the administration came into office in 2002 and won new contracts to continue that work. Mr. Doctoroff said that he has not been in any direct negotiations with Mr. Ross or Related and that he is not a member of the group that reviews Liberty Bond applications, although the people who do review them report to him.
 It is hard, they said, for a developer as busy as Mr. Ross to avoid contact with city officials. Mr. Ross, one of the most active developers both before and after Mr. Bloomberg took office, attributes much of the complaining by other developers to sour grapes in a competitive field.
 ''We're the most aggressive guys in the city,'' Mr. Ross said. ''We like complicated projects.''
 Mr. Skyler said any allegation of favoritism was a ''baseless smear,'' adding that Mr. Doctoroff has never been involved in any decision to select Related as a developer on a city project. 
 ''Does that mean Doctoroff or his staff never spoke to anyone at the company in the last three years?'' he said in a written response to questions. ''Does that mean that he has refused to be properly informed of any city project in which Related might be involved? No -- he is the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. It would have been absurd, counterproductive and detrimental to the city for him or his staff, or agencies that report to him to take such an extreme course of action.''
 Mr. Ross and Mr. Doctoroff are both tall, lean and driven men who see New York as a vibrant city where major new projects are possible and who believe that winning the Olympics could transform a great deal about the city. Although both men grew up in suburban Detroit, Mr. Ross said, he did not meet Mr. Doctoroff, then an investment banker, until 1997. They joined with two other investors that year to buy a professional hockey team, the Islanders, for $195 million. Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Ross each took a 5 percent stake in the team, but the group lost an estimated $40 million and sold the team in 2000 for $187.5 million.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Ross developed a fast friendship. ''We hit it off,'' Mr. Ross said in a 2002 interview. ''We've become very close.''
 Mr. Ross, 64, adopted Mr. Doctoroff's passionate quest for the 2012 Olympics, which both men see as an opportunity to enhance the city's image and to revitalize the West Side of Manhattan. The developer became a prominent fund-raiser for the Olympic bid committee formed by Mr. Doctoroff and worked with city planners on the conceptual design for the Olympic Village in Queens.
 In December 2001, while Mr. Bloomberg was mayor-elect, he tapped Mr. Doctoroff to be deputy mayor for economic development. As a result, Mr. Doctoroff stepped down as chairman of NYC2012. But to avoid a conflict, he needed the committee to repay $3.2 million of the $4 million in personal funds he had poured into NYC2012 before he joined the administration. Mr. Ross said Jay Kriegel, executive director of NYC2012, asked him to guarantee the loan from M&T Bank.
 The city's Conflicts of Interest Board ruled that there was no prohibition on contact between Mr. Doctoroff and Related, but Mr. Doctoroff said he would go beyond the ruling.
 ''I set a standard that far exceeded what the conflicts of interest law required of me -- that I would not get involved in the selection of Related as developer, or negotiate with them,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 But Mr. Ross said the two men did speak. ''He would call me from time to time shortly after he came into office to ask my opinion,'' Mr. Ross explained, ''but he didn't tell me the details.''
 Mr. Doctoroff no longer calls for advice, he added.
 ''He's a friend,'' Mr. Ross said in an interview at his office on Madison Avenue, ''but I don't talk to him about business.''
 One of the first things Mr. Doctoroff asked about was the city-owned Bronx Terminal Market near Yankee Stadium, so dilapidated that the city had wrestled in and out of court with the tenant, David Buntzman, for nearly 20 years. Another trial date was pending in the spring of 2002 when, as part of settlement discussions, Mr. Doctoroff asked Mr. Ross to assess the desirability of the site for development, Mr. Doctoroff said.
 A year later, Related agreed to buy out Mr. Buntzman and develop the site into a shopping mall and waterfront park. In exchange, the company will pay $42.5 million. Mr. Doctoroff immediately called Richard Ravitch, the mediator in the talks between the city and Mr. Buntzman, and said he was recusing himself from the talks, Mr. Ravitch said.
 But critics like Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat of Manhattan asked why the city had not solicited competing bids through a process known as a request for proposals, or R.F.P, to ensure that it got the best deal. 
 ''There should be an open and competitive selection process,'' Mr. Espaillat said.
 Mr. Doctoroff said the city could not interfere in what was essentially a private transaction because Mr. Buntzman's lease did not expire until 2052. ''We can't R.F.P. a lease that we don't control,'' he said. 
 The city was not without clout in the talks. Executives from the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is under Mr. Doctoroff's control, played important roles in the three-way negotiations with Related and Mr. Buntzman, and they had veto power over the deal, according to people on all sides of the talks. 
 At the same time, the city agreed to a series of concessions important to the deal, including several land swaps and support for Related's request for $80 million in Liberty Bonds. At one point, Mr. Doctoroff said, he urged his team to take a stronger stance in negotiations with Related. But, he said, under the lease, the city could not unreasonably withhold approval of the deal.
 Related is now trying to work out a deal at the South Street Seaport, an important tourist destination but a money loser for its operator, the Rouse Company. Mr. Doctoroff and the Bloomberg administration have worked since the World Trade Center attacks to enliven the area and create a residential corridor along Fulton Street.
 At the same time, the city had also been looking for a home for Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian circus company, and had introduced the company to several developers, including Related. Mr. Ross said he immediately thought the circus company would be appropriate for the Seaport, and began discussions with Rouse.
 Mr. Ross said he reached a tentative leasing agreement with Rouse and began negotiating with city officials in June 2003 about major changes of the Seaport, demolishing the pavilion, and building a permanent home for Cirque du Soleil. The deal has not been completed and may fall apart.
 Earlier this year, Mr. Doctoroff told officials at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation that he would seek $60 million in federal money for infrastructure related to the project.
 Mr. Skyler said Mr. Doctoroff was not involved in the negotiations, and did not advocate the use of federal funds for the Seaport until after the city's project team determined that it was necessary. Those team members, however, report to Mr. Doctoroff.
 Mr. Ross, however, said he did have one meeting with Mr. Doctoroff when ''Cirque wanted to make sure the city was committed to the deal.''
 ''It's the greatest thing in the world for the city,'' Mr. Ross said. ''You have to make a statement downtown or you're going to lose all those corporations.''
 Some executives involved with rebuilding Lower Manhattan questioned why the city would not request proposals from other developers, given the major change in direction at the seaport. In all likelihood, they say, Related would have won, because it had an attractive tenant like Cirque.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the close ties between Daniel L. Doctoroff, a New York City deputy mayor, and Stephen J. Ross, the prominent developer, referred incorrectly to the city's recommendation that two of Mr. Ross's projects in the Bronx be eligible for tax-free Liberty Bonds. Mr. Ross is not the only developer who has received such a recommendation for a project outside Lower Manhattan. There have been four others -- for projects in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. 
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about critics' claims that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg erred in promising a developer generous incentives to transform the Bronx Terminal Market into a shopping mall misstated the developer's middle initial in some copies. (The error also appeared in articles last Aug. 25 and on Nov. 19, 2004, and in a correction on Nov. 20, 2004.) He is Stephen M. Ross, not J.

HEADLINE: Catskills Casinos Are Closer After Land Claim Accord

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York announced an agreement yesterday to settle the tribe's 200-year-old claim to 64,000 acres in central New York in exchange for the right to operate a casino, moving the long-debated idea of casino gambling in the Catskills closer to reality.
 The deal came six days after Governor Pataki announced a similar agreement between the state and the Seneca-Cayuga tribe of Oklahoma, which was also a party to the same land claim and is trying to build its own casino in the Catskills. 
 The New York Cayugas are planning to build a $500 million, Las Vegas-style casino next to a raceway in Monticello in Sullivan County, 90 miles from New York City. It would dwarf the four Indian casinos already operating in New York and, according to analysts, could pull in an estimated $1 billion a year in revenues, posing significant competition to the Atlantic City gambling resorts and the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. 
 The Seneca-Cayugas are still discussing the design and location of a casino. Robert A. Berman, chief executive of Empire Resorts, the tribe's development partner, said he was encouraging the tribe to consider developing the Concord Resort Hotel at Kiamesha Lake, which closed in 1998.
 The two agreements -- which emerged after years of negotiations, administrative procedure and litigation -- represent the most progress anyone has made in the 30-year effort to use gambling to revive the Catskill Mountains resort area.
 But the deals still require the approval of both the State Legislature and Congress. In recent years, the Pataki administration has announced gambling agreements with various tribes, only to see them collapse.
 A tentative agreement in June between the New York Cayugas and Governor Pataki that would have opened the door to a casino development collapsed in July when the tribe rejected a settlement offer in the land-claim lawsuit, which involved land in Cayuga and Seneca Counties. Negotiations stalled for months, but resumed after the Seneca-Cayugas reached an agreement with the state that was announced last Friday.
 The Pataki administration said yesterday that it did not anticipate any more pitfalls in the path of the two deals. ''We're confident that we can get the necessary approvals to move this process forward,'' said Todd Alhart, a spokesman for Governor Pataki.
 Republican and Democratic state legislators have berated the Pataki administration for not moving fast enough to bring casinos to the Catskills. But yesterday, some Congressional officials said they felt the Pataki administration had rushed the Cayuga deal without proper consultation with either local residents or the state's Congressional delegation.
 ''It's been done in a very hurried and, I would say, haphazard kind of way,'' said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a Democrat whose district includes Sullivan County.
 A spokesman for Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, said that while the senator supported the casinos in the Catskills, the agreements were not ready for full Congressional review.
 ''The communities in Seneca, Cayuga and Sullivan counties have not yet reached consensus given the short amount of time they were given to look at this, and we want to make sure their needs are fully protected before moving forward,'' said the spokesman, Blake Zeff.
 Both officials said they doubted that there was enough time -- or willingness on the part of the New York Congressional delegation -- to push the bills through Congress before the end of its session.
 Mr. Berman, however, dismissed the congressmen's complaints, saying, ''The underlying projects are something the delegation has been aware of for years.''
 The Pataki administration says the two casino projects will create thousands of new jobs and improve the economy of the Catskills region.
 The Pataki administration has been negotiating for years to settle land claims with half a dozen New York tribes, hoping to use the promise of casinos, rather than taxpayer dollars, to persuade tribes to drop their claims.
 Under the agreement announced yesterday, the state will be allowed to continue with its appeal of a federal court ruling from 2001 that awarded $247.9 million to the Cayugas and the Seneca-Cayugas to redress the state's illegal purchase of Indian tribal land more than 200 years ago. The Seneca-Cayugas are based in northeastern Oklahoma but trace their lineage to lands in New York.
 If the award is affirmed on appeal, the agreement sets a cap of $150 million on what the state will have to pay the New York Cayugas and permits the New York Cayugas to purchase 10,000 acres within the claim area.
 But if the award is not upheld, the state will not pay anything to the Cayugas and the tribe will not be entitled to purchase more than 2,500 acres in the claim area, the agreement said.
 The deal also requires the state and the Cayugas to pay $3 million annually to Seneca and Cayuga Counties and to negotiate price parity on sales of alcohol, cigarettes, gasoline and other products by Indian vendors to non-Indians.
 In its separate agreement with the state, the Seneca-Cayugas decided to end its litigation against the state and relinquish any interest it has in the $247.9 million judgment it obtained in 2001. The tribe also agreed to reimburse the state any final monetary judgment awarded to the New York Cayugas in the land claim litigation.

HEADLINE: Indicators Down Once Again, Signaling Slow Growth Ahead

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The economy could be headed for slower growth in the next several months, according to a report released yesterday by a private research group. A separate report showed a drop in weekly claims for unemployment benefits.
 The research group, the Conference Board, said its index of leading economic indicators fell in October for the fifth consecutive month. While the monthly declines have been small, they provide a ''clear signal that the economy is losing steam,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the group, which is based in New York. 
 The index fell 0.3 percent in October -- worse than the 0.1 percent decline that economists had expected -- after declining the same amount in September, August and July. It declined 0.1 percent in June. The index, which is intended to predict economic activity over the next three to six months, now stands at 115.1 after reaching a high of 116.5 in May.
 The Conference Board noted that despite more widespread signs of economic weakness, the recent decline in the index did not indicate that the expansion was coming to an end.
 Many economists expect the economy could be headed for slower growth, but how much slower remains a subject of debate. Recent data have been clouded by the effects of the hurricanes in Florida and jitters among consumers and businesses before the presidential election.
 With those factors gone, the main uncertainties facing the economy are job creation and consumer spending during the holiday shopping season, which is critical to retailers.
 The index is calculated by combining a number of factors believed to be good indicators of the direction of the economy over the next three to six months, like manufacturing, interest rates, consumer expectations, stock prices and money supply.
 In a positive sign, the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment insurance dropped by a seasonally adjusted 3,000, to 334,000, last week, the lowest level since the end of October. New filings increased by 5,000 the week before.
 The labor market has lagged other parts of the economy that have improved since the summer. Businesses have been cautious about adding workers, though there have been signs of an increase in hiring in recent months.

HEADLINE: House in Falluja Seems to Have Been Base for Top Jordanian Terrorist

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH and EDWARD WONG; Robert F. Worth reported from near Falluja for this article and Edward Wong from Baghdad. Reporting was contributed by Fakr Haider in Basra; an Iraqi employee of The New York Times in Karbala; and Richard A. Oppel Jr. in Mosul.

DATELINE: NEAR FALLUJA, Iraq, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
American military officials said Thursday that they had discovered a house in the devastated city of Falluja that appeared to have been a headquarters for guerrillas of the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. 
 An American commander also said the weeklong offensive to take the city had ''broken the back of the insurgency.''
 Despite that assessment, gun battles and mortar fire continued to shake the city, and the commander, Lt. Gen. John Sattler of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, said it would be ''some time'' before it was safe enough to allow many of Falluja's 300,000 residents to return. A wave of assaults continued across areas of central and northern Iraq dominated by Sunni Arabs, who controlled the country under Saddam Hussein. 
 The Shiite regions have remained relatively quiet. During the aborted American assault on Falluja last April, fighters loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr launched attacks in southern Iraq and in Baghdad. The Shiites are looking to seize majority rule through elections in January, while hard-line Sunnis keep up the guerrilla war to prevent that. 
 The building that seemed to be a Zarqawi command center was taken by Americans on Sunday after a fierce gun battle with up to 25 well-trained insurgents, said Maj. David Johnson of the First Infantry Division, who accompanied the Army unit that searched the house on Thursday after being alerted by Iraqi soldiers. 
 The Iraqi soldiers had discovered letters they believe were exchanged between Mr. Zarqawi and his lieutenants, the major said, along with computers, materials for car bombs, identification papers (including a Sudanese passport) and medical supplies from the International Red Cross and the United States Agency for International Development. A classroom had a blackboard with drawings of American fighter jets.
 Mr. Zarqawi's network is believed to be responsible for ambushes, bombings and beheadings that have left hundreds dead across Iraq since the summer of 2003, and the recent assault on Falluja was partly intended to destroy the most important base for the insurgency. American commanders say Mr. Zarqawi, who has a $25 million bounty on his head, almost certainly fled the city in the days or weeks leading up the offensive. Marines continued to engage in firefights on Thursday with pockets of insurgents in southern Falluja. A marine and an Iraqi soldier were killed at sunset when they came under fire as they were trying to clear a building.
 So far, at least 51 American servicemen have been killed and 425 wounded in the city since the began on Nov. 8, General Sattler said at a news conference at the Marine headquarters. Eight Iraqi soldiers have been killed and 43 wounded. About 1,200 insurgents appear to have been killed, he said.
 The offensive had crippled the insurgents and ''disrupted them around the country,'' he said. 
 But violence continued across central and northern Iraq. Bombings in Baghdad and two northern cities killed at least eight Iraqis. In Mosul, pushed to the brink of chaos by a revolt last week, rebels attacked a police station and lobbed 10 mortar shells at the provincial government center, wounding at least four of the governor's bodyguards. The Iraqi government was investigating reports that 63 freshly trained police had been abducted at gunpoint as they were driving in from Jordan.
 In Basra, in the south, about 300 Shiite Arabs have banded together into a group called the Anger Brigades to battle extremist Sunni Arabs, Ali al-Mahdi, a spokesman for the group, said in an interview. The founding of the group raised the specter of new sectarian conflict in this deeply divided society. 
 General Sattler's assertions about routing the insurgency appeared optimistic, given the fact that Abdullah Janabi, the leader of Falluja's mujahedeen council, was still operating in the city. A recent Marine intelligence report also warned of the resurrection of the insurgency in the Falluja area should the American military reduce troop levels there, as has been planned.
 Continuing skirmishes will slow the return of Falluja's civilians, many of whom fled before the fighting began. The decision to move people back is to be made by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi after recommendations by American commanders. 
 Almost all of the city has been heavily damaged, and the biggest question is how residents will react to seeing the vast swaths of destruction. Even before the devastation, residents were opposed to any American presence. American commanders say rebuilding efforts will win over the Fallujans, but attempts at reconstruction in other urban battle zones have stumbled badly.
 Falluja is known as the City of Mosques, but the landscape is now dotted by broken minarets, many destroyed by airstrikes. 
 The interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, said at a news conference in Baghdad that families who fled would receive 150,000 dinars, or about $110, with their next monthly food ration. Engineers are evaluating how to restore power, water and sewage systems to the city, where hazards like downed power lines continue to pose a danger. .
 What is thought to be the Zarqawi base was uncovered when Army and Iraqi soldiers returned Thursday to a compound where a fierce battle had unfolded Sunday, said Major Johnson, the Army officer. In the battle, he said, up to 25 insurgents armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades had fought to the death from camouflaged positions.
 ''They fought well, better than the ones we'd seen,'' he said, noting that the fighters had mounted a coordinated defense and fired from deep in the house to hide their muzzle flashes.
 By Thursday, the area had been reduced to a wasteland of rubble, rotting corpses, broken sewer lines and feral dogs. The house was in the southeast corner of a compound measuring about 4,300 square feet with a mosque at the center, Major Johnson said. 
 ''That part of Falluja was the worst I've seen,'' he said. ''There were bodies and body parts everywhere.''
 Videotape from a CNN cameraman who accompanied the American soldiers showed an Arabic sign on a wall with the words ''Al Qaeda Organization.'' Inside, soldiers found vast piles of ammunition, Major Johnson said, including some that appeared to be Chinese and Jordanian, and a room with bomb-making equipment. In Baghdad on Thursday, a suicide car bomb exploded next to an American military convoy, killing at least two Iraqis and wounding five. Later, American and Iraqi soldiers swept through the hostile neighborhood of Haifa Street, arresting more than 100 suspected insurgents, the Interior Ministry said. 
 In Mosul, the streets calmed from the uprising that took place last Thursday, when insurgents stormed a half-dozen police stations. Only 800 of the city's 4,000 policemen stayed on the job then, Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, the regional commander, told reporters on Thursday. At least 60 rebels were killed in clashes over the next 48 hours, and one American soldier and at least four Iraqi National Guardsmen died, he said. 
 [Reuters reported Friday that the Australian prime minister, John Howard, retracted his statement on Thursday that a body found in Falluja appeared to be that of the kidnapped Irish-born aid worker Margaret Hassan, 59.]
 The Iraqi government was trying Thursday to piece together the whereabouts of 63 policemen from Karbala who may have been kidnapped this week as they returned from training in Jordan. 
 One of two trainees who escaped, Laith Saad Nema, said in an interview that the group was abducted at gunpoint from a hotel in Rutba, near the Jordanian border. He said foreign Arabs were among the kidnappers, and one captor said, ''We will send their dead bodies to Allawi.''
 But the police chief of Karbala said in a televised interview that none of his men were missing.
 In Basra, Mr. Mahdi, the spokesman for the Anger Brigades, said the new Shiite militant group was demanding that prominent Sunni clerics here and in Saudi Arabia issue an edict calling on Sunni extremists not to kill Shiites. Otherwise, he said, the Anger Brigades will start hunting down the Sunni fighters, believed to be foreigners.
 In recent weeks groups of Shiites, many of them security officers, have been killed in an area around the insurgent strongholds of Mahmudiya and Latifiya, 20 to 30 miles south of Baghdad.
 ''Why are the Shiites being killed in cold blood?'' Mr. Mahdi asked. ''Some Arab countries want to create a civil war in Iraq. We are forming these brigades to resist those groups coming from outside the country.''

HEADLINE: Racing to Keep Up With the Newest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
NEVER mind that the almost shockingly big Museum of Modern Art, which opens tomorrow, could hardly have been other than an improvement on the previous expansion, 20 years ago, which was a rats' maze of galleries around an escalator. By and large the redone museum, although more than a trifle like the new corporate headquarters of modernism, is a triumph of formal restraint and practical design -- an eloquent reaffirmation, within its galleries, of the enduring beauty of the Modern's historic, albeit tendentious, account of modernism. 
 There are big problems with the museum. But you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., and elaborated on, brilliantly, under William Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe. The story is now retold in an installation, overseen by the curator John Elderfield, that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum I can recall. 
 This re-hang, like the architecture by Yoshio Taniguchi, pays homage to what has always made the Modern the Modern, tweaking, rather than overturning, the past. Yes, the rooms are larger, starker and less human scale; yes, there have been some changes to what's on view, and yes, reactionaries will inevitably carp and declare the end of the world as we know it. But the Modern, after experimenting with alternative, thematic ways to present its classic modernist paintings and sculptures in a series of awful shows four years ago, has largely gone back to its roots, and what results is a gift.
 The new suites of galleries for prints, drawings, photographs and design, I should add, make a virtual museum within the museum. The opening show of prints is a sublime survey of the medium to the present. Drawings are packed like sardines in the galleries, but they are some of the greatest works of early 20th-century art. Photographs skew to the present, racing up to 1960, a little swiftly, with the obvious names and some new ones.
 ''Have you seen it?'' people clearly want to know. Obviously the Modern matters deeply, to the city, to our psyche. It is part of our identity. We have missed it. We're reminded by the reopening, lest we have become too complacent or grouchy, that its core historic collections are indispensable to our shared cultural legacy, representing to the rest of the world not just American wealth and power but also our most progressive dreams. The place, declining to dumb down, speaks to the aspirations of our society to be modern.
 That said, the Modern has become so embedded in the minds of New Yorkers, that it is a virtual Rorschach of conflicting desires. I wrote ''by and large'' earlier because I can't help finding it infinitely sad that the museum, which many New Yorkers, not all of them art buffs, fondly recall from decades ago as an intimate and congenial place to commune with the gods of modern art and to pass an idle hour or two in its garden, our urban Eden, has now become, like so much of the rest of our culture, grandiose. 
 Everything comes at a price these days. At the Modern that price is $20 per ticket, an appalling and cynical figure. Unfortunately, this will set the standard for other museums, with the obvious consequences for a broad public. The comparison is not to for-profit Broadway or Disneyland. A museum is an educational institution. In 1939, admission to the Modern was 25 cents. Adjusted for inflation, that would be around $3.50 today, which I suspect is still shy of the price of a cappuccino in the cafe now crudely plunked directly opposite the entrance to the fifth- floor galleries, guaranteeing that the first sights of the museum's glorious Cezannes and van Goghs will be accompanied by the ching of cash registers.
 Notwithstanding the considerable intelligence and grace that Mr. Taniguchi has brought to the design of the galleries, the main public space is also a chilly box. It's easy to predict the din and to foresee the mobs of people roaming across what the museum is daintily calling the building's ''piano nobile,'' a kind of second-floor lobby below the soaring atrium, adjacent to a bookstore and aspiring to be a kind of town square, where Barnett Newman's ''Broken Obelisk,'' a work perilously close to kitsch, stands before Monet's ''Water Lilies'' and a few other otherwise excellent pictures, now dwarfed in the vastness. 
 You either like atriums or you don't, in the same way that you either do or don't like hotel lobbies and airports. After visiting the museum several times, I have grown gradually more accustomed to this one, without yet feeling the intended spiritual uplift and communal cheer that others seem to. 
 Elsewhere, within its restrictive agenda for a large midblock expansion, the Modern has faced down the sirens of architectural fashion by building a building whose galleries are so clean, calm and self-effacing that they are ruthless. I mean that the rooms, with their walls that seem almost to float, force the art on view to speak for itself, which sets the bar very high. Another way to put it is to say that the architecture, the atrium excepted, hides nothing.
 There are now amazing moments as a result: standing near the corner in the gallery of early Cubism, there's a view that takes in Picasso's ''Bather'' (1909), his standing nude (1906), another Picasso of two nudes (1906), his ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and Boccioni's Futurist sculpture of a dissolving figure a couple of galleries away.
 A suite of Brancusis (a room of Brancusis used to be a kind of dead end in the old museum, a resting point) now marks a crossroads within the fifth-floor galleries, with Miro, Duchamp and Mondrian left, right and center -- it's up to you to choose which direction to take. The installation allows visitors to make connections among familiar artists, and so to see modernism in ways that can recall Barr's famous graph of history, with its spaghetti entanglement of -isms and arrows. 
 Let's hope the new Modern gives other museums pause before they sign up yet another big-name architect to build a building that tussles with art to call attention to itself. Mr. Taniguchi solved the problem of designing an immense museum by trying to make it disappear. Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian and Bonnard, not Mr. Taniguchi, are still the stars here, to Mr. Taniguchi's credit.
 And in rooms designed to suit the formal account of artistic progress and cross-pollination that is the Modern's old mantra, the collection moves seamlessly from the 1880's and Cezanne in one direction off to ''Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' In another direction, it heads toward Expressionism, after which comes a room of Matisses (talk about Eden). That is succeeded by a melange of 1920's art, pairing Matisse and Picasso, with yet more branches into rooms for Constructivism and Dada, Mondrian and Surrealism.
 I could imagine a few more resting spots, places at which to look at a single picture with nothing else in one's field of vision. I remember what it used to be like at the museum, pre-1984, to encounter ''Water Lilies'' as if in its own chapel, or ''Guernica'' looming in a room off the top of the stairs, immense and engulfing.
 What worked then in parlor-size rooms for a modest audience is, alas, impossible in a building designed to accommodate millions of visitors, but people still want, and need, to feel themselves immersed in a painting, to commune with art in peace, in private -- or at least to have the illusions of peace and privacy: they want to lose themselves, psychologically speaking, in the work. 
 The present layout avoids the tiresome progression of rooms in the last expansion that by necessity betrayed both chronology and the messiness of how art really happens. There's now space for new names and some serendipity. Diego Rivera, in his Cubist phase, is mixed in among the Cubists. Van Gogh's portrait of the postman Joseph Roulin (an acquisition made under Mr. Elderfield's predecessor, Varnedoe, to whom the painting's conspicuous placement is an implicit homage) is tucked around the corner from Signac's cheeky portrait of the art critic Felix Feneon, replacing Cezanne's male ''Bather,'' which had become a kind of poster boy, as the opening salvo. The rearrangement lets you look afresh at ''The Bather,'' which now hangs nearby with other Cezannes.
 Less successful is the fourth floor. It picks up the history of painting and sculpture from 1940 to 1970 with American art, rather than, as in the past, with Giacometti and Dubuffet, who now share the next room with a wider range of artists than used to represent the postwar era. The Modern pretty much ran out of space in its permanent galleries shortly after the galleries for Pollock and the Abstract Expressionists. A couple of small rooms sufficed for the 1960's. 
 Now there is space dedicated to Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, to Pop, Minimalism and Post-Minimalism. Artists who had rarely, if ever, been shown are present -- Armando Reveron, Yayoi Kusama, Norman Lewis, Romare Bearden, Howard Hodgkin, Richard Diebenkorn, Lee Bontecou, Alejandro Otero. Reshuffling the deck permits some new, interesting linkages: Bridget Riley with Sol LeWitt; Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark with Robert Smithson and Eva Hesse.
 But there are also drawbacks. The Abstract Expressionist galleries seem somehow less momentous than they used to, less a culmination than a passageway. The closer to the art of the present the installation gets, the more it breaks down. Despite the clever juxtapositions, the sculptor Donald Judd was right years ago when he complained that the Chinese menu style of museum installation clashes with the spirit of the art he and others of his generation made.
 The Modern is clearly still not sure what to make of the art of the last 30 or 40 years -- what its role and mission, as well as its taste and judgment, are in an art world that has changed and expanded. Innumerable institutions not wielding its clout but not freighted with its history have come along and outflanked it.
 As further proof, the new galleries for art since 1970 in Mr. Taniguchi's building are a disappointment: a suite of gigantic double-height rooms on the second floor, physically and conceptually prominent, declaring the Modern's intent to seem current, but also separated from the art of the past on the upper floors. The space feels lofty and utterly sterile, like a bloodless purgatory for work that hasn't yet earned the right to ascend to the pantheon. 
 Divided by decade, the galleries are sparsely scattered with eclectic sculptures, paintings, photographs and drawings that look washed ashore -- the costly remains from a sea of curatorial indecision. Here's a Gordon Matta-Clark, there's a Cindy Sherman, there's a Robert Gober, there's a Matthew Barney, there's a Gerhard Richter, there's a Vito Acconci. Some great stuff and all big names, canceling each other out. 
 The museum will no doubt learn how better to use this space. But 30 years of art will become 40, then 50. How will the museum ever incorporate the recent past into history? Will it just keep expanding? What, in the end, does it stand for?
 Success has raised expectations about the Modern's ability to legislate quality. Almost from the museum's creation, people have complained about the Modern's failure to make sense of the now, to clarify what had seemed, in each moment, a muddle. For the first 40 years of its existence the museum managed well. In the current print and design galleries, you might almost think it still does.
 But the Modern is a congenitally cautious institution. It opened in 1929 with a survey of Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat and van Gogh. By 1929, Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat and van Gogh were long dead; it would be like opening a contemporary museum today with a show about Abstract Expressionism or Pop. During the next decades, a steady flow of landmark exhibitions presented Cubism, Dada and Surrealism years after they had been invented.
 When Barr talked about a modern museum he meant a museum that remained in touch with the present but that also rethought and refined the past in terms of the present. To him, modern meant progressive. He preferred the word modern to ''contemporary'' because contemporary was too inclusive, too voguish. The Modern was slow to embrace Abstract Expressionism. There are no Julian Schnabels or Damien Hirsts now in the collection of paintings and sculpture. 
 It is a cliche to talk about museums today as cathedrals, and of the Modern as the cathedral of modernism, with its evangelical mission to spread the gospel to its visiting pilgrims, its white box galleries conveying a cleansing spirit, the aura of baptismal refreshment. 
 But of course the Modern is not a cathedral. It is the custodian of orthodox modernism, and now also a huge bento box of shops, restaurants, cafes, movie theaters, a garden and other diversions, along with art, to justify as a full day's excursion the egregious ticket price. 
 Moving expansively into the future this way, it still has to figure out the present.

HEADLINE: Declining Oil Prices Help Extend Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks extended their rally yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at its highest point since March, as falling oil prices relieved concerns about the impact of energy costs on corporate profits and consumer spending. 
 The Altria Group, the parent of the cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, helped support the Dow, rising 2 percent after two investment banks upgraded its stock. The upgradings came a day after a federal appeals court panel questioned whether the government had the authority to force cigarette makers to pay billions of dollars as part of its racketeering case against the industry. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 22.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 10,572.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,183.55, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 4.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,104.28, its highest close since January.
 Stocks have been rising since the election, after hitting their low points for 2004 in October.
 ''This is a continuation of the rally we've seen recently,'' said Tom Schrader, managing director of United States equity trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore.
 ''There's money out there to be spent on stocks,'' he added. ''Oil continues to help; energy prices are trending down.''
 The decline in oil prices especially helped industrial stocks like Caterpillar, which rose 56 cents, to $91.44.
 Crude oil for December delivery declined 62 cents, to settle at $46.22 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders booked profits from a rally on Wednesday.
 Economic news was mixed. The index of leading economic indicators fell in October for a fifth consecutive month, according to the Conference Board. Output growth at mid-Atlantic factories eased in November, but still suggested that the manufacturing sector was operating at a healthy clip, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
 Altria, the largest tobacco company, gained $1.28, to close at $58.70, after Goldman Sachs and Prudential upgraded their ratings on the stock. Goldman Sachs also raised its view of tobacco companies to attractive from neutral.
 A rival tobacco company, Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, increased $2.19, or 3 percent, to $77.80.
 But McDonald's dragged on the Dow, falling 45 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $29.95. Shares of other hamburger chains declined, too, after the Agriculture Department said that first-round screening tests had returned ''inconclusive'' results for mad cow disease in one animal.
 Colgate-Palmolive weighed on the S.&P. 500, falling $1.82, or 3.7 percent, to $46.92 after a Banc of America Securities analyst, William Steele, cut his rating on it to neutral from buy.
 Technology shares ended higher. Applied Materials, the world's biggest maker of equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, rose 31 cents, or 1.8 percent, to close at $17.65, a day after warning that an oversupply of chips would hurt sales and profit in the current quarter.
 Shares of Google slipped $4.96, or almost 3 percent, to $167.54 after it warned that it could not sustain its rate of revenue growth in the future.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 5/32, to a price of 101 5/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.11 percent from 4.13 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Bush Confronts New Challenge On Issue of Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
While assembling a new national security team, President Bush is confronting what could become the biggest challenge of his second term: how to contain Iran's nuclear program and what some in the administration believe to be Tehran's support of violence in Israel and insurgents in Iraq. 
 In an eerie repetition of the prelude to the Iraq war, hawks in the administration and Congress are trumpeting ominous disclosures about Iran's nuclear capacities to make the case that Iran is a threat that must be confronted, either by economic sanctions, military action, or ''regime change.'' 
 But Britain, France and Germany are urging diplomacy, placing their hopes in a deal they brokered last week in which Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment program in return for discussions about future economic benefits.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell thrust himself into the debate on Wednesday by commenting to reporters that fresh intelligence showed that Iran was ''actively working'' on a program to enable its missiles to carry nuclear bombs, a development he said ''should be of concern to all parties.'' 
 The disclosures alluded to by Mr. Powell were seen by hard-liners in the administration as another sign of Iranian perfidy, and by Europeans as little new. 
 Although Mr. Powell has praised the negotiations between the Europeans and Iran, one administration official said that his comment suggested that there was ''a steady tightening of outlook between hawks and doves'' that Iran will use the negotiations as a pretext to continue its nuclear program in private. 
 Leading the charge for a tough line on Iran has been John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security. At the moment, administration officials say there are no prominent members of Mr. Bush's inner circle enthusiastic about the European approach of negotiating with Iran; most of the moderates are lower-level areas specialists in the State Department. But only last week Prime Minister Tony Blair persuaded Mr. Bush to endorse the European approach.
 Though Mr. Powell will soon leave Mr. Bush's administration, he is about to face a tough choice on Iran -- whether to have an extensive conversation with the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, or to avoid any contact when the two men attend a conference in Egypt next week.
 ''The simple fact is the secretary doesn't want to meet with Kharrazi,'' said an administration official, adding that that he saw little opportunity for dialogue and that Mr. Powell may have been signaling his pessimism when he made the disclosure about Iran's missile capability.
 The possible Powell-Kharrazi meeting could occur Tuesday at Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, where European, Middle Eastern and other envoys are attending a conference on the future of Iraq. A top aide to Mr. Powell said the secretary would go with talking points to discuss ways to improve Iranian-American relations, but that it was up to the Iranians whether the conversation would take place.
 A European diplomat familiar with the British-French-German initiative said they were also pessimistic that Iran would back off its nuclear ambitions, but that they had no choice but to engage Iran because military options were distasteful or impractical after the troubled invasion and occupation of Iraq.
 ''America clearly understands that Iran will be one of its greatest threats in the second administration,'' this diplomat said. ''But the Europeans understand that even the greatest threats also present a great opportunity to resolve problems.''
 Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former policy and planning director under Secretary Powell, said he favored a major effort to offer incentives to moderate Iran's behavior, combined with threats of tough action if it does not.
 European leaders say they want the United States to join with them in offering economic incentives to Iran, such as working to get Tehran to join the World Trade Organization -- a step that could not occur without active American support. 
 Mr. Haass said it made no sense for the Europeans to offer incentives and for the United States to make threats. Both must be done together, he said.
 The Iranian issue has vexed the Bush administration for so long that plans to produce a major policy paper within the administration simply ground to a halt last year and have not been revived. American contacts with Iran were cut off last May, when Iran was linked to groups that carried out bombings in Saudi Arabia.
 Administration officials said there was fresh evidence that Iran supported insurgents in Iraq and had stepped up its support of the militant organization Hezbollah, which Israel now says is helping to subsidize organizations like Hamas and Islamic Jihad who have carried out suicide bombings there.
 Indeed, an administration official said that Americans believed that Iran was supporting suicide bombers and insurgents in response to the pressure over its nuclear program -- and specifically to warn Israel not to consider the kind of airstrike on a nuclear reactor that it carried out in Iraq more than two decades ago.
 Officially, administration officials say that a military option like the one employed by Israel in 1981 against Iraq, when it bombed a reactor near Baghdad, is unrealistic because the Iranians have buried their most important nuclear facilities and can rebuild anything that is destroyed.
 But an administration official said that a military strike or sabotage was not out of the question -- ''you never take the military option off the table,'' he said -- and that in any case it was ''money in the bank'' for Iran to be concerned about such an option, because it might be goaded into a more conciliatory approach to the United States.
 On the other hand, many in the administration say that Iran is not likely to enter into talks with the United States, as the Europeans want, because the revolutionary clerics who control the government are unalterably opposed to engaging with a country it considers the enemy.
 ''You can't call yourself a revolutionary regime and also negotiate with the Great Satan,'' said an administration official.
 For months the United States's position has been not to threaten war but to force the issue to the United Nations Security Council, where sanctions -- including a ban on oil imports and technology transfers -- could be considered. But the European initiative has brought such talk to a halt.
 But the thinking among many administration officials is that if the European deal to get Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities falls apart in coming months -- if, for example, inspectors are unable to verify compliance -- administration hawks will surely enlist others in a campaign to confront Iran with threats.
 The decision, said European and American diplomats, will be made by Mr. Bush with his new secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who is said by aides to be of two minds about the problem just as Mr. Powell is -- willing to try diplomacy, not sure that it will work and ready to look at other possibilities if it does not. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Friday about the Bush administration's policy choices for Iran misstated the date that American contacts with that country were cut off in response to evidence linking it to groups that had carried out bombings in Saudi Arabia. That occurred in May 2003, not last May.

HEADLINE: Sorenstam Can Finish Masterpiece With a Few More Strokes

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Working on another masterpiece season, Annika Sorenstam hopes to add the final touch this weekend.
 Having already clinched her fourth consecutive L.P.G.A. money title, Sorenstam shot a six-under-par 66 on Thursday to take a one-stroke lead at the season-ending ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. Cristie Kerr was in second place at 67, and Karrie Webb, Jeong Jang and Candie Kung were tied for third at 68.
 Sorenstam has won a season-high seven times this year, including the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship, her seventh career major victory. But she will reflect on her accomplishments after the season. This weekend, she will be focused. 
 ''I'm going to say I feel very comfortable in my position,'' she said. ''I come to a tournament, I'm ready to win.''
 Sorenstam, 34, has continued to be the L.P.G.A.'s dominant player. She has won 37 tournaments since the start of 2000, more than any other man or woman during that period, and 55 over all. When Sorenstam became the first woman in 58 years to play in a PGA Tour event last year at the Bank of America Colonial, it lifted her star profile and brought more attention to the L.P.G.A. 
 Sorenstam has said that she has begun to run out of goals, and if she retires in the near future, the L.P.G.A. will face the challenge of going forward without her. Ty Votaw, the L.P.G.A. commissioner, said he would not try to persuade Sorenstam to prolong her career.
 ''There's very little arm-twisting you do with Annika,'' Votaw said, smiling. ''She's going to make a decision that's right for her, and when she does make that decision, we'll support it. 
 ''We've had a lot of torches passed from generation to generation, and when Annika decides to leave, that will be another torch passed. But I think the game itself will be able to survive pretty well.''
 The Tour highlights this year have not all been about Sorenstam. 
 Grace Park, Meg Mallon and Karen Stupples also won major championships, and Mallon and Kerr each won three times this year. There were 18 different tournament winners, including seven first-time winners, a reflection of the Tour's depth.
 While Sorenstam handled business on the course, Votaw handled issues off the course at his annual state of the Tour address Thursday. He announced next year's schedule, which will feature 31 official events with prize money at a record $43.3 million. 
 There will be two new events in Mexico, as well as the Women's World Cup of Golf in South Africa.
 Over the past few years, the L.P.G.A. has also added tournaments in South Korea and Japan, reflecting the makeup of a tour with worldwide talent. Eight of this year's top 10 money winners were born outside the United States, and 24 countries are represented on the L.P.G.A. Tour. 
 Votaw said he believed that the L.P.G.A.'s diversity would continue to help it attract worldwide sponsors.
 ''The market isn't as homogenous as it was 15 or 20 years ago,'' he said. ''Companies that are outside the United States see our diversity as a plus to market their products.
 ''We've asked ourselves a fundamental question: Are we a world tour that happens to be based in the United States, or are we a U.S.-based tour that happens to play a number of events outside our boundaries? I think we're a world tour that happens to be based in the United States. However, there's no economic marketplace that's larger than the United States, and we'll have the majority of our events in the United States for the foreseeable future.''
 Once again, the L.P.G.A. will have a lengthy off-season, not resuming until the Women's World Cup of Golf in South Africa Feb. 11 to 13. 
 The first full-field event will be the SBS Open at Turtle Bay in Hawaii, Feb. 24 to 26. 
 The L.P.G.A. has taken January off since 2002, and Votaw said that policy had helped attract the top players to more tournaments.
 ''I know many of the top players look forward to the break,'' he said. ''Players below the top 60, if you will, are looking at a three-month break, and they probably are as anxious any as anybody to get back. But I still feel that having a time off in January is the right thing for this organization.''

CHIP SHOTS
 Jeong Jang had a hole in one on No. 5, using a 5-iron from 164 yards. . . . Wendy Doolan withdrew with a rib injury and was replaced by Wendy Ward. . . . Grace Park shot a 71, and the defending champion, Meg Mallon, struggled to a 74.

HEADLINE: With Defaults Down, Banks and Bond Markets Find Nothing to Fear

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
CALL it the ''What, me worry?'' market. The dollar may be quivering and economic recoveries in Europe and Japan may look shaky. But this is a time of confidence for those who lend money to corporations.
 That confidence is shown by an increasing willingness to lend money at low rates to even those with dubious credit. The fear of default seems to have almost vanished. 
 The bond market has been exuding confidence for much of 2004, evidently assured that world growth would keep profits pouring in. But the trend has accelerated this month, as oil prices slipped and investors expect that business conditions will improve with President Bush and the Republicans in firm control in Washington.
 This week, the Federal Reserve released its quarterly survey of bank lending officers and found that banks said they were easing credit terms and getting less for their loans to corporate customers. And when they were asked if they were concerned that conditions might worsen over the next year, few saw this as likely while a larger number thought that things would continue getting better.
 The confidence is also reflected in the stock market. There, the underlying strength is obscured by the fact that some large stocks have not done as well as the overall market. This month's rally has left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 6 percent for 2004, but more than 20 percent below the 2000 peak. 
 Still, most stocks in the index are well above where they were when the market peaked. The S.&P. reflects that by measuring the index in an alternative way -- one that assumes that an investor put an equal amount of money into each stock, rather than buying more shares in larger companies. On that equal-weighted basis, the index is up 11 percent this year -- and is more than 20 percent above the 2000 peak.
 Why the confidence? Economies are generally performing well, and companies are making enough money that they do not need to borrow much. Default rates are down in the United States, and in Europe there have been no defaults on high-yield bonds in 2004. Investors, surprised that long-term interest rates have not risen, have reached for better yields by purchasing more speculative bonds.
 The dollar is weak, and the big story of 2005 may be efforts by Europe and the United States to force China and other Asian nations to allow their currencies to rise. In that atmosphere, one might expect foreigners to shy away from dollar-denominated corporate bonds, fearing that currency losses could more than offset interest income.
 But so far that has not been the case. The Treasury Department reported this week that foreigners bought $45 billion in American corporate bonds in September, by far the largest monthly total ever. In the last 12 months, almost $300 billion in foreign money has gone into such securities, 22 percent more than the year before. The money financing the trade deficit must go somewhere, and foreigners are dubious about American stocks. A lot goes into Treasuries, but their yields are even lower than corporate bonds'.
 Is the lack of worry reasonable, or a sign of dangerous complacency? The margin for error is obviously greater when there is little in the way of extra compensation for taking on risk. At the moment, the yield premium on speculative bonds -- whether denominated in dollars, pounds sterling or euros -- is a third or less of what it was just two years ago, according to Lehman Brothers data. 
 ''We are reaching levels that are clearly unsustainable,'' said Guillaume Menuet, an economist at Moody's in London, speaking of the small yield premiums. ''The question is how fast they will go up.''
 It may be that within a year or two it will appear that the biggest risk that investors took was the decision to act as if there were no risks.

HEADLINE: Congressional Leaders Work On Compatible Spending Bill

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Working behind closed doors, House and Senate leaders struggled Thursday to resolve differences on a $388 billion spending bill that would squeeze dozens of domestic programs and favor a few.
 Under pressure to show progress in reducing the budget deficit, White House officials threatened that President Bush would veto any measure that exceeded the spending limits set earlier this year. But they also warned lawmakers not to shortchange some of Mr. Bush's priorities, like his plan for preliminary work on a mission to Mars. 
 ''The president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto any bill that exceeds the agreed-upon spending limits'' or that uses ''unacceptable budgetary devices'' to disguise the true level of spending, wrote Joshua B. Bolten, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.
 The much-delayed bill lumps together nine individual spending bills that Congress failed to pass during its regular session, mainly because of bruising tug-of-wars in a year when discretionary spending outside of defense and domestic security has essentially been frozen. 
 Mr. Bush has yet to veto a single spending bill, and federal spending has soared since he took office, but the administration is under increasingly intense pressure to show a tougher hand on spending cuts.
 House Republican aides said that they had narrowed most of their major differences with the White House and that the remaining battles were mostly about individual programs rather than overall spending levels. 
 The total spending package at issue now is still about $4 billion higher than White House officials wanted. Lawmakers would pay for that by imposing an across-the-board budget cut of three-quarters of a percent on the agencies being financed.
 As negotiators worked into the evening on Thursday, they continued to wrestle over spending on President Bush's Millennium Challenge program, which provides grants to impoverished nations, as well as over financing for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. But they did add in energy programs, including $800 million for the nuclear waste disposal site planned for Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
 Lawmakers also stripped out a provision, passed by the Senate and House, that would have blocked the Labor Department from enforcing new rules on overtime pay. Labor unions and many other groups complained that the new rules deny overtime pay for millions of workers, especially in white-collar jobs, but the administration insisted the old rules were outdated and fostered litigation.
 Over all, the bills would increase domestic discretionary spending, not including military and domestic security, about 2 percent this year. After adjusting for inflation, that would translate to a freeze on spending with cuts in many areas.
 With money tight, Congressional Republican leaders have been in a tug-of-war with the Bush administration over which programs would get any increases at all. 
 President Bush had sought $16.2 billion for NASA, but House and Senate lawmakers originally wanted to provide about $1 billion less. By Thursday, aides on the House Appropriations Committee said the bill would provide about $15.9 billion.
 The House voted 208 to 204 late Thursday night to increase the federal debt ceiling by $800 billion, enough to allow the federal government to keep borrowing for about another year at its current pace.
 Coming one day after the Senate passed an identical measure, the vote will prevent the federal government from running out of cash and allow it to proceed with its next scheduled sale of Treasury securities on Monday.

HEADLINE: Fuel of the Future? Some Say Coal

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: GERLACH, Nev. 

 BODY:
John and Rachel Bogard are used to living off the grid in this desert hamlet, generating their own electricity with solar panels. They have been doing so for nearly 30 years.
 But now the grid is rushing toward them, in the form of an electrical source even more futuristic than solar power. It is coal. 
 Sure, coal sounds dirty and dated, the kind of energy source that went out of fashion with big Buicks and bell-bottom jeans. But a coal project here in northern Nevada is one of more than 100 coal-fueled plants that are vying for approval around the country -- the largest increase in such projects since the 1970's. 
 The reason for coal's resurgence is an intensifying fear in the United States that supplies will become scarce in electricity's other main fuel source, natural gas. And coal is a lot cheaper. 
 Altogether, energy companies in the United States have announced plans to build more coal-fired power plants in the last 12 months than they did in the last 12 years. If all those projects get off the ground, utilities would invest more than $100 billion.
 The electricity industry's back-to-the-future approach to coal is soon expected to pit dozens of communities around the country against energy companies that are planning coal-based expansion strategies in their midst. 
 The Bush administration has significantly shifted policy away from three decades of federal efforts to reduce the nation's dependence on coal, which is significantly cleaner than it once was, but still dirtier than natural gas.
 Now the administration is supporting the push for a new wave of coal-fueled energy, with the Energy Department investing $2 billion in ventures intended to make coal less polluting. 
 But until coal-fired plants become even cleaner, clashes over their impact on air quality are expected to multiply. Because of restrictions elsewhere, many coal-fired power plants will be put in places with pristine air quality and relatively relaxed pollution restrictions.
 Gerlach's location near Nevada's border with California, an energy-hungry state where environmental standards make it nearly impossible to build coal-fired plants, is one attraction for the builder, Sempra Energy. Gerlach, which has fewer than 200 residents, is at the crossroads of rail lines that can haul coal from Montana strip mines and an electricity transmission line that can send the power southward to Los Angeles and San Diego.
 Gerlach has a ''combination of ideal factors,'' said Marty Swartz, a director for project development at Sempra. As for Gerlach itself, he said, the project would generate about $30 million in tax revenue for Washoe County, which encompasses this tiny hamlet as well as Reno, a two-hour drive south.
 Prospects of new wealth for the town have done little to calm people's nerves here.
 ''If it's such a great deal, then let them build the thing in California,'' Mr. Bogard, 56, the owner of a pottery business, said. ''I'm not sure if anyone involved with this realizes what a nightmare it is to have a plant spewing coal fumes go up in their backyard. This would simply destroy our life out here.'' 
 The tensions arising from Sempra's plan -- known as the Granite Fox Power project -- and from similar plans for other coal-fueled plants are an inevitable outcome of energy policies pursued in the 1990's. During that period, nearly every new electricity plant was built to be run on natural gas, which is cleaner-burning and was generally thought at the time to be in ample supply in North America.
 But in the last five years, natural gas prices have skyrocketed as imports from Canada slowed and domestic production failed to keep up with demand. Prices have shot up to more than $6 for each thousand cubic feet from just $2 in 1999.
 Coal, meanwhile, has remained relatively cheap, and the United States has the world's largest reserves. As a result, while it costs more to build a coal-fired plant than it does to build one to use natural gas, the running cost of a gas plant has soared in comparison with coal. A typical coal-fired power plant spends 2 cents per kilowatt-hour to fuel its operations, compared with 5 cents per kilowatt-hour for a plant fueled by natural gas. 
 In the partly deregulated power-generating business, much of that electricity can be sold at prices reflecting the cost of the most expensive source. ''Running a coal-fired plant in these times is a gold mine,'' said Robert McIlvaine, a coal industry consultant in Northfield, Ill., who does research on new power plants around the country.
 So far, Mr. McIlvaine has tracked announcements to build 118 coal-fired plants, including 4 others in Nevada besides Sempra's Granite Fox project. The Granite Fox plant alone is expected to supply 1,450 megawatts of generating capacity, making it one of the nation's largest; it would generate enough electricity to meet the needs of a city the size of San Francisco.
 Sempra, in San Diego, has adopted a two-pronged approach to dealing with high natural gas prices. It has pursued ambitious projects to bring natural gas from Indonesia and other nations to Baja California, Mexico, and Lake Charles, La., placing the company at the forefront of efforts to expand imports of natural gas. 
 The other Sempra prong is coal, which has attracted less attention. In the last year, Sempra, together with an investment fund connected to the Carlyle Group, spent more than $400 million to acquire a large amount of coal-fired energy generating capacity in South Texas. 
 Sempra is also trying to build a 750-megawatt coal-fired plant in Idaho. But its most ambitious move into coal is here in Gerlach, where Sempra wants to invest more than $1 billion over the next five years, creating roughly 800 local construction jobs.
 Despite the expected economic lift, people in Gerlach are divided over the coal-fired plant.
 Giovanni Bruno Selmi, an Italian immigrant who arrived here in 1946, said he supported the project, especially if it would provide tax revenue. 
 ''Money talks here, like it does everywhere in the world,'' said Mr. Selmi, 81, the owner of Bruno's Country Club, which houses one of Gerlach's three bars along with a diner and a small hotel. 
 Still, like Mr. Bogard, some of the people who came to Gerlach to distance themselves from the bright lights of the city are concerned over the potential environmental impact of a coal-fired plant. And they worry that a large industrial complex would ruin the aesthetics of a quiet natural swath of northern Nevada's playa, or desert flats. 
 Executives at Sempra said they planned to begin holding meetings in Gerlach early next year to discuss the benefits of the plant once a preliminary series of environmental and weather tests was completed. 
 Mr. Swartz, the Sempra executive in charge of the project, said county commission officials appear to favor it now that they have been reassured that coal-burning methods today are far cleaner than those at plants built a generation ago. Construction could begin as early as next year if Sempra wins county approval, he said. 
 But it will not be without a fight. Environmentalists, working with some local residents, have begun marshaling opposition.
 ''No matter how clean the technology for coal-fired plants, they still contribute to pollution by dumping tons of material in the air basins and beyond,'' Susan Lynn, executive director of Public Resource Associates, a nonprofit organization that works on land policy issues, wrote in a recent letter to Nevada's public utilities commission. 
 Ms. Lynn also said that Sempra's project would block opportunities for renewable energy companies in the area. Sempra, however, insists that its project would allow wind and biothermal energy companies to piggyback access on the transmission line extending to southern California. 
 Sempra recognizes that it needs to move quickly if it hopes to win approval for Granite Fox. Prices for coal, particularly coal from the eastern United States, have climbed this year in part because of robust demand for fuel in China.
 While coal is being promoted as a secure domestic alternative to natural gas, there will be dozens of different coal and natural gas complexes competing for banks' attention, and the first projects will have a better chance of winning financing, said Will Bailey, a director in the North America power group at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm.
 ''It wasn't too long ago that coal was thought to be too low-tech for our cutting-edge economy,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''Now that we're waking up to the fact that coal will be with us for a long time to come, it's shaking things up.''

HEADLINE: Journal Columnist and Editor Is Set to Join Bloomberg News

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Albert R. Hunt, a columnist and former Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal who has spent nearly four decades working at the paper, is decamping for Bloomberg News.
 Mr. Hunt, 61, will join Bloomberg's Washington bureau in January as managing editor for government reporting, the company announced yesterday in a memorandum to its staff. In an interview, Mr. Hunt said that his new job was loosely defined, but that his mandate was to give the 14-year-old financial news service's Washington coverage ''more of a high profile and visibility.'' 
 ''I don't want to be presumptuous,'' Mr. Hunt added. ''I'm going in cold. I'm not going in to fix something, because there is nothing to fix.''
 Mr. Hunt said that he was initially approached about joining Bloomberg News by its editor in chief, Matt Winkler, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in July. ''My first thought was, 'This is crazy, but let's not rule it out,''' Mr. Hunt said. 
 In the end, Mr. Hunt said he realized that while he was not tired of writing his column, he did miss playing a role directing news coverage.
 He also said he became intrigued by the prospect of joining a relatively unconventional news organization, which reaches consumers primarily through its 200,000 financial news terminals and the more than 300 newspapers that subscribe to its wire service, as well as its 24-hour financial news channel. There are currently no plans for him to write a regular column.
 Mr. Hunt, whose weekly column is much less conservative than those of the paper's regular op-ed page columnists, said his departure was of his own volition. 
 He said he had been assured by the paper's senior executives -- including Peter R. Kann, chairman and chief executive of its parent company, Dow Jones -- that he could continue his column for at least another three years. He said he was also told he could continue to serve as president of Dow Jones's charitable foundation for aspiring journalists, as a member of the board of its regional newspaper group. In departing The Journal, Mr. Hunt is leaving the only professional home he has ever had. He joined the paper, as a reporter in June 1965, two weeks after graduating from Wake Forest. By the late 1960's, he had been reassigned to the paper's Washington bureau, where he would spend the balance of his career, including a 10-year stint as bureau chief that ended in September 1993. 
 At Bloomberg, Mr. Hunt will be reunited with several former Journal colleagues, including Mr. Winkler, a former Journal reporter, and Rich Jaroslovsky, a protege of Mr. Hunt's who spent nearly three decades at the paper. Yesterday, Bloomberg News said that Mr. Jaroslovsky, who joined the news service this year as an editor at large, would now serve as managing editor for government and economy in the Americas.

HEADLINE: Germans Weigh Taking Stocks Off Wall Street

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Add another entry to the list of how Americans and Europeans are parting ways. Several German companies, which rushed to have their shares traded on exchanges in the United States during the bull market of the late 1990's, are now seriously thinking about abandoning the market.
 The Germans are disenchanted by the United States as a source of capital, and offended by what they view as oppressive new regulations adopted in the aftermath of Enron and other corporate scandals.
 With trading volumes in New York that are, in most cases, a small fraction of their turnover in Europe, the companies are less willing to bear the legal costs, liability and the bureaucracy of complying with the rules.
 ''They feel they can raise money just as cheaply outside the U.S.,'' said Alastair Ross Goobey, the chairman of the International Corporate Governance Network. ''Why would you expose yourself to much greater regulation, and much more personal risk when you don't have to?'' 
 Until now, the public discontent has been limited to little-known companies like Lion Bioscience and SGL Carbon. But last week, German newspapers reported that Siemens was mulling whether to delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange, where it has traded since 2001.
 Siemens refused to confirm or deny the report. But the mere suggestion that a company with global reach, with a household name and 70,000 employees in the United States, would take such a step has ratcheted up the debate.
 The trouble, the Germans have discovered, is that getting out of the United States is much harder than getting in. The Securities and Exchange Commission imposes strict rules before it will deregister any publicly listed company, thus freeing it from disclosure requirements.
 German executives contend that the United States should ease the rules for foreign companies, since European regulators make it comparatively easy for Americans to withdraw from their markets. Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, pressed that case in a recent meeting with John Thain, the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange.
 ''It's what you call a one-way ticket,'' said Ralf Fischer zu Cramburg, a lobbyist with the German Equity Institute, which represents listed companies. ''We just want to have a level playing field.''
 French and British companies are also unhappy about the new rules, and a group of European trade and industry groups has suggested, among other things, that the S.E.C. allow a company to be deregistered if less than 5 percent of its overall trading volume is in the United States.
 Of the 17 German companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, only 3 generate more than 5 percent of their total volume in New York. And only one, SAP, the business software giant, generates a substantial percentage of its volume -- 22.5 percent -- in the United States.
 One reason for these thin volumes is that American investors, particularly institutional ones, find it relatively easy to buy shares of European companies in Frankfurt, London or Paris. The liquidity of Europe's major capital markets has increased substantially since the 1980's.
 There is also a less-flattering explanation. German companies have lost much of their sheen among investors, as the German economy has limped through a recession and a barely perceptible recovery.
 Carmakers like Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler have reported dismal sales; financial institutions like Deutsche Bank and Allianz have faced a near-crisis in German banking; and the pharmaceutical giant, Bayer, is digging out from a pile of lawsuits over an anti-cholesterol drug.
 The DAX 30-stock index, which tracks Germany's biggest public companies, has only recently made up the ground it had lost since 2002. American markets have struggled as well, of course, and some analysts say that is the real reason German companies are talking about leaving.
 ''They got into the market with the euphoria of the late 1990's, thinking 'we want to go to America, we want the liquidity, we want the prestige,''' said Sina Hekmat, a partner at the Frankfurt office of Jones Day who advises German companies on United States securities laws.
 ''The benefit, both in terms of tangible and intangible benefits, didn't materialize,'' Mr. Hekmat said. ''And this was compounded by the year-in-year-out cost and effort of staying in the U.S. market.''
 The tipping point, he said, was new regulations mandated by the post-Enron Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which is generating heavy legal costs and has made executives more accountable for the accuracy of financial statements.
 German executives took umbrage at the requirement that the chief executive and chief financial officer sign off on financial reports. They argue that this is at odds with the structure of German corporations, which have management committees that, publicly at least, function as a collective.
 Porsche, the maker of sports cars, cited this requirement as one reason it opted not to seek a listing on the Big Board. Porsche does not even file quarterly reports -- a practice that has brought it to blows with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
 The chemical giant BASF, which has traded in New York since 2000, is also unhappy about the rules. Its chairman, Jurgen Hambrecht, described them in a news conference this week as ''bureaucratic overkill,'' though he added that BASF would hold on to its listing.
 In reality, German governance and securities laws are gradually coming more in line with those in the United States. Volkswagen, one of the country's most conservative companies, said this week that it would disclose the salaries of its top executives. Still, no Volkswagen chief executive would face the legal risks of a comparable chief executive in the United States.
 Lion Bioscience, a biotechnology company based in Heidelberg, said it spends 1.5 million euros ($1.95 million) a year on legal and other fees related to its S.E.C. registration. Its total annual expenses are roughly $20 million, according to a spokesman, Gunter Dielmann.
 Last month, Lion's entire top management walked out because the company declined to extend the liability insurance on top managers. Lion, which has had severe financial problems, announced this week that it would voluntarily stop having its American depository receipts traded on Nasdaq after Dec. 22.
 That step is relatively simple. The bigger trick will be to deregister. Under S.E.C. rules, the company can do so only if it proves it has fewer than 300 shareholders living in the United States. Mr. Dielmann said he hoped most American investors would sell their shares after they stopped trading in the United States, bringing their number below 300.
 ''As a small company, we can do it,'' he said. ''For a big company like Siemens, the rules may make it impossible.''
 Losing Lion will hardly dent Nasdaq. But losing a name like Siemens would hurt the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange confirms that fewer European companies have sought listings since the new rules. A spokesman said a few Europeans had begun trickling back, though the real growth is from emerging economies like Brazil, China, India and Russia.
 Lobbyists here are also hoping that the S.E.C. may agree to a modest relaxation of the rules, perhaps using the percentage of American shareholders, rather than the absolute number, as a threshold for de-registration. A commission spokesman said only that ''we continue to give the issue serious consideration.''
 As the Germans step up their lobbying, there are mixed feelings about the rumors surrounding Siemens. ''It could cut both ways,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''It could show the Americans that it's a big problem. Or it could suggest that if they make it easier to leave, more companies will do it.''

HEADLINE: Temperatures Dip in Europe, Sending Price of Oil Up 4.8%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The price of crude oil surged 4.8 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest rise in more than five months, on concern that cold weather in Europe will draw heating oil from the United States. 
 Temperatures in Germany, the largest market for heating oil in Europe, are expected to stay below normal this weekend. And United States supplies of heating oil, at 49.1 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 12, were 12 percent lower than the comparable week last year, according to Energy Department figures. Oil also fell because the dollar plunged against the yen and euro. 
 ''There's a scramble for product right now in Europe, and demand is coming out of Germany,'' said Ed Silliere, vice president for risk management at Energy Merchant in New York, which markets wholesale gasoline and heating oil. ''Germany is behind on inventories.'' 
 Crude oil for December delivery rose $2.22, to close at $48.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest jump since June 1, when the market reacted to a weekend attack that killed 22 people in an oil-producing region of Saudi Arabia. Prices are up 2.4 percent this week. Futures are up 49 percent in the last year.
 Heating oil for December delivery rose 5.26 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $1.4826 a gallon in New York. Prices gained 8.7 percent this week. Gasoline rose 7.26 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $1.3109 a gallon, the highest close since Nov. 3. 
 The profit from making a barrel of crude oil into heating oil gained 39 percent, to $13.829 a barrel this week, based on futures prices. 
 ''The profit from making crude into heating oil is pretty close to an all-time high,'' said Jason Schenker, an economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte. ''We have to keep an eye on the weather because it will push up the profit margins for refiners making heating oil. Crude oil will chase the heating oil price.''

HEADLINE: Thousands Demonstrate Against Bush in Santiago

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Using tear gas and water cannons, riot police officers dispersed hundreds of rock-throwing protesters on Friday after thousands of people had gathered peacefully to demonstrate against the presence of President Bush at a weekend summit meeting here. 
 Mr. Bush, in his first trip abroad since his re-election, is one of 21 world leaders scheduled to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, being held here for the first time. The group, known as APEC, aims to encourage economic growth and trade among member nations, who account for more than half of the world's economy. The Chilean government has trumpeted the decision to hold the meeting here as an indication that this country of 15 million has achieved elite status. 
 Protest organizers said 30,000 people took part in the late morning march, which followed a convoluted route through downtown streets, far from the actual site of the conference in a remote convention center surrounded by a mountain range. The police refused to offer an estimate, and local radio stations put the number of marchers at about 15,000.
 The protesters, a combination of graying veterans of the Allende era, mixed with younger environmental advocates, Indian groups, punks, goths and anarchists, said APEC fostered economic inequality, and they criticized Mr. Bush for the war in Iraq. They carried placards and banners portraying Mr. Bush as a vampire, carrion-eating vulture, demon and ghost, as well as Cuban flags and a large Iraqi flag with the exhortation, ''Hang on, Falluja!''
 ''We want Bush to know that he is not welcome here,'' said Monica Ceron, a college student who was wearing a ''Bush Stinks'' T-shirt and a red headband that with the words ''Down with Bush'' and a hammer and sickle. ''Our government may want to do business with him, but the Chilean people oppose his genocidal war on Iraq and his designs on Latin America.''
 Citing the same international accords that made possible the detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Britain in 1998, opposition groups here even filed a complaint to have Mr. Bush held as a war criminal. A judge dismissed the complaint early this month, however, arguing lack of jurisdiction.
 A few older demonstrators also complained of American support for the military coup that overthrew Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered an indirect apology for that policy last year, saying it was ''not a part of American history we are proud of.'' But marchers like 58-year-old Tomas Soto described the episode as ''an example of the kind of state terrorism that the United States always claims to be against.''
 Friday's march, organized by the Chilean Social Forum and nearly 100 other groups opposed to corporate-led globalization, was the only legal means of mass protest the government was willing to authorize during the conference. But some other left-wing and anarchist groups have defied that ban and led smaller street protests of their own all week, resulting in rock-throwing confrontations with the police and several hundred arrests.
 Security precautions have been extraordinary by Chilean standards, with an estimated 4,000 police officers in the streets or around leading hotels, helicopters in the air, streets blocked off and armored cars in reserve. The government declared a holiday here in the capital on Friday to encourage people to stay off the streets, but that only seemed to encourage university students to join the protests.
 In a flier distributed to schools and government offices, the national police warned that ''Chile may be at the end of the world, but for international terrorism, nothing is far enough away.'' The text made little distinction between antiglobalization and terrorist groups and urged citizens to report any ''suspicious attitudes'' or ''the places of anti-APEC meetings'' to authorities.
 Sara Larrain, one of the organizers of the protest, called the police flier ''an effort to intimidate and spread fear.''
 ''We're not bomb throwers,'' she said. ''We want to confront APEC, but only in the realm of ideas and paradigms.''

HEADLINE: In Time of Turmoil, Graham Offers Soothing Words

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Nov. 18 

 BODY:
It was 55 years ago when the publishing titan William Randolph Hearst caught wind of a young preacher drawing thousands to his tent revival in the streets of Los Angeles.
 ''Puff Graham'' came the directive from Mr. Hearst to his editors.
 The Rev. Billy Graham, a Presbyterian from North Carolina, would go on to become the foremost evangelical personality of the 20th century, counselor to United States presidents and a man who stayed free from both politics and scandal that plagued so many television preachers who followed him. 
 Dr. Graham returned to Southern California this week an old man, shuffling along on a walker, having suffered a broken hip and a leg in the last year. He spoke for 30 minutes on Thursday evening at the 92,000-seat Rose Bowl, the beginning of a four-day crusade here that organizers say is his 416th worldwide and his next-to-last. Dr. Graham's final evangelical crusade, health permitting, is scheduled for June in New York City.
 The autumn evening was cold and the stadium only half-full. Mr. Graham, 86, arrived in a golf cart and was lifted onto the stage by an elevator. He appeared frail, dressed in a dark topcoat, his voice a croaking tenor.
 ''Do you feel your life has been a failure? Do you wonder which way to turn? The choice you make tonight will affect your whole life.'' He warned his acolytes to guard themselves against self-righteousness.
 ''We go to church. We pray. We're good people. We're moral people,'' Dr. Graham said. ''But He looks at us through His own righteousness and He sees the defects in all of us. Sin.''
 Dr. Graham's testimony was free of incendiary topics of the day like gay marriage, Islamic fundamentalism or the presidential election. He told The Los Angeles Times this week that though he phoned President Bush to congratulate him on his victory, he has not told anyone who he voted for.
 On Iraq, he made only a fleeting reference: ''You look at Iraq, you'll be amazed to find out that more of the Bible was in Iraq than in what we call the Holy Land today. It's a Bible country as far as history is concerned and the Garden of Eden is there and Adam and Eve were there.''
 But much of his message seemed focused on personal responsibility. ''You kill and covet but you cannot get what you want. You quarrel and fight, you do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives. That you spend what you get on your own flesh.'' 
 ''Sin has affected our minds.''
 The timing of Mr. Graham's crusade is impeccable, with the nation wrestling with the notion of moral values and the influence of evangelism and Christianity in the wake of the victory of Mr. Bush, who credits the counsel of Dr. Graham as leading him toward Christ.
 People at the crusade said they were pleased that the idea of moral values had bubbled into the national debate, but they also said it was a mistake to think that Mr. Bush enjoyed their support simply because he is an anti-abortion Christian. Their concerns, they say, are like other Americans' and range from the economy to Iraq to self-sufficiency to sizing up a man who they believe means what he says.
 ''For me personally, it wasn't all moral values,'' said Graham Stanley, 44, a landscape architect from Seal Beach, Calif. ''I'm a businessman and I'm tired of paying high taxes. You're supposed to work for your money. The Bible says if a man doesn't work, he shouldn't eat. But it also says to care for the widows and orphans. Sometimes Democrats have better values.''
 Still, the state of the American culture is alarming, many of the faithful said. The litany included the explosion of pornography and gambling, half-naked starlets on television, the dissolution of the traditional family, drugs, violence.
 It is not so much that conservative Christians want to push their moral values on others, they said, as it is that they feel others are pushing their values upon them. The debate, to them, is whose values will be the voice in the public square.
 ''I don't want to dictate my morals on people,'' said Shifra Wylder, 42, a painter from Malibu who converted to Christianity from Judaism after hearing Mr. Graham preach on television.
 ''It just seems that others are trying to dictate their morals on us,'' she said. ''Gay marriage. Taking prayer out of the schools. Taking God out of the pledge of allegiance. These are not the values that the country was founded on. They are not my values.''
 Mrs. Wylder said the debate over values could have as easily been framed as social or cultural values. For instance, she said that though she is anti-abortion, she is capable of voting for a pro-abortion candidate, as she did with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 ''Ultimately, I decide who is the best man for the job based on a lot of things,'' she said. ''It's not a single issue for me.''
 California has changed much since Mr. Graham first came here in 1949. What was then a booming city of World War II veterans and English speakers and orange groves, has evolved into a city of office workers, strip malls and immigrants.
 Nevertheless, the Golden State is not as liberal as its reputation. Mr. Bush won 45 percent of the vote here and four years ago California voters banned same-sex marriage by a vote of 61 to 39 percent.
 The crusade was organized by 1,400 churches of 100 denominations and the sermons translated into 26 languages, such as Vietnamese and Roumanian.
 Ray Castro, 43, came from East Los Angeles on his motorcycle to pay homage to a man he has never heard speak. ''My pastor called this man a general in God's army,'' he said. ''You hear of men of God who fall short. Billy Graham has integrity. We may not have an opportunity to see him again.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees No Rise Soon For the Dollar

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan came to the home of the euro on Friday and suggested that the relentless decline of the dollar might well continue, offering little relief to those here who worry that the United States is seeking to gain a competitive advantage for its industries from a weaker currency. 
 In a speech to a banking congress here, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that ballooning foreign borrowing on the part of the United States poses a future risk to the dollar's value.
 He said that foreign investors, who help finance the large American trade and budget deficits by buying Treasury securities and other dollar-denominated assets, would eventually resist lending more money to the United States, causing the dollar to fall further.
 Mr. Greenspan's comments came two days after the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, appeared to rule out intervening in currency markets to help Europe and Japan -- both heavily dependent on exports to sustain economic growth -- stem the decline of the dollar. Mr. Snow, speaking in London, prodded European leaders to tackle their home-grown economic problems. 
 Taken together, the two speeches appear to be sending an unmistakable message that Washington, on the heels of President Bush's election to a second term, is prepared to tolerate a weaker dollar for the foreseeable future.
 A falling dollar makes it more expensive for Americans to travel abroad and risks reviving inflation and sending interest rates higher in the United States. But for American manufacturers, who have been shedding jobs for years, it provides a powerful shot of adrenaline by making their exports cost less abroad and adding to pressure on foreign industries to raise the price of imported goods in the United States. 
 Given the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, Mr. Greenspan likened predicting the dollar's path to ''forecasting the outcome of a coin toss.''
 While Mr. Greenspan, as he often does, relied on carefully chosen phrases open to various interpretations, the message seemed clear here to European bankers, who laughed nervously at the metaphor: The dollar, which has fallen to record lows against the euro this week -- giving fits to European politicians and business executives -- is likely to fall even further. 
 To analysts, the speech had a laissez-faire tone, leaving events in the hands of the market and giving speculators free rein to bet against the American currency without worrying that officials would get together to slap them down.
 On Friday, in New York, the stock market reacted by falling sharply. At the close of trading, the Dow industrial average was down more than 115 points, to 10,456,91, a decline of more than 1 percent. 
 Currency traders drove the dollar to its lowest level in four and a half years against the Japanese yen, and near its record low against the euro. Treasury notes fell the most in two weeks.
 The hints from Washington policy makers that they have no intention of supporting the dollar could add to the strains between the United States and Europe, which is increasingly worried that the rise of the euro is choking off its tenuous recovery. In France and Germany, growth in the third quarter dropped to 0.1 percent, as exports dried up.
 European leaders are already raising distress flags. Germany's minister for economics, Wolfgang Clement, urged Asia, Europe and the United States to take coordinated action to stop the slide. The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet -- who is Mr. Greenspan's counterpart here -- has called the shifts in exchange rates ''brutal.''
 Mr. Trichet, who traveled a few blocks from the headquarters of the European Central Bank to appear on the same panel as Mr. Greenspan, pointedly declined to repeat that characterization.
 Both central bankers later flew to Berlin for a meeting of the G-20, which includes the Group of 8 industrialized countries, as well as emerging economies. The downward path of the dollar is likely to be high on the agenda, but there is little hope for a concerted response.
 Analysts said Mr. Greenspan's speech made it clear that the Federal Reserve would make no effort to influence the process of narrowing the United States' current account deficit, either through interest rate increases aimed at deliberately supporting the dollar or by intervening in the market.
 The current account deficit, which encompasses annual trade as well as the balance of financial flows, has gone from zero in 1990 to nearly $600 billion this year. The nation's accumulated debt to foreign investors is $2.6 trillion, equivalent to 23 percent of the annual output of the economy.
 ''It was an either-or message,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''Either the current account deficit comes down. Or the market will do it, but at a cost to the dollar. Will the Fed play a role in this? Probably not. It will stick to its mandate.''
 Speaking on a panel that included the deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazumasa Iwata, Mr. Greenspan devoted most of his remarks to the effect that American fiscal policy has on global markets.
 ''Current account imbalances, per se, need not be a problem,'' he said in a characteristically technical speech, ''but cumulative deficits, which result in a marked decline of a country's net international position -- as is occurring in the United States -- raise more complicated issues.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan said foreign investors, in part because they fear having too much money at risk in the United States, would eventually become reluctant to take on more such assets.
 ''It seems persuasive that given the size of the U.S. current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''But when, through what channels, and from what level of the dollar? Regrettably, no answer to those questions is convincing.''
 This is not the first time Mr. Greenspan has warned about the risks of a rapidly widening current-account deficit. In testimony before Congress last February, he said ''foreign investors, both private and official, may become less willing to absorb ever growing claims on U.S. residents.''
 As he did last winter, Mr. Greenspan said on Friday that his preferred remedy would be for the Bush administration to bring down the current account deficit by taking steps to shrink the federal budget deficit. That would make more domestic savings available in the United States, reducing the dependence on foreign borrowing.
 But analysts did not interpret Mr. Greenspan's remarks as a rebuke of the White House -- which has indicated that it will seek to make the deep tax cuts of its first term permanent -- but rather an effort to let the markets find their course.
 That will be cold comfort to many Europeans, who say that their currency is absorbing the bulk of the pressure from the declining dollar, since Japan and other Asian countries have intervened aggressively in the market to prevent their currencies from rising significantly against the dollar.
 Mr. Greenspan took issue with that suggestion, saying that based on his review of recent statistics, Asia's ''very large'' central bank interventions had had only a ''moderate'' effect on exchange rates.
 For his part, Mr. Trichet seemed determined not to breathe another word about the dangers of a rising euro. Describing his previous comments on the subject as ''poetry,'' he turned aside questions about the exchange rate.
 Mr. Mayer of Deutsche Bank said Mr. Trichet's silence suggested that his earlier efforts to talk down the currency had fallen short.
 ''They are basically seeing that there is very little they can do about it,'' Mr. Mayer he said. ''They are not in a position to change interest rate policy to address it.''

HEADLINE: Congress Votes to Ban States From Taxing Internet Service

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Congress passed a measure Friday putting a three-year ban on state and local governments' taxation of the monthly fees that Internet providers charge their customers. President Bush is expected to sign the measure into law. 
 The ban on taxes by Internet providers was first enacted in 1998. It expired one year ago amid dire predictions that tax-happy states could choke the growth of the Internet. 
 The House voted last year to make the moratorium permanent, to ensure that it applied to high-speed broadband service and to phase out existing state taxes. 
 But the Senate let the ban lapse after some lawmakers said it would require states to raise taxes in other areas to make up for the millions of dollars they would lose as telephone and other services migrate to the Internet. 
 The measure would allow states to tax online phone service, but the Federal Communications Commission recently ruled that only the federal government had that authority. 
 The Senate passed a compromise bill in April that would reimpose the ban until November 2007, a measure resisted by House Republicans until the final days of the session. 
 ''Without any action by this Congress, the Internet economy and its participants are more vulnerable, even if we must act on a weaker bill,'' said Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who won a concession requiring his state to phase out its existing access tax in two years. 
 In the Senate, Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he was going to tell his constituents to upgrade to broadband for the holidays. 
 ''This is an enormous holiday gift for the American consumer,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Doubts Persist on Iran Nuclear Arms Goals

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and WILLIAM J. BROAD; Elaine Sciolino contributed reporting from Paris for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Despite having collected substantial information about Iran's nuclear and weapons programs over the last several years, Western officials have limited intelligence about the crucial question of whether Tehran is trying to meld those two programs to produce a nuclear warhead that can be carried by a missile, administration officials said Friday. 
 The inability to answer that question so far poses an obstacle to the Bush administration's efforts to press for a hard line against the Tehran government. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said this week that he had seen intelligence indicating that Iran was ''working hard'' to produce a functioning nuclear-tipped missile. American officials said Friday that while such an effort would not be surprising, it would be significant if the new intelligence is true. But they suggested the intelligence had come from a single source and had not yet been verified, a detail first reported by The Washington Post. 
 A State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, defended Mr. Powell's comments on Friday, saying, ''We believe we are on very, very solid ground in pointing to a clandestine effort by Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.''
 United Nations inspections in 2003 disclosed that Iran was capable of enriching uranium, the main ingredient in a nuclear bomb. In the past year, they have deeply investigated Iran's nuclear program, which Iran says is for civilian use. 
 In recent days, the inspectors discovered that Iran had mastered a central technology needed to produce weapons-grade uranium that can be used to make nuclear bombs, Western diplomats based in Vienna said Friday. 
 But the inspectors, with the International Atomic Energy Agency, have not been able to shed much light on whether Iran has begun work on a covert nuclear program that could produce a weapon within the next several years, as Western intelligence agencies believe.
 American allies in Europe have now reached an agreement with Iran to suspend work on its nuclear program. The accord has yet to take effect. 
 The Bush administration has been skeptical of the deal, and President Bush is expected to raise the issue of Iran when he meets in Chile on Saturday morning with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader. 
 Iran may also be discussed next week when Mr. Powell attends a conference at an Egyptian resort, Sharm el Sheik, which representatives of Iran are also expected to attend.
 In many ways, the state of Western knowledge about the civilian nuclear program acknowledged by Iran is much more extensive than was the state of knowledge about Iraq at the time of the American invasion in 2003, after a long period without United Nations inspectors there. 
 Still, the problem that the administration is facing on Iran, in seeking to enlist allies behind a confrontational approach on the basis of limited intelligence, has echoes of the dilemma the Bush administration faced before the Iraq invasion. 
 After the experience in Iraq, where American intelligence about illicit weapons turned out to be badly overstated, the lesson now being applied in the case of Iran is ''to be appropriately skeptical about intelligence claims, and to really do your homework,'' a State Department official said Friday.
 ''We're not in a Feb. 5 mode on Iran,'' the official said, referring to the date in 2003 when Mr. Powell presented what later proved to be a flawed case against Iraq to the United Nations Security Council, ''in the sense that we're not ready to submit our information to public scrutiny.''
 Intelligence on Iran, as was the case with Iraq before the invasion, is riddled with holes, some current and former government officials acknowledge.
 ''Prior to the invasion of Iraq, we knew our intelligence on Iraq was inadequate but we did not realize how poor it actually was,'' said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is the author of a new book on Iran. ''Today, most intelligence officials believe that our intelligence about Iranian decision making and weapons of mass destruction is even more fragmentary and uncertain than what we believed to be our state of knowledge about Iraq.''
 Even so, United Nations inspectors have learned in recent days that Iran is producing large amounts of uranium hexafluoride at the gas processing facilities at its vast installation in Isfahan, said Western diplomats who are in contact with the I.A.E.A. Although Iran's uranium enrichment process is frozen under the agreement announced Monday with Britain, France and Germany, Iran has said it will begin suspension of its enrichment activities on Dec. 22.
 Officials in Vienna, Paris and London who are familiar with Iran's nuclear program said they suspected that Iran intended to prove to the world its mastery of the crucial step of the process before the agreement goes into effect.
 Beyond the United Nations inspectors, intelligence about Iran has come from a variety of sources. 
 In recent years, some of the most important information about Iran's nuclear program has been brought to the attention of American intelligence by a dissident group, the People's Mujahedeen of Iran. That group, which issued new claims this week, has sometimes shown an inconsistent record as a source of intelligence information.
 Former intelligence officials said that in recent months American intelligence officers have gained a new window on Iran as a result of their operations in neighboring Iraq. But it was not clear whether the large flow of new information being gathered on Iran from Iraq was proving reliable, the former officials said.
 American intelligence officials have always described Iran as a hard target, because of the impenetrability of the clerical government, which along with Iran's intelligence service and Revolutionary Guards maintains a monopoly on sensitive national security information. The Bush administration has said it believes that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but it has not presented evidence to back up those assertions.
 Beyond the debate over Mr. Powell's comments on Iran, experts have long known that it is pursuing advanced missile and atomic programs. Mr. Powell's comments were the strongest suggestion to date from an American official that Iran might have gone far toward melding these two efforts to create a deliverable nuclear warhead, potentially crossing a deadly line.
 The Iranians say that their nuclear reactor program is for making electricity and that the rocket program for making conventional military arms as well as for putting satellites into orbit. But the size, secrecy and aggressiveness of both programs have sown doubt among federal and private experts.
 Suspicions soared in the past year as European inspectors found that Iran had hidden some of its most sensitive nuclear work for as long as 18 years, and that some equipment bore traces of uranium pure enough to make nuclear arms. In August, a new surprise emerged as Iran test-fired a rocket that bore a suspicious-looking nose cone. 
 The rocket was an updated version of their Shahab-3 missile, and the test ignited a quiet debate among experts over whether its advanced nose cone was designed to carry a nuclear warhead. For two decades, the Iranians have been developing generations of long-range rockets with the aid of North Korea, and the Shahab, which means shooting star in Persian, stands at the cutting edge. 
 After last summer's test-firing, Charles P. Vick, an expert on the Iranian program at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group based in Alexandria, Va., said, ''What I've seen fly is a prototype for a nuclear warhead.'' 
 But other experts said the nose cone might be part of Iran's preparations for launching a satellite into orbit, which Tehran has said it plans to do in April. It was too thin, one said, to hold a relatively crude nuclear weapon. 
 ''These guys need all the space they can get'' atop a missile, said a European expert who closely follows the Iranian program.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Iran's nuclear program misstated the date announced by that country for the suspension of its uranium enrichment activities. (The error was repeated in an article yesterday on the emergence of Iran as a repeated subject of conversation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago, Chile.) The date is today (Nov. 22), not Dec. 22. An article about Iran's nuclear program appears today on Page A8.

HEADLINE: Groundhog Day

 BODY:
Stop us if you've heard this one before. The Bush administration creates a false sense of urgency about a nuclear menace from a Middle Eastern country. Hard-liners talk about that country's connections to terrorists. They portray European diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions as a feckless attempt to appease a rogue nation whose word can never be trusted anyway. Secretary of State Colin Powell makes ominous-sounding warnings about new intelligence, which turns out to be dubious.
 That is how President Bush rushed the country into an unnecessary conflict with Iraq in his first term, and we have been seeing alarming signs of that approach all week on Iran. 
 Let's be cleareyed about this: Iran has an active nuclear program, has not tried terribly hard to hide it and has been dishonest in its dealings with the West. But nothing we have seen suggests some new, urgent development in Iran that would impel American officials to start talking about ''the military option.'' In fact, the most recent developments have been encouraging. Last week, under the threat of a looming U.N. deadline, Tehran said it would freeze all uranium and plutonium processing and invite back international inspectors. 
 It was a welcome step, resulting from efforts by Britain, France and Germany, and signaled that even the hard-liners in Tehran are susceptible to economic appeals. If the negotiations over Iran's nuclear programs go well, Europe promises to resume talks on a preferential trade agreement. If they don't, it will be time for international economic sanctions. After meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Bush went out of his way to praise and endorse the Europeans' efforts.
 But on Wednesday, Mr. Powell suddenly offered scary sounding talk about new intelligence that supposedly showed that Iran was not only working on enriching uranium, a big step toward making a bomb, but was also working on ways to attach such a weapon to a missile. His alarmist tone was a bit puzzling, since everyone has already agreed that Iran has nuclear ambitions, and it's hard to imagine a country wanting to own a nuclear bomb without exploring ways to use it. The world has also known for years that Iran was testing guided missiles. 
 Puzzlement turned to alarm yesterday when The Washington Post reported that Mr. Powell's comments were based on unverified information that had been brought to the United States by a previously unknown source whose reliability and authenticity had not yet been vetted. That certainly did bring back old memories -- of Mr. Powell assuring the world that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons, based on fanciful intelligence reports about aluminum tubes. 
 Steven Weisman of The Times reported that administration hawks were also talking about fresh intelligence on Iran's support for Hezbollah, which the world has known about for decades, and Iran's support for insurgents in Iraq, another old story. The hawks seem to be already throwing cold water on the prospects for a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear problem, while trying to open the door to contemplating a military option. An administration official told The Times that Mr. Powell was trying to avoid meeting with the Iranian foreign minister at a conference both men are to attend in Egypt next week.
 Small wonder, then, that the Europeans started to accuse Washington of trying to undermine diplomacy with Iran, just as the Bush administration thwarted their efforts to resume the U.N. inspections of Iraq -- inspections that we now know had been highly effective.
 Iran has long been a target of the hawks in the administration, who are undoubtedly feeling their oats after the election. But we hope that President Bush has learned enough from the Iraq adventure to understand the dangers of using flawed intelligence to create a false sense of urgency about a national security threat. 
 Obviously, a nuclear-armed Iran run by its current brand of extremists, who have twisted religion to support terrorism, would be a cause for real concern. But there is no military solution here. Iran's scattered and secretive nuclear program cannot be bombed out of existence. And even if the United States had not stretched its military to the limit in Iraq, invading Iran, a country of nearly 70 million people, would be a catastrophic mistake. 
 The Bush administration has said that stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons is at the top of its foreign policy agenda. That's where it belongs. But it's a goal that can be pursued only through truly multilateral diplomacy, in which the United States works with its European allies, rather than trying to undermine them, and the Europeans are prepared to stand behind Washington with a credible threat of economic sanctions when they are justified. It is not an excuse for war or even for pretending that war is a rational option.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Worries Over U.S. Deficits and Oil Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday as Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, sounded a warning over the nation's rapidly climbing trade deficit. Crude oil futures rose more than $2 a barrel, further pressuring stocks.
 Mr. Greenspan's unusually frank assessment of the trade imbalance and its effect on the economy worried many investors. The Fed chairman said the economy had been resilient, but foreign investment could wane if the deficits continue to build and the dollar remains weak. 
 ''Certainly that has investors worried, though I'm not entirely sure why Greenspan chose to make a case out of this,'' said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services in Boston. ''The lower dollar will eventually force importers to raise prices, and that'll help cut the trade deficit. But nonetheless, it was unusual for him to speak out on it like that, and it's having an effect.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 115.64 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,456.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 13.21 points, or 1 percent, to 1,170.34, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 33.65 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,070.63.
 Yesterday's performance pushed the major indexes to their first weekly loss after three consecutive weeks of gains, halting a post-election rally on Wall Street. Most analysts, however, said the week's trading, and especially yesterday's losses, were a pause in an overall positive market, and added that stocks would probably continue to rise.
 For the week, the Dow fell 0.78 percent, the S.&P. 500 shed 1.17 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 0.71 percent.
 Trading was also pressured by oil prices, which rose after a government report showed a drop in inventory for distillates like heating oil, which is critical as winter approaches. A barrel of light crude was quoted at $48.44, up $2.22, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Despite oil prices and Mr. Greenspan's assessment of the trade deficit, analysts said that the overall market remained strong and that the sell-off amounted to profit taking after weeks of strong gains.
 ''Today is more of a blip on the screen, with people using Mr. Greenspan's comments as an excuse to take some profits,'' said Stewart Freeman, chief equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''We're exiting a period of uncertainty with the elections and terrorism and worries about slowing profit growth, and I think we're set up nicely to continue upward after this.''
 Pharmaceutical stocks fell as investors digested Thursday's Senate hearing over Merck's arthritis drug Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market because of findings that it caused a high risk of heart attack and stroke. The Food and Drug Administration was roundly criticized at the hearing for its drug-approval process. Merck shed 24 cents, to $27.12, while Pfizer slipped 54 cents, to $27.23, and GlaxoSmithKline dropped 82 cents, to $42.77.
 Nike lost $2.50, to $82.50, after the company announced that its co-founder Philip H. Knight was stepping down as president and chief executive. Mr. Knight will remain chairman, while William D. Perez, a top executive at the privately held S.C. Johnson, will become president and chief executive.
 Sirius Satellite Radio also has new leadership, recruiting Mel Karmazin, former Viacom president, as its new chief executive. Sirius surged 45 cents, to $5.17.
 Midnight was the deadline issued by Oracle for shareholders of PeopleSoft to respond to Oracle's $24-a-share takeover bid. Oracle plans to abandon its bid unless more than half of PeopleSoft's shares are tendered by the deadline. Oracle fell 22 cents, to $12.75, while PeopleSoft gained 25 cents, to $23.17.
 Walt Disney was up 29 cents, at $26.66, after it beat Wall Street profit expectations on Thursday afternoon by 6 cents a share. The media conglomerate said strong results from its ABC television network and cable channels offset a poor performance in its movie division. The company restated its 2005 guidance, but warned that the first quarter could be weak.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 26/32, to a price of 10011/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.2 percent, from 4.11 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: China Widens Economic Role in Latin America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 19 

 BODY:
The expected arrival here on Friday of President Bush, who personifies for Latin Americans the economic and political power of Washington, is being greeted with an uneasy mix of protests and hopes for greater growth.
 But while the United States may still regard the region as its backyard, its dominance is no longer unquestioned. Suddenly, the presence of China can be felt everywhere, from the backwaters of the Amazon to mining camps in the Andes.
 Driven by one the largest and most sustained economic expansions in history, and facing bottlenecks and shortages in Asia, China is increasingly turning to South America as a supplier. It is busy buying huge quantities of iron ore, bauxite, soybeans, timber, zinc and manganese in Brazil. It is vying for tin in Bolivia, oil in Venezuela and copper here in Chile, where last month it displaced the United States as the leading market for Chilean exports. 
 While President Bush is spending the weekend here for the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, President Hu Jintao of China is here in the midst of a two-week visit to Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Cuba. In the course of it, he has announced more than $30 billion in new investments and signed long-term contracts that will guarantee China supplies of the vital materials it needs for its factories. 
 The United States, preoccupied with the worsening situation in Iraq, seems to have attached little importance to China's rising profile in the region. If anything, increased trade between Latin America and China has been welcomed as a means to reduce pressure on the United States to underwrite economic reforms, with geopolitical considerations pushed to the background.
 ''On the diplomatic side, the Chinese are quietly but persistently and effectively operating just under the U.S. radar screen,'' said Richard Feinberg, who was the chief Latin America adviser at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. ''South America is obviously drifting, and diplomatic flirtations with China would tend to underscore the potential for divergences with Washington.''
 Chinese investment and purchases are seen as vital for economies short on capital and struggling to emerge from a long slump. In Argentina earlier this week, for example, Mr. Hu announced nearly $20 billion in new investment in railways, oil and gas exploration, construction and communications satellites, a huge boost for a country whose economic vitality has been sapped since a financial collapse in December 2001.
 China is also increasingly willing to venture outside the economic realm. In March, for example, after Dominica, in the Caribbean, severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Beijing responded with a $112 million aid package, which includes $6 million in budget support this year and $1 million annually for six years. In Antigua, it has pledged $23 million toward the construction of a new soccer stadium. 
 Political relations seem to be advancing most rapidly with Brazil, Latin America's most populous nation, where the left-leaning government has repeatedly floated the idea of a ''strategic alliance'' with Beijing.
 The Brazilian government has made clear that it views closer ties with China as a card that can be played to offset American influence and trade dominance. While not suggesting that China could soon replace the United States as Brazil's main customer and partner, the aim is to force trade and other concessions from the United States and rich industrialized nations.
 ''We want a partnership that integrates our economies and serves as a paradigm for South-South cooperation,'' President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in May during a state visit to China during which he was accompanied by nearly 500 Brazilian business executives. ''We are two giants without historical, political or economic divergences, free to think only about the future.''
 Before his visit, Mr. da Silva even hinted at negotiating a free-trade agreement with China, a step that Chile this week announced it would take. But China's impact in Brazil is already felt so strongly that the idea was quickly shelved after Sao Paulo business groups expressed fears of being overwhelmed by state-owned Chinese companies in their own domestic market.
 In 2003 China became Brazil's second-largest individual trading partner, and in recent months the Chinese have been seeking joint ventures that would expand trade even further and give them a significant investment stake. Brazil is one of the few countries to enjoy a trade surplus with China, and last year alone exports to China nearly doubled, to $4.5 billion.
 ''Over the past three or four years, the growth in trade has been explosive,'' said Renato Amorim, formerly a diplomat in Brazil's embassy in Beijing and now the executive director of the Brazil-China Business Council. ''China is trying to assure reliable sources of supply of raw materials to deal with the shortages it faces, and since there are no conflicts on the political agenda, Brazil fits the bill.''
 Many of the minerals come from a part of the Amazon known as Carajas, which has the largest, purest reserves of iron ore and other strategic minerals in the world. At a complex at the mouth of the Amazon near Belem that produces alumina, the white powder that is refined from bauxite to make aluminum, production may soon double, with most of it expected to go to China over the next decade.
 Farther down the coast, Baosteel of China and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil, the world's largest iron ore producer, are partners in a $1.5 billion steel venture to produce up to eight million tons of iron a year. Upriver in Manaus, Chinese delegations are negotiating long-term deals for timber. To the south, in Mato Grosso, similar missions are trying to lock up supplies of soybeans and cotton.
 The same is happening elsewhere, especially in agriculture. All across the South American heartland, from the Amazon to the pampas of Argentina, a boom in the cultivation of soybeans, used mainly as animal feed, has been propelled in recent years by the emergence half a world away of a Chinese middle-class with more income and a desire for more pork, chicken and beef.
 Concerned by what they see as Chinese advances, Japan and South Korea are also stepping up their efforts to secure their own supplies of raw materials in the region. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan visited Brazil in mid-September. President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea has also scheduled trips to Argentina, Brazil and Chile, planned around the Chinese visits.
 ''Within a few years there is likely to be a 'war' to develop raw materials,'' Park Yong Soo, president of the state-run Korea Resources Corporation, told Reuters last month. ''China is challenging aggressively,'' he added, leading to supply shortages and higher prices.
 The few Brazilian analysts who have experience dealing with China are also urging their government to be cautious. Ideological sympathies or some vague notion of third world solidarity, they say, should not get in the way of the national interest.
 In pursuit of their ''strategic partnership,'' Brazil and China have jointly developed a satellite program, are discussing Brazilian sales of uranium for use in Chinese reactors, and recently marked the opening of a plant in China owned by the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer.
 But it is clear to most Brazilian experts that China sees their country primarily as a source of raw materials, and that bothers them. Many are encouraging the government to fight for a more equal relationship, raising concerns from trade flows to environmental damage.
 ''Thus far, the discourse has been much more political that pragmatic, with all this talk of a South-South alliance,'' said Eliana Cardoso, formerly a World Bank economist for China and now a university professor in Sao Paulo. She and others caution that though President da Silva has stressed that the Brazilian and Chinese economies are essentially complementary, China is also a rival.
 During President Hu's visit last week, the Brazilian government agreed to recognize China as a ''market economy,'' a step that makes it harder to impose penalties on China for dumping exports. The influential Industrial Federation of Sao Paulo immediately criticized the move as a ''political decision'' that leaves ''Brazilian industry in a vulnerable position'' and will bring ''prejudicial consequences to various industrial sectors.''
 Not only are businesses concerned about China's making inroads into the domestic market; they also worry about exports of products with which Brazil has had some success abroad, from shoes and toys to chemicals and car parts. ''What Brazil has to insist on is that instead of exporting raw materials, we try to export processed goods,'' Dr. Cardoso said.
 Marcos Jank, an economist who is an adviser to the Industrial Federation of Sao Paulo, agreed. ''China in the long term can rob markets from Brazil, because the hand of the state is still very strong in a lot of areas, including the exchange rate,'' he said. ''It is a ferocious competitor in the things we export, as well as for markets and investments.''
 In fact, so much foreign investment has been going to China that Latin America is finding it difficult to obtain the capital it needs to finance its own growth. As a result Brazil, like neighboring Argentina, has been forced to court Citic, the state-controlled China International Trust and Investment Corporation, in hopes that at least a small part of China's estimated $500 billion in foreign reserves will make its way to the region.
 Thus far, China has been mainly interested in infrastructure projects that would assure a more steady flow of the products it is already buying from Brazil and Argentina. In particular, railways, ports, highways, gas pipelines and other energy-related projects are being studied. Earlier this month, a Citic delegation visited two dam sites in the Amazon that would be essential to the alumina and steel joint ventures in Brazil.
 Such projects have raised questions about the environment, especially in the Amazon. Environmental groups here look at China's dismal record on projects like the Three Gorges Dam and worry that the Chinese will be tempted to export their problems to Brazil.
 In fact, several of the projects being considered would be highly polluting, while others would be energy-intensive and probably inflict damage to the environment similar to what occurred at Three Gorges. Of special concern are a pair of plants that would process coal in Brazil, partly for export back to China.
 ''It would be sad if at the moment the Chinese are beginning to worry about being green, we continue on the old path of not evaluating this criterion in our commercial transactions,'' the columnist Washington Novaes wrote this month in O Estado de Sao Paulo. Brazil must avoid falling into the trap of being ''a big supplier of commodities without compensation for the high environmental and social costs'' that accompany that role, he added.
 Brazilian analysts agree that hard negotiations on this and a host of other issues lie ahead. Though the relationship with China is inherently unequal, they note, Brazil can get more of what it wants only if it avoids being impetuous and is as hard-nosed and pragmatic as the Chinese themselves.
 ''They want Brazil to continue to be a big producer of commodities so as to regulate prices, to depress them on world markets,'' said Gilberto Dupas, director of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Sao Paulo. ''For China, any alliance with Brazil is eminently pragmatic and opportunistic, and much more tactical than strategic.''

HEADLINE: A Painful Goodbye To Cheap Money

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN. 
Daniel Altman is the author of ''Neoconomy: George Bush's Revolutionary Gamble With America's Future.''

 BODY:
MONEY doesn't grow on trees, though for a while there it seemed as if it did.
 Americans had years to get used to zero-percent financing on cars and major appliances, rock-bottom mortgages and cut-rate credit card deals. They borrowed prodigiously to pay for more spending, even when paychecks weren't growing and neither was employment. As tepid and intermittent as the economy's recovery from the 2001 recession has been, it owes a big part of its very existence to that American willingness to go on consuming, come what may. 
 But in raising short-term interest rates to 2 percent this month, with more increases likely to come, the Federal Reserve has signaled that the days of arboreal money are over. Americans are going to start feeling the cost of repaying their debts. 
 The adjustment could be a painful one. No longer will many consumers be able to make impulse buys -- a new stereo, washing machine or sports coupe -- with no payments due for a year or more. Credit card companies will no longer come knocking with dazzling balance-transfer offers. 
 Time that used to be spent hunting for a new home, spurred on by record low mortgage rates, may be devoted instead to finding a good I.R.A. or mutual fund to house the down-payment money. And some people who are already living on the knife edge between managing their monthly payments and falling into bankruptcy will be pushed over the edge.
 Short-term interest rates are going up now for two reasons: because the specter of inflation is returning as the economy resumes a path of steady growth, and because the Fed needs some room to maneuver in case that path turns out not to be so steady. 
 Inflation hasn't become a problem so far, but there are some signs in the data that it may. Last month, the prices that businesses pay for labor and materials rose by a whopping 1.7 percent; consumer prices rose, too, though more moderately. There is not much sign in the latest statistics that productivity growth is helping to moderate inflation, so it is likely that the Fed will have to go on raising rates to head it off. 
 It won't take long before households feel the pinch: their payments on existing loans with adjustable rates will go up, and new borrowing will cost them more. Since many credit cards today charge floating rates linked to the prime rate, which moves in lockstep with the Fed, some of this squeeze is already occurring. 
 Higher credit-card rates are likely to result in less borrowing, said David B. Gross, vice president of Lexecon, an economic consulting firm in Chicago. ''Certainly, you would see some substantial effect within a year,'' he said. 
 Research that Mr. Gross published in 2002 with Nicholas S. Souleles of the University of Pennsylvania showed that a 10 percent increase in credit card rates -- say, a bump up to a 6.5 percent rate from 5.9 percent before -- was associated with a drop of 13 percent in borrowing. Less borrowing usually means less spending, and that could take much of the consumer wind out of the economy's sails. 
 The situation differs for mortgages and other long-term loans. Rates on most of those are fixed, said Robert E. Mellman, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, so few existing borrowers are threatened. But with higher rates making the payments larger on new loans, some house and car buyers may have to choose between settling for a smaller purchase and not buying at all. 
 Less demand for housing, in particular, could also lead to lower spending in other areas of the economy. If house prices fall, homeowners may feel less wealthy and spend less of their incomes -- the so-called wealth effect working in reverse. And the combination of falling house prices and rising rates could close off one of the most important sources of fresh spending cash for consumers in recent years: refinancings and home-equity loans.
 Mortgage rates are generally linked to long-term bond rates, and have not yet reflected the Fed's moves. But if the Fed keeps raising short-term rates, lenders will have to start charging more, too. Mr. Mellman said that he and his colleagues expect long-term rates to start rising in 2005. 
 ALL this matters more than ever to most Americans because they owe so much. Fed statistics for the first half of the year show that households' debt payments stood near an all-time high, as a share of after-tax income. The recent pickup in the economy may have offset the effects of the Fed's first few moves to raise rates, by raising average incomes enough to keep pace. But that may not last, because several factors could combine to push long-term rates up sharply.
 One factor is the federal budget deficit. Financial markets may shrug off a bad year or two, but when expectations grow for a long string of big deficits -- caused, for example, by big permanent tax cuts or costly overseas conflicts that last longer than expected -- the government's need to borrow can drive up rates for everyone. 
 Interest rates could also climb if factors like a weak dollar and slowing consumer demand make America a less attractive place for the world to invest, or if, conversely, something suddenly went very right -- say, a technological breakthrough that caused a sudden spike in the demand for capital to exploit it. 
 Indeed, higher long-term rates could be a sign that the economy is ready to grow faster: a booming economy brings more demand for credit, which can drive up rates, but it also brings the threat of rapid inflation, which can compel the Fed to put on the brakes by raising rates. That in turn could herald an economic slowdown, with stagnant incomes and widening unemployment -- a potentially devastating cocktail for heavily indebted Americans.

HEADLINE: Old-Car Itch? Here's a Club To Scratch It

BYLINE: By NICK KURCZEWSKI

 BODY:
OWNING a vintage car in a big city is like having a pet elephant: the novelty value is undeniable, but where do you keep the beast? And how do you pay the mounting bills for truckloads of hay and barrels of peanuts -- or for piston rings?
 In Britain, two brothers who are car buffs gave the matter some thought and came up with a solution, a club that lets urban enthusiasts experience the thrills of driving vintage cars without the aggravations of owning, storing, maintaining and insuring them.
 A member of the Classic Car Club simply checks out, for a day or a weekend, one of the dozens of classic and sports cars that the club maintains and garages in the city. After a summer Sunday in a raffish MGB, a member can sample an E-Type Jaguar or move on to a Rolls-Royce Mulliner Park Ward -- all for a single annual fee. 
 The concept, which spread from London to five other British cities, is due to cross the Atlantic; a New York City franchise is to open next year. Other branches are planned for Atlanta; Baltimore-Washington; Boston; Los Angeles; and Princeton, N.J. The club is looking at other cities as well.
 The club was begun in 1995 by Phil Kavanagh and his brother, David, then in their 20's, who were frustrated by what they perceived as age discrimination by banks. Often, they said, young people were denied loans to buy the older cars they loved. 
 ''We wondered how we could develop a system to allow people to drive cool cars,'' Phil Kavanagh said in a recent telephone interview from London. ''So we put the plan together and developed the points system.'' 
 That system is the bedrock of the club's operation, providing an efficient capitalist solution to thorny questions about which members can drive the most desirable cars on the most sought-after dates. Essentially, each member receives an equal number of points that he or she can cash in as desired. The best cars and the most popular driving times command a premium.
 When the club began, in London, it had three dozen members and 10 cars. After six months as a modest success, a long article about the club in The Sunday Times prompted a flurry of interest. More publicity followed, and both the membership rolls and the auto fleet multiplied several times over. The London club now has more than 40 cars, about 500 members and a waiting list.
 As the club flourished, queries arrived from other British cities. The Kavanaghs (David later left the business) sold franchises for Bath, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester and Woking. 
 While it is possible to rent classic and exotic cars in Britain, as in the United States, the Classic Car Club offers some advantages, including the camaraderie nurtured through organized driving events, a membership committee and informal monthly get-togethers. A newsletter and a Web site -- www.classiccarclub.co.uk -- let members know when cars are added to the fleet.
 Glen Waddington, features editor of Thoroughbred & Classic Cars, a British enthusiast magazine, is familiar with the club and has met many members. ''It's not purely a car rental company or entirely an owners' club,'' he said, but a clever combination. Joining the club, he added, is ''certainly less of a risk than investing in one classic and finding out you don't like it.''
 Membership begins with a character reference and a review of the applicant's driving record. In Britain, the annual membership charge is $:2,600 plus a $:500 initiation fee, or a total of about $5,700. The annual charge covers vehicle maintenance and storage, insurance, emergency road service and unlimited mileage. 
 With a basic membership, the member starts the year with 750 points that he or she can trade for time in cars. The amount of points deducted depends on a variety of factors, including the value of the car and the month, day of the week and number of days the car is used. The cars are ranked on desirability and grouped into six ''bands,'' from the likes of a Morris Minor in Band 1 to valuable Ferraris in Band 6.
 The system works this way: A Band 6 car like a Ferrari 348 costs 6 points. Driving it on a Saturday would multiply the cost by 4 points, to 24. Checking out the car in a high-demand month like July would multiply that amount by another 4 points, for a total deduction of 96 points. 
 Driving the same 6-point car on a weekday (multiplied by 1) in December (multipled by 2) would cost only 12 points.
 Mr. Kavanagh says the system encourages members to try a variety of cars, and they confirm this. Nick Pipping, who joined five years ago, said, ''You discover all sorts of cars you never thought about.'' 
 Mr. Pipping, a 45-year-old executive with an employment firm, said that although he could have afforded to buy a classic, he could not make up his mind about what to get. ''Personally I prefer this,'' he said.
 While many members in London are professional men aged 30 to 45, the clubs are becoming more diverse. ''We have retired couples, we have gay couples and quite a lot of single women are getting into the club now,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. A few celebrities have joined, including Jamie Oliver, television's Naked Chef. (His restaurant, Fifteen, is across the street from the London club.)
 Can the camaraderie survive a move across the Atlantic? Chris Braun, a protege of Mr. Kavanagh who owns the rights to establish North American clubs, says it will.
 Still, the intricacies of setting up American operations were more daunting than the club imagined. Each state's rules pose challenges and increase the paperwork.
 The New York franchise is held by Zac Moseley, known for designing the lighting in hip New York clubs and restaurants, who was intrigued by a program about the club that he saw on a flight to London. Other investors in New York are Mr. Braun and Michael Prichinello of the Modern Message public relations firm.
 Branches are free to buy what they wish, but Mr. Kavanagh offers advice, including a list of ''must have cars'': Porsche 911, Series III Jaguar E-Type, Ferrari 308 and 328.
 Mr. Kavanagh plans to encourage the American branches to offer options like the ''City Car Club'' that has proved popular in London. For an extra fee, members have access to a separate fleet of sporty modern cars like the Porsche Boxster and Subaru WRX. As in Britain, membership in one branch would entitle a member to use club cars in other cities, though the necessary points would be bought separately. 
 While the basic structure will not change, membership charges haven't been set; because of American insurance costs, fees are likely to be slightly higher than in Britain.

(Photo by Jonathan Player for The New York Times)Chart: ''Membership Has Its Driving Privileges: Sharing Classics From Econoboxes to Exotics''Members of the Classic Car Club in Britain pay about $5,700 for their first year, entitling them to 750 points that can be used to borrow cars from the club's collection. The number of points deducted depends on several factors, including the month and day the car is driven, but one important factor is the desirability of the model. For instance, the London club groups its 40-some cars into six 'bands,' with Band 6 the most desirable. Using a Ferrari 328 GTBi on a Saturday in July might cost a member 96 points, compared with 12 points on a weekday in December.

HEADLINE: O Canada! That Fractured, Frosty Land

BYLINE: By BRUCE McCALL. 
Bruce McCall, the humorist, is the author of ''Thin Ice: Coming of Age in Canada.''

 BODY:
Now is a particularly favorable moment to immigrate to Canada: the National Hockey League has all but evaporated in a labor dispute, so the usual forced bloating of the United States emigrant's cerebral cortex with the billions of data bytes necessary to talk hockey with mailmen, cabdrivers and yes, customs agents, is suspended.
 Canada's states are called provinces for a good reason: provincialism. They're strung out laterally across the North American continent like washing on a long line, and the towels never talk to the socks. British Columbia out there on the far side of the Rockies feels zero affinity with Newfoundland out there in the Atlantic, and not a lot more with the other eight provinces. 
 Meanwhile the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as independent of one another as if they were in the Balkans, border on the politically wacky through lack of cultural cross-ventilation and are united only in their contempt for centrally situated Ontario -- rich by Canadian standards, and revoltingly smug about it -- whose residents in turn have generally despised their next-door neighbors in francophone Quebec for 200-plus years. The feeling is at least mutual, while the three Maritime Provinces -- New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island -- pine away in geographic and economic isolation, nursing a grudge against all the other provinces on general principles.
 Having fled the United States because of its increasing regional factionalism, you thus must learn to hate all over again: loyalty to whatever province you fetch up in, including its prickly bag of resentments against all the others, will be as vital as your loyalty to Canada itself. 
 Canada's DNA is late-Victorian British, so no wonder Canadians from whatever province regard calling attention to oneself as vulgar or, worse, American. Assimilating will go easier if you abandon vanity, as in good haircuts and fancy European haberdashery, and any worldly success as anything but a grotesque mistake. If life in Canada is cheaper, the money saved by extinguishing the ego is one reason. 
 Texans and other congenital blowhards moving north should learn to speak in a low voice and a tone so mild that even declarative statements sound like questions. (Thus that Canadian habit of appending that ''eh?'' to every sentence, both a plea for approval and license for the hearer to disagree.) American extroverts entering Canada are likely to meet members of its persecuted attention-seeking minority, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, etc., heading the other way. Real Canadians shun the open expression of almost any emotion, save the cathartically splenetic Yank-bashing, second only to hockey as a national pastime.
 It must be understood that the appeal of hockey for Canadians extends way beyond a game: it is the only sanctioned outlet for both an otherwise repressed violent streak, and a secret appreciation for grace and beauty that would be deemed an admission of sissyhood if lavished on, say, dance. In brief, hockey equals group therapy.
 Stock up on warm rainproof clothing because Canadian weather stinks. It rains all the time in British Colombia and Newfoundland. Montreal is so cold in winter that they had to build an underground city to fend off mass frostbite. No wonder TV weathercasters from Seattle to Bangor spend most of their airtime dreading the latest cold front sweeping down from Canada. Most Ontarians and Quebecois would be planning to winter in Florida even if the Yanks had just re-elected Vlad the Impaler president.
 Abandon all hope of gustatory ecstasy. In fact abandon hope of anything but all-brown meals. Canada, a k a the Land of the Spice Haters, is where food is an energy source only (think diesel fuel) and fine dining another import of American ostentation. If Canada had a Death Row, the most popular last meal would be Salisbury steak, canned corn and Tim Hortons doughnuts.
 Canadians have this zany idea that it is they who bask in a land of opportunity, justice and tolerance demonstrably equal if not superior to (strict gun laws, gay marriage, environmental responsibility, universal health care) the United States, or anywhere else, so best to rein in the gassy Only-in-America ethnocentrism that is your birthright -- or, to Canadians, birth defect.
 So welcome, American immigrants, but -- said as kindly as possible -- just shut up.

HEADLINE: Happy as Two Blue-Plate Specials

BYLINE: By Stephen Burt

 BODY:
The classical Greek word for poet means ''maker''; its Latin counterpart, ''vates,'' also means ''prophet,'' implying not craft but spirit or inspiration. Readers since antiquity have asked whether true poetry comes from diligent artifice, or from powers outside the poet's control. The best poems, now as ever, evidence both: they are at once inventions and discoveries.
 Laura Kasischke's poems probe the lives of supposedly ordinary women, along with the extraordinary emotional tumult those lives may conceal. In GARDENING IN THE DARK (Ausable, paper, $14), this Michigan-based poet's territory encompasses high school parking lots, ''the bottom of the fountain at the center of the mall,'' and a kitchen with macaroni and cheese in the oven, ''shifting / shape and sweetening / in the heat.'' Such spaces promise refuge, but deliver danger: ''Even / in spring, the closet's a blind hive. A black dress / hangs at its center. . . . Never forget, / it sings.'' Her stressed-out mothers and reckless adolescents risk melodrama for the sake of vivid drama. Their wild hearts find appropriately wild similes: ''spring, as if a bride / had been bewitched into windchimes.'' Kasischke's intelligence is most apparent in her syntactic control and pace, the way she gauges just when to make free verse speed up, or stop short, or slow down. 
 With their grammatical displacements, changes of subject and predicate, and whiplash transitions, the poems in Brian Blanchfield's confident debut, NOT EVEN THEN: Poems (University of California, paper, $16.95), appear at first to depict nothing at all. Then they come into focus and portray a life: a young gay man learns to inhabit New York City, seeking out peers and lovers while sifting through information overload. Like the forebears he acknowledges (John Ashbery, Hart Crane), this clever, busy, anxious, flirtatious poet, with his ''predilections . . . for predicaments,'' can connect anything to anything else. The purposeful clutter and crowded dissonance in Blanchfield's verse heightens his worldly-wise, unlikely charm: ''If there's a better boy way into metaphysics, / again may I say yours is perfectly pulled across.''
 Wallace Stevens once said that poets must love words with all their power to love anything at all. Few first books show as much pleasure in words as Matthew Thorburn's SUBJECT TO CHANGE (New Issues, paper, $14). ''Have you ever seen a less flight-worthy lark, / such an archipelago of glum-faced / rice-throwers?'' Thorburn writes of a winter wedding. Influenced by Paul Muldoon, among others, Thorburn fashions original devices to depict familiar affections. In a sestina, he celebrates a more fortunate marriage, showing its couple ''happy as two blue / plate specials in a diner called Moe's.''
 Drawn to fragments and foreshortening, ''drinking down the will of the event'' or invoking ''sheet lightning on sheet glass,'' Jean Valentine has long combined explosive vigor and extreme restraint, from the rhymed odes that won her the 1965 Yale Younger Poets prize to the halting, almost prayerful, new works that open DOOR IN THE MOUNTAIN: New and Collected Poems, 1965-2003 (Wesleyan University, $29.95). Her preoccupations include religious mysticism (Buddhist, Christian and Native American), imprisonment, mourning, maternal care and erotic experience. Valentine's best volumes (those from before 1975 or after 1990) suggest the inward tumult, though not the intellectual rigors, of a latter-day Emily Dickinson; her hacked glyphs and mottoes capture entire lives: ''The black lines lived around my crayon bones''; ''someone wrote something here in the dirt / and I sip at the word.'' 
 If Valentine's brief forms recall hot coals, then Bill Knott's suggest scrimshaw. Relying on brains and on his ''comic attitude, which flirts / With grimace-smiles, jokes,'' Knott sees himself as a bitter, rueful observer of human behavior (including his own). THE UNSUBSCRIBER (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20) gathers long antiwar screeds and experiments in translation, along with much verse that's either self-consciously awkward or perhaps a little too slangily up-to-date. Yet a double handful of sonnets, and a sheaf of even more compact poems, redeem the whole. Knott's playful verbal acuities serve as counters for bleak moods: ''Severs and brothers, brokens and sisters, is this it?'' Here he also writes corrosive attacks reminiscent of Catullus, classically tranquil poems in Japanese forms, sharp paradoxes and clipped wisdom: ''Even when the streets are empty, / even at night, the stopsign / tells the truth.''
 The language in Mary Jo Bang's poems can seem to break free from its subjects, rising into its own realm; if Bang understands that aerial appeal, she also knows how to bring her poems back down to earth, how to link them to their subjects again. In THE EYE LIKE A STRANGE BALLOON: Poems (Grove, paper, $13), the subjects are 52 works of visual art, among them 17 by the German postmodernist Sigmar Polke, whose distractable, inquisitive sensibility matches Bang's own. Bang assumes the persona of a grown-up Alice in Wonderland on a quest through absurd, incompatible scenes: ''the self is consistent,'' Bang explains, ''but the story is made / of fragments, color-coded, ballooned / or cubed''; ''Of course we are flying / blind. Of course we are frightened.'' If Bang's weaker poems fly apart into unrelated quips, the stronger ones speed from odd sights into pithy hypotheses. Life in her imaginary museum becomes not just a game but a test of character: if we resist easy conclusions, keep our good humor and play through pain, then perhaps we can become ''content / with whomever we think we are.''
 Not art history but family history drives DIRT EATERS (University Press of Florida, paper, $12.95): Teri Youmans Grimm's debut tells her own life story and those of her Southern rural relatives. As in Rita Dove's ''Thomas and Beulah,'' the emotional weight derives from her characters' accumulated experience: surviving a house fire, rejecting evangelical Christianity, or feeling stranded and lonely at a school dance. Grimm's technique shows in her judicious quotation from other speakers and in her diversity of forms, from two-beat lines to expansive verse paragraphs to a tightly wound villanelle. Turn-of-the-century ancestors' ''chatty born-again ghosts'' offer Grimm ''a debt / no one ever really counts on collecting''; the poet herself remembers wearing ''my sister's five-year-old / chiffon and pink polyester/ bridesmaid'' dress as she competed (successfully) for the title of ''Miss Senior High Duval County.'' 
 Mark Nowak, too, sifts his sources from history: all five of the verse and prose-poem sequences in SHUT UP SHUT DOWN: Poems (Coffee House, paper, $15) concern labor unions or unemployment, and all five weave real or imagined interviews together with excerpts from other documents, and with Nowak's terse reactions. Sometimes those reactions sound shrill: ''destabilized / democratic spaces / closed foreclosed / nation.'' The best segments, though, make ''Memorials / of the materials'' from which laid-off miners, air traffic controllers or clerks have tried to make lives. The elegant stanzas of ''Francine Michalek Drives Bread'' follow an immigrant family through decades of bare survival: Francine wakes early to drive a bakery truck; ''Not rising / is not her option.'' Nowak can speak for his characters, but prefers to let them speak for themselves. If he casts himself as a prophet, a Jeremiah, his inspirations are far from mysterious: like all these poets, he has made what he can out of what he has seen and heard.

HEADLINE: Soaring Interest Is Compounding Credit Card Woes for Millions

BYLINE: This article was reported by Patrick McGeehan, Lowell Bergman, Robin Stein and Marlena Telvick and written by Mr. McGeehan.

 BODY:
When Ed Schwebel was whittling down his mound of credit card debt at an interest rate of 9.2 percent, the MBNA Corporation had a happy and profitable customer. But this summer, when MBNA suddenly doubled the rate on his account, Mr. Schwebel joined the growing ranks of irate cardholders stunned by lenders' harsh tactics.
 Mr. Schwebel, 58, a semiretired software engineer in Gilbert, Ariz., was not pleased that his minimum monthly payment jumped from $502 in June to $895 in July. But what really made him angry, he said, was the sense that he was being punished despite having held up his end of the bargain with MBNA.
 ''I paid the bills the minute the envelope hit the desk,'' said Mr. Schwebel, who had accumulated $69,000 in debt over five years before the rate increase. ''All of a sudden in July, they swapped it to 18 percent. No warning. No reason. It was like I was blindsided.'' 
 Mr. Schwebel had stumbled into the new era of consumer credit, in which thousands of Americans are paying millions of dollars each month in fees that they did not expect and that strike them as unreasonable. Invoking clauses tucked into the fine print of their contract agreements, lenders are doubling or tripling interest rates with little warning or explanation.
 This year, credit card companies are changing the terms of their accounts at a historically high rate, said Michael Heller, an industry consultant.
 As those practices spread, they are creating a rift between the lenders and some of their more lucrative customers, according to cardholders, current and former bank consultants and regulators who were interviewed for a joint report by The New York Times and ''Frontline,'' the PBS documentary program.
 People like Mr. Schwebel, who carry balances from month to month and pay finance charges regularly, feel they should be the favored customers of the credit card business, which is now the most lucrative segment of banking. They make up the profitable majority of the 144 million Americans who have general-purpose credit cards. To a degree, they subsidize the 40 percent of credit card customers who pay in full each month without incurring any fees or charges. 
 But increasingly, they say, what should be a warm embrace has turned into a painful squeeze as lenders employ new tactics to extract more and bigger penalties for even the slightest financial transgressions. In the last few years, lenders have more frequently raised customers' rates because of slip-ups elsewhere, like late payment of a phone or utility bill, or simply because they felt a customer had taken on too much debt. 
 The practice, called universal default, started after a rash of bankruptcy filings in the mid-to-late 1990's and has increasingly become standard in the industry. While MBNA declined to comment on any specific customer's account, its general counsel, Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, said in a statement that it was being prudent by raising rates when it had reason to think the risk of not being repaid had increased.
 Edward L. Yingling, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association, said bankers must have the flexibility to change terms on short notice. The bankruptcy filings of the 90's -- many by customers who had been paying their bills on time -- caught banks off-guard, he said. 
 Lenders decided they needed to watch for signs of trouble elsewhere, like missed car payments, he said. In those cases, he added, there are only two logical responses: ''We're not going to let you have this credit card loan anymore and we're going to say, 'Pay it off,' or we can say, 'You're now more risky; we're going to raise your rate.''' 
 Still, some critics say the severity of the punishment does not match the risk of default. The suddenness and perceived unfairness of the penalties have left many consumers feeling burned by lenders who relentlessly courted them with promises of low rates. 
 To some cardholders and consumer advocates, credit card companies are acting like modern-day loan sharks, strong-arming their customers to pay more -- with no legal limit on how much they can charge.
 In eight years, the major card companies have increased the fee charged to cardholders for being even an hour late with a payment to $39, from $10 or less.

Unleashing an Industry
 Duncan MacDonald, who, as a lawyer for Citibank was involved in its successful case for deregulation of fees before the United States Supreme Court in 1996, now says he fears that he helped to unleash a monster.
 Until that ruling, most banks still charged an annual fee of about $25 for the use of a card and a single fixed rate to all borrowers, usually around 18 percent. Applicants either qualified for the privilege of carrying a card or they did not.
 ''I certainly didn't imagine that someday we might've ended up creating a Frankenstein,'' said Mr. MacDonald, who predicted that the penalty fees could rise to $50 in another year. ''I look at that and I say to myself, 'Is $50 a fair fee, plus a 25 percent interest rate and all these other fees that are thrown on, for folks who are probably not that risky? Is that fair?'''
 Mr. MacDonald said federal bank regulators should investigate the fairness of universal default and some of the banks' harsh penalties. But regulators and lawmakers have been reluctant to crack down on a popular consumer product that fuels America's economic engine. Consumer spending pulled the country through the last economic downturn, powered largely by purchases financed with debt, to the tune of $2 trillion.
 Few consumer products today are as cherished or reviled as credit cards. The typical household has eight cards with $7,500 on them. People like Mr. Schwebel are known as ''revolvers'' in the industry because they roll balances over from month to month, never paying in full. 
 Without the 85 million Americans who revolve, card issuers would be struggling to please their investors. But with them and the hefty finance charges they accrue from the moment cashiers swipe their cards, the industry is reaping record gains. Last year, card issuers made $2.5 billion a month in profit before taxes. 
 ''I think it is generally understood that those that use the revolving part of the credit card are kind of the sweet spot,'' said Mr. Yingling of the bankers' association, who spoke on behalf of several of the biggest issuers, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and MBNA, all of which declined to make executives available for interviews.
 But the lenders' aggressive tactics have prompted a surge in complaints and lawsuits and even a warning from the primary regulator of national banks in September. In an advisory letter, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said banks should not raise card rates without having fully and prominently disclosed the circumstances that might cause an increase.
 The case that opened up the industry came in 1978 when the Supreme Court decided that a bank could charge its cardholders any rate allowed in the bank's home state. Major banks swiftly moved their credit card operations to places like South Dakota and Delaware that had removed caps on interest rates. There is no federal limit on consumer credit rates.

Changing the Terms
 After that ruling on interest rates, credit cards, which until then had generally been an uncertain business, started to look potentially lucrative. Banks began to innovate and compete. They cut the required minimum monthly payment to 2 percent of the balance, from 5 percent, to encourage customers to borrow more and stretch out the repayment. They dropped annual fees and dangled offers of low interest, or none at all, to lure new customers.
 At the same time, legal teams crafted contracts of 12 or more single-spaced pages that gave the banks the leeway to change their terms whenever they wanted. A typical term sheet for a Visa card issued by Bank One, which was acquired this year by J.P. Morgan Chase, includes: ''We reserve the right to change the terms at any time for any reason.''
 John Gould has worked in and around the credit card business for 25 years, but he said he was shocked when his wife tried to make a last-minute payment over the phone and was charged an extra $15.
 ''What a rip,'' he said. ''That does get me mad.''
 Fees like that are accounting for a greater share of the revenue that card companies garner from their customers. Last year, they collected $11.7 billion in penalty fees, more than half of the total $21.5 billion in fees they collected from cardholders, according to CardWeb, a research firm. 
 Mr. Gould, a former executive of MasterCard International who conducts research for TowerGroup, a company owned by MasterCard, said he did not think that card companies were trying to trap people into financial distress. But he said it was ''absurd'' that 44 percent of them tell their customers that they might be penalized for one or two late payments with maximum rates that now exceed 28 percent. 
 This practice has gone on while the short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve Board have been unusually low, now at 2 percent, he noted, but the rates have been rising in recent months.
 ''What are they going to do if we have a spike in interest rates?'' Mr. Gould said. ''What are they going to start charging people, 35 percent, 38 percent? If it comes to that, you might as well go to the loan sharks.''
 But Andrew Kahr, a financial services consultant who devised some widely used consumer-lending strategies, including the zero-percent teaser rates, said consumers should be able to recognize that the business is a ''game of chance.'' Interest rates shooting past 25 percent may seem scandalous to some, Mr. Kahr said, but they are ''no less realistic'' than the low introductory rates many cardholders receive.
 The lenders offer tantalizingly low initial rates because that is what it takes to lure customers from competitors, said Mr. Kahr, who was a founder and chief executive, until 1986, of the San Francisco lending company now known as Providian. After he left, Providian ran afoul of state and federal regulators for some of its credit card practices, and agreed to a $300 million settlement.
 But, he said that banks cannot earn an adequate return by lending for less than it costs them to borrow, so they look for ways to recoup losses on the low-rate chasers.
 ''They do better when they apply these price increases selectively to customers who statistically have become more risky, or to those who have violated the rules of the account,'' Mr. Kahr said.
 Still, some cardholders complain that they did not know the rules until after they were punished for breaking them. Linda Sherry, editorial director for Consumer Action, an advocacy group, said ''the consumer really has no rights to find out anything, to demand, 'Why is this being done to me?'''
 Last month, a consumer advocacy group in San Diego, the Utility Consumers' Action Network, filed suit against Discover Financial Services, the issuer of the Discover card, asserting that it had changed the rules late in the game. The group contends that a recent rewording of Discover's universal-default policy is unfair to consumers, especially those in difficult financial situations.
 The change, disclosed to cardholders in April, allowed Discover to raise the interest rate to 19.99 percent, from as low as zero, for a single late payment. But the infraction did not have to follow the revision, because Discover reserved the right to look back 11 months for a late payment that could justify the increase. 
 ''It has gotten to the point where the fine print is becoming almost outright abusive of their customers,'' said Michael Shames, executive director for the consumer group. ''The customers who are affected most by this practice are those who, for one reason or another, are having trouble making payments and have a large balance.''
 Jennifer Kang, a spokeswoman for Discover Financial, said she could not comment because of the pending litigation. Discover executives declined repeated requests for an interview.
 Mr. Heller of Argus Information & Advisory Services in White Plains, the industry analyst who has studied the rate of change in credit card terms, said that his research showed that in the first half of this year, MBNA -- the card issuer that doubled the interest rate for Mr. Schwebel, the Arizona engineer -- repriced a smaller share of its card accounts than the industry average.
 But MBNA, in the statement from Mr. Freeh, said: ''If we see indications that a customer is taking on too much debt, has missed or is late on payments to other creditors, or is otherwise mishandling their personal finances, it is not unreasonable to determine that this behavior is an increased risk. In the interest of all of our customers, we must protect the portfolio by adjusting a customer's rate to compensate for that increased risk.''

The Credit Score
 The interest rate on a credit card is theoretically correlated to the likelihood that a borrower will make good on his debts. Lenders typically measure those odds by a three-digit number known as a FICO score.
 Calculated by and short for the Fair Isaac Corporation, a company in Minneapolis, that score has become the most vital of statistics to many Americans. 
 Credit scores are used to determine everything from how much a person can borrow to how much he or she pays for life insurance to whether he or she can rent a home. A utility company in Texas even experimented last summer with using credit scores to set prices for electricity.
 The number crunchers at Fair Isaac do not make lending decisions. They simply take information collected by the three largest credit-reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, and apply mathematical formulas to boil it down to a single number on a scale that runs to 850. 
 ''Lenders use that score, almost like a thermometer, to determine if they're going to grant credit or not,'' said Tom Quinn, a spokesman for Fair Isaac. He estimated that his company had calculated a credit score for about 75 percent of American adults.
 The average FICO score is 720, he said. A score below 620 lands a consumer in the riskiest category, known as subprime, and virtually ensures the highest borrowing rates, if the consumer can obtain any credit at all. Credit reports generally note only those payments made at least 30 days late.
 Consumers with better-than-average scores are usually, but not always, eligible for the lowest rates. As Steve Strachan, a flower importer in York, Pa., learned, a relatively high credit score does not guarantee favorable terms.
 A thick credit report on Mr. Strachan from January showed a FICO score above 730, but by then he had already been through a battle with the issuer of a card that had once been his favorite method of payment.
 In the 1990's, Mr. Strachan traveled frequently from his home on the West Coast to Amsterdam and other foreign cities to meet with suppliers of tulips and exotic flower varieties that he distributed to domestic florists and wholesalers. He obtained a WorldPerks Visa card that rewarded him with seat upgrades through Northwest Airline's frequent-flier program.
 ''I used that card whenever I possibly could because of the travel benefits,'' he recalled, sitting in his living room before stacks of credit card bills, change-of-terms notices and other correspondence between him and several lenders. ''Never paid a penny of interest.''
 He was such a valued customer then, he said, that US Bank, which issued the card, had extended him a high credit limit of $54,000 even though the card rate was just one percentage point above the prime rate. When the economy wilted after the collapse of the stock market in early 2000, so did Mr. Strachan's business. He began using his credit lines on that Visa card and a few others to stay afloat, paying smaller portions of his growing balances.
 Then, in May of last year, US Bank sent Mr. Strachan a letter telling him that it planned to raise the card's rate to 20.21 percent, nearly quadrupling the existing rate of 5.25 percent. 
 ''I wasn't late, and I didn't go over the credit limit, and I didn't write bad checks,'' Mr. Strachan said. A representative of US Bank told him he was using too much of his available credit, he said.
 A US Bank spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Strachan's account.
 The monthly interest charge on his $50,000 balance jumped from $209 in June to $756 in July and $808 in August. He eventually persuaded the bank to restore the original rate, but the bank closed the account, shutting off a key source of credit.
 By then, Bank One, another creditor, had compounded Mr. Strachan's woes. He was carrying a balance of about $70,000 on one account when the bank started raising his rates, first to 19.99 percent in April 2003, then to 22.99 percent the next month, then to 24.99 percent in June. By October of last year, he was incurring a monthly finance charge of about $1,500 on a $77,000 balance.
 ''It was like they almost all had a little meeting in the back room and said, 'Let's get Strachan,''' he said of his creditors. ''How does it serve them to treat people like that? Are they trying to force them into bankruptcy?''
 Lawyers he consulted advised Mr. Strachan to take the easy -- and increasingly popular -- way out by filing for bankruptcy protection, but he refused. He is struggling to make good on his debts ''because I have principles and ethics.''
 But the battle to dig out of a deepening hole has taken a toll. Mr. Strachan said he had lost 30 pounds and described himself as a ''broken man.''
 Lately, he said, Bank One has periodically reduced his credit limit to a level just above his remaining balance, leaving him little margin for error. Some months, he said, if he were to pay only the minimum due, the ensuing finance charge would put his balance over the limit, triggering a penalty fee.
 By doing that, he said, ''They create their own little monster.''

The Regulators
 Consumer complaints prompted the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nationally chartered banks that constitute most of the major card issuers, to warn banks about giving fair notice of term changes and about sending out tempting offers to people who are unlikely to qualify for them.
 Julie Williams, the acting comptroller, said in an interview that as long as the lenders were not intentionally deceiving their customers, they were free to set whatever rates and fees their home states allow. If customers do not want to pay a particular rate, ''they have choice,'' she said. ''They can find another card.''
 But consumers clearly are unhappy with the choices they have. About 80,000 people lodged complaints with the comptroller's office last year. Ms. Williams said the largest single source of their ire was credit cards. Those complaints are routed to examiners who monitor the banks, she said, but the examiners' foremost concern is to make sure the banks are financially sound.
 Ms. Williams described her agency as a ''tough regulator,'' but critics contend that the comptroller's office has taken strong action against only one major issuer of credit cards in the last five years. In 2000, the O.C.C. joined in an investigation into Providian that had been started by the San Francisco district attorney's office.
 Providian customers complained that they had been hit with late fees for payments that had been sent in on time but not credited to their accounts for days or weeks. Some said the resultant penalties pushed them over their credit limits, leading to additional fees.
 Later, Ms. Williams said, the two agencies joined forces to extract $300 million in a settlement with Providian.
 The comptroller's office has since angered state attorneys general by trying to limit their ability to regulate how national banks behave in their states.
 Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, said his office gets ''thousands of complaints every year about credit card issues relating to the major banks, the major card issuers.'' But more often, he said, the banks' response has been that '''we don't need to deal with you because the O.C.C. has told us -- indeed, directed us -- not to deal with state enforcement entities.'''
 Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School who has been a vocal critic of consumer lenders, said the comptroller's office should do more than express discomfort with the practices of credit card companies, as it did in September. 
 The regulators did not say that ''those are unfair practices, they are unsafe and unsound and don't do them,'' Ms. Warren said. ''Instead, they said it's a problem. Look, if they think it's a problem, then tell the credit card companies to stop doing it.''

Guests have a choice of a green bean casserole that serves eight, cranberry chutney or a whole pumpkin pie. It's the Kick Them Off the Couch deal. Information: www.omnihotels.com.

IT DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OVER 15 -- While on the subject of California, the City of West Hollywood was officially incorporated 20 years ago in December. Nine hotels in the city are offering rates that they say are similar to those 20 years ago, along with a CD of hits from 1984, throughout most of the month. The Argyle, (800) 225-2637, has standard rooms for $159; at the Grafton on Sunset, (800) 821-3660, the first night is $149 and extra nights are $104.

Information: (800) 368-6020 or www.visitwesthollywood.com.

SAVING BY THE BARREL -- Travelers don't need an excuse for a hotel discount, but hotel marketing departments do. So the 183-room Loews Denver Hotel, through Feb. 28, has its Airline Fuel Surcharge Rebate. All guests who present airline ticket receipts with dates that correspond to their stay will receive a rebate equal to the price of a barrel of crude oil, based on the price on the first day of that month. A minimum two-night stay is required. Information: (800) 345-9172 or www.loewshotels.com/hotels/denver. The hotel is near the Cherry Creek shops.

A FLIGHT AND TWO NIGHTS -- For purchases made through Nov. 23, British Airways will provide two nights in a central London hotel with a round-trip economy-class ticket to London.

The hotels are in the three- or four-star category, and include the Royal National, Corus Hyde Park, Jurys Inn Chelsea, Gresham and Central Park. Continental breakfast is included. For information, call up www.britishairways.com.

CHICAGO FOR SALE -- This is for fans of Chicago who think they know how to snag bargains at auctions. From Dec. 2 to 16, the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs will stage a charity auction on eBay that will feature hotel accommodations and theater tickets. Hotels that will have rooms up for bid include the Allegro, the Fitzpatrick, the Peninsula, the Whitehall and the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower.

HEADLINE: When Long Hours at a Video Game Stop Being Fun

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail:ddomain@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CHARLES DICKENS himself would shudder, I should think, were he to see the way young adults are put to work in one semimodern corner of our economy. Gas lamps are long gone, and the air is free of soot. But you can't look at a place like Electronic Arts, the world's largest developer of entertainment software, and not think back to the early industrial age when a youthful work force was kept fully occupied during all waking hours to enrich a few elders.
 Games for video consoles and PC's have become a $7 billion-a-year business. Based in Redwood City, Calif., Electronic Arts is the home of the game franchises for N.F.L. football, James Bond and ''Lord of the Rings,'' among many others. For avid players with professional ambitions to develop games, E.A. must appear to be the best place in the world. Writing cool games and getting paid to boot: what more could one ask?
 Yet there is unhappiness among those who are living that dream. Based on what can be glimpsed through cracks in E.A.'s front facade, its high-tech work force is toiling like galley slaves chained to their benches. 
 The first crack opened last summer, when Jamie Kirschenbaum, a salaried E.A. employee, filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, accusing it of failure to pay overtime compensation. He remains at the company, so I spoke with him by phone last week to get an update. He told me that since joining E.A. in June 2003 in the image production department, he has been working -- at the company's insistence -- around 65 hours a week, spread over six or seven days. Putting in long hours is what the industry calls ''crunching.'' Once upon a time, the crunch came in the week or two before shipping a new release. Mr. Kirschenbaum's experience, however, has been a continuous string of crunches.
 Crunches also once were followed by commensurate periods of time off. Mr. Kirschenbaum reports, however, that E.A. has scaled back informal comp time, never formally codified, to a token two weeks per project. He said his own promised comp time had disappeared altogether. At this point, he said he would be glad to enjoy a Labor Day without laboring, or eat a Fourth of July spread at some place other than his cubicle, pleasures he has not enjoyed for two years. The company said it had no comment on the lawsuit, but it is likely to argue that Mr. Kirschenbaum's image production position is exempt from the laws governing overtime compensation.
 A few days ago, another crack opened -- one large enough to fit a picture window. An anonymous writer who signed herself as ''E.A. Spouse'' posted on the Web a detailed account of hellish employer-mandated hours reaching beyond 80 hours a week for months. No less remarkable were the thousands of comments that swiftly followed in online discussion forums for gamers and other techies, providing volumes of similar stories at E.A. and at other game developers.
 I learned the identity of the E.A. employee described in the anonymous account and spoke at length with him in person late one night, adding a third shift to the day's double that he'd already worked. He seemed credible in all respects, in his command of technical detail, in his unshakable enthusiasm for the games he works on -- and in his pallor. 
 For around $60,000 a year in an area with a high cost of living, he had been set to work on a six-day-a-week schedule. On weekdays, his team worked from 9 to 10 (that is, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.), and on Saturdays, a half-day (that means 9 to 6). Then Sundays were added -- noon to 8 or 10 p.m. The weekly total was 82 to 84 hours.
 By tradition, Silicon Valley employers have always offered their bleary-eyed employees lottery tickets in the form of stock options. E.A.'s option grants, however, offer little chance of a Google-like bonanza. An employee who started today with an options package like that of the E.A. worker just described (and who stayed with the company the four years required to fully vest) would get $120,000, for example, if the share price quadrupled -- and proportionally less for more modest increases. The odds of a skyrocketing stock grew much longer this month, when the company said competition had forced it to cut prices on core sports titles.
 Still, the company is a generous warden: free laundry service, free meals, free ice cream and snacks. The first month, the E.A. employee recalled, he and his colleagues were delighted by the amenities. But he said they soon came to feel that seeing the sun occasionally would have had more of a tonic effect.
 This employee, who has not had a single day off in two months, is experienced in the game software business. But he said he had never before had to endure a death-march pace that begins many months before the beta testing phase that precedes the release of a project.
 Jeff Brown, a company spokesman, declined to comment on E.A. Spouse's allegations. Mr. Brown did say that the company was interested in its employees' opinions, as illustrated by its employee survey, conducted every two years. This suggests that it needs to conduct a survey to learn whether a regular routine of 80-hour weeks is popular among the salaried rank and file.
 Asked about reports of employees working long, uncompensated hours, Mr. Brown responded that ''the hard work'' entailed in writing games ''isn't unique to E.A.'' He is correct; smaller studios demand it, too. The International Game Developers Association conducted an industrywide ''quality of life'' survey this year documenting that ''crunch time is omnipresent.'' The study urged readers to tell ''the young kids just starting out'' in the industry to reject the hours that lock them into ''an untenable situation once they start wanting serious relationships and families.''
 Electronic Arts' early history has none of the taint of present labor practices, and many who are acquainted with the old E.A. and the new E.A. have publicly lamented in Web forums the disappearance of the generosity practiced by Trip Hawkins, who founded the company in 1982. Mr. Hawkins, who has not been associated with E.A. for many years, said that he was not surprised by E.A. Spouse's story. He called today's E.A. a corporate ''Picture of Dorian Gray,'' its attractive surface hiding a not-so-attractive reality. 
 INDEED, E.A. is noticeably young in appearance. After Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, spent a sabbatical last spring as a researcher at the company, he wrote, ''I am 43 and I felt absolutely ancient during my time there.'' He said the place felt to him like ''Logan's Run,'' the 1976 science fiction movie in which no one is allowed to live past 30 -- and he felt even older when he realized that the 20-somethings were too young to know the reference. 
 The company has 3,300 employees in its studios developing game titles, and it hires 1,000 new people a year. (Company officials said voluntary turnover is about 10 percent annually.) In the past, it has hired only about 10 percent of new studio personnel directly from college; it has set a goal of increasing that to 75 percent, which would skew the median age still younger. 
 Professor Pausch listed cost savings from lower salaries as one reason E.A. wishes to shift hiring to a younger group. The company also recognizes that fresh graduates are the most suggestible; Professor Pausch said he heard managers say that ''young kids don't know what's impossible.'' That, however, they will learn when they get their schedules.

HEADLINE: States Trying New Tactics to Reduce Spending on Drugs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
Alarmed at soaring pharmaceutical costs, states are trying a wide range of new tactics to curb spending on prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients, public employees, prisoners and other residents, bringing them into lobbying combat with the drug industry. 
 A dozen states have joined purchasing pools in an attempt to use market power to reduce costs. Dozens more are requiring Medicaid recipients to use generic or lower-priced drugs from preferred lists.
 Worries about pharmaceutical costs have risen so high in West Virginia that the governor called a special session of the Legislature this week to consider legislation that authorizes a single state coordinator to negotiate deep discounts on drugs purchased for virtually all the state's insurance and health care programs. The measure passed unanimously. 
 And in one of the more innovative programs, Oregon and 11 other states have joined in an ambitious effort to compare the safety and effectiveness of hundreds of drugs. Medicaid officials steer doctors and patients away from costly drugs found to have no proven clinical advantage over cheaper products. 
 The West Virginia plan is considered the most comprehensive of its kind, potentially covering more than a third of West Virginia's 1.8 million residents, including prisoners, veterans, state employees and disabled workers. Private employers and individuals could join the state's drug-purchasing pool in the future.
 ''No other state has gone this far,'' said John Luehrs, who works on state prescription drug policies for AARP, the lobby for older Americans.
 In addition, many states have filed lawsuits against drug manufacturers, saying they defrauded state Medicaid programs by charging inflated prices. Attorney General Jim Petro of Ohio, a Republican, has filed six such suits this year, including one this week asserting that a manufacturer had charged the state up to four times as much as it charged wholesalers for certain drugs.
 Drug companies are fighting most of the state initiatives, which they say will deny patients access to valuable treatments.
 States will be the main arena for lobbying battles over drug prices because Congress is not expected to do much more with the issue next year. 
 ''My sense is that Congress is not coming back to this for a while, but the problem hasn't gone away,'' said Gov. Bob Wise of West Virginia, a Democrat who pushed the drug purchasing program. ''So now it is being fought out in 50 state capitals.''
 Medicaid spending, which increased almost 50 percent in the last four years, is among the fastest growing items in state budgets, and drug spending is one of the fastest growing components of Medicaid. 
 ''Sixty percent of our cost increases in any year are tied to drug spending increases -- not just higher prices, but also higher utilization,'' said Anne Marie Murphy, the Medicaid director in Illinois.
 A recent report from the nation's governors and state budget officers said Medicaid spending this year would, for the first time, exceed state spending on elementary and secondary education, forcing cutbacks in welfare and other programs.
 ''This is rising higher on states' agendas,'' Mr. Luehrs said. ''State officials are confronting some very serious budget problems, and one thing that sticks out is the cost of prescription drugs.''
 Cost-control policies, tested in a few states, spread quickly. Most states -- 37 at last count -- now require that generic drugs be dispensed to Medicaid recipients if they are available. 
 ''This is a safe approach to lowering drug costs,'' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ''Generics, on average, cost 70 percent less than brand-name drugs.''
 Many states have joined purchasing pools to obtain lower prices. One group, led by West Virginia, is buying drugs for public employees and retirees in five states. Another group, led by Michigan and Vermont, is buying drugs for Medicaid recipients in eight states, with encouragement from the Bush administration.
 And more than 30 states have established lists of preferred drugs for Medicaid recipients. In many cases, doctors can prescribe other drugs, but need permission from the state to do so. Drug makers typically offer discounts and price concessions in return for having their drugs included on these lists. In West Virginia, officials intend to create a single preferred drug list, not just for Medicaid, but for all state agencies. 
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies, has unsuccessfully challenged these lists in court. ''We get very concerned when government bureaucrats limit access to drugs for Medicaid recipients, who are far more vulnerable than most patients,'' said Wanda Moebius, a spokesman for the organization.
 The Oregon-based project, comparing drugs used to treat the same illness, will help officials manage more than $30 billion a year in drug spending in 12 states, including Arkansas, Michigan, Missouri and North Carolina. AARP and Consumers Union support the project, which is coordinated by former Gov. John A. Kitzhaber and the Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland.
 George L. Oestreich, director of the Medicaid pharmacy program in Missouri, said the studies provided ''unbiased evidence'' that the state used in deciding which drugs to recommend in each therapeutic class. 
 The Food and Drug Administration can approve a drug if it is safe and effective, but does not usually ask whether the drug is safer and more effective than the alternatives. 
 In the Oregon project, state officials begin their work with an exhaustive review of all published medical and scientific evidence on drugs in a particular class.
 Dr. John S. Santa, medical director for the project, said, ''In most of the 15 drug classes reviewed to date, we found no evidence that one drug was more effective than others intended to treat the same illness.''
 In such cases, state Medicaid officials often decide to recommend the lowest-price drugs. But if the expert reviewers find that one drug is more effective than the alternatives, state officials often allow doctors to prescribe it, even when it costs more.
 Ms. Moebius, the spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, criticized the state initiative. ''The idea of evidence-based medicine has been around for years,'' she said. ''But it's been distorted in Oregon so that it's based more on economics than on evidence.''
 Oregon invited Pfizer to submit a dossier of evidence on Zoloft, its widely used antidepressant, but the company declined to do so.
 ''We are unwilling to engage in a process designed to disguise cost containment initiatives as credible scientific analyses,'' said Dr. Lisa Egbuonu-Davis, a vice president of Pfizer. State officials have a financial interest in limiting access to medicines, she said in a letter to the Oregon reviewers.
 Experts from Oregon and other states have reviewed 15 classes of drugs and plan to review at least 10 more.
 Dr. Santa, medical director for the project, said state reviewers detected evidence of safety problems with Vioxx, the arthritis and pain medication, two years ago. As a result, he said, Oregon Medicaid officials decided to exclude it from their list of preferred drugs. 
 Merck announced on Sept. 30 that it would stop selling Vioxx because a study had shown that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in some patients. 
 The Oregon project reviewed five heartburn and ulcer drugs, but did not find enough evidence to conclude that one was better than the others. One of the drugs, Prilosec, is available without a prescription for about $20 a month, whereas the other drugs often cost more than $100 a month.
 James N. Gardner, an Oregon lawyer for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the state's evaluations were severely flawed. When state officials find no evidence that one drug is superior, he said, they make the mistake of concluding that all drugs in that class are equivalent.
 But, Mr. Gardner insisted, ''the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of the absence of any difference in clinical effectiveness.''
 West Virginia has moved aggressively to hold down drug prices because its finances have been strained by skyrocketing Medicaid and workers compensation costs, and because it has one of the nation's oldest and poorest populations.
 According to a recent study by Boston University's School of Public Health, West Virginians spend a larger share of their personal income on prescription drugs -- 3 percent -- than people in any other state except Tennessee.
 Governor Wise, who will leave office in January, warned that tougher measures may lie ahead if the industry attempts to oppose the state's cost containment measures.
 ''I would argue that if the industry can't work within this model,'' Mr. Wise said, ''then many states will come through with more severe measures, including price controls.''

HEADLINE: 'This City Is a Monster'

BYLINE: By JAVIER F.; As told to Seth Kugel, who translated from the Spanish

 BODY:
NOTHING happened in my life for three years. Then, in 10 days, everything happened.
 One night, I was at a nightclub in La Rioja, the kind of place with a lot of drugs and a lot of people who you weren't quite sure how they made a living, when someone called me a drug addict in front of my girlfriend. So I punched him. It turned out he was a powerful drug dealer whose uncle was a judge. The police came after me, and suddenly, La Rioja became very small. 
 Meanwhile, a Brazilian woman I had dated during vacations in high school had tracked me down from New York. At the same time, the Argentine economy was headed toward another macabre collapse. With the help of a friend who had worked in the state intelligence service, I escaped from La Rioja in a black car, just like in the movies, went back to my hometown, Cordoba, and arranged to come to New York. Ten days after Sept. 11, 2001, I moved in with my old Brazilian girlfriend in Sunnyside, Queens. Even though I was undocumented, she got me an $8-an-hour job in the cafe where she worked. 
 It happened so suddenly, I hadn't considered the adjustments I would have to make. Before I left, a friend asked me, ''Javier, how's your English?'' I told him I had studied it for three years in high school. ''House,'' ''dog,'' that was about the extent of my vocabulary. When I got here and started working in the cafe, people would ask me, ''Can I have a Coke?'' and I would think, ''What in the world is this guy talking about?''
 But language was the least of it. I was 32 years old, already a mature adult. Here, life was full of incoherencies. I needed a dictionary to translate the culture of New York City. I was essentially reborn with a blank slate, and now, three years later, I am barely starting to speak. 
 One of my first tasks was to adjust to the American workplace. One day when I was working the counter at the cafe, a man complained that his table was dirty. In Argentina, I would have gone and cleaned it -- we're used to multitasking. But someone in line said to me, ''That's not your job.'' So I didn't do it. I guess I should have called the Department of Table Cleaning to take care of it.
 After a few months at the cafe, I was named assistant manager -- my first promotion. After a year and a half, I became the manager. But still, not everything made sense. Take that truly American word that says so much about life here: networking. To me, it is an absurd concept. In Argentina, such things happen spontaneously. I go to a barbecue, I meet someone. A party is a party. Here, networking is like going fishing.
 Eight months ago, I went to a networking party. The conversations went like this: ''Hi, what do you do?'' 
 ''I sell shoes.''
 ''Oh, I do Web design.'' 
 You exchange cards and go on to the next person. Ridiculous. But afterward, I made a business card, just in case. To be prepared.
 There were also differences I liked: I found that New Yorkers smile a lot. In Argentina, people's bitterness is visible in their faces. If you go downtown, you have to avoid people who hate their jobs, who are broke, whose children are sick but the social security system doesn't cover them. Here, people smile at you. It's normal. It's polite. Before I understood this, a woman would smile at me in the cafe and I would immediately think I should ask for her telephone number. I was an Adonis. 
 Another thing that surprised me was that when I started to explore New York, I found that this city is a monster. It's transitory, so making friends is very difficult. It's unforgiving: you leave your car at a meter for three minutes too long, you get a ticket. On the other hand, there are unlimited possibilities. Here, even I can afford to go out and spend $20 every night. If I told that to my friends in Argentina, they'd say: ''Wow, this guy, what a marvelous life he leads!'' Because even if they have money, they don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
 After these three years, I'm a different person. I have learned to be more private about my personal life, like an American. Still, I will never completely adapt. For example, the idea of a stranger as your roommate doesn't exist in Argentina, but that's what I have here. 
 After I broke up with my Brazilian girlfriend, I moved in with a Uruguayan. Three months ago, I needed a new place and found someone on Craigslist. This time, it was an American. We've been living together for a month and a half, and we still haven't gone out for a drink. It's tough to break the ice. One day, I asked him, ''What are you doing tonight?''
 ''I'm going to see some musician friends play in a recital,'' he said. ''And you?''
 Great, I thought, he's going to invite me along. ''Oh, nothing,'' I said.
 ''O.K., see you later.'' Then he was gone.
 But that kind of thing seems minor compared to the cultural and economic obstacles of being undocumented. At first, I got around things. I managed to get a driver's license before my tourist visa ran out, but only with the help of my girlfriend. I work without any kind of health insurance, but take vitamins every day to be like a bull, and have not had to go to the doctor. 
 Still, once you reach a certain level, you realize that the next job up is only for Americans. And even the job you have is unstable. The cafe where I work changed ownership seven months ago, and the good will I had built up with my old bosses vanished. They deduct taxes from my salary, and since I can't file for a refund, I end up paying much more than legal workers. If they need to, they make me work for no pay on my day off. But there is a line of 10 people waiting to take my job, so I swallow my pride. 
 Then a few days ago, my boss said he was cutting my salary 41 percent. So I now make less than when I got here, and I do triple the work. I am letting my roommate know I have to move out soon; I can't afford the rent. I am angry and am losing hope. Logically, working hard should lead to a better life, but it doesn't. 
 I don't want to go back to Argentina; I may move to the small basement apartment of a friend in Jamaica, Queens. It's far, and though it's cheaper, I'm going to have to get a second job just to afford the rent. But at least maybe, once in a while, we'll get together for a drink.

HEADLINE: The Four-More-Years Portfolio: How to Narrow the Field

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE people have spoken. And on Wall Street, where money talks, the election results may resonate for the next four years. While myriad factors influence share prices, many investors believe that Republican control of the White House and Congress will affect the prospects of certain companies and industries.
 But which ones? Fund managers, stock analysts and portfolio strategists often mention health care, financial services, energy and military contracting among the areas that will benefit most if President Bush's economic and political agenda is carried out fully. But opinions can vary widely about the segments within each broad sector -- not to mention the specific companies -- that offer the best opportunities. And experts point out that there is no way to be certain which proposals will be enacted, or what their impact will be. 
 Certain types of energy stocks are included in many four-more-years portfolios. Investors generally express no great affection for the major international, diversified energy companies, partly because so many of their operations are in the Middle East.
 Jonathan Golub, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management who specializes in American stocks, prefers companies that do business closer to home, especially ones involved in drilling in Alaska or off the coast of Mexico. ''We would expect energy companies leveraged to a policy of expanding production of North American oil to do well,'' Mr. Golub said. Some examples are Transocean, Noble and Halliburton.
 Gil Knight, senior fund manager at Gartmore Global Investors near Philadelphia, also favors companies that focus on finding and extracting oil. ''The attitude toward drilling and exploration is going to be positive in the next four years,'' he said. Mr. Knight said he did not expect crude oil prices to remain near their recent peaks, but he predicted that ''prices will be high enough to make it worth drilling'' new fields.
 Mr. Knight named Halliburton and other leading drilling businesses like Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and BJ Services as likely beneficiaries of expanded exploration programs. His firm holds Schlumberger and BJ Services in its portfolios.
 Jerome Booth, research director at Ashmore Investment Management, a firm in London that invests primarily in emerging markets, follows countries, not companies. He anticipates strength for the financial markets of oil-exporting nations that offer alternative sources of crude to the Middle East.
 ''Oil states generally will benefit from Bush,'' Mr. Booth said. ''I would hope that he gives a clear sense that he wants to build a reliable supply of oil outside the Middle East.'' He advised investors to ''definitely'' include Russia in a four-more-years portfolio, and he finds Mexico a good bet, too.
 When it comes to the administration's domestic agenda, John Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investment Management, said, ''The market's going to pay attention to two things: tax cuts and Social Security reform.''
 Preserving the reduction of dividend tax rates to a maximum of 15 percent, enacted during Mr. Bush's first term, could lift share prices of utilities like Duke Power and the Southern Company, Mr. Lynch said.
 Overhauling Social Security, of course, is extremely contentious politically, but if there are changes that give more control over investment of government retirement funds to individuals, a windfall may accrue to firms that give financial advice, he said. Mr. Lynch prefers to bet on such an outcome through ''bigger names within the financial service industry,'' including Citigroup, Bank of America and American Express, all of which Evergreen holds in its portfolios, along with Duke and Southern.
 He added that an expansion of private saving vehicles could give a significant lift to stocks in general by funneling an estimated $150 billion to $200 billion annually into the market that otherwise would go into Treasury bonds -- the instruments in which the Social Security fund is primarily kept.
 By contrast, Mr. Golub said, bond investors might suffer because the fiscal deficit might have to widen to finance the initial shift to private saving plans. That could also be a result of an extension of the tax cuts of the president's first term.
 ''A natural outcome is higher interest rates,'' Mr. Golub said.
 He acknowledged that revamping of Social Security would not be easy. But he advised investors who were eager to gain from any reorganization to buy shares in firms with heavy concentrations in asset management -- like T.Rowe Price and Mellon Financial, which owns the Dreyfus funds -- instead of more diversified firms.
 ''If you bought Citigroup, their mutual fund business would get a bit overshadowed in the mix,'' he said. His firm holds T.Rowe Price as well as the other stocks he recommends. 
 Mr. Knight, at Gartmore, takes a more ecumenical view on financial services. He likes asset managers, including Price, BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, but also diversified businesses like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
 He also favors a variety of military and security companies, including aerospace leaders like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines.
 Mr. Knight also selected two producers of software and other equipment used in security systems: CACI and L-3 Communications. Citing L-3's surveillance technology, he said, ''As long as terrorism is out there, there's going to be a lot more money spent on homeland defense.'' Gartmore holds L-3 as well as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies.
 He also named a company whose output is less sophisticated but packs a big punch: Alliant Techsystems. ''These little fellows are the largest producer of small-arms ammunition'' for the United States military, Mr. Knight said. Alliant also makes rocket warheads and motors. ''We expect a lot from this company,'' he said.
 Mr. Golub said that companies providing managed health care, like WellPoint Health Networks and Humana, would fare better under President Bush than they would have if Senator John Kerry had won the election. The same is true for large drug companies, he said. But he cautioned that he was not offering a strong endorsement of either sector.
 Greater regulation of the sector might be ahead, he said. But the industries are likely to have a larger say in it under the Republicans. 
 ''It's no longer a matter of whether there will be price controls,'' Mr. Golub said, ''but what they will look like.''
 Health care stocks had been depressed before the election, but they surged after Mr. Bush won. Mr. Knight said he was wary of them after their ''huge run.''
 ONE company that might hold more promise for investors, he said, is Thomas Nelson, whose business dovetails with a core theme of the Bush presidency: Nelson is the world's largest publisher of bibles in English.
 Its earnings have grown at a compounded annual rate of 18 percent over the last five years -- a generally difficult period in which to make money, Mr. Knight noted. With the stock selling at 22 times analysts' estimate of 2005 earnings, it now looks cheap, he said.
 After an election in which faith and morality were important issues, the stock could rate a buy, based on values as well as valuation.
 ''If you believe the president has a mandate, there could be interest in it,'' Mr. Knight said.

HEADLINE: Postcards From Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Of all the images I saw on a short visit to Iraq last week, two stand out in my mind. One was a display that the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, in the Sunni Triangle, prepared for the visiting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Myers. It was a table covered with defused roadside bombs made from cellphones wired to explosives. You just call the phone's number when a U.S. vehicle goes by and the whole thing explodes. The table was full of every color and variety of cellphone-bomb you could imagine. I thought to myself that if there is a duty-free electronics store at the gates of hell, this is what the display counter looks like. 
 The other scene was a briefing by Lt. Gen. John Sattler, the Marine commander in Falluja. General Sattler was explaining how well the Marines, Army, Air Force and Navy Seabees had worked together in Falluja as a combined task force. As General Sattler was speaking, I looked around at the assembled soldiers in the room. It was a Noah's Ark of Americans: African-Americans and whites, Hispanic Americans and Asians, and men and women I am sure of every faith. The fact that we can take for granted the trust among so many different ethnic groups, united by the idea of America -- and that the biggest rivalry between our Army and Navy is a football game -- is the miracle of America. That miracle, and its importance, hits you in the face in Iraq when someone tells you that the ''new'' Iraqi police unit in a village near Falluja is staffed by one Iraqi tribe and the ''new'' National Guard unit is staffed by another tribe and they are constantly clashing.
 What unites these two scenes is the obvious fact, which still bears repeating, that we are trying to plant the seeds of decent, consensual government in some very harsh soil. We are not doing nation building in Iraq. That presumes that there was already a coherent nation there and all that is needed is a little time and security for it to be rebuilt. We are actually doing nation creating. We are trying to host the first attempt in the modern Arab world for the people of an Arab country to, on their own, forge a social contract with one another. Despite all the mistakes made, that is an incredibly noble thing. But for Iraqis to produce such a social contract, such a constitution, requires a minimum of tolerance and respect for majority rights and minority rights -- and neither of those is the cultural norm here. They are not in the drinking water.
 I have been to this play before, though. Fifteen years ago I wrote a book about the Arab-Israel conflict, including a chapter on the Marines in Beirut in 1982. I called that chapter ''Betty Crocker in Dante's Inferno.'' It was my way of expressing the contrast between the truly pure intentions of those Marines trying to refashion Lebanon into a more decent, democratic polity and the harsh soil that was Lebanon of that day. 
 Cultures can change, though. But it takes time. And, be advised, it is going to take years to produce a decent outcome in Iraq. But every time I think this can't work, I come across something that suggests, who knows, maybe this time the play will end differently. The headlines last week were all about Falluja. But maybe the most important story in Iraq was the fact that while Falluja was exploding, 106 Iraqi parties and individuals registered to run in the January election. And maybe the second most important story is the relatively quiet way in which Iraqis, and the Arab world, accepted the U.S. invasion of Falluja. The insurgents there had murdered hundreds of Iraqi Muslims in recent months, and, I think, they lost a lot of sympathy from the Arab street. (But if we don't get the economy going on the Iraqi street, what the rest of the Arab world thinks will be of no help.)
 Readers regularly ask me when I will throw in the towel on Iraq. I will be guided by the U.S. Army and Marine grunts on the ground. They see Iraq close up. Most of those you talk to are so uncynical -- so convinced that we are doing good and doing right, even though they too are unsure it will work. When a majority of those grunts tell us that they are no longer willing to risk their lives to go out and fix the sewers in Sadr City or teach democracy at a local school, then you can stick a fork in this one. But so far, we ain't there yet. The troops are still pretty positive. 
 So let's thank God for what's in our drinking water, hope that maybe some of it washes over Iraq, and pay attention to the grunts. They'll tell us if it's time to go or stay.

HEADLINE: Allison Heilborn, Jaseung Coue

 BODY:
Allison Diana Heilborn, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George H. Heilborn of Ridgewood, N.J., was married yesterday to Jaseung Coue, a son of Mr. and Mrs. 
Dalheue Coue of Seoul, South Korea. The Rev. George W. Rutler performed the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Savior in New York.

HEADLINE: Pledging Assets For a Down Payment

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
IT is said that the best way to get a loan is to convince the lender that you don't need it. So it makes sense that some investment companies offer 100 percent mortgages to buyers who have enough money invested to serve as collateral for what would otherwise be a down payment.
 While such loans, called pledged asset mortgages, have been around for a while, mortgage experts say that optimistic hopes for the stock market may increase their popularity. Those same experts say, however, that while pledged asset mortgages may be good for some, they carry risks and are not suitable for all. 
 Richard Musci, chief lending products officer for Charles Schwab Bank, said in a press release introducing the company's pledged asset mortgage that his company was responding to clients who want to buy a home ''without having to liquidate assets and alter their investment strategy.''
 Schwab's program is similar to pledged asset programs offered by other lenders. A borrower who has liquid investments like stocks, bonds and certificates of deposit can pledge those investments as collateral for the cash down payment typically required for a mortgage. With Schwab, the borrower must have liquid assets of at least $250,000 and can pledge no more than 60 percent of their total assets as collateral.
 Other lenders have different requirements. Under Fannie Mae's pledged asset program, if a borrower -- or a family member of a borrower -- pledges a certificate of deposit for at least 5 percent of the sale price, the borrower can get 100 percent financing on a single-family residence. 
 Anthony B. Sanders, professor of finance at Ohio State University, said that with a regular mortgage, a larger down payment generally means a better interest rate. In addition, a down payment of less than 20 percent usually requires the purchase of private mortgage insurance to make the lender more comfortable about making the loan.
 But buyers whose assets are tied up in investments may not want to liquidate those investments to come up with a cash down payment. For one, capital gains taxes may have to be paid if the investments have appreciated. In addition, the buyer may believe that the investments will produce a greater rate of return than the home will. So instead of cashing in the investments, a borrower can use them as collateral for what would otherwise be a down payment.
 Holden Lewis, a financial writer for Bankrate.com, which specializes in finance and investments, offered an example. A person buying a $500,000 home might need a down payment of 30 percent, or $150,000, to get the best rate and also avoid paying for private mortgage insurance. But if that buyer had a significant amount of investments, she could pledge some as collateral for the $150,000 and get a mortgage for the entire $500,000. Since investment values fluctuate, the pledged amount includes a cushion. A lender might require pledged assets of 130 percent of the amount required for the down payment -- in this case $195,000 in assets. 
 Gail Liberman, a co-author of ''Rags to Retirement'' (Alpha, 2003), a book about investing, said there are risks with such mortgages. First, she said, the collateral is typically placed in an account maintained by the lender and cannot be sold without being replaced. Also, if the value declines, additional assets must replace the lost collateral. Most significantly, she said, if the value of the pledged assets cannot be maintained, the lender can foreclose.
 ''It's a double whammy,'' she said. ''You run the risk of losing not only your stock portfolio but also your most precious asset, your home.''

HEADLINE: This Is Horse Country

BYLINE: By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
WHEN Frank and Evelyn Cunningham bought an 87-acre former dairy farm in Salem in 1966 and began stabling a small herd of horses, their hunter-jumpers were a relatively uncommon sight in the small town.
 ''In the 60's, there were a number of dairy farms here,'' he said. ''There were no indoor riding arenas.''
 Times have changed in Salem. One of the town's last dairy farmers recently sold his herd of cows. But fields of grazing bays and buckskins are more plentiful, there are a number of local riding stables and the town is eager to attract more equine businesses, said Mr. Cunningham, who for many years worked as a farrier. 
 ''When I started shoeing horses in 1953, it was nothing like today,'' he said about the increase in the number of horses. ''In the last few years, it's really gone crazy.''
 Connecticut has been dairy farm country and cows used to dominate the rural landscape, but horses are about to take over. A census released this year by the United States Department of Agriculture reported that there were 4,191 farms in the state in 2002, down from 4,905 in 1997, and that the number of cows has fallen 21 percent, to about 54,000. A survey by the University of Connecticut that is expected to be released next month counted more than 47,000 horses. The university said that Connecticut already has the highest density of horses (one for every 68 people) in the country. 
 ''There are roughly 47,412, but we're probably missing some,'' Dr. Jenifer Nadeau, associate professor of animal science at UConn, said. ''I wouldn't be surprised if it was higher.''
 Those who study the state's equines said there are more first-time horse owners than ever and most of them earn only modest incomes, dispelling the perception that it is a rich person's hobby. Although the traditional hunt club has long been associated with some of the wealthier parts of the state, now there are businesses ranging from therapeutic riding stables to miniature horse breeding farms scattered throughout the state.
 Statistics on the horse population are not easy to come by, but various horse breed associations report an increase in their Connecticut registrations. The American Morgan Horse Association reports it had 1,378 registered Morgans in Connecticut in 1997 and now has about 2,760. The American Paint Horse Association shows it had 213 Connecticut members in 2003, while there were just 56 in 1993. The American Quarter Horse Association reports it had 3,946 registered Quarter Horses in Connecticut in 1998 and in 2003 had 4,029.
 Equine Affaire, a horse trade show that premiered in Ohio in 1994, has set up at the Eastern States Exposition grounds in West Springfield, Mass., which is just over the border, each November (this year's fair ended last Sunday) since 1998. Marci Young, marketing associate for the event, said attendance was less than 40,000 in 1998, but grew to 95,000 in 2003 (2004 figures were not available). She said most of those who attend are from Massachusetts and Connecticut.
 Bruce Gresczyk, commissioner of the state agriculture department, said considering that horses need feed, supplies such as saddles and other riding tack, veterinary care, farrier services, training and other services, horse owners contribute a significant amount to the economy.
 ''We know it's a pretty significant number, but it's hard to wrap your arms around it,'' he said. ''We know it keeps a lot of people working.''
 Towns, such as Salem, have recognized the economic impact of horse-related businesses.
 Larry Reitz, the first selectman of Salem, said the town's Economic Development Commission determined last year that equine-related businesses would be among the best types of development for the town to attract.
 ''We have a number of farms we'd like to preserve,'' he said. ''We don't think horses will bring a lot of dollars in and they probably are not a big tax benefit, but they might help us preserve some farms and some of the tax base we already have.''
 When Salem officials were studying economic development, they looked to Granby for guidance, a town that has a reputation as a horse friendly community, Mr. Reitz said. 
 Sally King, a member of the Granby Horse Council and a selectman there for more than a decade, said Granby's zoning regulations broadly define agriculture and make a point to encourage horse ownership.
 Granby's horse community is a microcosm of the state, Ms. King said. There are some very large farms and riding academies, including one of the largest horse dealers in New England. There also is a therapeutic stable for disabled riders, many recreational horse owners who have just one or two horses, as well as children who may own a 4-H project horse. 
 Once a week from May to October, groups of recreational riders play games on horseback, including rounding up cows into a pen. Every Wednesday afternoon, many riders head out on a group trail ride, she said.
 ''In Fairfield County, there are mainly show horses,'' she said. ''But here we are blessed with dedicated open space for trails. I can get on my horse in my backyard and go for three hours on various trails.''
 Ms. King, Ms. Nadeau and others said many recreational riders are middle-aged women who grew up dreaming of horse ownership and finally have the money and time to dedicate to making that dream a reality.
 The UConn survey bears this out.
 ''We found that 88 percent of the horse owners in Connecticut are women,'' Ms. Nadeau said. ''And 45 is the average age of owners. The number of first-time owners is on the rise.''
 Lisa Rosner, 45, an engineer who lives in Canterbury, said she has been horse crazy since she was a young child. She began taking riding lessons when she was about 8 years old and often worked in barns in exchange for riding time. When she graduated from college, she said, ''the first thing I wanted to do was buy a horse.''
 Now, she has four horses that she keeps on her 40-acre property, which is a former poultry farm. She trail rides and participates in Quarter Horse shows and riding competitions, she said.
 ''I see a real surge in adults coming into the sport,'' she said. ''There are a lot more people like me: It's either something they always dreamed about or wanted to do and then are finally able to do it.''
 Ms. Rosner and other horse owners estimated that it costs about $200 a month to provide a horse with such basics as food, veterinary care and shoes. Boarding costs in the state can range from a few hundred dollars a month into the thousands, depending on amenities such as indoor riding, heated stables and available trail networks.
 Ms. Nadeau said the UConn survey refutes the long-held belief that horse owners in the state are wealthy.
 ''We found the annual income of most owners is under $100,000,'' she said. ''Most of them are in the $50,000 to $99,990 range.''
 Mr. Cunningham, who is working to preserve his Salem property as a farm, said many people struggle to find ways to stay in the horse business out of love for equines.
 ''A lot of us aren't millionaires,'' he said. ''There's a lot of people mucking stalls, giving lessons and finding ways to be in it. They are in for a lifetime.''

HEADLINE: Rebels Keep Up Attacks In Sunni-Dominated Cities Of Central and North Iraq

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Robert F. Worth contributed reporting from Falluja for this article, Richard A. Oppel Jr. from Mosul and Khalid al-Ansary from Baghdad.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
Violence surged through central and northern Iraq on Saturday as a tenacious insurgency led by Sunni Arabs kept up relentless assaults in several major cities, including Baghdad, Ramadi and Falluja, which the Americans devastated during an intense weeklong offensive aimed at routing the insurgency.
 In the capital, insurgents armed with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades tried storming a police station at dawn in the northwestern neighborhood of Amariya, where American and Iraqi soldiers had engaged in a mosque shootout on Friday. The attack on the police station left three Iraqi policemen dead and two others wounded, said Col. Adnan Abdul-Rahman, an Interior Ministry spokesman. 
 Hours later, a car bomb exploded in downtown Baghdad, at the eastern end of the bridge over the Tigris River leading to the Green Zone, the fortified compound housing the American Embassy and the headquarters of the interim Iraqi government. The bomb was aimed at vehicles of a Western security contractor. At least one Iraqi was killed and another wounded, witnesses said.
 Four employees of the Public Works Ministry were gunned down from a passing car, and three Iraqi national guardsmen died in explosions in western Baghdad during gun battles with insurgents, Iraqi officials said. 
 An ambush on an American military convoy in central Baghdad ended with the death of one soldier, the military said. Nine others were wounded in what appeared to be a highly coordinated attack, with insurgents using explosives, automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Fighting raged in the rubble of Falluja. Two marines were killed and four wounded in an ambush on Friday in which an insurgent deceived the Americans by waving a white flag, military officials said Saturday. 
 The weeklong offensive, which began Nov. 8, smashed a haven for the insurgents, but guerrillas still roam the streets, sniping at American troops and deterring military engineers trying to rebuild the city.
 American commanders in Falluja say they are seeing an increasing number of guerrillas using white flags to pose as unarmed civilians.
 In a bit of positive news, a Polish woman abducted in October by insurgents announced her release to reporters in Warsaw in a brief news conference with the Polish prime minister, Marek Belka, broadcast by the BBC and CNN. 
 The woman, Teresa Borcz-Kalifa, 54, said her captors had treated her well. She is married to an Iraqi and had lived in Iraq for 30 years. Her captors made at least two videos that were shown on Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network, demanding the withdrawal of Polish troops. 
 The unrelenting wave of assaults in Sunni-dominated areas indicate that the attack on Falluja could have inflamed Sunni resentment against the American presence. 
 American and Iraqi officials have found it impossible in the 19 months since the invasion to persuade hostile Sunni Arabs to lay down their arms and engage in the emerging political system. 
 The Sunni Arabs, who make up a fifth of the population here, ruled the region known as modern Iraq for centuries, until the American invasion toppled Saddam Hussein. 
 Mr. Hussein, himself a Sunni, heightened ethnic and religious differences by installing Sunnis in the most senior positions and persecuting Shiite Arabs and Kurds. Now, with a power and security vacuum throughout Iraq, those tensions are reviving and threatening to unravel the very social fabric of the country.
 Sunni-dominated cities exploded during and immediately after the Falluja offensive. In April, when the Marines tried to take control of Falluja, thousands of unruly Shiites rose up also, led by the firebrand cleric Moktada al-Sadr. 
 During the more recent invasion, Mr. Sadr condemned the Americans' use of force but did not call on his militia to fight. These days, even radical Shiites appear ready to use legitimate politics to ensure that Shiites seize majority rule of the country. 
 The most restive areas in Iraq are in Anbar Province, including Ramadi and Falluja, and, in the north, Nineveh Province; its capital, Mosul, a city of two million, has become a second front of the insurgency.
 On Saturday, marines set up roadblocks around Ramadi, the capital of Anbar, and broadcast messages calling on residents to turn over ''terrorists,'' Reuters reported. The marines are engaged in a holding action there. They have a presence at the government center and several outposts downtown, but they do not have real control of the city. Insurgents operate freely and regularly murder residents they say are collaborating with the Americans or the interim Iraqi government.
 Senior American commanders believe that many guerrillas fled Falluja before the offensive and sought a haven in Ramadi, just 30 miles west, causing a spike in violence there.
 In Mosul, Iraq's third largest city, 225 miles north of Baghdad, nine bodies of Iraqi Army soldiers with bullet wounds to the head were discovered Saturday, said Lt. Col. Paul Hastings, an Army spokesman. Seven of those were also decapitated. On Thursday, he said, four headless bodies were found in eastern Mosul.
 The group of the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi posted an Internet message dated Thursday that said it had decapitated two Iraqi soldiers in public. At least one witness said that he saw the killings and that the bodies had been left in the street for hours because people had been afraid to collect them.
 American and Iraqi forces are trying to root out resilient insurgent bands in Mosul that pushed the city to the brink of chaos last week. On Nov. 11, groups of guerrillas stormed a half-dozen police stations and stole weapons and uniforms after setting fire to the buildings and squad cars. Only 800 of the city's 4,000 police officers stayed on the job.
 The Army of Ansar al-Sunna, one of the country's most militant groups, posted a message on the Internet on Saturday saying it had shot and killed two members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A video showed two gagged and blindfolded men being shot in the back of their heads, Reuters reported.
 The car bombing in Baghdad took place around 12:30 p.m., as a convoy of vehicles carrying Western security contractors drove near the Jumhuriya bridge. A suicide car bomber tried ramming into the convoy. The security contractors escaped, but an Iraqi man in a pickup truck behind the bomber was incinerated.
 Blackened bits of metal and glass lay scattered across the street, and the man's charred body could still be seen in the cab of the pickup.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about fighting in Iraq misstated the name of a northwestern neighborhood of Baghdad where insurgents attacked a police station, killing three officers and wounding two. It is Adhamiya, not Amariya. 
An article on Nov. 21 about the persistence of violence in Sunni-dominated areas of Iraq referred imprecisely to the history of rule in that region. For the roughly 500 years that the area was controlled by the Ottoman Turks, the Sunnis ruled as their proxies. (Ultimately, as the Ottoman Empire crumbled during World War I, the Sunnis allied with the British to expel the Turks.) The Sunnis did not rule the region outright. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: Letting Their Hair Grow On Their Yerida

BYLINE: As told to Sam Knight

 BODY:
In Hebrew, emigrating from Israel is known as ''yerida,'' or going down, the opposite of ''aliya,'' or immigration to Israel, which means going up. And at Village Shuwarma on the Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village, a handful of Israeli immigrants can invariably be found eating, playing backgammon, watching soccer and reflecting on this often complicated journey.

Tsach Algaza
25, of Borough Park, Brooklyn.
Originally from Yehud, near Tel Aviv.
 After the army, you have to get out of Israel, just for resting, after a hard three years. Most of us have to get free, get this freedom, grow our hair.
 New York is the biggest zoo ever. I am more like a quiet person, but this place, it's New York, it's interesting and it's new. Of course, everyone here knows the Israelis. We are loud and we are aggravated; when we come in, everyone is supposed to know, but we are very good people. 

Yariv Atias
29, of the Upper West Side.
Originally from Haifa, in northern Israel.
 The soccer stadium maybe is 100 meters from where my parents live, and my father used to take me to games. When we're at the games, my uncle can put 50 of these watermelon seeds into his mouth and eat them all. He is like a professional. He says the game without the seeds is not a game.
 In Israel, it is hard. You live in a country always in a war. The economic situation is not good, so people try some other place to go, to forget, relax their mind. Haifa is like Long Island; it's suburban. It is a different mentality. Here in New York, people are arrogant, always pushing you, stepping on you, this and that. 

Guy Numi
26, of the Upper West Side.
Originally from Jerusalem.
 I've been here for four years. There is a big difference from Jerusalem. In Israel, you don't see people waiting in line all quietly; in Jerusalem there is swearing in the street, in the traffic. 
 The second thing is that if you want to do anything in New York, you can. It's up to you. If you are in middle school and you want to study anything, different things, you can. In Jerusalem there is less variety, but the food in Israel is the best food.

Limor
31, of Manhattan.
Originally from Tel Aviv.
 In Israel you just know everybody and everybody knows you. Everything is bigger here, just everything. People have some strange opinions about Israel -- there are a lot of Jewish people in New York who have families there, so they know. 
 This one American guy, he came to my apartment and he said, ''This looks like an American apartment!'' 
 And I said, ''What did you expect?'' 
 He said: ''I don't know. It just looks like an American girl's apartment.''

DANGER ON PEAKS
Poems.
By Gary Snyder.
112 pp. Shoemaker & Hoard. $22.
 GARY SNYDER is in no rush; his last book of new poems, ''Axe Handles,'' appeared in 1983. But the 59 poems in this collection suggest he hasn't been lazy. If he's up before the hawks start circling and spends the day chopping wood, sharing meals with neighbors, taking on the dark forces of anti-environmentalism, visiting his aging mother and, more than once, simply sitting down to take a good look at the world around him, Snyder is also the last one to bed at night, after he has poured the coffee on the campfire and stirred the coals. In Snyder's view, if art is long, life's even longer. His core subject, the world of nature, has, after all, been around for roughly four billion years.
 If poetry is as much a state of mind as it is an assortment of black marks on white pages, then it resides in that intimate space between the world and those who observe it. In one of these poems, Snyder quotes a haiku by the Japanese master Issa: ''This dewdrop world / is but a dewdrop world / and yet-.'' ''That 'and yet,' '' he adds, ''is our perennial practice.'' From this standpoint, the poet's powers are best used to describe, with a few strokes, what's always been out there and, if we can keep the dark forces at bay, what will always be out there, even after our own brief moment has passed. 
 The best of this new work explores the interplay between what's remembered, what's seen now and what may come. Thus the prosy ''Atomic Dawn'' recounts how the young Snyder descends from a climb to the peak of Mount St. Helens in 1945 to find a bulletin board at the Spirit Lake lodge plastered with photographs of the destruction of Hiroshima:
 ''There were whole pages of the paper pinned up: photos of a blasted city from the air, the estimate of 150,000 dead in Hiroshima alone, the American scientist quoted saying 'nothing will grow there again for 70 years.' . . . I swore a vow to myself, something like, 'By the purity and beauty and permanence of Mount St. Helens, I will fight against this cruel destructive power.' ''
 Not all the poems hit this hard; in fact, too many contain lines that are mere window dressing. (''Heading south down the freeway making the switch / from Business 80 east to the I-5 south.'') There are poets who talk to us, like Whitman, and poets with whom we talk, like Dickinson. Snyder is the second type, and when he squanders too much of a poem on pure description, it's O.K. to say, ''You're boring us, man.'' In fact, he comes across as so good-natured, so open to every possibility, that you get the feeling he'd probably just cackle with laughter and agree.
 Snyder's work isn't all mountains and birdsong. He has an eye for the sensual, as when he recalls trysts with an older lover or remembers a woman who practiced yoga naked all one summer by the river at Big Sur. And with no apology (though perhaps a sly wink) to Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias, he titles one poem ''To All the Girls Whose Ears I Pierced Back Then.''
 Snyder can even make a Dumpster sound like a living creature (''flapping black plastic lids / gobbling flattened cardboard''). And when he tells us how he picks up his laser printer from the repair shop, buys a copy of The Economist and sits down to an ostrich burger for lunch, these actions come across not as items on a checklist but as fragments in time -- here for a moment, then quickly gone.
 Historically, Snyder will always be located at the green end of the Beat/hippie movement, just as Allen Ginsberg will always represent partying and stick-it-to-the-man politics. Ginsberg stands for sex and drugs in the big city, Snyder for meditation and green tea in a forest clearing. Like his better-known counterpart, Snyder once was required reading for a generation of young radicals. But Ginsberg barnstormed from city to city, selling books by the vanload, while Snyder practiced a Buddhist self-effacement that makes the appearance of this new collection all the more startling and welcome.
 Yesterday's hippies are now gray-haired and prosperous and probably not reading much poetry. It would be nice if ''Danger on Peaks'' introduced a master they once venerated to their children before he too slips around the bend. An end-of-life poem called ''Waiting for a Ride'' recalls Warren Zevon's ode to his hearse, ''My Ride's Here.'' ''Most of my work, / such as it is / is done.'' Oh, I hope not.

HEADLINE: Stepping Out of Manhattan's Shadow

BYLINE: By JENNIE GREEN

 BODY:
YES, there is a Starbucks in Jersey City. But there's only one, directly across the street from the Pavonia/Newport PATH Station in the glimmering heart of a revived Hudson River Waterfront, whose glass-plated office towers and luxury high-rises stand proud and tall; these days not so much in the shadow of Manhattan's famous skyline but rather as a kind of graceful western extension. 
 Yet coffee aficionados need not worry, as a variety of tasty brews can be found around town. The Hard Grove Cafe on Grove Street, for example, is a Cuban-American diner with gold foil palm trees that serves cafe con leche rich and piping hot.
 The aggressive development of Jersey City's waterfront and downtown districts that began roughly a dozen years ago, after a false start during the 1980's, has resulted in what some might refer to as an urban renewal of legendary proportion. But that didn't stop Julie Kaufman, who has lived in Jersey City since 1988, from recalling the bad old days: ''First of all, Exchange Place didn't exist,'' she said, referring to a new PATH station in the city's financial center. ''And the Pavonia/Newport PATH station was a total wasteland that you didn't walk across; you ran. There were hookers on the streets and drug deals going down right out in the open.'' 
 Despite a vigorous and successful campaign by developers and city officials to ''put Jersey City on the map,'' many people, including New Yorkers who live only a few miles away, continue to have little sense of the place. 
 Sure, the Goldman Sachs building, Harborside Financial Center Plaza and the Newport development can be seen from the west side of Manhattan, but the glitzy new buildings in the waterfront area, built first to accommodate dot-com companies and then back-office divisions of major financial institutions, are merely the tip of the iceberg. 
 Jersey City is as sprawling as it is diverse, and the fact that some real estate agents have taken to calling it ''the sixth borough'' is not entirely accidental. Like Brooklyn, Jersey City is huge and encompassing of many neighborhoods, or sections, each of which has developed a particular character over time. 
 Historic downtown, for example, is not only within walking distance of the newly gentrified waterfront, it is also home to a significant portion of the city's brownstone row houses, which were built around Van Vorst Park and Hamilton Park at the end of the 19th century. Jersey City's downtown and waterfront were the areas most ravaged by poverty and decay during the decades after World War II. Yet these areas were the first to be remade. 
 ''At any point during the 1970's you could have bought a whole side of Van Vorst Park for $100,000,'' said Dan Frohwirth, director of real estate for the Jersey City Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization that functions as a liaison between developers and the city. ''Now you're going to pay over a million for a house with recessed lights and a Sub-Zero refrigerator.'' 
 In contrast, Jersey City Heights is a densely populated residential neighborhood in the northernmost part of the city. Most of the Heights housing consists of detached two-family dwellings, with some low- to mid-rise apartment buildings. Greenville, on the southern tip of the city, has single-family houses built in the early 1900's, and the Country Village development, which comprises two-family detached and attached houses built in the early 1960's. 
 The newest development in western Greenville is an exclusive waterfront community called Port Liberte, which has become increasingly popular among affluent families. 
 And this is only the beginning. Also within Jersey City is the Martin Luther King Bergen/Lafayette neighborhood, a notoriously decrepit underclass stronghold that has suddenly turned up-and-coming because of its desirable brownstone row houses and proximity to downtown Manhattan via the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Transit. And Journal Square has recently become a focal point for commercial and residential developers, largely because of its precious PATH station. 
 Michael Berney, an agent at Liberty Realty, which started in Hoboken and expanded to downtown Jersey City three years ago, said: ''Jersey City is so hot right now with the waterfront and downtown basically finished, that a natural expansion has occurred. Potential buyers who previously wouldn't consider anything outside of Hoboken are now more than open to Jersey City.'' 
 Checking the latest Hudson County Multiple Listing Service report, he continued: ''There's been a 17.69 percent average price increase on all sales in Hudson County between 2003 and 2004. Year to date, the number of closed sales has also gone up 27.5 percent. Suddenly there are bidding wars.''
 In Jersey City, where the real estate market is inexorably linked with the New York market, three features that most frequently attract urban home buyers are square footage, parking and outdoor space. At the upper end of the Jersey City market ($750,000 to $1.5 million), a buyer may purchase a downtown brownstone in good to mint condition, or a spacious condominium in a luxurious waterfront building with countless amenities. One such apartment that recently hit the market for $1.25 million is a 1,667-square-foot penthouse with an additional 1,500 square feet of private rooftop terrace space in a Washington Street building called the Sugar House. 
 Many choices also exist in the $300,000 to $600,000 range. One is a two-family house in Jersey City Heights for $440,000, with an annual property tax bill of $5,103. 
 Despite the fact that much Jersey City property has doubled in value since 1994, first-time home buyers need not be discouraged. According to a recent Multiple Listing Service report, there were a total of 115 available properties for less than $200,000 apiece in all of Jersey City. Most of these were one- and two-family houses in Greenville and Journal Square, one-family houses in Bergen/Lafayette and Jersey City Heights, and mostly one-bedroom but some two-bedroom condominiums all around town. 
 For families, the biggest question about Jersey City can be said in a word: schools. Like systems in other densely populated urban areas, this one has a history of being strained by overcrowding, underfunding, high dropout rates and a multitude of other problems faced by districts that serve large numbers of disadvantaged children. Evidence can be found in the 2002-03 district SAT scores of 413 for math and 392 for verbal, compared with statewide averages of 518 and 500, respectively. 
 But there are options. Between Jersey City and neighboring Hoboken there are at least four charter schools (Grades kindergarten through 8), three private schools (Cornerstone School in Jersey City and Stevens Cooperative School and Mustard Seed School, both in Hoboken) and too many parochial schools to count. 
 Ms. Kaufman sends her children to the Learning Community Charter School, a public school on Grand Street in Jersey City. ''The classes are small and the child-centered Bank Street method of education they use is really effective,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ''Already, our third and fourth graders have tested above the statewide average.'' 
 Jersey City is booming, but that doesn't mean it's a panacea. Jersey City property taxes run higher than New York City's, and some of the land remains polluted by obsolete manufacturing plants. Also, the place is too rambling for one pulsating hub like Washington Street in Hoboken or Seventh Avenue in Park Slope to emerge. 
 Stephen Becker, who is 36 and single and has lived within walking distance of his waterfront office and the Grove Street PATH station for 10 years, has recently become the happy beneficiary of sushi restaurants, upscale bars and chain retailers like Pier 1 and Target. 
 Still, when asked where in Jersey City he likes to go out for an evening of socializing or entertainment, Mr. Becker, who works for EquiServe replied, ''Manhattan or Hoboken.''
 At the same time, old neighborhoods have started to gel in new ways. Ms. Kaufman, who never expected to stay in Jersey City for the long haul of family life, can't imagine living anywhere else. ''Both of my children,'' she said, ''know every single person who lives on our block.''

HEADLINE: Big Winners, Big Losers In Earnings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
AS the reporting for the third-quarter earnings season draws to a close, performance honors are likely to go to Phelps Dodge, the copper miner and manufacturer; Nucor, the steel maker; and CMS Energy, which generates electricity and distributes natural gas.
 On the list of losers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are Delphi, the maker of vehicle electronics and transportation components; Winn-Dixie, the retail and drug store chain; and LSI Logic, a maker of integrated circuits.
 All of those with big gains have bounced back from poor earnings a year ago. Phelps Dodge's profits rose to $2.95 a share from 6 cents a share, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial. Nucor had earnings of $2.59 a share, up from 8 cents. While CMS's earnings surged, the new profit number is not that striking: the company bounced back from a penny a share last year to 11 cents a share this year. 
 All three of the losers have gone from pennies a share of profits to pennies a share of losses. Delphi had a loss of 12 cents a share, versus a one-cent gain in the same quarter a year ago, while LSI Logic's profit of 4 cents a share turned into a 7-cent loss. Winn-Dixie reported a loss of 8 cents a share, compared with a one-cent gain in 2003.
 Earnings for Marsh & McLennan, the world's biggest broker of commercial insurance, declined 94 percent, the biggest drop so far among companies reporting a third-quarter profit. The company has been accused of rigging bids and fixing prices by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. Ace Ltd., another insurer, and a target of Mr. Spitzer's investigation of the industry, had the next-biggest decline, 93 percent.
 The three sectors with the biggest gains in earnings are materials, up 84 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2003; energy, up 56 percent; and technology, up 39 percent. The lagging sectors are utilities, down 1 percent; telecommunications, up just 2 percent; and financials, up 3 percent. Despite CMS Energy's big gain, 10 of the 19 other utility companies in the S.&P. index reported a drop in earnings.
 With just 19 more companies to report, overall earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to be up 16.8 percent for the three months ending in September, according to Thomson Financial.
 That would be a healthy gain. But it would be the first time in five quarters that the quarterly earnings increase had fallen below 20 percent. 
 A deceleration in earnings growth, however, should not be a big surprise, because there has not been a string of five 20-percent-plus quarters in more than 40 years.

THE WEEK'S DATA -- Reports on durable-goods orders and sales of new and existing homes, as well as the final report on consumer confidence in November, are due during this Thanksgiving week. Durable-goods orders are forecast to have risen by 0.5 percent in October, according to Bloomberg News. Consumer confidence is expected to be slightly higher, while home sales are forecast to be virtually unchanged.

HEADLINE: The 21st-Century Unlimited?

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE walls of the 20 Horse Tavern are lovingly adorned with photos, ads and even tools from early in the last century, when the dining room was a stable and warehouse and the bar was the office for the old Volney G. Bennett Lumber Company. 
 The industrial waterfront surrounding the 20 Horse was never a bastion of loveliness, but through the first half of the 20th century, it boomed. A block west, along the Delaware River, huge ship propellers and other scrap metal are vestiges of that success. Many of the industrial buildings are still there, many awaiting some other use. Even back in its heyday, though, the neighborhood wouldn't have been a place where veal Oscar and lime-and-cilantro citrus vinaigrette were part of the scene. 
 Yet, half a year into its existence, the 20 Horse Tavern is becoming a veal Oscar and lime-and-cilantro landmark. Its business has grown, in part, because it sits two blocks from the end of the River Line, New Jersey Transit's Trenton-to-Camden light rail line that opened earlier this year. 
 ''We thought for the last 20 or 30 years, Camden has been plagued by shot-and-beer joints, with no place to go to sit and have a nice meal,'' said David Levecchia, the 20 Horse Tavern's executive chef. ''We're only about 1,200 feet from the end of the train line.''
 The River Line has been plagued by a general badmouthing. It cost $1.1 billion to build and only averages about 5,400 riders a day. Service halts in mid-evening weekdays and at about midnight on weekends to accommodate commercial rail traffic on the route. 
 Even so, especially in the Burlington County downtowns that have sustained an economic downturn in the last generation, the River Line is a boost for redevelopment hopes. 
 ''When the controversy came, we knew this was what we wanted,'' said Mark Remsa, director of the Burlington County Department of Economic Development and Regional Planning. ''We knew that this would be a major development stimulus. And it is the kind of transit-oriented development planners dream about.'' 
 In Riverside, for example, the town is taking bids from developers on the old Keystone Watchcase Factory, a six-story building with a Rococo-style facade just a block away from the River Line station. Mr. Remsa said it would probably become a combination of housing, studios and retail. Four blocks in the other direction, the old Taubel hosiery mill may soon be turned into apartments. 
 In between, right at the station, the Madison Pub just got approval to expand into the property next door, which by spring should be a 9,500-square-foot upscale restaurant. Already, the Madison Pub offers a River Line martini, a mix of Grey Goose l'Orange, Stoli Razberi, DeKuyper peach schnapps and cranberry juice. The restaurant's Web site (www.themadisonpub.com) offers videos and schedules for the River Line. Across the tracks, the more casual Branigan's offers a dollar off menu items to people who have a River Line ticket.
 Burlington City's boomlet-by-train is even more palpable. The four blocks of High Street from the River Line station at Broad Street are filled with shops, small restaurants, galleries and ''coming soon'' signs in buildings that only a couple of years ago were mostly vacant. On weekends, Mr. Remsa said, tours of the historic area of Burlington, West Jersey's capital three centuries ago, are busier than ever, mostly because of the train traffic. State Senator Diane Allen's business, VidComm, a video production studio, is only steps from the station.
 Mr. Remsa said the New Jersey American Water Company is negotiating with Beverly City to develop its Delaware River waterfront property, which is the site of old and abandoned wells. ''It's the train line that is spurring that, since it is the magic distance, a five-minute walk, from the station,'' he said. The train stops at the Haines Industrial Center, where only a third of the 700-acre property has been developed.
 ''We have a thousand jobs now, mostly in warehousing, but they foresee at least three times that many, with the workers having good access because of the train,'' Mr. Remsa said. ''We may be getting the first spec real estate building in Burlington County in a generation there. People look at current ridership and think its a failure, but we have to give it time.''
 Armando Frallicciardi Jr., the owner of Lorenzo's, the popular longtime political hangout, found his restaurant just 200 feet from the northern end of the River Line in Trenton. Business has long been good at Lorenzo's, but it was always a Trenton-based crowd.
 ''Since the train opened up, my lunch business is up 15 percent,'' Mr. Frallicciardi said. ''People come in from Camden, believe it or not. Or we get seniors who want to take a ride and have the time to get lunch.
 ''And now people have the advantage that they don't have to drive, especially if they live by another stop. They come early, sit at the bar, and know they just have to walk a few steps to the train, which whisks them safely.''
 For some, their home is or will be Bordentown, just a few miles down from Trenton. The River Line is just across Lorenzo's parking lot from the New Jersey Transit/Amtrak Trenton station, where passengers can board for direct trains to Philadelphia and New York.
 ''Properties don't even go on the market there anymore,'' Mr. Remsa said. ''They are sold before they do. If you're working in New York, it's still far cheaper to live there, and now it has easy train access.''
 In fact, it's so easy that Mr. Remsa and his wife, Kathleen, who commutes to New York for work, are planning on moving to Bordentown from their home in Mount Laurel.
 ''The River Line is going to be great for us,'' he said. ''She'll get to work easier, and we may just get rid of a car. No one can convince us this train is a failure.''

HEADLINE: Bill Clears Way for Government to Cut Back College Loans

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER and DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
The federal government will be able to require millions of college students to shoulder more of the cost of their education under the new spending bill approved yesterday by the House and Senate.
 The government moved to change its formula for college aid last year, but was blocked by Congress. Now, however, no such language appears in the appropriations bill lawmakers are considering, clearing the way for the government to scale back college grants for hundreds of thousands of low-income students. 
 Nearly 100,000 more students may lose their federal grants entirely, as Congress considers legislation that could place more of the financial burden for college on students and their families. 
 The cutback stems from a revision to the formula governing virtually all of the nation's financial aid. Last year, the Department of Education changed the formula on its own, angering members of Congress who contended that it was a backdoor way of cutting education spending without facing the public. The department retorted that it was merely following the law. 
 In response, Congress passed legislation in the fall of 2003 to suspend the new formula for at least a year. The Senate put forward the same measure this year, and many members of the House said they also expected the new formula would wait at least until Congress updates the Higher Education Act, which will probably take the better part of the coming year.
 But keeping the old formula in place for another year would add an extra $300 million in grants for college students to a program that is already running at a shortfall, the Office of Management and Budget said. So, the bill approved yesterday, brokered by Congressional leaders in a conference committee, eliminates a provision that would have barred the Education Department from changing the eligibility formula. A Senate staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the White House insisted the provision be dropped, citing the shortfall, and House Republicans were adamant in their agreement to do so. 
 ''They are throwing students out of the opportunity to seek a college education,'' said Senator Jon S. Corzine, the New Jersey Democrat who wrote the amendment to stop the changes last year, and introduced a similar provision this year that did not survive the conference committee. ''It is now clear to me that this was a backdoor attempt to cut funding from the Pell grant program.''
 The exact impact of the new rules is difficult to predict, but had the new formula gone into effect last year, it would have prevented about $270 million from being spent on Pell grants, the nation's primary scholarship program, the Congressional Research Service found. Many students, perhaps more than a million, would have received smaller grants, many education experts estimated. And about 84,000 students would have lost their Pell grants altogether, the research service reported.
 Brian K. Fitzgerald, director of the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, which Congress created to advise it on student aid, estimated that the $300 million the administration hopes to save in the coming year will very likely mean that more than 90,000 students, largely among those whose parents earn $35,000 to $40,000 a year, would lose their Pell grants.
 Whether furnished by colleges, states or the federal government, the vast majority of the nation's $110 billion in financial aid is dictated by an intricate federal formula. Its purpose is to calculate how much of a family's income is truly discretionary, and therefore eligible for covering college expenses. 
 Much like federal income tax, the formula allows families to deduct some of what they pay in state taxes. But last year the department significantly reduced that amount, in some cases cutting it in half, leaving families with more money left over to pay for college, at least on paper. 
 The problem, many members of Congress contend, is that state taxes have gone up for the last three years, not down, making the new formula out of step with the economic environment families currently face. With the issue seemingly on hold, the Department of Education said in June that it would review the formula and seek guidance on its fairness. 
 Without instructions from Congress to the contrary, however, department officials said that they would most likely start using a new formula, as required by law. Its effect on students could vary greatly from family to family, depending on their economic circumstances. But assuming that the department uses figures that are similar to the ones it proposed last year, as many as 1.2 million low-income students could have their grants cut, according to the American Council on Education, which represents colleges. 
 That does not mean that the government will end up spending less money on college scholarships than it has in prior years. In fact, significant increases in the number of low-income students going to college, and the recent economic woes of students and parents who might not have been eligible for help in the past, means that the government spent more than $13 billion on Pell grants in 2004, up from about $10 billion in 2001, department statistics show.

The Year TV Came to Dinner
 EVERYTHING has a history, including the TV dinner on a segmented aluminum tray, which turns 50 this year, according to an article in The Christian Science Monitor by Mary Dixon Lebeau. Excerpts follow: 
 It began as a solution to that All-American holiday problem -- what to do with the leftover turkey. But executives at C.A. Swanson & Sons were talking 520,000 pounds of poultry. 
 The Omaha, Neb., frozen-food company had overestimated the demand for its 1953 Thanksgiving supply. Having insufficient warehouse facilities to store the overage, brothers Gilbert and Clark Swanson loaded the turkeys into 10 refrigerated railroad cars, which had to keep moving to stay cold.
 Enter Gerry Thomas, a company salesman. Visiting the food kitchens of Pan American Airways in Pittsburgh, he caught sight of the single-compartment aluminum trays the cooks used to keep food hot. Thomas requested a sample, then spent his flight home designing a three-compartment tray.
 Thomas presented a turkey-dinner-filled tray to the Swanson brothers. Then he suggested tying the dinners to the nation's latest craze, television. Packages were designed to resemble a TV screen, complete with volume control knobs -- and the TV dinner was born.
 ''The segmented plate was enormously powerful, and remains so,'' says Betty Fussell, food historian.
 ''The food is segmented, just the way we separate food on our plates when we're children and don't want things mixed. It's a form of comfort to us. Everything is in its place.''
 In 1954, more than 25 million TV dinners were served.

Eco-Economics, Unmasked
 Spike (www.spiked-online.com), a conservative online magazine, includes an essay called ''The Dismal Quackery of Eco-Economics,'' by Daniel Ben-Ami, who argues that environmentalism has corrupted the study of economics. Excerpts follow:
 There are two recurring themes running through the environmentalist approach to economics. 
 First, an obsession with the need for limits. The environmentalist debate assumes that strict limits must be put on economic activity. Second, the idea of precaution has more recently become more central to the debate. 
 The prevalent assumption is that people need to be cautious about economic development because it could have harmful unintended consequences in the future. Often such fears are expressed in the language of ''sustainability.'' 
 The precautionary approach acknowledges the power of human creativity. But advocates of precaution tend to see such creativity as a source of problems, rather than a positive attribute of human beings.
 Underlying both assumptions is a misanthropic view of humanity. Environmentalism can be seen as a counterattack against a key premise of the Enlightenment: that a central part of progress consists of increasing human control over nature. 
 Instead, environmentalists argue that humans should accept their place as a mere subsidiary of the natural world. In practice this means reconciling humanity to poverty, disease and natural disasters.
 Nature has sometimes been destroyed as a side-effect of economic growth. But the aim of economic development is to benefit humanity rather than to destroy the natural world. It is important to remember that richer societies are in a much stronger position to create a positive environment for human beings than poor ones.
 Even in the developed world there is still a long way to go before material want can be abolished. In the third world the consequences of 'sustainable development' are even starker.

Terrorism Takes to the High Seas
 In the war on terrorism, one arena that has received relatively little attention is the open sea. And that is a dangerous oversight, write Gal Left and Anne Korin in ''Terrorism Goes to Sea,'' in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs. Excerpts follow:
 Intelligence agencies estimate that Al Qaeda and its affiliates now own dozens of phantom ships -- hijacked vessels that have been repainted and renamed and operate under false documentation. Security experts have long warned that terrorists might try to ram a ship loaded with explosive cargo, perhaps even a weapon of mass destruction, into a major port or terminal. 
 Ominously, there have been cases of terrorist pirates hijacking tankers in order to practice steering them through straits and crowded sea-lanes -- the maritime equivalent of the Sept. 11 hijackers' training in Florida flight schools. These apparent kamikazes-in-training have questioned crews on how to operate ships but have shown little interest in how to dock them.

Shoes and Schizophrenia
 Marc Abrahams writes in the British newspaper The Guardian that a paper in the journal Medical Hypotheses, written by Jarl Flensmark of Malmo, Sweden, links shoes to schizophrenia. Excerpts follow from Mr. Abrahams's article, in which in he quotes from Mr. Flensmark's paper: 
 ''Heeled footwear,'' he writes, ''began to be used more than 1,000 years ago, and led to the occurrence of the first cases of schizophrenia. Mechanization of the production started in Massachusetts, spread from there to England and Germany, and then to the rest of Western Europe. A remarkable increase in schizophrenia prevalence followed the same pattern.''
 He cites evidence from other parts of the world, too -- Turkey, Taiwan, the Balkans, Ireland, Italy, Ghana, Greenland, the Caribbean and elsewhere. 
 Flensmark boils the matter into a damning statement: ''After heeled shoes is [sic] introduced into a population, the first cases of schizophrenia appear and then the increase in prevalence of schizophrenia follows the increase in use of heeled shoes.''

HEADLINE: Airlines Are Counting On Luxury Up Front

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
WILLING to pay more than 20 times the cheapest fare on your next cross-country plane trip for a seat that reclines flat into a bed? Or how about a bed for two -- but no privacy -- on your next flight between New York and London? Perhaps a designer goodie bag might be all that is necessary to persuade you to pay $4,066. 
 The major airlines, caught between soaring fuel prices and plummeting air fares brought on by discount carriers like JetBlue and Southwest, sure hope so. Three domestic airlines are operating under the supervision of bankruptcy courts: ATA, United and US Airways. 
 But the interesting action is at the high end, where airlines are lavishing attention on passengers who will pay top dollar if they can get more than just an extra inch or two of width in their seat and more legroom. ''Before 9/11 just 10 percent of fares from airline hubs were full-fare coach,'' said Darryl Jenkins, a visiting professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla., who has been a consultant to most domestic airlines. Now, he said, just 4 percent are. At spoke cities, he said, no more than 5 percent of passengers paid full fare, a figure now down to 1 percent. 
 Take United Airlines. It decided to rip dozens of seats out of some of its Boeing 757 narrow-body jets. Up front it kept the same dozen first-class seats, but chose models that take up more room because they recline into a sort of bed, a feature available on many international flights but not on any competitor's domestic routes, at least not since United began its premium service late last month. And passengers can use a handheld DVD player to watch movies with the sound coming through headsets that mask the rumble of the jet engines. United is selling those seats for $2,220 or more each way between New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. That would bring in enough revenue in first class alone to pay the costs of the flight, making revenue from the 26 business class and 72 coach seats on the flight largely profit.
 ''This is not a major trend, but a very very small niche that will make United money so long as no one else does it,'' Professor Jenkins said. 
 A much smaller niche can be found in the Neiman Marcus catalog of opulent gifts, which includes a lifetime first-class pass on American Airlines at $3 million for one person or $5 million for two. Delta recently went in the other direction, slashing fares at its Cincinnati hub because so many customers in search of lower fares had been driving hours to airports like Dayton or Louisville. Under its new SimpliFares policy, Delta now charges no more than $499 in coach and $599 in first class for one-way travel from Cincinnati to anywhere in the 48 contiguous states, even for last-minute walk-up customers. US Airways, which was giving away 90 percent of its first-class seats to its most frequent fliers who were eligible for free upgrades, has replaced most of them with coach seats. On some planes seven rows of first class have shrunk to two, adding 10 coach seats that can be sold. 
 International first class is getting even more attention. American Airlines has improved the quality of wines on its international first-class and some business-class cabins to include offerings such as Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque Champagne. Virgin Atlantic is giving passengers in Upper Class, its up-front section, a goodie bag by Ozwald Boateng, a Savile Row maker of bespoke suits. On outbound flights Upper Class passengers will get Boateng cuff links, and on the way home a handheld mirror or a key ring. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, calls these the ''collector's items of the future.'' 
 Virgin is also installing Upper Class seats that turn into a two-person bed, which it calls double suites, and Qantas is promising cocoonlike seat beds starting in January. And then there's Singapore Airlines, long known for its luxurious service and lately for its long flights, including 18-plus-hour runs from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles. While Airbus 340's can hold more than 300 passengers, Singapore has seats for just 181 on these routes, which reduces weight so the planes can stay aloft longer. 
 Emirate Airlines has created semiprivate first-class compartments to attract customers flying between Dubai and New York on its Airbus A-340's. Behind a five-and-a-half-foot screen each passenger has his own space with a 19-inch TV, desk, phone, vanity table and a little closet. And none of the dozen first-class customers should want for anything else because they will be waited on by four flight attendants, one for every three passengers.

HEADLINE: 'Sliding Up a Rabbit Hole Into Wonderland'

BYLINE: By NELLY ROSARIO. 
Nelly Rosario is the author of ''Song of the Water Saints,''a novel.

 BODY:
IF you applied today's world headlines to this microcosmic city, it would be easy to imagine a quilt torn to shreds. What exists, instead, is a city of complex fabrics: the Chinese in Little Italy, the Colombians in Jackson Heights. This is not to say ethnic conflicts don't exist on many levels here; polka dot and kente cloth do clash. But there's as much to be said for the fine threads of daily exchanges between all these communities that hold this city together.
 I was born in the Dominican Republic and grew up in the 70's and 80's in the Southside of Williamsburg, a largely working-class Latino community in Brooklyn. The elevated J, M, and Z tracks on Broadway run like a thick seam between the Southside and the Hasidic Satmar enclave, affectionately and derisively coined ''Jewtown'' by local kids. 
 Around Broadway, you'll find the Williamsburg Public Library, the Williamsburg Bridge, a host of dining spots, banks and other businesses. Transfiguration Roman Catholic parish, our local church and school, was also near Broadway. During my childhood, this seam inevitably came to represent a personal transfiguration: religion and education, literature, movement and prosperity. 
 Older Southside residents joke that the statue of George Washington in Williamsburg Plaza points its rear toward the Southside. So crossing Broadway from the Southside each morning was like sliding up a rabbit hole into Wonderland: the concrete burst open with columns of muscular trees, accompanied by chirping birds; more quiet, less litter; and brownstone after brownstone flanking tree-canopied streets with names like Marcy, Hooper, Penn, Roebling, Bedford and Division.
 The frayed threads between the Latino and Hasidic communities seemed, and still seem, endless, despite the fact that both communities share the experience of immigration and value family and tradition. I grew up with stories of Hasidic vigilante groups who allegedly attacked suspected Latino teenagers. I'd hear ''high-hitluhs'' hurled at yeshiva school buses in response to spitballs. My father used to attend community board meetings that boiled with bitter disputes over housing, social services, business practices, zoning, local politics, ad nauseam -- and still do.
 But it's Olivia, my 5-year-old, who encourages me to view this city's patchwork optimistically. A walk down the street provokes in her questions about why ''Sidians'' wear ''curls'' and ''white pantyhose'' or why Abuela speaks Spanish and others don't. She reminds me to take note of the small exchanges, the surprising moments of connection. 
 Besides parroting learned prejudices, children are also unwitting mediators. Women in kerchiefs often asked us to operate elevators or stoves during the Jewish Sabbath and holidays. Like me, most kids I knew rarely declined the opportunity to sneak glimpses into the lives of such an insular community. You got to peek into those strange wooden structures erected around autumn; you got to taste those slabs of honey-apple cake displayed in kosher bakeries.
 I'd walk down Lee Avenue with my mother as she bargain-hunted. She used to haggle with the store clerk in broken English. The clerk counter-haggled in broken Spanish. Mexican stock boys chatted with their bosses in broken Yiddish. In other words, business as usual.
 On the corner of Marcy and Hewes, another kind of business was going on: My best friend was smitten with a Hasidic boy who worked at the corner store. No ear locks or felt hat or long black coat could hide those amazing eyes, she said. The feeling seemed mutual. They had some ''eye dates'' for a while, and though nothing ever came of them, such glances have the power to create new generations.
 Always, the curiosity. If there was one place where both sides could freely quench curiosity, it was the Williamsburg Public Library on Division Avenue. It was here I indulged in my compulsion for reading. Black Interest, Latino Interest, Jewish Interest -- categories didn't matter. At the checkout desk, I'd catch a Hasidic woman eyeing one of my books, a Holocaust memoir; and she'd catch me eyeing hers, ''The House of the Spirits'' by Isabel Allende. 
 To a writer, these moments become a kind of reverse magical realism, where ordinary human exchanges take on the quality of the fantastic. I think about my father, whose name, Israel Rosario, helped him garner the votes of unsuspecting Hasidic residents at a Brooklyn Villas' tenants meeting. I think about Miriam Vale, owner of Millie's Hair Designs on Williamsburg Street East, a Hasid-customized salon where young women can get their hair relaxed. 
 I think about Orthodox Martin Needelman, who is a legal advocate for Williamsburg Latinos, and who is married to America Ruiz, an economist and schoolteacher. I think of the W.I.C. Center on Wilson and Taylor, whose employees include a Latina who converted to Judaism.
 Snatches of Spanish come from Argentinean Hasidics, labeled Latinos in their community. Dominican cab drivers serve as guides into the Southside's underbelly for adventure-seeking Hasidic men. If you drive past the Amoco station at Kent and Flushing Avenues, don't be surprised to hear hip-hop blasting from the cars of hip-talking Hasidic boys. 
 The assumption that random threads can bind communities may come off as simplistic. Perhaps I'm fixated on the children who ignore prejudice at the Bedford playground. But in my mind, I multiply these threads by the hundreds of others throughout New York. Even the Royal Quilting Company at Metropolitan and Havemeyer will tell you: it's the small, even lockstitch that makes for a longer-lasting quilt.

HEADLINE: Homes Start To Invade A Gallery Neighborhood

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
ART dealers and gallery owners in West Chelsea like to boast that they are off the beaten path, long blocks from more mundane stores and supermarkets, subway stations and fast food restaurants, out of the sightlines of tourists and casual shoppers.
 As Betty Cuningham, who opened a gallery bearing her name at 541 West 25th Street two months ago, put it, ''I like the fact that this is a garage area, so people who do come here are primarily coming to see art, not to be distracted by something else.'' 
 Stefan Stux, whose gallery is nearby, at 530 West 25th Street, had much the same assessment: ''If you see people walking on the streets between 10th and 11th Avenues, you can be confident that eight out of 10 are involved with art.'' 
 How long West Chelsea, especially in the blocks of 20th to 22nd Streets and 24th to 27th Streets from 10th to 11th Avenue, can remain the virtually exclusive domain of the contemporary art world, immune to incursions of less lofty commerce, seems uncertain. 
 So far there are few indications that retailers will stake a claim to properties west of 10th Avenue, but there has been a wave of residential construction there, supplanting the many auto repair and supply shops that dot the area. 
 ''If you don't go down there for two months, it seems like an entirely new market,'' said Jed Garfield, managing partner at Leslie J. Garfield and broker on the sale last month of a two-story carriage house at 526 West 22nd Street. ''If you look at 23rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, residential development is going up at a shocking pace. Go back 18 months and you have literally gone from maybe 15 residential units to 500.''
 The roll call of new apartment towers includes the Tate, a 313-unit rental complex; the Marais, a 107 unit building that is a hybrid between a co-op and a condo; and a unnamed rental building nearing completion stretching from 23rd to 24th Streets near 11th Avenue. The proliferation of residential buildings is a result of rezoning enacted in 1999 that permitted residential construction on the 23rd Street corridor. 
 Vesta 24, a 14-story, 22-unit condo at 231 10th Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets, which sold out last month in a day and a half, demonstrates the appeal of the area. ''Two-bedroom two-bath apartments went for $1.1 million to $1.37 million, and it is difficult to find a good apartment in that price range in a brand new building,'' said Jim Brawders, senior vice president at Corcoran Group Marketing. ''And people think it's hip and cool.'' 
 Now the Department of City Planning is seeking approval for further rezoning of West Chelsea, which it defines as the area stretching from 17th to 30th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. It is proposing the creation of a special district, which would expand residential development along 10th and 11th Avenues but, with few exceptions, retain the manufacturing designation for the midblocks. 
 ''That area is a manufacturing zone, and that is the main reason the galleries thrive,'' said Vishaan Chakrabarti, director of the planning department's Manhattan office. ''Had we allowed residential construction in the midblocks, the galleries would quickly be driven out by economic pressures.''
 Transformation of the High Line, the abandoned elevated railway that runs along the edge of West Chelsea, into a landscaped promenade, as called for in the rezoning, is expected to provide a further boost to the gallery scene. ''It will allow people to develop buildings next to and underneath the High Line, which will create opportunities for new galleries,'' Mr. Chakrabarti said. 
 Meanwhile, two developers who have formed a partnership, Jack Guttman and Young Woo, are planning to break ground in January on a vacant parking lot at 545 West 25th Street for what Mr. Guttman describes as the first new construction geared specifically to galleries and other art-related enterprises. 
 Planned for 20 stories -- or 111 feet more than the 135 feet that would be permitted under the new zoning as written -- the building will be a silvery concrete and glass tower that will soar above its neighbors on the block. 
 ''We are not that much taller than anything existing on 11th Avenue and are certainly shorter than the Starrett-Lehigh Building,'' Mr. Guttman said, referring to the gargantuan former warehouse-factory on 11th Avenue to which Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera will soon move. Among its current tenants are the School of Visual Arts, a Veuve Clicquot Champagne office, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and, in a nonfashion outpost, an office of the Customs Service, part of the Department of Homeland Security. 
 ''Contemporary art needs to be shown in contemporary space,'' Mr. Guttman said, explaining why he and Mr. Woo had seized the opportunity to build from scratch rather than renovate an existing building. ''Some of the world's largest and finest art galleries have been looking for a location like this in Chelsea.'' He added that commitments had been signed by several notable galleries but that it would be premature to identify them. ''Some have an international presence and some are relocating from other sites in New York,'' he said.
 According to Elizabeth Haukaas, director of client services for Grubb & Ellis, the commercial real estate company, which represents the building, the first four floors have already been claimed by ''big name Midtown galleries.''
 The brothers Rick and Robert Rathe have renovated 535 West 24th Street, where they lived for several years, and are aiming it for use by art and fashion showrooms, advertising agencies and other so-called ''creative'' businesses.
 Built in 1906 as the horse and carriage stable of the Fifth Avenue Coach Line (outlines of the manure chutes are still visible on the interior brick walls), the building has had numerous incarnations: it has included theater and television set production, race car storage and photo studios. It was there that Richard Avedon shot his famous photograph of the model Dovima with elephants. 
 Four of the six stories are available, including the top floor, a 95-by-55-foot expanse with an 18-foot ceiling and sweeping views, priced at $320,000 a year. Rents in the area tend to range from $25 to $65 a square foot, depending on where the space is within a building, with the ground floor considered the most desirable.
 For the time being at least, the appeal of West Chelsea to both established art businesses and newcomers shows no signs of abating. Valerie McKenzie, formerly a director at Graham & Sons on the Upper East Side, believed it was essential to be there when she struck out on her own in 2002. ''I knew I had to be in Chelsea and no place else because that is where the audience interested in contemporary art goes; where the critics go; museum curators, directors, art press, collectors and art lovers go,'' she said. ''Not everyone who walks through the door has intentions of buying, but the quantity of visitors is greater than Madison Avenue or SoHo. On a busy Saturday, I can get 300 to 500 visitors and the concentration of galleries is very convenient. You can just wend your way back and forth between 20th and 26th Streets.''
 But with the appetite for space seemingly insatiable and rental and sales prices rising, is West Chelsea destined to become another SoHo, whose artists have been driven out and which is now more urban shopping mall than cultural mecca? 
 Many brokers and gallery owners think that is unlikely.
 ''The map tells the tale,'' said Carri Lyon, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage firm, noting that the distance from subway stations deters foot traffic. By contrast, ''SoHo has a million subways and is convenient to get to,'' said Ms. Lyons who has a number of clients in the arts. ''In SoHo everyone is out for free entertainment and a little shopping, but if you come here, you are not just looking for a new knockoff handbag. You are here to see the art.''
 Michelle Stone, managing director of Sinvin Realty, agreed. ''There is not a lot of activity on the streets, so if a high volume business wanted to come in, there would be little traffic,'' she said. ''The galleries close in August and on Sundays or Mondays, and the Pottery Barns and Armani don't survive on neighborhood traffic.''
 Furthermore, the wide streets of West Chelsea are not conducive to leisurely strolling and meandering in and out of shops the way pedestrians do on the cobblestone streets of SoHo.
 There is a growing trend among dealers to buy premises, and this is said to be further insuring stability. Steven Soutendijk at a broker with Cushman & Wakefield, who views ''the art world as harbinger for gentrification,'' said, ''Artists have decided not to get pushed out again by retail, so they are buying if they can while land values in West Chelsea are still relatively cheap.''
 Jack Fuchs, who owns several properties on West 25th Street including a document storage warehouse he converted to art space, is not so confident about the tenacity of the art community. ''I think people who say this won't change are whistling past the graveyard,'' he said. ''When the High Line gets built and more residences come into the neighborhood, the brave gallery owners who brag about how they will never sell will sell and go elsewhere, seduced by the money.'' 
 What looms most significantly over the future is the proposed Hudson Yards plan that would massively change the 40-block area immediately north of Chelsea, introducing skyscrapers, apartment buildings, parks and, perhaps, a football stadium.
 Whatever shape it takes, it is sure to have enormous impact. ''The biggest question hanging over West Chelsea is the stadium,'' said Douglas Baxter, president of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, which moved its downtown space from SoHo to 534 West 25th Street, in 2001. ''The effect would be to bring in restaurants, bars, crowds and traffic.'' 
 But then, he added, ''It is hard to imagine where the art world will go if it has to leave Chelsea.''
 There is at least one hint: the fashion district, between 35th and 41st Streets from Fifth to Ninth Avenue. But there are only four galleries there now, so it has a long way to go to match West Chelsea. 
 ''As always, it is rent driven,'' said Barbara Blair Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, noting that rents there are $16 to $25 a square foot. ''There are two buildings that are strictly artists' studios and a burgeoning off-Broadway theatrical presence. We are thrilled.''

HEADLINE: The Poetry Symposium

 BODY:
The Book Review recently asked a handful of poets and critics to respond to this question: What book of poetry, published in the last 25 years, has meant the most to you personally -- the book you have found yourself returning to again and again? We asked them not to select reissues, or volumes of a poet's ''selected'' or ''collected'' work. Here are their responses: 

John Ashbery:
 Poetry is being written, and presumably read, all over America. Some of it bears traces and inflections of its place of origin; much of it does not. The new poet laureate, Ted Kooser, lives in Nebraska, and according to James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, he is the first poet laureate to hail from the Great Plains. One hopes that the High Plains, the Mississippi Delta and the Florida Panhandle will one day achieve similar recognition. Democracy is after all what our land is all about, or was until fairly recently, and states' rights are important, though for reasons that have always eluded me.
 But what about poets whose accents are less easily traceable, like Charles Wright of Virginia, via Florence and Pickwick Dam, Tenn., his birthplace? Susan Howe of Boston and Buffalo? Charles Simic of New Hampshire and Belgrade (Serbia, that is)? Are they of less significance because their poetry happens to speak with an unfamiliar regional burr, or none at all? Is this -- gasp -- cosmopolitanism, a crime under the Soviets? 
 Then there is James Tate, born in Missouri and educated in Kansas and Iowa, whose idiom may not sound familiar to inhabitants of those states. But then again, it may. Tate knows that all places are the same place, and conversely, ''If you ain't where you are,/ you're no place.'' Elsewhere he writes, ''Adios Toledo, see you in Ohio.'' Local color plays a role, but the main event is the poet's wrestling with passing moments, frantically trying to discover the poetry there and to preserve it, perishable as it is. Tate is the poet of possibilities, of morph, of surprising consequences, lovely or disastrous, and these phenomena exist everywhere.
 I return to Tate's books more often perhaps than to any others when I want to be reminded afresh of the possibilities of poetry. It's hard to choose a single volume. I'd have picked his ''Selected Poems'' if that were allowed, but RECKONER (Wesleyan University, 1986) is as good a place as any to start, prime middle-period Tate. He chose to preface it with a passage from Wallace Stevens's ''Man on the Dump,'' which ends: ''Where was it one first heard of the truth? The the.'' The line is a notorious one (my spell-check won't accept ''the the,'' and neither have a lot of readers) yet it is essential. Its ''where'' is the wellspring of poetry, and, yes, there is a ''there'' there, an all-encompassing one.
 Tate, who lives in Amherst, Mass., channels Emily Dickinson in one poem from ''Reckoner'': '' 'Tears are my angels now,' she said to me / around 4 a.m. 'But are they interested / in Cedar Rapids?' I asked. 'I'm not qualified / to say,' was her sorry reply'' -- suggesting both that the reply was inadequate and that Emily was sorry about that. I think she was being unduly modest: she is qualified and she does ''say,'' over and over, regardless of the setting, which is always here. And Tate, though he seems to be kidding the boonies (sorry, Cedar Rapids; I've been to you and know you've got culture), is similarly our great poet of local habitations and names, even if they don't show up on every map.
 John Ashbery's new book of poems, ''Where Shall I Wander,'' will be published next spring.

Jorie Graham:
 In 1982, I stole out of a study that doubled as a guest room to find an all-night Xerox machine in Berkeley. I had found, in galleys sitting on the desk, a sound, a tone of voice, searing, true beyond anything I could imagine uttering; a sound I have come to think of as one of the most distinctively American sounds -- the easiest to fake or betray, the hardest to make endure -- the sound of a sorrow that is inseparable from terminal anger. ''The center of the world is closed,'' Denis Johnson writes in the title poem of his seminal collection THE INCOGNITO LOUNGE: And Other Poems (Random House, 1982), ''The Beehive, the 8-Ball, the Yo-Yo, / the Granite and the Lightning and the Melody. / Only the Incognito Lounge is open.'' Although they seem random, and might have been so in the hands of a lesser poet, each of these names has crucial meaning to disclose: the wisdoms of nature, of the archaic, of chance, of mathematics, of sacred texts, of transcendent forces, of song, of the epiphanic as such, are all closed to us. The only way through this ''night'' is to go without name, without face, to go, spiritually, off the grid.
 There is a strain of our poetry that wants to speak in a tone of voice, out of a predicament, that feels exclusively American -- the sound of damaged lives eked out in desert lots, trailer parks, motels -- lives unemployed (both literally and spiritually), abandoned by the dream of freedom though still haunted by the habit of it, abandoned by God although he might be one motel down the road, who knows; a loneliness born as much out of feeling one's self to be ''outside history,'' as out of being abandoned by the dream that America owns to its marrow: the dream of the loner, of absolute self-reliance. ''But here one weeps,'' Johnson writes, ''to see the goodness of the world laid bare / and rising with the government on its lips.''
 Perhaps anyone, like myself, coming from a European background, carried by its long current of history, would be drawn to that sense of an utter dead end, that voice from the edge of the world the American tone gestures toward -- that anger which allows James Wright to say, in his great ''Ars Poetica: Some Recent Criticism,'' ''Reader / We had a lovely language, / We would not listen,'' and end ''When I was a boy / I loved my country /. . . Ah, you bastards, / How I hate you''; that sense of the achingly shortsighted betrayal of what Richard Hugo described as those ''stammering pastures where the picnic should have worked.'' The picnic. Not a continental angst, but rage. Hopeless grief mixed in. For ''who we should have been.'' For ''what we could have been.'' ''Sometimes the closest I get to loving / the others is hating all of us,'' Johnson writes. 
 The Vietnam-era poet of ''The Incognito Lounge'' spoke for a people who knew when they were being betrayed and lied to. You have to be able to tell you are being lied to, to be this angry. In exploring to what use such anger can be put, Johnson reminds us that when anger is a useful tool, it is because one watches the speaker turn the blame inward as well as out. 
 Jorie Graham's new book of poems, ''Overlord,'' will be published next spring.

Jim Harrison:
 Now that I am older and am sliding into home base, I've become aware that I've read some poetry nearly every day for the past 50 years for basically nutritional reasons. It is a survival tactic, this soul food, a need to assuage the sense of incomprehension that I have lived with daily since I was a desperate and vulnerable boy. Just last week on a French book tour when I felt like a stray dog struck by a car and biting at its wounds in a ditch I stopped into a bookstore to fortify myself with a few pages of Rimbaud and Rene Char.
 Naturally I read hundreds of poets, many of them foreign, but in recent years I've probably returned to the work of Gary Snyder and Ted Kooser more often than any others. This is not to say they are the best poets of our time -- I find such rating attempts paltry and onerous -- but the poets whose work most soothes and enlivens me. Snyder has not been subsumed by our culture but has consistently stood off to the side, giving his work a grand range far beyond academic claustrophobia. Ted Kooser has been a friend and correspondent for many years but I was drawn to his work long before I met him because of his genius for making the ordinary sacramental. In both of these poets I find a consistent ability to do honor to their calling. They are apparently incapable of inferior work and have not been swallowed by the activity that surrounds the poetry world but has nothing to do with poetry. It's only the work that matters. Recent books by the two are Snyder's DANGER ON PEAKS (Shoemaker & Hoard, 2004) and Kooser's DELIGHTS & SHADOWS (Copper Canyon, 2004).
 We've been slow to understand that likely the best work in poetry in the last century has been written in the Spanish language. In August I used the new Antonio Machado published by Copper Canyon as an overpowering morning devotional. Poetry doesn't care about nationalities. (Even our fiction seems an island in the sea of Garcia Marquez.) Long ago Sappho wrote mysteriously:
 What cannot be said
 Will get wept.
 Snyder and Kooser say it.
 Jim Harrison's most recent book of poems is ''The Shape of the Journey: New and Collected Poems.''

Robert Pinsky:
 There is no ''most'' or ''best'' in art. No Top 10 or First Place on the scale of art: the large scale, where Ben Jonson is more famous than this year's celebrity. Of the many contemporary books of poetry I value, I'll choose one treasured by poets, but not much noticed by academic or journalistic fashion.
 James McMichael's FOUR GOOD THINGS (Houghton Mifflin, 1980) has provided me repeatedly, over the 24 years since it was published, with the quality of vision. By vision I mean something like the view from a high place. You see more, and farther.
 Partly about one life, ''Four Good Things'' also includes a social vision. Usually, when poetry tries to imagine the nature of society, we can expect a version of the op-ed page, but with the ideas simplified and the rhetoric amplified. The ordinary poem of this kind has less nuance than journalism on the same subject. But ''Four Good Things'' provides the exhilarating subtlety of art. Akira Kurosawa's great film ''Ikiru'' sees the profound mystery in what could be banal: a bureaucrat, told he has a fatal illness, tries to accomplish something good. McMichael's material, too, is familiar. He writes about how America's suburban streets and houses, comforts and technologies, involve an invisible history, from the Industrial Revolution and colonialism to the Information Age. 
 Planning and worry, information and labor, form McMichael's home place, Pasadena, Calif., where Caltech, home of the wind tunnel, was founded in the spirit of William Morris's weavings and handmade papers. The poem's sentences, the dreamy movement from Irish poverty in Manchester to the maps of computer chips, the lines flirting with a camouflaged blank verse, all create an unforgettable formal impression: the feeling of a vision into the forces of greed and generosity, contending in one's country and in oneself.
 Robert Pinsky's most recent book of poems is ''Jersey Rain.''

Mary Karr:
 To watch German tanks roll down your block one year and -- six million deaths later -- Soviet tanks in their wake must have doomed Zbigniew Herbert to Kantian antinomy. He sometimes speaks through a clown-faced doppelg* nger called Mr. Cogito, whose lofty beginnings in Descartes's cogito ergo sum are countered by his bumbling, Buster Keatonesque manner. Herbert poems are slapstick for intellectuals and philosophy for the ill educated.+
 Blame Poland's history. Constantly invaded, the country was obliterated from maps for centuries, its language even deemed ''barbaric'' enough to be banned in some Polish universities in the first half of the 18th century -- facts that impel Herbert's poetry to its keen ''Polishness.'' But he also embraces the European and classical traditions others might renounce as tools of the oppressor. He's a barbarian classicist whose precise, Chekhovian detail provides a cleareyed view of the 20th century at its bloody vortex. He makes marble statues breathe.
 Herbert also advances local experience to mythic scale. The title poem of REPORT FROM THE BESIEGED CITY (Ecco, 1985) opens with the author's political impotence as he's made to chronicle -- ''I don't know for whom'' -- his city's siege. At first the approach is wholly ironic, the reticent speaker making a grocery list of outrages: ''monday: empty storehouse a rat became the unit of currency.''
 But the poem ends -- as Herbert's work often does -- with emotional conviction in the face of certain catastrophe.
 cemeteries grow larger the number of defendants is smaller
 yet the defense continues it will continue to the end
 and if the City falls but a single man escapes
 he will carry the City within himself on the roads of exile
 he will be the City
 we look in the face of hunger of fire face of death
 worst of all -- the face of betrayal
 and only our dreams have not been humiliated.
 In a time of great terror and prevarication, this voice can heal us.
 Mary Karr's most recent book of poems is ''Viper Rum.''

James Fenton:
 No one would wish to deny Cavafy his pre-eminence as lyricist of the homoerotic, but the acts of love he was talking about were furtive, led nowhere and took place in a disapproving world. Thom Gunn toward the end of his life wrote a group of erotic poems and love poems (the categories sometimes overlap) which record a society in which such furtiveness would be comically out of place. It is a new moral world, containing choices that Cavafy never seems to have had to face. Can a man balance, for instance, a life of hedonistic sexual adventure with long-term partnership? What happens to the sexual buccaneer as he grows old? How should one make one's life mean something?
 Two of Gunn's most beautiful friendship poems (''Rapallo'' and ''In Trust'') appear in his last collection, ''Boss Cupid'' (2000). Still, I must choose an earlier volume, THE MAN WITH NIGHT SWEATS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1992), since it contains, at the end of the sequence of poems arising from the AIDS epidemic, that most characteristic of his responses to the crisis, ''A Blank.'' In this poem, a former lover is glimpsed from the bus in the company of the child he has decided to adopt, and Gunn admires the spirit in which his friend has embarked on life as a single father. The situation of the poem is something new to lyric poetry, although the appreciation Gunn expresses is entirely consistent with his life's work. What he admired was always authenticity.
 James Fenton's most recent book is ''A Garden From a Hundred Packets of Seed.'' 

Sapphire:
 All of Lucille Clifton's previous books come together in this one like a train pulling into the station: NEXT (BOA Editions, 1987). This is not so much ''the book I come back to'' as the one book that keeps coming back to me:
 the path men walk is shadow
 . . . enter the dream to be real
 this belief 
 in the magic of whiteness,
 . . . that it explains
 allows 
 assures
 entitles
 . . . like jack's bean
 . . . leads 
 to the giant's actual country
 where jack lies broken
 . . . the land is in ruins,
 no magic, no anything.
 Lines from a poem in ''Next'' come to me as I am standing on a New York City street on Sept. 11, 2001, watching the twin towers burning:
 the hoop of the world is breaking.
 fire burns in the four directions.
 And I thought of Nagasaki and my mother, who was a soldier in the segregated Women's Army Corps during World War II. My mother blamed the leukemia that killed her on her exposure to fallout from nuclear tests that the Army had lied to the soldiers about doing. 
 I think of Lucille Clifton now:
 there is a wheel 
 and it is turning.
 . . . we are all next. or next.
 Sapphire's most recent book of poems is ''Black Wings & Blind Angels.''

Harold Bloom:
 John Ashbery's eighth volume of poetry, AS WE KNOW (Viking, 1979), was certainly his most ambitious up through 1979. It was two books at once. First comes ''Litany,'' a highly problematic and at moments magnificent long poem of some 65 pages, in two quite separate columns -- or is it two long poems resolutely refusing congress with one another, while running side by side? Then come 40-odd shorter poems, lyrics and meditations of which at least the following are anything but problematic, and indeed are superb: ''Silhouette,'' ''As We Know,'' ''Flowering Death,'' ''My Erotic Double,'' ''Knocking Around,'' ''Late Echo,'' ''Tapestry'' and ''The Sun.'' Those eight poems stand with the best of Ashbery, and one in particular, ''Tapestry'' (of which more to come), is of the eminence of ''Soonest Mended'' in his book ''The Double Dream of Spring'' and ''Wet Casements'' in ''Houseboat Days.'' There are not many contemporary poems that deserve the old but crucial phrase: ''inexhaustible to meditation.'' These do.
 But I begin with ''Litany,'' the scandal of the volume and a text I have never ''mastered,'' at least in the high Nietzschean sense of interpretation exercising itself as the interpreter's will-to-power over the text. With Nietzsche, I murmur: ''Who is the interpreter?'' even as I begin a ninth or tenth reading of this maddening but very amiable and accomplished poem. What is maddening did not come suddenly to Ashbery at 52. It was always there, in an only apparent discursiveness that played at being a willful randomness. But, as before, Ashbery is neither discursive nor random. He is as intensely figurative a poet as Whitman and Stevens were, and like these ancestors he wears a mask of the casual extemporizer that no reader should trust for an instant.
 Ashbery insists that ''Litany'' ought to be heard simultaneously as two monologues independent of each other, yet somehow related. I understand that he and another reader have so performed the poem, before an audience, but I cannot regret my absence from that celebration. Sustained reading has convinced me finally that the right-hand column is much the better of what I suspect after all to be two poems, uneasily separate from each other. Not that the left-hand column lacks its glories, but it speaks for Ashbery's self whereas the right-hand meditation is the voice of what Whitman has called the real me, or the me myself, a more inward and vulnerable aspect of the self. If my judgment is at all correct, then I would call the left-hand column a substitution for or sublimation of Ashbery's deepest desires, whereas the right-hand side is more nearly an evasion or repression of those desires, which fascinatingly keep breaking through, revealing ranges of Ashbery's sensibility and intellectual ambition that have not been overly evident before this. I give first a left-hand passage in which poetry, like the dreadful, is what has already happened:
 . . . And the agony
 Of looking steadily at something isn't
 Really there at all, it's something you
 Once read about; its narrative thrust
 Carries it far beyond what it thought it was
 All het up about; its charm, no longer
 A diversionary tactic, is something like
 Grace. . . .
 Which is to say that Ashbery, unlike Wordsworth, cannot labor to keep his eye steadily upon the object, because every object now belongs to anteriority, and not to us. This rueful sublimation has its elegance, but is weak when confronted by the right-hand column's beautiful evasion that ends a brilliantly sustained passage on the use of poetry and the right use of criticism:
 And so lead us gradually back to words
 With names we had forgotten, old friends from
 Childhood, and then everything
 Is forgiven at last, and we 
 Can sit and talk quietly with them for hours,
 Words ourselves, so that when sleep comes
 No one is to blame, and no reproach
 Can finally be uttered. . . .
 ''Words ourselves'' is, in full context, a wholly adequate trope, and one of a litany of evasions of the right-hand me myself. I call the poem/poems ''Litany'' ''problematic'' because with each rereading I wonder why I (or Ashbery) need the left-hand side, but then I recall Whitman's ''Song of Myself,'' surely Ashbery's ultimate model, with its moving description of Whitman's evasive side: ''the Me myself'':
 Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
 Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
 Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
 Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
 Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.
 ''Litany'' extends the achievement of the Ashbery who begins to persuade us that he, rather than Whitman, has written these lines concerning his true self.
 I have space to consider only briefly Ashbery's triumph in lyric and shorter meditative poems. His mode here is as clearly related to Stevens as ''Litany'' is to Whitman. Sometimes indeed the relation is a touch too clear:
 The poem of these things takes them apart,
 And I tremble. Sparse winter, less vulnerable
 Than deflated summer, the nests of words.
 Still, that is the second of ''Five Pedantic Pieces,'' and is probably deliberate parody. Ashbery is most himself in ''Tapestry,'' which can rival Stevens's ''Poems of Our Climate'' as an ''Ode on a Grecian Urn'' for our time. ''Tapestry,'' like Ashbery's masterpiece in the long poem, ''Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,'' studies the estrangement of both artist and audience from the artwork, discovering anew the sorrow that the distance increases even as the aesthetic experience becomes more intense:
 As words go crying after themselves, leaving the dream
 Upended in a puddle somewhere
 As though ''dead'' were just another adjective.
 At one moment in ''Litany,'' Ashbery commends Keats's sonnet ''On the Grasshopper and the Cricket'' as writing that does not offend us. At his best, as in ''Tapestry,'' Ashbery is equally remote from all offense. Now, in 2004, he is our major poet since the death of Wallace Stevens in 1955. 
 Harold Bloom's most recent book is ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found?''

Sharon Olds:
 The first book that came to my mind is Stanley Kunitz's NEXT-TO-LAST THINGS (Atlantic Monthly, 1985). So many of its lines have become a part of my life, like words from the Bible, heard as a child, which seem to be stored where one's own physical sense memories are stored.
 . . . The way I look
 at it, I'm passing through a phase:
 gradually I'm changing to a word.
 Whatever you choose to claim
 of me is always yours:
 nothing is truly mine
 except my name. I only
 borrowed this dust.
 The second book makes me wonder, with delight, how such exactness and such mysteriousness can be so deeply present together Reading Yusef Komunyakaa's MAGIC CITY (Wesleyan University, 1992) has been for me like the early days of rock dancing -- joy and music and trying to figure out how the other person is doing what he's doing!
 All the bees in the world
 Live in little white houses
 Except the ones in these flowers.
 All sticky & sweet inside.
 I wonder what death tastes like.
 Sometimes I toss the butterflies
 Back into the air.
 Third is a book that sort of threw me to my knees. Deborah Digges's TRAPEZE (Knopf, 2004) is a book that shows me how much truth, and feel-of-truth -- embodying profound complex mourning -- can be sung.
 As for your dead, they will not be
 returning. The leafless burial woods fill
 with brilliant brutal light. How few
 you've loved toward posterity. You only
 recognized each other. Who wouldn't envy
 the mole his nature, old fossor,
 Charon's shadow crossing over.
 Sharon Olds's most recent book is ''Strike Sparks: Selected Poems, 1980-2002.''

A Gang of Six

 The poetry world, like the inside of a good wine store, can seem quite small and blindingly vast at the same time -- a constellation of names and approaches and critics' darlings and undervalued treasures. Six of the poetry world's signal talents were photographed at The Times in late October. They are pictured here from left to right, beginning with Yusef Komunyakaa, who was born in Bogalusa, La., in 1947. He is the author of many books of poetry, including ''Neon Vernacular: New and Selected Poems,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994. He teaches at Princeton University. Harold Bloom, born in 1930 in New York City, is Sterling professor of humanities at Yale University and, over the past several decades, has been one of this country's most influential and prolific literary critics and scholars. Deborah Garrison was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1965; as the poetry editor at Alfred A. Knopf, she is among the poetry world's most significant arbiters. Formerly an editor at The New Yorker, she is the author of a collection of poems, ''A Working Girl Can't Win.'' Paul Muldoon, born in 1951 in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, is the author of''Poems 1968-1998'' and ''Moy Sand and Gravel,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003. He also teaches at Princeton University. John Ashbery, born in Rochester in 1927, has written more than 20 books of poetry, including ''Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1976. Jorie Graham was born in New York City in 1950 and grew up in Italy. Her many books of poetry include ''The Dream of the Unified Field: Selected Poems 1974-1994,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1996. She teaches at Harvard University. THE EDITORS

HEADLINE: Some Hard-Liners in Turkey See Diversity as Divisive

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
In the cavernous Panayia church, one of the few Greek Orthodox churches still active in Turkey, ceiling panels dangle precariously over the choir loft. Flying glass has pitted the frescos of biblical scenes. Musty carpets are rolled up and stored like logs beside the elaborate Byzantine iconostasis.
 The building, which celebrates its 200th anniversary on Sunday, has been scarred for a year, since terrorists bombed the nearby British Consulate and the force of the explosion shattered dozens of the church's stained glass windows. 
 Orthodox leaders, following Turkish law, asked for government permission to make repairs but received no response. Rain seeped in. Paint peeled. Mildew grew. 
 After a few months, they surreptitiously replaced the broken church windows. But they hesitate to start renovations because the Turkish authorities, as frequently happens in such cases, still have not acknowledged their request. 
 ''That's the usual tactic,'' said Andrea Rombopoulos, a parishioner who publishes a newspaper for the small Greek Orthodox community in Istanbul. ''They don't give a negative answer. They don't give any answer at all.'' 
 Turkey has long viewed its non-Muslim minorities with a certain ambivalence, defending individual freedom of worship while tightly regulating the affairs of religious institutions. Christians of Greek and Armenian descent, in particular, have said they are blocked from using, selling and renovating properties that have been in their churches' hands for centuries. 
 Now, under pressure from the European Union and local civil rights advocates, Turkey has started to cautiously reassess the way it has treated religious minorities since the state was founded 81 years ago. 
 Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erdogan's government has prepared legislation that would give Christian and Jewish foundations more freedom to manage their own assets and elect their board members. Parliament is expected to vote on the bill before Dec. 17, when European Union leaders are to decide whether to open accession talks with Turkey.
 For the first time, senior Turkish officials have also broken a long-standing taboo and broached the idea of allowing the Greek Orthodox patriarchate to reopen a 160-year-old seminary that once served as a leading training center for priests. 
 The school, perched on a hill on an island in the Sea of Marmara off Istanbul, was closed in 1971 when the state took control of all private universities. Mr. Erdogan's aides have suggested that it could be permitted to operate again, as a gesture to the European Union, if Turkey's membership bid advances.
 Some legal constraints on religious foundations have already been relaxed over the past three years, although European and American human rights monitors, citing cases like the Panayia church, have reported that local officials have been reluctant to carry out the changes.
 Still, Christian leaders here said they were more hopeful than ever. 
 ''What has changed is that we don't have that hostility anymore from the authorities,'' said Elpidoforos Lambriniadis, an aide to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. ''As the patriarchate, we don't doubt the good will of the government. But we know the government is not controlling everything in this country.''
 For many Turks, even a discussion of religious or ethnic minorities raises fears of separatism. Some have argued that lifting government controls on religious institutions, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, would undermine Turkey's secular foundations. And Turkey's president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, recently warned that drawing attention to Turkey's sectarian or cultural diversity harmed the state. 
 The delicacy of the issue was highlighted earlier this month when a government-sponsored commission released a report criticizing Turkey's definition of itself as a ''single-culture nation-state'' and urging an end to all restrictions on the expression of minority languages and cultures. 
 When the report was presented at a news conference, a dissenting member of the commission ripped a copy from the hands of the presenter and tore it up. Later, the Erdogan government, which established the commission, also disowned it.
 Baskin Oran, the Ankara political science professor who headed the commission, said he was undeterred by the reaction. 
 ''They are clearly seeing that what they have been pushing under the carpet since the 1920's is now being questioned,'' he said, ''Now, everything will be discussed. There will be no taboos in Turkey, and they hate that.''
 For some hard-line nationalists, even the term ''minority'' is anathema, suggesting dual loyalties and the betrayal of the country's cherished ideal of an indivisible Turkish identity.
 ''In the end, there will be lots of small groups feeling different and trying to identify their differences as separate identities on basis of religion, race or language,'' said Mehmet Sandir, a spokesman for the Nationalist Movement party. ''And at times of economic or political crisis, our country will immediately turn into a 'minority hell' of internal strife.''
 Turkey's enemies, he added, could then exploit those differences to split the nation, as the European allies and Russia did after World War I when the Ottoman Empire was further divided. 
 ''This is not paranoia,'' said Mr. Sandir, whose party has organized demonstrations against the orthodox patriarchate. ''The recognition of minorities was used as an argument in destroying empires. The Balkans are boiling now because of this chaos of minorities.''
 A distrust of minorities is drilled into Turks from childhood, according to Hrank Dink, a magazine publisher and scholar active in the country's ethnic Armenian community.
 ''In public school, 'minorities' are mentioned in the textbook on national security, under the section that talks about separatism and about the 'games played against Turkey' by outside powers,'' Mr. Dink said. 
 That suspicion carries over to the local officials who are in charge of regulating the non-Muslim religious foundations, including those that administer the 17 schools and 42 churches of the Armenian community in Turkey. 
 ''They see the minorities in terms of national security,'' Mr. Dink said. ''The fewer there are, the less they feel threatened.'' 
 The official doctrine on minorities stems from the 1923 Lausanne treaty in which the European powers recognized Turkey's independence and received guarantees concerning the status of three non-Muslim communities -- Jewish, Greek Orthodox and Armenian -- in the new and predominantly Muslim Turkish state. 
 The three groups mentioned in the treaty, sometimes referred to as ''indigenous foreigners'' in official documents, were promised protection but not the privileges they enjoyed under Ottoman rule. 
 The Greek Orthodox patriarchate, regarded with great suspicion by the Turkish leaders because of its support for the failed Greek invasion a few years earlier, was allowed to remain in Istanbul, where it had been based for nearly 1,700 years. 
 But Turkey did not recognize its ecumenical authority, instead treating successive Orthodox patriarchs as parish priests responsible for the churches in their immediate neighborhood. 
 The treaty did not mention Turkey's minority Alewite population, who are Muslims but follow a different sect from Turkey's Sunni mainstream and now want their national identity cards to show them as Alewite instead of Muslim.
 Nor did the treaty mention ethnic minorities like Kurds. Until recently, Turkish governments used that omission to justify their ban on references to Kurds as a distinct subgroup in Turkey. The government has eased its restrictions on Kurds in the past two years but it refers to them as a group using a different language than Turkish, not as a minority.
 More changes are inevitable, said Professor Oran, who spearheaded the government report on minorities. 
 ''The concept of 'minority' has changed since the Lausanne Treaty,'' he said. ''Now it's anyone different from the majority and who wants to maintain this difference. We have to delete the laws that prevent them from using the same rights as the majority. If a Turk can read and write and publish in Turkish, then any Kurd or Circassian should have the same right.''
 ''The genie,'' Professor Oran added, ''is out of the bottle.''

HEADLINE: Stirring Up a Sleepy Town

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL SULLIVAN MOORE

 BODY:
THE top reason successful applicants to the University of Connecticut decline to attend, according to a recent university survey, is because there ''is nothing to do at Storrs.''
 But that reason may vanish if a $150 million redevelopment project for the sparse center of this rural, university town becomes a reality in the next few years.
 Unveiled earlier this month to Mansfield residents, the Storrs Center project would concentrate about 600 market-priced housing units, 70 retail shops and restaurants, and 25,000 square feet of commercial and office space on about 15 acres of a 45-acre site in downtown Mansfield. It would be at the southern end of the UConn campus, across from the university's fine arts complex. At the development's heart would be a classic town green. 
 The project typifies ''new urbanism,'' a pedestrian-friendly genre that emulates how pre-World War II neighborhoods were built around Main Streets or commercial centers, said Steve Maun, president of LeylandAlliance, the project's developer, based in Tuxedo, N.Y. 
 The developers are seeking about $20 million in state and federal funds for infrastructure, such as road improvements, a parking structure and building the town green, said Howard Kaufman, Leyland's general counsel. Leyland will cover the balance of the funds, he said. 
 Backed by a partnership of town officials, university administrators, community residents and area businesspeople, the Storrs project is the result of at least four years of planning at the local level. 
 ''It's been needed and talked about in Mansfield for years,'' said Elizabeth Paterson, the town's mayor.
 ''There are plenty of things to do on campus, but what's missing is if you're looking for a decent place to take a date out, to go to a store and locate an iPod or locate an all-night diner, it isn't here,'' said Thomas Q. Callahan, special assistant to the UConn president. 
 Much of the project hinges on its retail element. 
 While the plan wends its way through various town and state agencies, the project's retail consultant, the Village People of Montreal, will ''audition'' tenants for the retail portion, beginning first with local businesses to find the best chocolate maker or coffee bar, Mr. Maun said, giving some examples. ''The trick is to create authenticity,'' he said. 
 Other tenants might include a white tablecloth restaurant, a good diner, pizzeria and a range of apparel stores, geared to the market's purchasing power. About 20 percent of the tenants would be national retailers, with such brand recognition as the Gap, Mr. Maun said. 
 Nine small neighborhoods providing a mix of apartments, condos and townhouses would also be built, Mr. Maun said. The residents would not be for undergraduates, but instead meant for graduate students, faculty members and others wanting to live in a university setting
 The project has a long way to go before construction could begin in the spring of 2006. This spring, the plan must win approval from the town's planning and zoning commission, which also must give permission to create ''a mixed-use zone'' for the site. Because traffic and wetlands would be affected, the project also must get a go-ahead from the state Department of Environmental Protection and the state Department of Transportation. Finally, the Town Council also must approve it.
 But Mr. Maun and other supporters of the project are optimistic, banking on the partnership between the town and the university. 
 So far, opposition has been minimal, with typical concerns about the project's impact on traffic, storm drainage and the environment, according to Ms. Paterson and Cynthia van Zelm, executive director of the Mansfield Downtown Partnership. . 
 ''There's not as much as you would expect in an academic town, where there are lots of opinions,'' Ms. Paterson said.

HEADLINE: Does a Free Download Equal a Lost Sale?

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
RECORD industry executives hold it as an article of faith that the advent of file-sharing Web sites like Napster and Kazaa was largely responsible for a stunning decline in the sales of recorded music. From 1999 to 2003, after all, the number of compact discs and other forms of recorded music shipped in the United States plunged 31 percent. 
 Sure, other factors -- including the stubbornly high price of CD's, a recession that cut into discretionary spending, a plethora of unappealing pop acts and the intense competition for the entertainment dollar -- may have contributed. ''But there's no question that file sharing has an enormous impact on sales,'' said Mitch Bainwol, chairman and chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, based in Washington. ''The most basic notion of economics is this notion of perfect substitution. You have two products that are in essence substitutes, so the market drives toward the freebies.'' 
 The association has buttressed this Econ 101 lesson with consumer surveys showing that the industry's core audience would rather download tunes free than pay for them. In November 2002, Peter D. Hart Research Associates found that when 19- to 24-year-olds were asked about a song they liked, 32 percent said they would download it, while only 9 percent said they would buy it.
 From the outset, however, economists have been skeptical that every free download represented a lost sale. And several years after the explosion, and subsequent implosion, of the original Napster, academics have begun to plug data about free downloading into complex equations and theoretical frameworks. 
 Stan Liebowitz, an economist of the University of Texas at Dallas who has synthesized much of the research, sees economists as generally coming to an agreement. ''I think the consensus is going to be that file sharing and downloading is going to be harmful to sales of music,'' he said. The question is, how much? 
 Two professors at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel Waldfogel and Rafael Rob, measured the downloading and CD-buying behavior of students at the University of Pennsylvania, Hunter College in New York and City College of New York. In a working paper published recently by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they concluded that students each spent $126 on the best-selling CD's without downloading and $101 with downloading. While conceding that their research did not cover a representative sample, they concluded that every 10 downloads of music resulted in 1 to 2 lost sales. 
 Why such a small correlation? Many downloads represent transactions that would not have taken place at the asking price. As part of the study, the professors asked students to place a dollar value on CD's they bought and on CD's they effectively obtained free. The average valuation of downloaded hit CD's was only $8.81 -- far below the retail price. ''If they were downloading things they would not have purchased, that would tend not to reduce industry revenue and not to increase displacement,'' Professor Waldfogel said.
 While most studies conclude that free downloads depress music sales to some degree, Felix Oberholzer-Gee, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, isn't ready to add his voice to the harmony. In a paper he wrote with Koleman S. Strumpf of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he examined the correlation between popular downloads and popular CD's in the fall of 2002. 
 They found that Eminem's ''8 Mile'' soundtrack was the second most popular among albums sold, and that his song, ''Lose Yourself,'' was the most popular among file sharers. It seems that downloading was more a symptom of an artist's popularity in the record stores than a barrier to it. ''Our best guess is that peer-to-peer networks in 2002 had no effect whatsoever on sales,'' Professor Oberholzer-Gee said.
 ANALYZING the economics of downloading is difficult, partly because the landscape has changed so rapidly. As the industry has begun to embrace digital distribution of music, the free-for-all era of file sharing is slowly giving way to the more commercial age of iTunes. Plainly, many consumers are reluctant to buy music for $15.99 a CD at large record stores. But that doesn't necessarily mean doom and gloom for the industry. 
 Contrary to most predictions, sales of recorded music rose earlier this year. In the first half of 2004, shipments of CD's rose 10.2 percent from the period the previous year, according to the recording industry group. ''In that context, there's a tourniquet around the problem,'' said Mr. Bainwol. He said the industry's crackdown on file sharing was bearing some fruit.
 But Professor Oberholzer-Gee draws a different lesson. ''Sales can go up even when the usage of peer-to-peer technology is rising,'' he said. So it appears that the digitization of music will continue to be a boon both to music-loving consumers and to data-loving economists.

HEADLINE: Playland And Profit: Firm Seeks A Marriage

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
A FIXTURE on the edge of Long Island Sound since 1928, Playland is home to a beach, pool, boardwalk, skating rink, miniature golf course and nature sanctuary. But the heart of the operation is the nation's only municipally owned and operated amusement park, a popular relic that has been a money loser for Westchester County for years.
 After spending $53,000 last year on studies by two separate consultants who examined profitability issues at the Ice Casino and the amusement park at Playland, the county has now hired a third firm, Bullock Smith & Partners of Knoxville, Tenn., to help develop a comprehensive plan for the amusement park. Bullock Smith has been charged with devising a 10-year master plan for the park; the firm began gauging public opinion on the project at a meeting last month in White Plains. 
 While the consultants are examining a wide range of issues, the main mission of the study will be to determine how the park can balance its budget, said Michael B. Kaplowitz, who is chairman of the county Board of Legislators' Budget Committee. He said last week that he had received figures projecting $5 million in losses at Playland for 2004; the original estimate for the year was less than half that. The losses in 2003 were $2.2 million, he said. 
 Cool, rainy weather was cited in much of the shortfall, but Mr. Kaplowitz expressed concern. ''I am increasingly frustrated, and I think the whole legislature is over the direction the park is heading,'' he said, noting that he spoke at the meeting last month and asked the consultants to find ways to help the park at least break even. ''We're getting further away from a break even or nominal loss.''
 The $250,000 study of the amusement park, which was proposed by County Executive Andrew J. Spano, will examine its historic and environmental aspects along with issues like marketing, infrastructure, architecture, theme elements, traffic and how the site fits with the greater community.
 Last year another consultant, Economics Research Associates of Washington, conducted its review of Playland, which is operating under the aegis of the county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. The firm examined the operation of the amusement park and recommended several changes, among them reconfiguring it as a public benefit corporation. But Mr. Spano rejected that recommendation, citing concern that it could saddle property owners with an extra financial burden. Park officials said the consultant's other suggestions -- one of them buying rather than leasing rides -- were accepted. 
 Another study conducted last year by Canlan Ice Sports of British Columbia suggested that the Ice Casino be privatized, which the county rejected.
 ''We chose not to privatize because it would have created a distance between the facility and the community we serve,'' said Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to Mr. Spano. ''We didn't want to lose that closeness or control. Also, under our analysis, it would have cost us money, not saved us.''
 THE county did act on some of the recommendations, however, reorganizing the staff and separating the casino's budget from that of the amusement park. Capital improvement projects are already in the works to renovate the Olympic-size pool and the Art Deco bathhouses, which have been designated as the site for a children's museum.
 ''This is no Disneyland,'' Mr. Spano said in a phone interview. ''We want to keep it a family-oriented, historic park. If this was an amusement park like Six Flags, I'd sell it in a minute.''
 But Playland is different, Mr. Spano argues. It is on the National Register of Historic Places, is the most visited park in the county's system, and provides a diverse range of options for visitors. ''We have a great place, but we have to expand that base if we're going to make it viable,'' he said.
 Any expansion, however, must be balanced with the concerns of surrounding communities that could be affected by increased traffic, county officials say. Therefore, at last month's meeting, Ernest C. Odierna, a Mamaroneck town councilman, who has been boating on the Sound for almost 50 years, proposed creating a dock or mooring to give boaters access to Playland from the Sound.
 ''I have long thought that it would be really nice if boaters could access and enjoy the facilities at Rye Playland just as those who drive or take buses do,'' he said. ''With all the monies being spent to clean up the Sound, there is virtually no place for a boater to go ashore.''
 While Bullock Smith is still months away from the March 2005 date for issuing its report, a survey of 524 people attending Playland this summer, as part of the new report, provided the consultants with some early data to consider. Over all, those questioned were happy with their visit to the amusement park -- 95 percent rated it excellent or good -- but the survey found 66 percent of the visitors decided to make the visit the day they came or the day before.
 ''That tells me you should be generating more people outside that one-day drive,'' said Ed Stone of Stone Communications in Hendersonville, Tenn., the firm examining marketing at Playland.
 Bullock Smith, at last month's meeting, repeated previous consultants' assessments that the county is paying more to lease rides than it would cost to own them. 
 In the early 1980's the Marriott Corporation of Bethesda, Md., operated the amusement park, enclosing it and charging admission. Attendance plummeted in the face of public outrage. 
 ''It was a disaster,'' Mr. Spano said. ''Under my administration we will never charge an entrance fee.''

HEADLINE: Zambian Salaries

 BODY:

To the Editor: Like Jill Abramson, who wrote ''In Zambia, Luxury Above the Torrent'' (Oct. 24), my wife and I also were uncomfortable with the obsequious hospitality at the Royal Livingstone hotel in Zambia on our trip there last year. Our uneasiness turned to alarm when an employee pleaded for a tip, saying she and her children were hungry.
 We later learned from other hotel employees that the hotel (part of the Sun International chain) employs only a handful of full-time service staff, which it pays according to the country's labor laws, and that the vast majority of the staff is made up of ''temporary'' workers and paid a fraction of a living wage. 
 Tourism is a major resource for sustainable economic development in developing countries. On future trips, we would like to direct our tourism dollars toward companies that promote local economic growth.

Justin Bekelman, M.D.
New York, N.Y.

Boris Bornman, general manager of Sun International, Zambia, responds: Sun International started operating in Zambia three years ago. The resort directly employs a staff in excess of 1,000, approximately 600 full-time and the remainder via a Zambian labor broker. Salaries are reviewed on a yearly basis to ensure they are in line with acceptable standards in Africa, using various indicators, from cost-of-living indexes for the region to extensive salary surveys.
 We are proud to state that the Sun International employees are some of the best-paid hotel employees in Zambia, earning in general above the industry average.
 The resort invests heavily in the community. In 2003, the children's hospital in Livingstone was renovated at a cost of $80,000. There is also ongoing support of various orphanages, old age homes, AIDS programs, schools and more. 
 For 2004, the resort has adopted the Zambezi School in Livingstone, and is busy with an extensive renovation program at an estimated cost of $100,000. Other programs include farming projects within the region.

HEADLINE: East Village Values

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 C.J. Hughes's thorough article (''Bohemia With a Softer Edge,'' Oct. 31), poses questions fundamental to any community and city: As neighborhoods evolve, what can be done to preserve their unique and important qualities? How can varied, often contentious local factions work together? 
 The East Village is an instructive example. As the neighborhood moves toward a greater degree of ownership, more people feel they have a stake in preserving it. Our sense of value goes beyond the merely monetary. We understand that economic, ethnic and cultural diversity are the keys to a creative, vibrant community. We know also that our low-rise building profile and low-density neighborhood encourage a familiarity and solidarity amongst the residents. The East Village has proud traditions: struggle for the poor and working class, protest and civil disobedience. 
 New organizations like the one I work with, the East Village Community Coalition, have focused on specific issues. The coalition is working with the Latino community and our councilwoman, Margarita Lopez, to oppose the demolition of such neighborhood landmarks as St. Brigid's Church and the century old P.S. 64, formerly the Charas/El Bohio Community Center.
 The East Village is a powerful piece of the city's economic engine. The city administration has a wonderful opportunity through initiatives like landmark designation and zoning reform to protect and preserve what keeps it vibrant, unique, and desirable. Development need not be thoughtless, venal, or counter-productive.

HEADLINE: Innovative Drugs, But at What Price?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 High prices for drugs in the United States subsidize the cost of drug benefits in other parts of the world, where price controls limit the chance for drug companies to achieve the benefits of innovation. But let's not look for ways to change the United States' system or the incentives in our ''free market'' economy. Our experience tells us that involving the federal government in such matters is likely to cost more and to slow the process of discovery and development.
 Rather, our government should seek opportunities in bilateral and multinational discussions to have the rest of the developed world share the costs of such innovation and permit a reasonable return on such investments outside the United States. That, in my view, would create more uniformity in pricing around the world. Buying price-controlled drugs from Canada or Europe is not the answer.

HEADLINE: Upscale Flavors on Chicago's North Side

BYLINE: By DENNIS RAY WHEATON. 
DENNIS RAY WHEATON is chief dining critic of Chicago magazine.

 BODY:
AFTER 25 years living in Chicago, I am still wandering into neighborhoods I know little about. Take Lincoln Square, on the far north side of the city. 
 I've learned that its settlement dates back to the early 1800's, but that it grew after the fire of 1871, when arrivals built modest wood-frame homes prohibited by Chicago's new fire codes. Eventually annexed, it became known as a German neighborhood, but was also home to Swedish immigrants and later to the city's largest Greek population; more recently, Eastern Europeans and Mexicans have added to the ethnic mix. 
 All their cuisines are represented in simple local establishments, but recently more upscale families and gays have arrived, and along with them, restaurants with more than neighborhood appeal.

Charlie's on Leavitt
 The newest of these stylish Lincoln Square restaurants opened in late August. It is owned by two brainy restaurateurs, Charlie Socher, who has a Ph.D. in economics, and his sister, Susan, with a Ph.D. in biology. 
 Mr. Socher has put aside the traditional French cuisine that has made his well-respected, seven-year-old Cafe Matou in Wicker Park a success for boldly seasoned contemporary American cooking under the direction of the chef Mariano Aguirre. Raised in Cuernavaca and a former sous-chef at Cafe Matou, Mr. Aquirre is responsible for the Mexican flavors in some dishes, which still show an underlying French sensibility in technique.
 The smartly outfitted interior is cozy yet feels open, with an etched-glass partition separating the bar and front dining area from the back tables. Subdued beige and brown walls are framed by polished wood floors and a warm reddish recessed wood ceiling accent. Intriguing art by a local artist, Russell Maddick, depict colorful biological and celestial designs, reflecting Susan Socher's scientific bent.
 The moment we're seated, my party is presented with two terrific white and whole-grained breads from the Red Hen Bakery, the purveyor of choice for many top Chicago restaurants (none of which, however, plop them directly on the table as servers do here). The service was similarly slapdash, but once the appetizers -- trendily called ''small plates'' -- came, all was forgiven. 
 Bias-cut chunks of hearty grilled lamb merguez benefited from the accompanying Belgian endive and ripe avocado. Even more enjoyable was the savoy cabbage and blue cheese tossed with hot bacon-Dijon mustard vinaigrette.
 Entrees -- ''big plates,'' naturally -- consist of a half-dozen regulars and two or three daily specials. Grilled salmon was pumped up with smoky chipotle mayonnaise, chunks of crisp jicama and avocado. 
 As satisfying as that was, I was more taken with the juicy, grilled, thick ''burnt chile'' pork chop served with a spicy pool of ''tres chiles'' coulis. The sauce is a deeply flavored blend of three toasted dried Mexican chilies: bitter guajillos, spicy pasillas and sweet anchos. Finished with sour cream, honey and lime, the thick juicy chop is a winner. 
 The best dessert was the baked apple with thyme-scented caramel, pecan-almond phyllo and vanilla ice cream. 
 There's a list of wines of the day by the glass, which like the regular list features choices from small independent wineries. We decided on a lush 2002 Flora Springs Napa Valley merlot ($45) that spanned all our entrees.

 In a snug converted tearoom with a lovely patio (remember it in warm weather), Michael Altenberg has created one of my favorite Chicago bistros. Mr. Altenberg has a successful modern Italian restaurant, Campagnola, farther north in Evanston, but here he has turned to classic French bistro fare. 
 This spot is a few doors south of the Old Town School of Folk Music, a place for some of the best live music in the city. Thus, sometimes tables are easier to secure later, after concerts start. 
 The menu says that the kitchen is ''committed to the use of organic food products and strongly supports the sustainable, low-impact agriculture movement''; even the list of modestly priced, mostly country French wines notes those that are from vineyards that are farmed sustainably.
 Enjoyable standards abound, among them onion soup gratinee, salade lyonnaise, snails in garlic Pernod butter and mussels steamed in Belgian ale. The latter go perfectly with one of the selection of seven Trappist ales. Recent additions to the menu include a terrific meaty terrine of oxtail with artichokes and steak tartar with just-fried lattice potato chips.
 On our most recent visit, my wife, Carol, and I skipped our old favorites of steak frites and roasted chicken with wild mushroom ragout and onion frites to focus on other offerings. Wild-caught salmon came beautifully seared, set on a bed of mellow red-wine-braised leeks. Just as successful were two more adventuresome bistro dishes: tender braised rabbit with Banyuls wine sauce, shallot confit, prunes and bacon; and deep-green braised kale and sauteed veal kidneys in brandied mustard sauce with buttered noodles. 
 A rustic 2000 Cahors Heritage from Chateau du Cedre, a mostly malbec blend from southwest France ($28), made a perfect foil.
 There were ripe artisanal cheeses, and the best desserts were the profiteroles and the puckery lemon tart. Sadly, we found the vanilla pound cake with berries unacceptably dry, a rare miss at this usually spot-on Lincoln Square bistro.

Tank Sushi
 Early one evening, before the trendier crowds swamped Tank, a family sat at the 12-seat sushi bar. The parents were teaching their inquisitive young daughter the joys of raw fish with smiling assistance from one of the four sushi chefs. 
 This happy scene captured the essence of the best new Lincoln Square restaurants: stylish yet laid back and family friendly.
 So minimalist as to be stark, with illumination bouncing off bare white walls above cork-backed banquettes, Tank is a narrow storefront with perhaps two dozen shiny black tables arrayed to one side of the sushi bar and the adjacent cocktail bar. Toward the back, there is a small private space for up to 16 diners that can be divided into two rooms. 
 There is no art on the walls except near the tandem bars, where a leaded-glass mosaic depicts fanciful red and green fish swimming in a bluish silver sea. This artwork also appears on the on the cover of the menu, which is screwed onto a laminated plastic base enclosing a layer of pressed straw. 
 The utter simplicity of the room is all the better to put the focus on the excellent sashimi and sushi, as well as 20 or so small plates, some of them pan-Asian or Asian fusion dishes, and about eight main courses.
 As we put in drink orders, Carol and I chatted with our young waitress, who told us she had worked at other sushi bars but was happy now to be working in a good one nearer her home for ''better family life.'' We ordered from the list of 16 sakes and about a dozen wines, a 500-milliliter bottle of fragrant, slightly sweet and fruity Itten Yamahai Tokubetu Junmai sake ($35).
 With so many sushi possibilities -- two dozen nori and sashimi and over 30 maki rolls -- I am always tempted to skip the rest of the menu. But there are gems there, too, and we started with delicate cylindrical shrimp shumai dumplings with ginger soy sauce and a seared beef, daikon and cucumber salad tossed with lively sesame orange dressing. 
 On this visit, we delved so deeply into the sushi that we passed on entrees. But on previous visits, we have liked the barbecued pork ribs with tamarind glaze and the miso-glazed catfish.
 I invariably begin the Tank fish-fest with the platter of 15 assorted sashimi. It is handsomely served on a blond wooden plank in a nest of shredded daikon and pungent shiso leaves. 
 As always, every fish was so pristine that we next ordered just an assortment of sushi, letting the chef choose again. The nigiri sushi were expertly formed -- not overly large as too many American sushi places are doing -- and the fish line-up was similar. 
 A friend accompanying us loves hand rolls, so we ordered three: spicy tuna, shrimp and uni. They were outstanding, made with fine dark, shiny nori wrappings, and I found the sea urchin eggs to be the best I had lucked into lately.
 Since I first fell in love with sushi decades ago as a college kid studying in Kyoto, I have been a traditionalist about the stuff, especially maki rolls. But they are harboring every imaginable ingredient nowadays. I've lately seen them made with short ribs, mozzarella and other follies. 
 So it's no surprise that my favorite maki at Tank are the bare-bones kappa maki of cucumber and sesame seeds, a savory one of shiitakes with sesame seeds and sweet ginger soy, the classic yellowtail with scallions, and even the fat futo maki, made here with omelet, gourd, spinach, cucumber and a generous amount of rock crab.
 But it's the more fanciful and fusion maki that make up most of Tank's offerings. Of those, I prefer the dramatic Alaskan Night, made with salmon, rock crab and avocado covered with black tobiko roe and sesame seeds. But I'll leave the cloying Tropic Thunder maki of yellowtail, shiitakes, avocado, wasabi mayo and too much sweet mango to others. 
 The same with the fruit tempura dessert, which ought to be reserved for a better season. I'll end a meal at Tank with a green tea mochi ice cream and the last sips of intense Japanese tea from a rustic iron cup.

Acqualina
 Two things make this new California-Mediterranean restaurant unmistakable: The translucent bar near the entrance that glows in different colors as the evening progresses, and the enticing aroma of fire-roasted mussels that so many parties quickly order. 
 Beyond a bamboo divider, the dining room is outfitted with zebra wood, exposed brick and orange light fixtures above chocolate brown banquettes and tables with candles and leather-seated chairs. A new chef, Adam Tanner, previously sous-chef at a popular North Shore bistro, Betise, came aboard only a few months after Acqualina opened in June, and he is continuing the Cal-Med theme with more consistent results.
 I, too, ordered the mussels. Set on a cast-iron comal, the roasted mussels have an alluring smoky flavor augmented by a cup of harissa butter. A packet of smoked wild salmon filled with tangy marinated cucumbers on a pool of avacado mousse with creme fraiche also charmed, as did the frittata roulade made with minced roasted peppers, sweet peas and chorizo seasoned with balsamic mayonnaise served on chickpea puree. 
 As at Charlie's on Leavitt, visible out the window across the angled three-way intersection, Aqualina's entrees include a worthwhile grilled pork chop, but prepared quite differently. The chef wades into the lately ubiquitous realm of foam with a lathering of garlic froth oozing around a plate holding the juicy chop on creamy polenta and smoky braised cabbage, but the garlic enhances the preparation. 
 Succulent lamb in zinfandel-star anise sauce benefits from a delicious ratatouille of layered thin slices of eggplant, bell peppers and tomatoes seasoned with garlic and herbs. 
 Sticky toffee pudding with warm banana cake, caramelized bananas and toffee sauce is the best dessert. 
 From the heavily Mediterranean wine list, a fresh and earthy 2002 Guelbenzu Tinto Azul Ribera Queiles, a blend of cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo from Navarre ($36), made a fitting pour at this likeable new Lincoln Square restaurant. Now, time for another stroll around the neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Life Way After Head Start 

BYLINE: By David L. Kirp. 
David L. Kirp is a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of ''Shakespeare, Einstein and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education.''

 BODY:
The power of education to level the playing field has long been an American article of faith. Education is the ''balance wheel of the social machinery,'' argued Horace Mann, the first great advocate of public schooling. ''It prevents being poor.'' But that belief has been undermined by research findings -- seized on ever since by skeptics -- that federal programs like Head Start, designed to benefit poor children, actually have little long-term impact.
 Now evidence from an experiment that has lasted nearly four decades may revive Horace Mann's faith. ''Lifetime Effects: The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study Through Age 40,'' was released earlier this week. It shows that an innovative early education program can make a marked difference in the lives of poor minority youngsters -- not just while they are in school but for decades afterward. The 123 participants in this experiment, says David Ellwood, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and an architect of the Clinton administration's original welfare reform plan, ''may be the most powerfully influential group in the recent history of social science.'' 
 The life stories of the Perry students have been tracked since they left preschool in the 1960's. Like so much in education research, the findings have been known mainly in professional circles. But this latest dispatch from the field, confirming the remarkable and enduring impact of a long-ago experience, should alter the way we understand preschool and, maybe, the way society invests in the future. 
 The study began without fanfare in the fall of 1962, several years before Head Start was conceived. In the mostly blue-collar town Ypsilanti, Mich., 21 3- and 4-year-old children started preschool. All of them, as well as 37 more youngsters who enrolled over the next three years, were black. They came from poor families, and the South Side neighborhood, with its rundown public housing and high crime rates, was a rough place to grow up.
 Based on past experience, it was a near certainty that most of these kids would fail in school. During the previous decade, not a single class in the Perry elementary school had ever scored above the 10th percentile on national achievement tests, while across town, in the school that served the children of well-off professionals, no class had ever scored below the 90th percentile.
 The reformers who developed the High/Scope Perry model hoped that exposure at an early age to a program emphasizing cognitive development could rewrite this script. Most children attended Perry for two years, three hours a day, five days a week. The curriculum emphasized problem-solving rather than unstructured play or ''repeat after me'' drills. The children were viewed as active learners, not sponges; a major part of their daily routine involved planning, carrying out and reviewing what they were learning. Teachers were well trained and decently paid, and there was a teacher for every five youngsters. They made weekly home visits to parents, helping them teach their own children. ''The message was, 'Read to your child,' '' one woman, whose daughter went to Perry in 1962, remembered. ''If you read the newspaper, put your child on your lap, read out loud and ask her, 'What did I just read?' When you take her to the grocery store, have her count the change.''
 Even though prosperous children had thrived in similar settings for well over a century, 3-year-olds from poverty backgrounds had never had the same chance. Leading developmental psychologists cautioned against the idea. Such an intellectually rigorous regime, they argued, could actually harm such children by asking too much of them.
 David Weikart, the moving force behind Perry Preschool, was not convinced. The experts had a theory but no evidence, and Weikart decided to conduct an experiment. From a group of 123 South Side neighborhood children, 58 were randomly assigned to the Perry program, while the rest, identical in virtually all respects, didn't attend preschool. Random assignment is the research gold standard because the ''treatment'' -- in this case, preschool -- best explains any subsequent differences between the two groups.
 Early results were discouraging. In reading and arithmetic, the preschoolers' achievement scores at 7 and 8 weren't much better than the control group's, and while the preschoolers' IQ scores spiked, that difference soon disappeared. Those results were consistent with the dispiriting conclusion of a 1969 nationwide evaluation of Head Start. That study's key finding -- that the boost in test scores recorded by Head Start children faded by second grade -- was widely interpreted to mean that Head Start and, by implication, most other early childhood education programs for poor kids, were a waste of time.
 But in Ypsilanti the researchers didn't give up. They collected data every year from age 3 through 11, then at ages 14, 15, 19, 27 and now 40 -- an astonishingly long time span in the research annals. Just as astonishingly, they have kept track of 97 percent of the surviving group. ''I've found people on the streets, gone to crack houses where there were AK-47's,'' said Van Loggins, a gym teacher who coached many of the participants when they were teenagers and who has been interviewing them for 25 years. ''I'm bilingual -- ghetto and English.''
 Not only has the Perry study set records for longevity, but it also asks the truly pertinent question: what is the impact of preschool, not on the test scores of 7-year-olds but on their life chances? The answer is positive -- a well-designed program really works.
 As they progressed through school, the Perry children were less likely to be assigned to a special education class for the mentally retarded. Their attitude toward school was also better, and their parents were more enthusiastic about their youngsters' schooling. Their high-school grade point average was higher. By age 19, two-thirds had graduated from high school, compared with 45 percent of those who didn't attend preschool.
 Most remarkably, the impact of those preschool years still persists. By almost any measure we might care about -- education, income, crime, family stability -- the contrast with those who didn't attend Perry is striking. When they were 27, the preschool group scored higher on tests of literacy. Now they are in their 40's, many with children and even grandchildren of their own. Nearly twice as many have earned college degrees (one has a Ph.D.). More of them have jobs: 76 percent versus 62 percent. They are more likely to own their home, own a car and have a savings account. They are less likely to have been on welfare. They earn considerably more -- $20,800 versus $15,300 -- and that difference pushes them well above the poverty line.
 The crime statistics reveal similarly significant differences. Compared with the control group, fewer preschoolers have gone on to be arrested for violent crimes, drug-related crimes or property crimes. Only about half as many (28 percent versus 52 percent) have been sentenced to prison or jail. Preschool also seems to have affected their decisions about family life. More of the males in the Perry contingent have been married (68 percent versus 51 percent, though they are also more likely than those who didn't attend Perry to have been married more than once) and almost twice as many have raised their own children (57 percent versus 30 percent). These men report fewer serious complaints about their health and are less likely to use drugs.
 The newest report attaches a dollar-and-cents figure to this good news. Economists estimate that the return to society is more than $250,000 (calculated in 2000 dollars) on an investment of just $15,166 -- that's 17 dollars for every dollar invested.
 There are no miracles here. Not everyone who attended Perry became a model citizen -- the crime figures alone make that plain -- and some of those who didn't attend preschool have fared well. But because their opportunities are so constricted, the odds are stacked against kids who grow up in neighborhoods like Ypsilanti's South Side. Bluntly put, these are the children of whom we expect the least -- and overall, the life histories of the control group confirm those expectations.
 By contrast, many of those who went to Perry found their way to more stable lives. One graduate, a sales manager, has moved back to the South Side neighborhood, where he devotes much of his time to his church group, ''giving back'' to the community. ''I'm still using the discipline of school,'' he said. ''The harder you work in school or in life, the more you get out of it.'' One Perry alum said that when she was in her mid-20's, living on welfare and ''borrowing'' from her mother, she ''woke up one day to decide that was just wrong. I apologized to my mother and went to work in the factory. When I had the money, I bought Mom all new living-room furniture. I stopped dating the wrong kind of guys, and eventually I got married.'' Now she's a union leader, and when she had children of her own, there was no doubt they'd go to preschool.
 Why did Perry have such an impact? Though the data can't provide a definitive answer, a plausible interpretation is that the experience proved to be a timely intervention, altering the arc of these children's lives. Preschool gave them the intellectual tools to do better in school. When they succeeded academically, they became more committed to education, and so they stayed on. Then, because a diploma opened up new economic opportunities, crime proved a less appealing alternative.
 The strategy first developed at Perry is now packaged as the High/Scope curriculum and is widely used across the nation. Other well-conceived preschool initiatives have also generated impressive long-term results, including the Chicago school district's Child-Parent Center Program, which brings mothers and relatives into the schools, and the Carolina Abecedarian Project, in which intervention begins during the very first weeks of an infant's life and carries on until kindergarten.
 These successes have given ammunition to those who champion expanded preschool opportunities -- not just for poor children but for all children. Oklahoma and Georgia have been leaders in the movement for universal prekindergarten, and two years ago, Florida became the first state to pass a constitutional amendment requiring ''high quality'' preschool for all 4-year-olds. ''I testified in Florida,'' said Evelyn Moore, one of the original teachers at Perry Preschool, who is now president of the National Black Child Development Institute. ''The research has been vital in getting people to understand why early childhood education matters.'' Give us the child to age 7, the Jesuits say, and we'll give you the man. Give us the child at age 3, these findings suggest, and with quality preschool it's possible to work wonders.

HEADLINE: Oil and Deficit Worries End an Autumn Rally

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market's autumn rally hit a pothole on Friday, as large declines in all three major indexes offset gains earlier in the week, pulling the main market gauges into weekly losses for the first time since before the presidential election.
 Friday's losses came as oil prices spiked upward and after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that foreign investors would eventually have a ''diminished appetite'' for financing the United States' current account deficit. 
He also said that interest rates were bound to rise, remarks that immediately drove up rates in the bond market. 
 Shares of Sears, Roebuck rose 15.1 percent for the week, among the largest gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The stock climbed after Kmart said it would buy Sears for $11 billion.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 82.10 points, or 0.78 percent, to close at 10,456.91. The S.&P. dropped by 13.83 points, or 1.17 percent, to close at 1,170.34. The Nasdaq composite index fell by 14.71 points, or 0.71 percent, to close at 2.070.63.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.20 percent from 4.18 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: International Conference Expected to Add to Support of Democracy for Iraqis

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
A resolution supporting Iraq's political democratization, territorial integrity and reconstruction is expected to be the main result of an international conference on Monday and Tuesday at Sharm el Sheik, a popular Egyptian resort.
 Diplomats from various countries say the United States has won agreement from Arab, European and Asian nations for a resolution that, while largely symbolic, is intended to support Iraq's drive toward democracy, but has run into skepticism about a proposal for elections to occur as planned in January.
 Organizers say the conference was conceived in September, arising from the desire of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi of Iraq to hold an international meeting to gain legitimacy for his government and to pressure Iran and Syria to stop using their territory to aid insurgents in Iraq.
 But European and Arab diplomats who were drawn into the conference said they suspected that President Bush embraced it because it could be used to rebut the charge by Senator John Kerry, his Democratic foe in the presidential race, that the administration had failed to enlist Arab and European support for the Iraq war. 
 The conference is to be attended by Arab nations around Iraq, the leading industrial democracies of the Group of 8, and by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and the permanent members of the Security Council, including China.
 Security in Iraq remains grave, foiling efforts to rebuild cities and neighborhoods so that Iraqis can be confident in the democratic process. Some diplomats who will go to the conference say they doubt that it, alone, will improve things much.
 ''Once somebody had the bright idea of having this meeting, no one wanted to quash it, and it has taken on a life of its own,'' said one official who will attend. ''But the Egyptians and the Americans are high on it, and will say it's a success.''
 Bush administration officials say they expect to persuade participants to agree on three ideas: supporting the Iraqi political process while calling for inclusion of Sunni and other dissidents; demanding that Syria, Iran and other neighbors bar what the administration says is cross-border infiltration of aid to the insurgents; and broadening international economic aid.
 An official familiar with the drafting of the resolution said it was unlikely to support calling for elections by Jan. 31, because of mounting concern over security problems since the assault on Falluja and the anger it caused. ''The conference will probably not go out on a limb on the question of elections,'' the official said. ''There is a lot of doubt that elections can take place, or at least that credible elections can take place. The resolution will instead emphasize the process rather than the date.''
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell will arrive in Sharm el Sheik on Tuesday for meetings on the Israeli-Palestinian situation and for what aides say might be an encounter with the foreign ministers of Syria and Iran. Some administration officials say talks with both might be substantive on ways to improve relations.
 Since the conference was announced, international aid efforts have continued to lag, Hungary has said it intends to pull troops out and prospects for more from other countries are few. Supplementing the American force of nearly 140,000 troops in Iraq are about 24,000 troops from other countries. Nearly half of those troops are from Britain.
 Only about $1.8 billion of the $18.4 billion appropriated by Congress for Iraq's reconstruction has been disbursed.
 Mr. Powell and other administration officials have said repeatedly that they see no reason the Iraqi elections cannot occur in January. But interviews with many other diplomats and officials in Europe and the Arab world indicate that the doubts that have emerged among many Iraqis are widely shared. 
 ''If things remain as they are now, I just cannot see how the elections can be held,'' said a diplomat who was in Iraq recently. ''There are supposed to be 30,000 election places. How are they going to be protected? How are you going to secure voting in Baghdad when you can't secure streets only a mile from the Green Zone?''
 American officials say the conference will be a boost for Iraq irrespective of the questions of elections.
 ''The real value will be in mobilizing the regional players and others who have a deep stake in the stability and security of Iraq,'' said a senior administration official.

HEADLINE: Next Up for Spitzer: Funny Numbers

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ELIOT SPITZER, the New York attorney general, has already exposed insurance industry secrets like bid-rigging and hidden commissions. Now he is training his spotlight on an even murkier part of that universe: the buying and selling of insurance policies that artificially bolster companies' financial statements.
 The policies in question are known as finite insurance or financial reinsurance. They are sold as ordinary insurance policies, which allow companies that buy them to receive favorable accounting treatment -- smoothing out losses on their books, for example. 
 To critics, however, the policies are structured less like insurance and more like loans. At heart, they say, finite insurance is simply a form of financial engineering that masks the strength or weakness at the companies that buy them. As such, its use has probably had a much greater impact on investors and customers than other industry practices that Mr. Spitzer has singled out. 
 The deals offer an especially rich vein for investigators to mine, industry analysts say. And last week, Mr. Spitzer sent out a flurry of subpoenas to insurers -- including Ace Ltd., the St. Paul Travelers Companies and Zurich Financial Services -- about policies they may have sold to help customers eliminate or offset losses that would have hurt their financial results. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are also scrutinizing financial engineering products sold by insurers. All three companies said they were cooperating, but they declined to comment further. 
 By far the biggest customers for such policies are insurers themselves, so investigators will be looking at how these companies may have used these contracts to make their books look better. As regulators unravel these arrangements, industry analysts say, they are likely to discover a labyrinth of deals among insurance companies that are often routed through tax havens in Bermuda or the Caribbean.
 Given the complexity and secrecy of such deals -- they are often not disclosed on insurers' financial statements and require a good bit of detective work to find -- cases related to them may not come to light for some time. But industry analysts who have uncovered some of the arrangements on their own in recent years say that their use is widespread.
 No one knows for sure how large the market is for such policies. Robert Arvanitis, president of Risk Finance Advisors, a corporate finance advisory firm in Westport, Conn., that specializes in insurance, estimates that in any given year, $50 billion of all insurance premiums involve policies with some kind of finite element. 
 Some of the policies have been sold to companies like Honeywell, the diversified technology giant, and Brightpoint Inc., a cellphone maker. But most of these deals are struck among insurance companies. The arrangements allow insurers to bolster their net worth or surplus, a figure that investors check when weighing an insurer's financial soundness. Indeed, some deals have masked declining financial positions at both life and property-casualty insurance companies that later failed or are now on the edge.
 Finite insurance benefits customers in several ways. For one thing, it allows a company to avoid having to record a loss as a lump-sum deduction from its books; instead, it can spread out the loss over a predetermined period. For another, the insurance premium that companies pay for the policy is tax deductible. And if the loss a company anticipates never materializes, policy holders even get back some of the premium they paid.
 FOR the companies that buy the policies, not having to report a loss means that their surplus -- the crucial measure of their soundness and the figure that decides how much new business can be written -- does not take a hit. This is why finite insurance often shows up on the books of weaker insurers.
 The trouble is that buyers of such coverage are mortgaging their future earnings power. In effect, they are giving up the investment income they would have earned on the money they used to pay the policy's premium. That is something investors in insurance stocks would clearly want to know about.
 The biggest risk in such a policy, however, emerges when a regulator or auditor decides that it is not really insurance, in which true risk is transferred from one party to another, but a financing arrangement in which the premium paid by the company buying the coverage is seen as a deposit or a loan. In such a case, the beneficial accounting treatment disappears.
 ''As users of financial statements, we believe that the volatility of an insurer's accounting results should reflect the volatility of the underlying economic results,'' said Michael J. Barry, a managing director at Fitch Ratings, a ratings agency in New York that holds a negative view of these policies. ''But most finite insurance results in a disconnect between those two.'' As a result, Fitch tries to discount the financial effect of such deals when it assesses insurers' financial positions.
 Finite insurance has been around since the 1960's, but the first company set up specifically to sell such policies, Centre Reinsurance, was started more than 20 years later. In 1988, Guy Carpenter, a reinsurance subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan, was instrumental in creating Centre Re. To some degree, the finite insurance products that Centre Re and others began to sell in the 1990's simply represented a way for the industry to formalize what insurers had been doing informally for decades.
 But it wasn't until the late 1990's that finite insurance took off. At that time, too many insurers were chasing too few customers, and premiums and profits were in decline. It was, in industry parlance, a soft insurance market.
 Hoping to increase the amount of premiums they took in, insurance companies became highly creative about the financial reinsurance products they were selling. At the time, financial services firms were acquiring insurance companies and integrating them into their operations. Perhaps inevitably, finance and insurance began to converge.
 In a June 2001 discussion about finite insurance that appeared on Guy Carpenter's Web site, Michele Fleckenstein, a managing director at the company and head of its Finite Specialty Initiative, said its finite programs were growing more than 25 percent annually in previous years. 
 She explained why: ''Companies are facing escalating pressure, both internally and externally, to protect their business plans and achieve forecasted results. The need for these covers stems from the extreme pressure that companies face to make planned results and not have any surprises.''
 To be sure, all insurance is designed to ameliorate the effects of negative ''surprises'' -- say, fires or floods. But increasingly, the types of surprises that finite insurance was intended to mitigate were those that led to volatile company earnings or asset write-downs.
 In January 1999, Reliance Insurance introduced a product it called Enterprise Earnings Protection Insurance. Reliance executives said the policies were designed for midsize companies interested in protecting their earnings from situations like a disruption in the supply chain or a loss of important customers.
 It is not clear exactly how much of this insurance was sold. Reliance failed spectacularly in 2001, under a mountain of debt.
 The American International Group, one of the world's largest insurance companies, is often at the forefront of developing new insurance products. In 1997, it created a policy that combined traditional insurance with coverage of financial risks and sold it to Honeywell. A double-barreled policy, it covered both Honeywell's currency risk and its more traditional risks, like increased workers' compensation claims. The policy eliminated Honeywell's need to hedge its currency risks with derivative contracts that were costly and not tax deductible, the way insurance premiums are. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are based on another asset.
 The policy, as described on an A.I.G. Web site, is called a Coin, for commodity embedded insurance. Among its benefits, according to the site, is the ''attractive tax and accounting treatment'' that may be available in ''this blended insurance program.'' It also ''protects earnings from unexpected or unintended losses,'' the site says.
 But the coverage of possible currency losses by the policy resembled a derivative contract, as the Financial Accounting Standards Board said in 2001. It ruled that if the program involved little risk, it was not insurance and would have to be treated as a derivative contract and applied to its books. That would have eliminated the appeal of the policy.
 Accounting rule makers, however, leave it up to the company to determine whether and how much risk is involved. So companies using such blended products may have been encouraged to overstate the risk to achieve the desired accounting treatment.
 Joe Norton, an A.I.G. spokesman, said Honeywell was the only company to buy a Coin. The contract ran for two and a half years, he said, and had a significant risk transfer component. He said Coins had not been marketed since 1999, and that it was an oversight that its description had not been removed from the Web site.
 An official at Honeywell did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 A.I.G. also sold Brightpoint a different kind of finite insurance that helped that company hide $11.9 billion in losses in 1998, running afoul of the S.E.C. The insurer paid $10 million to settle the matter with the S.E.C., neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. But when regulators announced the settlement of the case in September 2003, they said A.I.G. helped mislead investors by selling Brightpoint a ''new 'insurance' product that A.I.G. had developed and marketed for the specific purpose of helping issuers to report false financial information to the public.''
 This is the defining characteristic of finite insurance, according to Mr. Arvanitis at Risk Finance Advisors. ''Anything that ultimately reduces the loss borne but doesn't change the accounting, or when there is a disconnect between the accounting for risk and actual incidence of risk, that is finite,'' he said. ''Essentially, you're saying you made money and you didn't.''
 As such, the most severe threat inherent in financial reinsurance is to investors who buy insurance stocks and to consumers who buy coverage from insurance companies. In both cases, finite insurance can mask problems at insurers. 
 As the analysts at Fitch have noted, insurers who are in distress are often heavy users of finite insurance. For example, in 2001, the Kemper Insurance Companies executed two large finite transactions, known as retroactive policies, that covered losses already incurred. 
 In a 2002 report, Fitch analysts noted that the effect of these transactions reduced Kemper's surplus by 15 percent. ''Without the aid of various financial engineering tools,'' the report noted, Kemper's surplus would have declined to $1.12 billion at year-end 2001 from the $1.5 billion the company reported in its financial statements.
 After a failed expansion plan and severe downgrades by financial ratings agencies, Kemper began exiting the business in 2003.
 OF course, it is unclear what regulators will find as they delve more deeply into financial reinsurance. If companies misled auditors by claiming true risk transfer simply to get favorable insurance bookkeeping treatment, they could be subject to civil suits accusing them of accounting irregularities. David D. Brown IV, the head of investor protection in the New York attorney general's office, is in charge of the insurance investigation.
 But even if their accounting proves to have been accurate, that may not be the end of it. With finite insurance high on regulators' radar screens, it is now much more likely that some companies holding the policies will undo them to avoid attracting the attention of prosecutors, creating more problems for an industry that is already up to its neck in trouble, thanks to Mr. Spitzer. 
 This month, Platinum Underwriters Holdings canceled a financial reinsurance transaction that it had struck with Berkshire Hathaway. Platinum's executives said that increased regulatory interest in finite insurance had compelled them to re-examine the deals they had made.
 It is also possible that new sales of these policies will simply sputter. Either way, the implications for buyers and sellers of the insurance would be huge.
 ''There is a sniff test here,'' said Mr. Barry of Fitch Ratings. ''Are the buyers and sellers of the insurance exposing themselves to operational risk? Is there a regulator who will come in and say, 'I don't like this transaction, and you have to unwind it?' There are consequences.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about insurance contracts that can help companies burnish their results misstated the amount by which Brightpoint Inc., a cellphone maker, was able to reduce its losses in 1998 through such a contract. It was $11.9 million, not billion.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Under Pressure to Serve as Haven for Refugees

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
North Korea's brand-new embassy, painted pink and protected by coils of barbed wire, opened three months ago on Revolutionaries' Avenue, one block behind Government House.
 ''They are watching us very closely,'' Tsakhia Elbegdorj, Mongolia's new prime minister, said in an interview here, half joking.
 But to American and South Korean advocates for North Korean refugees, North Korea's new diplomatic presence here, after a five-year absence for economic reasons, is seen as an attempt to block efforts to make Mongolia a haven and processing center for defectors from the authoritarian state.
 In the United States, the campaign to ease the plight of fleeing North Koreans is increasingly a mainstream cause. 
 Concerned Women for America, a public policy organization that claims 500,000 members, is organizing prayer groups for North Korea's persecuted Christians. Liberation in North Korea, or LiNK, a new American university-based organization, has held rallies in New York and Los Angeles, protesting China's deportation of 62 refugees to North Korea. Formed six months ago on the model of the 1970's campaign to free Soviet Jews, LiNK has mushroomed to include 70 chapters and a headquarters office in New York.
 Bolstered by President Bush's re-election and a new American law that calls for spending $20 million a year to help North Korea's refugees, refugee advocates would like to see Mongolia, sandwiched between Russia and China, play roughly the same role as Portugal's during World War II; a neutral state where refugees could be processed for settlement in other countries, preferably by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Mongolia has plenty of room, foreign human rights advocates say. Twice the size of Texas with only 2.4 million people, Mongolia is one of the least densely populated nations on the planet. But Mongolia's government has yet to embrace the idea.
 ''We are one of the few countries in the world that enjoys very good relations with both Koreas,'' Foreign Minister Tsend Munh-Orgil said in an interview here. ''Frankly, I don't think we would look favorably on setting up camps of any nature on the territory of our country.''
 Mr. Munh-Orgil, a Harvard-trained lawyer, said Mongolia would continue its policy of receiving refugees at border crossings. If they are found to be North Koreans, they are fed and housed until they can be sent on to a country that will take them, usually South Korea.
 ''They cannot be pushed back into Chinese territory, no matter whoever they are,'' he said, emphasizing that Mongolia's border police have orders not to hand refugees over to China, on the most common route for people fleeing North Korea.
 But refugee advocates watched with wariness the arrival this fall of the North Korean diplomats and several hundred North Korean construction workers on labor contracts.
 A few weeks ago, South Korean diplomats moved a holding center for North Koreans awaiting transfer to Seoul out of Ulan Bator, the capital, to an undisclosed location. 
 In the past month, officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as South Korean government officials, legislators and Christian pastors, have come here to investigate the North Korean refugee situation. Last year, about 100 North Korean refugees were transferred from Mongolia to South Korea.
 The new American legislation eases the granting of asylum to North Koreans. In a survey of 100 North Korean refugees in South Korea conducted in September by Segye Times, a Seoul newspaper, 69 percent said they wanted to proceed to Western countries like the United States, Canada and Australia rather than stay in South Korea.
 South Korea's government, which works hard to avoid angering North Korea, also opposes opening a United Nations-administered refugee processing camp. In parliamentary testimony this month, South Korea's vice foreign minister, Choi Young Jin, dismissed the idea of such a camp in Mongolia as unrealistic. 
 In response, American supporters are asking the Bush administration to pressure Mongolia and South Korea. Suzanne Scholte, president of the Defense Forum Foundation, based in Washington, said by e-mail: ''If the U.S. weighed in with Mongolia, it would seal the deal. The U.S. needs to counterweigh this opposition.''
 Mongolia tries to be evenhanded with the two Koreas. Mongolian officials say their country, which shifted to a market economy in the early 1990's after almost 70 years of Communism, can provide lessons to North Korea, under Communist rule for almost 60 years.
 But the economic relationship with the Koreas is lopsided, favoring South Korea. There are daily flights between here and Seoul; about 20,000 Mongolians are working in South Korea; and South Korean investors here are building apartment blocks, television stations, a shopping center and a cellphone company. 
 Refugee advocates argue that Mongolia can afford to take a harder line with North Korea. 
 ''There are nearly 20,000 Mongolian workers in South Korea; that was a big leverage,'' said Kim Moon Soo, a South Korean congressman who sought to win support for a processing camp in meetings with his Mongolian counterparts here on Nov. 6. Interviewed later in Seoul, he said, ''If Mongolians want to come to South Korea, why can't North Koreans go to Mongolia?''

HEADLINE: After Election Day, A Vote to Leave

BYLINE: By ALEX MARKELS

 BODY:
FOR most John Kerry supporters, it went no further than an idle election night threat. 
 ''I'm moving to Canada!'' some joked after the television networks called Florida for President Bush. 
 ''I'll check out New Zealand,'' others quipped as Ohio blinked red on the televised map. 
 But to Pamela Branch, it was no joking matter. Deeply disturbed over the Iraq war and what she says is the country's sharply rightward political turn under President Bush, the 34-year-old nurse anesthetist from Long Beach, Calif., and her fiance, Kyle Powell, 32, a neurobiologist, had already considered a move out of the country. ''We were of the mind that, maybe, possibly we'd stay if Kerry wins,'' Ms. Branch said of her fleeting hopes on election night. But as the United States map turned increasingly red, ''I was like, 'We've got to get out of here.''' 
 So the next morning, she mailed in her application for Canadian residency. She was hardly the only one to express interest in Canadian citizenship. From an average of 20,000 daily visits, the Canadian government's Citizenship and Immigration Canada Web site -- www.cic.gc.ca -- logged more than 150,000 visits on Nov. 3. The site, which allows prospective immigrants to assess their chances for admittance and download application forms, has since hovered at about triple the average number of visits, according to a government spokesman.
 Although it's too early to tell whether such interest will translate into an increase in the 5,000 to 6,000 Americans who take up residence in Canada annually, immigration lawyers there report a spike in American clients.
 Meanwhile, immigration experts in New Zealand, Panama and elsewhere have noted similar jumps in interest from Americans since the election. ''Based on what we're seeing, there may be millions of people planning on leaving the country,'' said Roger Gallo, the founder of www.escapeartist.com, a Web site that focuses on living abroad. The site has logged a large increase in inquiries since President Bush was first elected in 2000, and a doubling in Web site visitors to about 140,000 a day after the Nov. 2 election.
 Filled with primers on getting foreign residency status and buying real estate, it serves as an information clearinghouse for would-be expatriates. 
 Such an increase would represent a stark departure from the past when -- even at the height of the Vietnam War, when many young men fled to Canada to escape the military draft -- emigration of native-born Americans has long been estimated only in the tens of thousands annually, according to Ellen Percy Kraly, a geography professor at Colgate University who studies emigration from the United States. 
 Based on those who register voluntarily at consulates around the globe, the United States government estimates that there are currently three million to four million Americans living outside the country, a number that hasn't changed much in recent years. But because it doesn't actually count those exiting the country, ''it's almost impossible to know how many people are leaving,'' Professor Kraly said. That said, ''there is almost certainly an increase at the fringe of American society,'' she added.
 In past decades, much of that has been among libertarians, retirees and other so-called ''economic refugees'' seeking a lower cost of living and reduced taxes. ''But now I'm seeing fewer of the tax rebels and more of the intellectual and political refugees,'' Mr. Gallo said, citing growing interest in countries including Canada, New Zealand and Spain. ''The people who are fleeing because of taxes go to places like Panama, which is very laissez faire economically. But the ones who are more politically motivated go to places like Canada.''
 That is certainly the reasoning behind Michelle Paymar's recent decision to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, in part because in 2003, Canadian courts ruled that gay marriage was protected by the country's constitution. A lifelong resident of Los Angeles, the 47-year-old documentary filmmaker and her partner, Veronique Delaney, who is French and has so far been unable to get a green card, have been trying to find a way to stay in the United States.
 ''We were hoping that a Kerry administration might support the Permanent Partners Immigration Act,'' Ms. Paymar said, referring to legislation proposed last year that would provide same-sex partners of American citizens the same immigration rights as legal spouses now have. ''But it was wishful thinking.'' 
 To hedge their bets, the couple recently hired a Canadian immigration lawyer and took a house-hunting trip to Vancouver early this fall, when they quickly acquired a taste for Canada's institutionalized inclusiveness. ''We were renting a car and wanted to add Veronique as a second driver, which normally costs extra if you're not married,'' Ms. Paymar recalled. ''But the agent told us, 'No charge for spouses.' It was the first time in my life that someone treated my relationship like something completely normal!'' 
 Their sense of welcome only increased as their real estate agent ushered them into a beautiful two-bedroom condominium overlooking the city. ''She warned us that prices were so high that we'd get zero for our money,'' Ms. Paymar said. ''But compared with Los Angeles, it felt like a relative bargain.''
 Despite a steady decline in the American dollar's value against its Canadian counterpart since last year, a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment on the downtown Vancouver waterfront with sweeping views of Coal Harbour can still be had for about $400,000 (in American currency), including a parking space and access to an indoor swimming pool and gym. ''It definitely felt like a better investment than anything I could buy in California right now,'' said Ms. Paymar, who decided to buy an apartment even before she and her partner officially obtain residency.
 The process can take as long as two years, including a lengthy application in which would-be immigrants are judged on a point system that takes education, job skills, language, offers of employment and even age into account. Though Ms. Paymar is at the high end of Canada's ideal immigrant age of 21 through 49, as a skilled worker, ''I don't foresee any problems for her,'' said Michael Battista, her Canadian lawyer.
 College educated and skilled, Ms. Branch and Mr. Powell are also good candidates. They are considering Toronto, in part because ''as black people we want to occasionally see other people who look like us,'' Ms. Branch said. 
 The only down side is that her nurse-anesthetist credential isn't accepted in Canada. ''I'd have to take a job as a regular nurse, which would mean a huge pay cut,'' she said. So she and her fiance are also investigating other countries, including Spain, which accepts her medical credentials. ''And we love Zapatero,'' Ms. Branch said of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's new Socialist prime minister. ''On top of the Spanish culture and food and dance, to have this total progressive who stands up to Bush and the Catholic Church is irresistible.'' 
 Still, she knows such a move would be difficult. So to start out, she and Mr. Powell plan on renting instead of buying -- probably a smart move considering that Spain is experiencing housing price inflation even more severe than that in parts of the United States, according to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund. ''We just want to get our feet wet,'' Ms. Branch said. ''But if Bush goes berserk and starts bombing Iran, I doubt we'd go back.''

HEADLINE: Olympics Would Bolster New York's Image, But Some Benefits Are Uncertain

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki led thousands of Olympic athletes and their supporters across the Brooklyn Bridge 10 days ago with the city's official bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, echoing the parade 121 years ago that opened what was then the longest suspension bridge in the world.
 For supporters of the city's enormous Olympic effort, having the Games in New York City would be almost as important a link in the city's economic life as the bridge itself. Mr. Bloomberg says the Olympics would leave a legacy critical to the future of the city: drawing more tourists to New York; creating new sports fields, parks and housing; and producing important public works projects, including an extended No. 7 subway line, an expanded Javits Convention Center and a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
 The prospect of seeing the Olympic Games played across the five boroughs instead of watching it on television has excited members of a largely Haitian-American soccer league in Queens and many of the 2,000 students in the Intermediate School 96 after-school sports program in Bensonhurst, as well as hotel and tourism executives who see the Games as a way to enhance the city's international popularity and strengthen the industry. The city's construction industry and several unions have also embraced the Olympics as a jobs bonanza. 
 ''There is no bigger stage in the world than New York City to put on an event,'' said Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of the city's convention and visitors bureau and chief executive of Loews Hotels. ''This is not about putting us on the map. We're already the No. 1 city in the world. This'll reinforce that position and allow us to bring a future vitality to the economy through the travel and tourism industry. The construction jobs and the infrastructure for the Olympics will benefit us for decades to come.''
 The Games are expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors and a worldwide audience. Mr. Bloomberg and the city's bid committee, NYC2012, say they hope to sell 9.4 million tickets for the Games, which they say would add more than $12 billion to the economy and create more than 135,000 jobs. For many supporters, in fact, the city's very identity is at stake in the bid.
 ''If New York can't host large conventions, if it can't have a home for its football team, or if it can't host a Super Bowl or the Olympic Games, then New Yorkers have to think about the unthinkable: New York is not the greatest city in the world,'' said Frank J. Sciame, a developer and the chairman of the New York Building Congress, a trade group. ''It's been too long that we've been playing second fiddle to cities that can do these things.''
 But just like the crowd in the bleachers of any stadium, opinions vary widely. Although few people oppose the idea of a New York Olympics outright, many critics question major elements of what is a $10.6 billion plan, including at least $600 million in state and city tax money for an Olympic stadium on the West Side that would also be used for New York Jets games and other events. Some New Yorkers say the inconvenience of the sizable security precautions, which are expected to cost more than $100 million, and the traffic tie-ups caused by the Games make the city a poor location.
 Thomas Bender, a history professor at New York University, said that tying the city's public works needs to the Olympic Games might establish a distorted set of priorities.
 ''I don't know that we have a problem with the world knowing where we are,'' Mr. Bender said. ''If we need athletic fields, subways or roads, I think we should do them on our own, instead of having the Olympics, which will produce a distorted version of what we need.''
 Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College near Chicago who is analyzing the impact of this year's Games in Athens for the Greek government, said the short- and long-term benefits could differ depending on a city's needs and its prominence. The Olympic deadlines galvanized the Greek government to build subways, a modern airport and highways, he said, all of which were greatly needed, as well as softball fields and other sites that may now go unused. Barcelona redeveloped its waterfront for the Games and became a popular tourist destination after the Olympics. 
 ''But Barcelona was a relatively undiscovered city,'' Mr. Baade said. ''Paris, London, New York and the other cities vying for the 2012 Games are already discovered. You're not going to see people flocking to London or New York because they saw images of those cities during the Games.''
 It is also debatable, he said, how much demand there will be after the Games for some projects that would be built, including the $30.2 million Olympic Whitewater Center at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, or the $65.3 million Greenbelt Equestrian Center in Staten Island. The annual cost of keeping those sites open is also not clear. 
 But despite the criticism of individual projects or skepticism about the long-term benefits of the Games, few New Yorkers have said the city should not have submitted a bid. Even the Dolan family, which controls Madison Square Garden and has spent millions on ads opposing the proposed West Side stadium, says it is in favor of the city's bid. So do other stadium critics, like Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum and City Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn.
 Michael T. Cohen, a local real estate executive who said he was skeptical that the city would win the Games away from Paris, expressed concern that the city had tied its shaky proposal for the stadium to other projects like the subway extension. He is one of the rare real estate executives to say publicly that such projects are more important than the stadium.
 ''I personally would love to see the Olympics come to New York,'' said Mr. Cohen, president of GVA Williams Real Estate. ''But New York doesn't need the Olympics. New York does need the No. 7 subway line extended and the Javits expanded.''
 Peter J. Solomon, a former deputy mayor for economic development in the Koch administration, said he disagreed with Mayor Bloomberg's insistence on equating opposition to the West Side stadium with opposition to the Olympics. But he also said the Games would unify the city and create the political will to build projects that would not otherwise be possible.
 ''If you look at the Olympics not as a sporting event, but as the revitalization of New York City, the brilliance of the city's plan is that it incorporates almost every idea we've been working on for 30 years,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''It would open up the waterfront. It builds housing and expands the Javits.''
 Under the city's bid, for instance, a private developer would build a $1.6 billion 4,400-unit Olympic Village for the athletes on the Queens waterfront. After the Games, the village would become market-rate housing. And the Brooklyn site for beach volleyball and aquatics would be converted into the Williamsburg Waterfront Park.
 But for Pierre St. Fleur, who runs a predominantly Haitian soccer club in St. Albans, Queens, the attraction is the Games themselves. 
 ''It would be an exciting thing for immigrants and New Yorkers,'' he said. ''In New York you find every country in the world and every country in the world is represented in the Olympics. People would want to go to see the Games, especially when their own country is playing.''
 For many supporters, in fact, the attraction of the Games is principally one of emotion and proximity. Sandro Martorella, vice president of the American Juniors Soccer Club in Flushing, Queens, and coach of an under-14 soccer team, the Blue Angels, said he was particularly glad the committee was planning to build sports facilities at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
 ''They'll see things they haven't seen before,'' he said of his soccer players. ''They'll feel very proud of New York City.''
 In Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Darrien Huntley and Andrianna Collesso, both sixth graders in the I.S. 96 Beacon after-school program were clearly excited about the possibility of the Games coming to New York. Darrien, 11, said that he was particularly interested because he had raced in his school's mini-Olympics for the last three years, coming in either first or second.
 ''I hope it actually comes,'' said Andrianna. ''I'd like to see it up close, live. I'm very excited.''

HEADLINE: House Leadership Blocks Vote on Intelligence Bill

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders blocked and appeared to kill a bill Saturday that would have enacted the major recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission, refusing to allow a vote on the legislation despite last-minute pleas from both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to Republican lawmakers for a compromise before Congress adjourned for the year.
 The decision to block a vote on the landmark bill, which would have created the job of a cabinet-level national intelligence director to oversee the C.I.A. and the government's other spy agencies, came after what lawmakers from both parties described as a near-rebellion by a core of highly conservative House Republicans aligned with the Pentagon who were emboldened to stand up to their leadership and to the White House.
 The bill would have forced the Pentagon, which controls an estimated 80 percent of the government's $40 billion intelligence budget, to cede much of its authority on intelligence issues to a national intelligence director.
 ''What you are seeing is the forces in favor of the status quo protecting their turf, whether it is Congress or in the bureaucracy,'' said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who was the chief Senate author of the failed compromise bill, in what amounted to a slap at her Republican counterparts in the House. 
 The chairman of the Sept. 11 commission, Thomas H. Kean, a Republican and the former governor of New Jersey, said that the lawmakers who blocked the vote should be held accountable by the public, and he blamed senior Pentagon officials as well. 
 ''I think there's no question that there are people in the Pentagon who want the status quo, and they fought very hard with their allies in Congress for the status quo,'' Mr. Kean said.
 The decision to block a vote was announced by the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, who said that his members had determined that the bill hammered out by a House-Senate conference committee earlier in the day might dangerously dilute the authority of the military commanders over intelligence issues and could ''endanger our troops in the field.'' 
 ''It's hard to reform; it's hard to make change,'' Mr. Hastert said, only hours after House and Senate negotiators ended a monthlong stalemate and announced their agreement. ''We are going to keep working on this.''
 While Mr. Hastert said that the negotiations would continue and that as a result he would not formally adjourn the House for the year, many lawmakers said the action had effectively killed the legislation. Saturday was supposed to be the last day of business for the House and Senate in their so-called lame-duck session after the election, with many lawmakers not expected to return to Washington until January.
 The decision to block a vote was seen by the bill's proponents and others in Congress as a surprising embarrassment to the president, who had personally intervened as late as Friday night to pressure rebellious House Republicans to agree on an intelligence bill, and to Mr. Hastert, who had signaled that he wanted the legislation and was willing to overrule the opposition from within his ranks.
 Congressional officials said that Mr. Bush had telephoned a leading Republican critic of the bill, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, from Air Force One on Friday en route to a economic summit meeting in Chile to urge him to compromise.
 They said a similar call was made Saturday morning by Mr. Cheney to the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Duncan Hunter of California, who has long warned that the creation of a national intelligence director could interfere with the military chain of command as American troops continue to fight in Iraq.
 But the calls were to no avail, since House and Senate negotiators agreed that the continuing opposition of Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Hunter and a handful of other influential Republicans had tipped the balance for Mr. Hastert in deciding to block a vote.
 Less than three weeks after Democrats suffered a stinging defeat at the polls, the bill's failure could provide Democratic leaders with a political opening to argue -- along with members of the Sept. 11 commission and the families of victims of the terrorist attacks -- that House Republicans killed a bill that had widespread, bipartisan support and that would have allowed the government to protect the public better against terrorist threats.
 ''Today, the House Republicans missed an opportunity to make the American people safer,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. ''Their inability to overhaul our intelligence system is a staggering failure.'' 
 Representative Jane Harman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and one of the authors of the compromise bill, said, ''This is a tragedy for America.'' Ms. Harman added, ''If there is another major terrorist attack on our soil -- and sadly, there will likely be one -- we will have only ourselves to blame. Congress had a chance to protect America, and Congress failed.''
 The decision appeared also to reflect a sharp split between Republicans in the House and Senate. Senate Republicans voted unanimously last month to support a version of the intelligence bill that had been endorsed by both the Sept. 11 commission and the White House and that would have granted sweeping budget and personnel authority to a national intelligence director.
 In its final report in July, the commission cataloged the blunders and turf battles of the nation's spy agencies in the months and years before the Sept. 11 attacks and called for the appointment of a powerful intelligence director to force them to cooperate.
 At a news conference on Saturday to explain the tumultuous events of the day, Mr. Hastert singled out Mr. Hunter as instrumental in the decision to prevent a final vote on the bill. Mr. Hunter, a member of the House-Senate conference committee that shaped the compromise bill, had opposed the final product when it was made public on Saturday morning, warning colleagues that it could interfere with the transfer of vital intelligence to soldiers on the battlefield.
 Mr. Hunter's views reflected those of senior Pentagon officials, who have quietly lobbied for months to block the creation of the job of a powerful national intelligence director, the central recommendation of the Sept. 11 commission.
 In an interview, Mr. Hunter predicted that Congress would eventually approve an intelligence-overhaul bill, but one that would not permit a national intelligence director to interfere with the transfer of intelligence within the military and ''leave a state of confusion, which is deadly on the battlefield.''
 ''I'm very proud today of House Republicans and the House Republican leadership,'' he said. ''They care. If they didn't care, Denny Hastert could have hammered this thing across the goal line.''
 He said that during his telephone call with the vice president, Mr. Cheney had said ''he wanted to have a compromise and wanted to have a bill.'' But Mr. Hunter said the vice president ''also very much understands the importance of this lifeline between the combatants and the troops.''
 A spokesman for the Defense Department, Lt. Col. Barry Venable, rejected the suggestion by Mr. Kean and other proponents of the compromise bill that Pentagon officials were behind Saturday's developments. ''What goes on on Capitol Hill is entirely within their purview,'' he said. ''We don't have a vote.''
 House and Senate negotiators said that Mr. Sensenbrenner had been equally responsible for the decision to block a vote on the bill, which did not include a variety of provisions he had championed to broaden the powers of law-enforcement and immigration agencies. 
 They said Mr. Sensenbrenner had been adamant that the bill include a provision to create federal standards for drivers' licenses to prevent them from being issued to illegal immigrants, a move widely criticized by civil liberties groups as a step toward a national identification card. 
 ''Regrettably, the Senate thus far has been hellbent on ensuring illegal aliens can receive drivers' licenses, regardless of the security concerns,'' Mr. Sensenbrenner said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Where Playboy and 'Will and Grace' Reign

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
THE 2004 election, in which religious conservatives helped deliver the presidency to George W. Bush, brings up an interesting economic question: Why is the United States, the world's most prosperous and educated democracy, so religious? 
 The United States is rather unusual in this regard, an enclave of intense religious devotion in the mostly secular club of industrial democracies. The difference has long puzzled many scholars, who had believed that religion and modernity just didn't mix, that economic development led naturally to less religious fervor.
 But over the past 10 years or so a growing group of mostly American sociologists has deployed a novel theory to explain the United States' apparently anomalous behavior: supply-side economics. Americans, they say, are fervently religious because there are so many churches competing for their devotion. 
 Old-school sociology holds that as nations become more prosperous, healthy and educated, demand for the support that religion provides declines. 
 People do not suddenly lose faith as they grow rich, these sociologists argue. Rather, they gradually go less to church -- reducing their children's exposure to religion. Meanwhile, secular institutions take over functions, like education, formerly controlled by the church. Religious attendance, they argue, wanes from one generation to the next.
 In economic terms, demand for religion drops as its perceived benefits diminish compared with the cost of participating. Or, as stated by the famed anthropologist Anthony Wallace in the 1960's: ''The evolutionary future of religion is extinction.''
 The industrial democracies in Asia and Europe seem to bear this out. According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project two years ago, only 20 percent of Germans, 12 percent of Japanese and 11 percent of the French say religion plays a very important role in their lives. In a 1991 multinational survey, a quarter of all Dutch said they were atheists.
 ''If you take the United Nations' Human Development Index and look at the top 20 countries, 19 of those are very secular,'' said David Voas, a demographer and sociologist of religion at the University of Manchester in England.
 But this line of analysis cannot account for the most modern and rich country of them all. According to the Pew survey, 60 percent of Americans said religion had a very important role in their lives; 48 percent believed that the United States has a special protection from God; 54 percent said they had an ''unfavorable'' view of atheists.
 And religious expression in the United States seems to have grown, not diminished, with socio-economic development. According to Roger Finke, a sociologist at Pennsylvania State University, in 1890, 45 percent of Americans were members of a church. By 2000, that figure was 62 percent.
 ''Secularism only holds in Europe,'' said Peter Berger, professor emeritus of religion, sociology and theology at Boston University. Professor Berger was once a prominent proponent of the ''secularization'' model of development. But he has switched to the supply-side view. This posits that demand for religion has little to do with economic development. Instead, what creates change is the supply of religious services.
 That is, Americans are more churchgoing and pious than Germans or Canadians because the United States has the most open religious market, with dozens of religious denominations competing vigorously to offer their flavor of salvation, becoming extremely responsive to the needs of their parishes. 
 ''There's a lack of regulation restricting churches, so in this freer market there is a larger supply,'' said Mr. Finke. 
 The suppliers of religion then try to stoke demand. ''The potential demand for religion has to be activated,'' said Rodney Stark, a sociologist at Baylor University. ''The more members of the clergy that are out there working to expand their congregations the more people will go to church.''
 Mr. Finke notes that this free-market theory also fits well with the explosion of religion across Latin America, where the weakening of the longstanding Catholic monopoly has led to all sorts of evangelical Christian churches and to an overall increase of religious expression. 
 The supply-siders say their model even explains secular Europe. Europeans, they argue, are fundamentally just as religious as Americans, with similar metaphysical concerns, but they suffer from a uncompetitive market -- lazy, quasi-monopolistic churches that have been protected from competition by the state. ''Wherever you've got a state church, you have empty churches,'' Mr. Stark said. 
 The free-market argument is not absolutely watertight, however. Islamic states, for instance, have very strong quasi-state churches and high religious participation. And some European sociologists argue that there is much more religious competition in Europe than the supply-siders acknowledge. 
 And in the United States, the most religious states and counties are those most dominated by a single denomination --Mormon, Baptist or Pentecostal-- not those where there is most competition, Mr. Voas said.
 Whatever its shortcomings, the free-market theory might also offer solace for those concerned about the creeping influence of religion in American government. That's because the theory posits that for religion to thrive, it must remain clearly separate from the state.
 ''Our pluralism helps religion expand,'' said Gary Wills, the historian. ''The separation of church and state protected religion from anticlericalism.''

HEADLINE: Hawk Sightings Could Be Premature

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile 

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, the world thought it knew what kind of foreign policy George W. Bush would pursue. He had arrived in the Oval Office talking of a more ''humble'' America that didn't tell countries how to conduct themselves inside their borders. His national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was viewed as a realist rather than an ideologue; she made a compelling case that the United States could not afford to tie up its military in nation-building efforts because that would ''degrade the American capability to do the things America has to do.''
 ''We don't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten," she declared at the time, when few were thinking of her as a future secretary of state.
 A lot has happened since, not least a terror attack on American soil that profoundly changed the President's world view, and with it Ms. Rice's. But just as it proved unwise to draw a straight line then between what the president-elect was saying and how he would act, it may be equally risky to race to the certainty -- as many in Washington did last week -- that a second Bush administration, unrestrained by the caution of Colin Powell, will lead the United States into an unending series of confrontations with the world, starting with bellicose approaches to controlling the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea. 
 It could turn out that way, for sure. But it has been quite a while since the words ''Axis of Evil'' sprang from the president's lips. And during the election campaign, it was clear from the president's words and actions that the limits on American power had begun to sink in on this White House.
 Instead, presidential advisers have been talking of repairing ties and acting within alliances when they can -- a process for which an early test arrived this weekend, when the re-elected president arrived in the shadow of the Andes for the annual summit of Pacific Rim leaders. Here he will be setting the agenda for the next four years with the likes of Hu Jintao of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea.
 Gone from the President's pre-summit pronouncements was the ''with us or against us'' language that marked previous such meetings. And when the subject turned to Iran and North Korea -- countries with weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein could only have dreamed about -- there was no mention of the kinds of deadlines he set two years ago for disarming Iraq. 
 Some in the administration suspect that this is a pose, and point out that Mr. Powell was already talking last week of a worrisome (but barely understood) effort by Iran to develop small nuclear warheads for its missile fleet. If America can persuade the world that Iran and North Korea pose an imminent threat -- a much harder task after Iraq -- the hawks may have their day, led by Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 But that is still a minority view in the administration. The prevailing view focuses not on the dangers, but on the limited options for doing anything about them. In other words, Iraq has made it harder to be hawkish in this White House, not because desires to act have changed, but because it has tied down American combat troops and magnified the need to juggle scarce military resources.
 With roughly 130,000 troops stationed in Iraq for a while -- and hundreds of thousands more supplying them, training to replace them, or just coming off duty there -- Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice lack the kind of flexibility to deal with crises around the world that they had four years ago. What's more, the president has now committed himself to some of the largest nation-building efforts since the Marshall Plan, from Iraq to Afghanistan and perhaps, if his vision is realized, elsewhere in the Middle East. 
 The result is that ''we may have maxed out on hawkishness for a while,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who served on the National Security Council under President Clinton and was deeply involved in the first, unsuccessful, efforts to curb Al Qaeda in the 1990's. There will be ''many opportunities to sound hawkish'' on North Korea and Iran, said Mr. Benjamin, but Mr. Bush has limited options in both places. While he remains fundamentally at odds with Mr. Roh, who wants a more conciliatory approach that would allow more countries to be involved in the bargaining with North Korea, Pentagon planners acknowledge that America has good reason to avoid any flare-up with North Korea. That would almost certainly require reinforcing the American presence in Asia, even as it is being reduced to bolster the effort to pacify Iraq. 
 Ivo H. Daalder, a Brookings Institution scholar who co-wrote one of the first books examining the revolution in foreign policy that Mr. Bush has wrought, notes that Iran ''can make our life terribly miserable in Iraq'' by further fueling the insurgency there. Mr. Daalder does not believe that Mr. Bush will suddenly start embracing the United Nations or the International Atomic Energy Agency as partners in dealing with North Korea and Iran; the Bush White House views both with disdain.
 ''Instead, we may just do less in a second term, and learn to live with our limits,'' Mr. Daalder said, even if that means silently tolerating a nuclear capability that Mr. Bush has said would be unacceptable in either North Korea or Iran. Some administration officials dispute that view, saying that Vice President Cheney would not stand for such an outcome. They expect him to press for anything short of military invasion: harsh economic squeezes, even covert attempts to bring about a change of government.
 In fact, the most important unanswered question about the second term may well be what power dynamic will emerge among Mr. Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Ms. Rice. 
 Mr. Cheney's office was already moving last week to put his disciples into key second-tier jobs. Mr. Rumsfeld, White House insiders said, was maneuvering to hold on to his job as defense secretary as long as possible. And Ms. Rice's views as national security adviser have been somewhat inscrutable. In that job she swung from her initial role as Mr. Bush's tutor in the ways of the world to a new one, as the woman who tried to read Mr. Bush's post-Sept. 11 instincts and shape them into a new national strategy. 
 Some people close to Ms. Rice think she is being sent to the State Department to make sure the diplomatic corps enables a more muscular American approach, rather than apologizes for it. ''The reality is that she sided more often with Cheney and Rummy than she did with Powell,'' said an associate who witnessed many of the administration's internal debates. Ms. Rice, the friend said, has been heard expressing ''complaints that State is not with the program.''
 But she has also been talking about a mission of repairing breached relationships, and of delving into the opportunities in the Middle East that were created by the death of Yasir Arafat. The first goal could require striking a more flexible tone with the Europeans and the South Koreans; the second might involve putting pressure on Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, in a way that this administration never has. Both would require managing Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld, a task that her critics believe she has failed at, despite her closeness to the president.
 The first test may come in her selection of a deputy. Mr. Cheney's wing is pressing for someone like John R. Bolton, an acolyte of the vice president who runs the State Department's proliferation office. A very different choice would be someone like Arnold Kanter, a former State Department official who now works with Brent Scowcroft, who was the first President Bush's national security adviser. Mr. Scowcroft was Ms. Rice's mentor until the two differed over the Iraq invasion. Choosing Mr. Kanter to run the daily operations of the State Department could signal a shift toward something more like the first President Bush's approach to the world. 
 Another litmus test may be Ms. Rice's handling of Russia, the country she has spent a lifetime studying. When she arrived at the White House, she viewed Mr. Putin as a K.G.B. throwback to the age of Soviet hard-liners. Her public description of Mr. Putin became much more charitable after the President declared that he had looked into the Russian's eyes and seen his soul, and after Russia cooperated in allowing American military forces to operate against the Taliban from formerly Soviet territory. Now she appears to be swinging back toward her original view, especially after reading (in the original Russian) Mr. Putin's hard-line speech following the terror attack on a Russian school, an event he is using to try to consolidate more power in the Kremlin. 
 ''The place you really see the change from realism to ideology is in the way she talks about converting the Mideast to democracies,'' said one longtime associate. ''The Condi that came to Washington would have raised an eyebrow and said 'Good luck.' Now she sounds a lot more idealistic, even ideological, than we've heard before.''
 Indeed, Ms. Rice has been known to defend her boss's own bent toward idealistic and assertive American missions; she told French colleagues not long ago that without a good dose of American idealism, the United States might not have worked so hard to liberate Normandy. The question now is what happens when that brand of idealism comes up against the realities of managing the world, at a moment when the latest American experiment in using force to transform a nation -- in Iraq -- is still well short of the outcome the Bush administration envisioned two years ago.

HEADLINE: A New Library, Yes. But the Legacy?

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
A PRESIDENTIAL library gives a former leader of the free world the chance to dress himself up for history. Bill Clinton, who dedicated his library last week in Little Rock, Ark., clearly wants to be seen as a thoughtful public servant who improved people's lives, harmonized competing political philosophies and who was, and remains, a symbol of hope. 
 In his post-presidential life, he has written an autobiography, and is working to fight AIDS, promote racial reconciliation and foster economic empowerment.
 Not surprisingly, his library does not emphasize the black marks on his record. The impeachment trial occupies only a sliver of exhibition space. The pardons Mr. Clinton granted to Marc Rich, the fugitive financier, and others as he left office -- causing his poll numbers to plummet -- go unremarked. 
 Such omissions prompt the question: In the long view of history, can an accumulation of good deeds erase a bad one?
 ''There's nothing he can do about it,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. The impeachment, he said, ''is not going to disappear from the history books regardless of how much he rises to the post-presidential challenge.''
 A recent C-Span Survey of Presidential Leadership, in which 58 historians evaluated 41 presidents (the list excludes the second President Bush) in 10 categories, ranks Mr. Clinton at No.21. His middling rating -- between Lincoln at No.1 and Buchanan at No.41 -- was largely due to a basement grade in the category of ''moral authority.''
 Might such a judgment improve over time? Mr. Dallek said it was too soon to tell. If the country falls into a terrible recession, for example, he said, ''the headline with Clinton could become 'the president who presided over an economic expansion.'''
 It is also possible that documents eventually released by Mr. Clinton's library will give historians fresh insight into how and under what constraints he made decisions.
 ''Libraries provide the footprints that have rescued some presidential reputations,'' said Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University in Maryland, who has made extensive use of presidential libraries. The tapes of phone calls by Lyndon B. Johnson (ranked No.10 by the C-Span historians) showed him to have been far more assertive in pressing for civil rights legislation than was clear at the time.
 In a revealing interview last week with Peter Jennings of ABC News, Mr. Clinton said he thought impeachment would come out ''a wash'' for his legacy, adding that he had made a ''personal mistake'' but had already paid for it several times over.
 Asked about the judgment by the C-Span historians of his moral authority, Mr. Clinton said they were wrong, that prosecutors had spent $100 million in investigations of him, which ended with only one person in his administration being convicted, compared with 29 convictions during the presidency of Ronald Reagan (rank: No.11).
 ''I'll bet those historians didn't even know that,'' Mr. Clinton said heatedly. ''They have no idea what I was subjected to,'' he said, adding that while under investigation, he had ''tried to save people from ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and the people in Haiti from a military dictator who was murdering them.''
 He said that he would ''go to my grave being at peace about it,'' but after Mr. Jennings said he did not seem to be at peace at all, Mr. Clinton lashed out at the television networks for ''repeating every little sleazy thing'' the prosecutors had leaked to them. The interview made clear that, as the historian Pieter Geyl once said, ''history is argument without end.''

FRIENDLY JUDGMENT -- For the past 11 years, House Republican leaders have worked under party rules that required them to step down if indicted. But earlier this year, three political associates of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader, were indicted by a Texas district attorney, Ronnie Earle, on charges relating to the illegal use of corporate money in local campaigns.
 Mr. Earle has not named Mr. DeLay as a target of his investigations, but House Republicans, behind closed doors, decided not to take a wait-and-see attitude. Under a revised rule, adopted by voice vote, a party committee will now review any indictments against Republican leaders and committee chairmen, and it is the committee that will decide whether they should step down.
 ''With this decision, we have gone from DeLay being judged by his peers to DeLay being judged by his buddies,'' said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, a group that follows campaign finance issues. ''It's an absurd and ludicrous new rule and an affront to the American people.''

MODERN MAGNIFICENCE -- It's a palace, all right, but not exactly a people's palace. The Museum of Modern Art, closed for renovation since 2002, reopened in a blaze of publicity. The museum, which was founded in 1939, spent more than $400 million on architect Yoshio Taniguchi's redesign, which nearly doubled the available gallery space and received generally positive reviews. Less positive was the reaction to the new admission fee -- $20, up from $12 -- making the Modern the most expensive major museum in the country. Critics noted that the original admission price was 25 cents, or about $3.50 today, adjusted for inflation.

RETAIL RESHUFFLING -- In another sign of the way Wal-Mart, as well as Target and other aggressive, innovative retailers, are chewing up the competition, Kmart, which emerged from bankruptcy only last year, agreed to buy Sears, Roebuck for $11 billion. The merger, which will create the third-largest retailer in the country, surpassed only by Wal-Mart and Home Depot, ends the independence of two of the nation's oldest and best-known companies. Sears was founded in 1886 and Kmart, known until 1977 as S.S. Kresge, opened its doors in 1899 as a five-and-dime store.
 The combined company is still much smaller than Wal-Mart, and neither Sears nor Kmart has yet found a way to lure many customers away from their voracious rival.

HEADLINE: A 'Good-Cop, Bad-Cop' Approach on Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 20 

 BODY:
It took the bluntest-talking member of the Bush administration -- Richard L. Armitage, who is leaving his post as deputy secretary of state -- to explain the strategy of suddenly increasing the heat on Iran's nuclear program.
 Interviewed on Al Jazeera, the Arab-language television network, on Friday, Mr. Armitage argued that it made sense for Europe to offer incentives to Iran to give up its program while President Bush continues to take a hard line. 
 ''My view would be that the incentives of the Europeans only work against the backdrop of the United States being strong and firm on this issue,'' he said. ''In the vernacular, it's kind of a good-cop bad-cop arrangement. If it works, we'll all have been successful.''
 That may explain why Iran, which is nowhere near the Pacific Ocean, became a repeated subject of conversation on Saturday as President Bush arrived at his first post-election summit meeting, the annual gathering of leaders of Asian nations and countries from Chile to Canada whose borders touch the Pacific.
 Mr. Bush has been known to pursue his own agenda at these meetings. He used the 2001 gathering in Shanghai, for example, to organize the first responses to the Sept. 11 attacks.
 And since Wednesday, when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived here for a meeting of foreign ministers, the administration has used this summit mmeting to reinforce its tough stance on Iran -- though its exact strategy is still a bit of a mystery.
 Mr. Powell told reporters on the way here that he had seen information that Iran was trying to modify its missile fleet so it could launch small nuclear warheads -- even though, by all estimates, Iran is still a few years away from producing its first nuclear weapon. 
 Almost immediately, Mr. Powell took criticism for his comment, some from inside the administration. The intelligence is apparently based on a single source, whose reliability is unclear.
 To Mr. Powell's critics, it was a throwback to his presentation to the United States on Feb. 5, 2003 about Iraq's weapons, a presentation he came to regret.
 But he defended his comments during a television interview here on Friday, as did a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli.
 ''Don't just focus on a uranium enrichment program, on a nuclear plant here or a nuclear plant there,'' Mr. Ereli said. ''Look at the totality of the picture. And the picture is you've got undeclared nuclear activity, deliberate misinformation on nuclear activity, development of delivery systems and other technical research that, added all up, paints a very troubling picture.''
 Mr. Bush tried to add to that picture on Saturday, seizing on a report, attributed to diplomats who interact with the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran is speeding ahead in producing uranium hexafluoride, a gas that can be turned into bomb fuel. Although Iran's uranium-enrichment program was frozen under the agreement with Europe that was announced Monday, Iran has said it will not halt until Dec. 22. 
 By itself, this report on uranium hexafluoride proves little. Iran is within its legal rights to produce the gas, which can be used to make fuel for nuclear power plants. 
 In the end, Mr. Bush may not be the Iranians' main worry. While the president has made it clear he thinks that diplomacy, not military action, is the solution, the Israelis have been increasingly clear to administration officials that at some point they may feel forced to take action against Iran's facilities, before an Iranian project turns into a nuclear weapon that can reach Iran's neighbors.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Iran's nuclear program misstated the date announced by that country for the suspension of its uranium enrichment activities. (The error was repeated in an article yesterday on the emergence of Iran as a repeated subject of conversation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago, Chile.) The date is today (Nov. 22), not Dec. 22. An article about Iran's nuclear program appears today on Page A8.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Fallout

 BODY:

To the Editor: ''Reshuffling the Deck,'' by Frances Frank Marcus and Denny Lee (Oct. 31) was another example of America's self-centered world view.
 I would have hoped for an article about Caribbean tourism from the perspective of physical damage, employment impacts, tourism's role in the islands' economic recovery and the long-term prognosis for the lives of the people devastated by one or more of the four hurricanes to hit the Caribbean in the last few months.
 F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Congressman, will overcome his holiday tragedy -- the difficulty of finding a Caribbean vacation spot untouched by this fall's hurricanes -- much more easily than the people of Grenada will overcome theirs.

HEADLINE: A States' Rights Left?

BYLINE: By Jim Holt. 
Jim Holt is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
When George W. Bush was re-elected, people in some of the bluer states were so angry and sad that they talked of moving to Canada or seceding from the Union. How else, they felt, could they escape the intensifying red-state control of Washington? But there is a less drastic survival strategy available to liberals in the coastal and Great Lakes states, one that involves neither emigration nor civil war. It is based on the venerable doctrine of states' rights. And the oddity is that President Bush himself is determined to give the blue states a rather generous gift to help it succeed.
 The phrase ''states' rights'' has a nasty ring to it for liberals, given its historical associations. During the civil rights era, it was the proud slogan of Dixiecrats like Strom Thurmond and George C. Wallace, who fought tooth and nail against desegregation. A century earlier, it was invoked by the slave states of the Confederacy to justify their secession from the Union. 
 But states' rights has not always been the intellectual property of reactionaries. During the War of 1812, it was a rallying cry for antiwar forces. In the winter of 1814 and 1815, representatives from New England states came together at the Hartford Convention to express their hostility to the federal government and ''Mr. Madison's War.'' 
 So the doctrine of states' rights has had a varied career. But why resurrect it today? The reason is simple. There are big differences among the states, as the last election showed -- differences in their understanding of tolerance, in their attitude toward the role of religion in public life, in the value they place on education, conservation and scientific research. The more sovereignty each state has, the better it can pursue policies that are appropriate to the needs and preferences of its people.
 Marriage affords a vivid example. In some states it is evidently more imperiled than in others. The Bible Belt states, in particular, have a shockingly high divorce rate, around 50 percent above the national average. Given such marital instability, these states are anxious to defend the institution of heterosexual matrimony, which may explain their hostility to gay marriage. The state of Massachusetts, by contrast, has the lowest divorce rate in the nation. So its people -- or at least its liberal judges -- perhaps feel more comfortable allowing some progressive experimentation. It will be interesting to see how this experiment plays out, assuming the Bush administration does not succeed in choking off the right of a state to recognize same-sex marriages by getting the Federal Marriage Amendment enacted.
 Another matter on which states differ is crime and punishment. Here, too, they have considerable autonomy. Since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that the death penalty was constitutionally permissible, most states have chosen to reinstate it. As a group, however, the 12 states that reject capital punishment have a murder rate that is decidedly lower than those that embrace it.
 Coincidence? Perhaps. But there are symbolic advantages to living in a state without the death penalty. A few years ago, when I happened to be a resident of Maine, I traveled to Paris. There, in the course of conversations with Parisians, I was reminded that capital punishment, which the French abolished in 1981, was now a distinctively American form of barbarity. ''I'm from Maine,'' I would always reply, beaming a bit. ''We outlawed the death penalty in 1887!'' (I did not mention that Maine had also outlawed drinking a few decades earlier.)
 One of the most striking differences among states is in their levels of wealth. Liberals tend to live in more economically productive states than conservatives. The top five states in per capita personal income (Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York) all went to Kerry; the bottom five (Utah, New Mexico, West Virginia, Arkansas and Mississippi) all went to Bush. Since the blue states are generally richer than the red states, they must bear a greater portion of the federal tax burden. Most of them pay more to Washington than they receive, whereas most of the red states receive more than they pay. Some liberals in blue states must wonder exactly what they get in return for subsidizing the heartlanders, who are said to resent them.
 Here is where President Bush is their friend. According to a recent Brookings Institution analysis, as much as two-thirds of the benefits from the income tax cuts he pushed through in his first term go to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year. These well-off Americans tend to be concentrated around New York City, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and other liberal enclaves. By contrast, relatively few of the benefits from the Bush tax cuts go to the Southern and Prairie states, where low-income working families with children are more the norm. At present, the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire by 2010. If the president succeeds in making them permanent, as he has vowed to do, it will mean lasting relief for the blue states. The money they had been sending to the red states could then be spent locally, according to their own liberal values -- say, on public schools (where they already spend more per pupil than the red states) or stem-cell research.
 The more conservatives succeed in reducing the size and scope of the federal government, the more fiscal freedom the blue states will have to pursue their own idea of a just society. There are already signs that this is happening. Senators like Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Jon Corzine of New Jersey and Charles E. Schumer of New York are rumored to be contemplating gubernatorial runs in their respective states, convinced that there is now more to do in the governor's mansion than on Capitol Hill.
 Meanwhile, blue-state liberals should stop despairing and start thinking locally. Instead of saying, ''The United States is. . . . '' try saying, ''The United States are. . . . '' See? You feel better already. 

 The five poorest states are all red: Utah, New Mexico, West Virginia, Arkansas and Mississippi. They receive nearly $33 billion more from the federal government than they pay in taxes. Source: ''The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America,'' by John Sperling et al., August 2004

 CORRECTION:
An essay on Page 27 of The Times Magazine today about states' rights as a potential issue for the Democrats includes an outdated reference to the possibility that Senator Charles E. Schumer would run for the governorship of New York. On Monday, after the magazine had gone to press, Senator Schumer announced that he had no plans to run.

HEADLINE: Leave the Senate Behind

BYLINE: By HILARY ROSEN. 
Hilary Rosen, the former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, is a political commentator for CNBC and a Democratic strategist.

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton appears to have decided to run for Senate again. Presumably, she has been persuaded that a 2006 re-election campaign will not harm her possible bid for the presidency in 2008. But some Democrats, including me, think she shouldn't run for re-election. 
 A Clinton senatorial campaign is likely to be the most bruising and high-stakes race of 2006. The Republicans will put everything they have into attacking Mrs. Clinton, knowing that whatever damage they can inflict will pay dividends for them in 2008. 
 They will try to wrap a liberal skin around her so tightly that it will be impossible for her to emerge from it a year later, when she would be campaigning for the White House. And remember: a Democratic senator from New York has to take lots of liberal positions to keep the base happy.
 All this is especially frustrating because Senator Clinton is not such a liberal. This is the woman who supported her husband's push for the welfare-reform legislation that was vehemently opposed by her mentor, Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. 
 Knowing that it would anger the liberals, she nevertheless chose a moderate path. And contrary to the perception that she favored a government takeover of the health-care system, she has worked to expand the eligibility for existing coverage to more families and children.
 Indeed, her experience with health-care reform helped teach her that most people prefer incremental change to ambitious overhauls. Those who are paying attention know that her approach to helping the economy of upstate New York is dominated by Republican-like tax-credit and loan-guarantee proposals for employers that create jobs -- not proposals to increase old-fashioned government job grants. And she has shown a willingness to compromise and to work with Republicans in the Capitol. Her Senate colleagues view her as a congenial and shrewd politician. Her speeches are not fiery, moralistic or ideological but filled with pragmatic reasoning. 
 She is pro-choice -- and so are most people in the country. But she can talk about social issues in a way most Democrats can't. When she speaks about gay and lesbian issues, for instance, she sounds like a middle-American mom searching for the right way to be fair and inclusive without feeling uncomfortable. That is an attitude many in America share right now. 
 What's more, she doesn't need to create a platform for her moral values. She already has one. One that balances faith -- an uncontrived faith -- and politics.
 With no patience for political correctness, she knows how to relate to people across a broad spectrum of beliefs. In short, she comes across as the moderate Midwestern Methodist she is. 
 Senator Clinton's campaign in 2000 was a lesson in the value of star wattage. But it also showed how she operates. She didn't begin by announcing what she could do for her constituency as a senator. She shared some core values and then went on a listening tour. It was a smart and modest instinct.
 If there were ever a time that Democrats need to listen to Americans, it is now. That's why Senator Clinton should spend the next two years in the Senate burnishing her foreign policy credentials and staking out some good territory in the increasingly right-wing Republican Senate. 
 Then she should leave the Senate behind. 
 Instead of getting tangled up in what would probably be a costly, contentious, toxic race, she should get out in the heartland to connect with voters. If she gives the American people the attention she gave New Yorkers, they will see a woman who has the spirit needed to get though difficult times -- and the vision to be a leader. 
 Don't get me wrong. If Hillary Clinton has decided to run for re-election because she loves being the senator from New York, she can and should win. She has worked hard for New Yorkers and deserves re-election. But if her goal is to run for president in 2008, she shouldn't run for the Senate in 2006. 
 Politicians with higher ambitions often stay in political office to make sure they have a platform for their ideas. 
 That rule doesn't apply to Senator Clinton. She doesn't need to be in the Senate in 2007 to get attention -- from donors or from anyone else. 
 There will be other Democrats who may vie for leadership as we approach 2008. John Edwards, Bill Richardson, Evan Bayh, Howard Dean, maybe even Al Gore or John Kerry. 
 But many people are counting on Mrs. Clinton. And she needs to be prepared. Instead of running, she should walk -- across America.

HEADLINE: Leave the Senate Behind

BYLINE: By HILARY ROSEN. 
Hilary Rosen, the former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, is a political commentator for CNBC and a Democratic strategist.

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton appears to have decided to run for Senate again. Presumably, she has been persuaded that a 2006 re-election campaign will not harm her possible bid for the presidency in 2008. But some Democrats, including me, think she shouldn't run for re-election. 
 A Clinton senatorial campaign is likely to be the most bruising and high-stakes race of 2006. The Republicans will put everything they have into attacking Mrs. Clinton, knowing that whatever damage they can inflict will pay dividends for them in 2008. They will try to wrap a liberal skin around her so tightly that it will be impossible for her to emerge from it a year later, when she would be campaigning for the White House. And remember: a Democratic senator from New York has to take lots of liberal positions to keep the base happy. 
 All this is especially frustrating because Senator Clinton is not such a liberal. This is the woman who supported her husband's push for the welfare-reform legislation that was vehemently opposed by her mentor, Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. Knowing that it would anger the liberals, she nevertheless chose a moderate path. And contrary to the perception that she favored a government takeover of the health-care system, she has worked to expand the eligibility for existing coverage to more families and children.
 Indeed, her experience with health-care reform helped teach her that most people prefer incremental change to ambitious overhauls. Those who are paying attention know that her approach to helping the economy of upstate New York is dominated by Republican-like tax-credit and loan-guarantee proposals for employers that create jobs -- not proposals to increase old-fashioned government job grants. And she has shown a willingness to compromise and to work with Republicans in the Capitol. Her Senate colleagues view her as a congenial and shrewd politician. Her speeches are not fiery, moralistic or ideological but filled with pragmatic reasoning. 
 She is pro-choice -- and so are most people in the country. But she can talk about social issues in a way most Democrats can't. When she speaks about gay and lesbian issues, for instance, she sounds like a middle-American mom searching for the right way to be fair and inclusive without feeling uncomfortable. That is an attitude many in America share right now. 
 What's more, she doesn't need to create a platform for her moral values. She already has one. One that balances faith -- an uncontrived faith -- and politics. With no patience for political correctness, she knows how to relate to people across a broad spectrum of beliefs. In short, she comes across as the moderate Midwestern Methodist she is. 
 Senator Clinton's campaign in 2000 was a lesson in the value of star wattage. But it also showed how she operates. She didn't begin by announcing what she could do for her constituency as a senator. She shared some core values and then went on a listening tour. It was a smart and modest instinct.
 If there were ever a time that Democrats need to listen to Americans, it is now. That's why Senator Clinton should spend the next two years in the Senate burnishing her foreign policy credentials and staking out some good territory in the increasingly right-wing Republican Senate. 
 Then she should leave the Senate behind. 
 Instead of getting tangled up in what would probably be a costly, contentious, toxic race, she should get out in the heartland to connect with voters. If she gives the American people the attention she gave New Yorkers, they will see a woman who has the spirit needed to get though difficult times -- and the vision to be a leader. 
 Don't get me wrong. If Hillary Clinton has decided to run for re-election because she loves being the senator from New York, she can and should win. She has worked hard for New Yorkers and deserves re-election. But if her goal is to run for president in 2008, she shouldn't run for the Senate in 2006. Politicians with higher ambitions often stay in political office to make sure they have a platform for their ideas. That rule doesn't apply to Senator Clinton. She doesn't need to be in the Senate in 2007 to get attention -- from donors or from anyone else. 
 There will be other Democrats who may vie for leadership as we approach 2008. John Edwards, Bill Richardson, Evan Bayh, Howard Dean, maybe even Al Gore or John Kerry. But many people are counting on Mrs. Clinton. And she needs to be prepared. Instead of running, she should walk -- across America.

HEADLINE: The Castro Collection

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
RESTING on a coffee table in Jose Fanjul's mansion on Jungle Road is an inscribed silver box, a gift from King Juan Carlos of Spain. Another table bears a silver-framed wedding photo of Mr. Fanjul and his bride greeting the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere in the house, silver-rimmed photos of Mr. Fanjul and Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush are displayed prominently. An Impressionist work by the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida, ''Girl in the Silvery Sea,'' hangs in a living room corner.
 Mr. Fanjul opened a thick album and showed a visitor faded snapshots of cavernous estates that he and his extended family once occupied in and around Havana. Fidel Castro, after seizing the Fanjul family's real estate and sugar holdings in 1960, made one of their ornate residences his own. 
 Known to his friends as Pepe, Mr. Fanjul, 60, opened another hefty book, a handsome retrospective of Sorolla's works. Many of the paintings belong to a collection once owned by the Fanjuls and are still housed in Havana. He tapped his index finger on the glossy pages, quietly recalling where some of those Sorollas hung in his parents' home. A minor work by Sorolla -- ''Malaga Port'' -- that once graced an upstairs hallway is not featured in the book. Mr. Fanjul says he does not know where that painting is now, though he is almost certain that it is no longer in Cuba.
 And therein lies a tale.
 Six years ago, Mr. Fanjul learned that ''Malaga Port'' had surfaced in the London offices of Sotheby's, the auction house. He immediately phoned Joseph P. Klock, chairman of Steel, Hector & Davis, a Miami firm that handles his legal affairs. Mr. Klock, a power broker who would later advise Katherine Harris, then the Florida secretary of state, during the controversial presidential vote recount in 2000, had experience in cloak-and-dagger matters. He had a lawyer assemble a team to track down the Sorolla. 
 Mr. Fanjul and his older brother, Alfonso, who have become two of the United States' leading sugar magnates, then financed a global hunt for the painting. That pursuit, which continues today, offers a rare and unusually detailed road map of the subterranean, hush-hush business of art smuggling, a crime that is carried out at a very untidy intersection of art and commerce.
 The long search for the Sorolla has wound through Cuba, Italy, Switzerland, London and New York, taking some unusual turns along the way. As part of their effort to track down ''Malaga Port,'' the Fanjuls' lawyers filed claims with the State Department and the Treasury Department late last summer. They requested that the agencies penalize anyone trafficking in the painting because, they said, doing so violates federal trade sanctions against Cuba. 
 Last week, the Fanjuls' lawyers asked the State Department to focus specifically on Sotheby's, saying that the company knows who holds ''Malaga Port'' and that its refusal to provide the Fanjuls with that information flouted laws against trading with Cuba. If the auction house is found culpable, Sotheby's overseas directors and their spouses could be forbidden entry into the United States. Any of Sotheby's American employees involved with the Sorolla could be subject to fines and jail.
 The State Department and the Treasury Department declined to comment. A Sotheby's spokeswoman said that the auction house no longer had the Sorolla, had never sold it and had made every effort to respond to the Fanjuls' queries. She said Sotheby's last communicated with the Fanjuls four years ago but declined to say who brought the painting to Sotheby's, citing client confidentiality obligations. 
 SOTHEBY'S noted that it tightened its business practices after a series of scandals between 1997 and 2000 that tarnished its reputation, and it said that while it was confident it had not violated any Cuban trade sanctions, it would cooperate with the State Department if necessary.
 ''Sotheby's takes provenance and compliance issues extremely seriously everywhere in the world we do business, and we take pride in our pioneering efforts in these areas,'' said Diana Phillips, the spokeswoman for Sotheby's. ''We take issues relating to displaced art, including art from Cuba, equally seriously. We are extremely conscious of the U.S. laws regarding trade with Cuba and articles of Cuban origin and long ago implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance in this area.'' 
 None of this satisfies the Fanjuls, who plan to continue using their formidable resources in the search. Family members are pressing their case at a time when the Bush administration is putting greater diplomatic and economic pressure on Cuba -- a development that the Fanjuls applaud -- and their action is a warning to any dealers tempted to traffic in other Cuban art whose ownership is in dispute.
 ''I'm disappointed that we had to find out through a third party that Sotheby's had the painting for a number of years,'' Pepe Fanjul said. ''I'm sure they have their side of the story.''
 Alfonso Fanjul Jr., the steely, 67-year-old entrepreneur known as Alfy who rebuilt the Fanjuls' Cuban sugar empire in the United States, was more direct. ''I have been surprised by the behavior of the art world in general when it comes to paintings that clearly belong to my family,'' he said. ''I had hoped that they would see that it is important that we should be promptly notified when our artwork came into their hands. We would particularly like to know what the auction houses and others know of these paintings.''Starting in the 1850's, the Fanjuls' ancestors began buying land and consolidating their control of Cuba's sugar business. By the turn of the century, they were among the country's dominant producers. It was a wildly lucrative business, and one built on the backs of poorly paid, landless farm workers. 
 Money from sugar built an extravagant mansion that Mr. Fanjul's maternal grandfather, Jose Gomez-Mena, stocked with fine European art, including dozens of Sorollas. In 1936, Mr. Fanjul's father, Alfonso Fanjul Sr., married Mr. Gomez-Mena's daughter, Lillian, uniting two of Cuba's largest sugar fortunes. When Fidel Castro, whose father owned a modest sugar plantation, led the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista's government in 1959, the Fanjul family's holdings became a target. Mr. Castro's government renamed the Gomez-Mena mansion, with all of its furnishings and art intact, the National Museum of Decorative Arts.
 Pepe Fanjul recalls boarding a National Airlines flight from Havana, when he was a teenager. He was hustled aboard the plane by a friendly airport bartender and was seated across the aisle from the film star Errol Flynn, who, along with a girlfriend, was also leaving the country. Even while fleeing Cuba after the revolution, Mr. Fanjul was surrounded by a dash of glamour.
 For most other Cubans, airline flights and movie stars were well out of reach, a measure of Mr. Fanjul's privileged upbringing. When Pepe, Alfy and their three siblings left Cuba for the United States, they were forced to abandon most of the family's art and its other wealth. The family owned some real estate in Manhattan and had other money invested abroad by their parents, but their exile marked a sharp comedown. ''The family was in a state of shock,'' Pepe Fanjul said. ''We knew our parents would live comfortably, but not us. So we were challenged.''
 Over the next four decades, however, the Fanjuls -- under Alfy's initial direction -- wove shrewd and risky deal making, some well-greased political connections and a belief in Florida's economic future into a new sugar empire. Their privately held company, Flo-Sun, is now a leading sugar producer in the United States and in the Dominican Republic; the family has also expanded into resorts, hotels and other real estate ventures.
 Over the years, Flo-Sun has also been the object of some of the same criticisms that the Fanjuls experienced in Cuba, including accusations of abusing sugar workers and harming the environment. The family has strongly disputed the contentions. Pepe Fanjul, who has lavishly contributed to Republican candidates, and Alfy, who has done the same for Democrats, describe themselves as close brothers who maintain their political differences. Other political analysts attribute their bipartisan fund-raising to a calculated strategy of making sure that all political bases are covered. 
 Whatever the case, the Fanjul brothers have pursued their financial and political goals with unvarnished determination, and they are bringing that same brio to the hunt for their Sorolla.
 When Mr. Sorolla's great-granddaughter casually mentioned to Pepe Fanjul in 1998 that Sotheby's asked her to authenticate ''Malaga Port'' three years earlier, he was dumbfounded. ''I thought she was wrong, confused,'' he said.
 The Fanjuls had already taken all of the steps that art owners can take when they believe that one of their works has gone missing. Art that has been off the market for many years is difficult to value, though some experts said high-quality Sorollas now fetched about $2 million to $3 million at auctions.
 The family began keeping an eye on the Cuban collection in the early 1990's.
 ''So long as the collection remained in the Museum of Decorative Arts, we were willing to wait out the end of the regime,'' Alfy Fanjul said. ''After the fall of the Soviet Union, we became concerned that the collection might be removed from Cuba and sold off for hard currency by the Cuban government.''
 To forestall that possibility, the Fanjuls in 1993 registered the works, including ''Malaga Port,'' with the Art Loss Register, a British and American service that tracks lost and stolen art. When Art Loss began compiling its database in 1991, it listed 20,000 artworks. Today it lists about 145,000.
 ''There is no oversight of dealers, and the art market thrives on confidentiality,'' said David Shillingford, the director of operations at Art Loss. ''When we first came along it was clear that we weren't welcome in the art world because we were seen as creating a problem rather than providing a solution. That's changed completely.''
 Sotheby's itself invested in the register in 1997 as part of an increased effort to track art looted from victims of the Holocaust. Other investors include Christie's, Sotheby's chief rival in the auction business, and a number of insurance companies. Since the early 1990's, the register's database has offered auction houses and dealers a convenient place to assess the provenance of artworks.
 The Fanjuls also sent letters to Sotheby's, Christie's and other auction houses in 1993, notifying them that the family believed it was the rightful owner of the Cuban Sorollas. The Fanjuls have ample evidence, including photographs and catalogs, to back up that claim -- though asserting ownership of art that has been seized by a government through an act of state, or has simply gone missing for decades, is notoriously difficult to do in court.
 ''Obviously, if and when the Castro regime falls there's going to be some kind of analog to the Nazi art that was confiscated during World War II,'' said Dr. Marcus Burke, paintings curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York. ''But it's not a direct analog, because the Nazi art was taken at knife-point whereas Cuba was engaged in a civil war and a new government was established that had a claim to legitimacy.''Indeed, other legal efforts to recover Cuban art that the Castro government seized through an act of state have foundered, even as the Fanjuls and others contend that Cuban officials have sold expropriated art overseas for years to line their own pockets. The Fanjuls considered taking legal action in Italy in 1965 and in Spain in the mid-1990's to seize artwork from their Cuban collection that had surfaced in those countries, but lawyers advised them that expropriations by act of state were usually insurmountable. 
 IN 1995, the Cintas Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports the arts, sued Sotheby's in Spain, contending that years earlier it illegally sold two Cuban Sorollas that the foundation believed that it owned. The Spanish court ruled against Cintas, citing legal technicalities other than act-of-state issues. 
 Then, in 1998, the Fanjuls learned that ''Malaga Port'' had been held in Sotheby's London office from 1993 to 1995. In the ensuing years, the Fanjuls and Sotheby's engaged in a tug of war, with Sotheby's asserting that it was helping the family to the fullest extent possible, and the Fanjuls contending that they were being stonewalled.
 ''We put the Fanjul family's lawyers in touch with the lawyers for the current owner in 1998 so that they could resolve any issue they had with them directly,'' said Ms. Phillips, the Sotheby's spokeswoman. ''This is our standard practice in such cases as, given our fiduciary obligations to our clients, we cannot simply provide their identities to third parties. To our knowledge, however, in the six years that have intervened, they have never initiated any legal action to recover the painting or to learn the identity of the current owner.''
 But the Fanjuls maintain that the courts, because of act-of-state protections, are not the best avenues for recovering their art from Cuba. Instead, the family is now flexing its political muscles by requesting investigations of possible trade sanction violations by Sotheby's -- involving some of the very laws that Congress passed after strong prodding by the Fanjuls and other anti-Castro activists. And the Fanjuls say they think Sotheby's has much more to explain.
 ''We think they have a lot of information about how the painting got from Cuba to Europe,'' said Shanker Singham, a lawyer for the Fanjuls. ''We also believe that there was likely some form of arrangement for other paintings, and we would like to know about those also. It was by a combination of skill and luck that we tracked this painting, but we know that Sotheby's has a lot of information about other Cuban transactions.''
 Tracing stolen or smuggled paintings that are winding their way through the art underworld is never easy. Much of the information surrounding such trafficking is clouded by gossip and myth. Dr. Burke and other art analysts say they think that over the years Japanese investors, Arab sheiks and other wealthy aficionados have been the primary buyers of pricey stolen art. 
 Others disagree. ''People like to come up with the idea that there's some reclusive billionaire behind these thefts, but I think that's just Hollywood,'' said Mr. Shillingford of the Art Loss Register. ''More often than not it's organized crime behind the thefts, I think.''
 But if figuring out who smuggles art is tricky, determining where the art is marketed is less so. That is because there are only a few places with the necessary infrastructure. Experts said that the Sorolla's path from Cuba was, more likely than not, through Europe.
 ''I wouldn't be shocked if it went out through Italy,'' said Harold J. Smith, an art investigator who has worked on a number of significant cases. ''Italy crosses borders with Switzerland and France and it's easy to move art by truck from there. A lot of stolen art moves out of Italy.''
 In fact, Mr. Singham, the Fanjuls' lawyer, picked up on the trail of ''Malaga Port'' after parsing court documents in the Cintas case, and the path took him to Italy.
 The documents reviewed by Mr. Singham indicated that a former Sotheby's employee, Alex Apsis, had overseen Cuban and other Latin American artworks for the auction house in the 1990's, and therefore might have had some knowledge of how the Sorollas were being handled. 
 Mr. Apsis joined the London office of Sotheby's in 1974 and moved to its New York branch in 1992. In the mid-1990's, the former president of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, made him head of the auction house's Impressionist and modern art division. He left Sotheby's in 1999 and is now an independent dealer.
 Mr. Apsis is no stranger to controversy. In 2002, during the Manhattan District Attorney's tax fraud investigation of L.Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco International chief executive, law enforcement officials found evidence that Mr. Apsis may have helped Mr. Kozlowski and another wealthy buyer avoid paying hefty sales taxes on some artworks. While Mr. Kozlowski is now contesting tax fraud and other charges in court, Mr. Apsis has not been charged with wrongdoing.
 Mr. Singham got his next lead from a book about Sotheby's by Peter Watson, a British journalist who has also written recently about the Fanjul dispute for The Times of London. His book briefly mentioned Mr. Apsis, saying Bruno Scaioli, an art dealer in Alessandria, Italy, used Mr. Apsis's London address to ship art. In 2000, the Fanjuls' lawyers hired a private investigator who visited Mr. Scaioli in Italy -- where the investigator found ''Malaga Port.'' 
 According to the Fanjuls' investigator, Mr. Scaioli said that he sold art through Sotheby's, that he had obtained ''Malaga Port'' from a Cuban museum more than a decade earlier, that the painting was ''in some way connected with Sotheby's'' as late as 1998, and that he routinely shipped artwork to London through a free-trade zone in Switzerland to avoid British import taxes.
 Mr. Scaioli could not be reached for comment, and his London lawyer did not return requests for comment. Mr. Apsis, in a brief telephone interview last week, said that he knows Mr. Scaioli. ''But I don't want to go into all that,'' he said.
 ''I know nothing about this whole Fanjul thing,'' he added. ''That happened after I left the Impressionist department at Sotheby's.''
 Since finding ''Malaga Port'' in Italy, the Fanjuls have monitored the painting's whereabouts, but they say they are not entirely sure it remains in Mr. Scaioli's possession. They continue to consider legal options to secure the painting, while pressing their work with their interests in Congress and at the White House. With Cuba now higher on the Bush administration's agenda, they said, they believe the time is ripe for the State Department and the Treasury Department to investigate the matter.
 THE Fanjuls have enlisted the help of an old friend: Ms. Harris, the former Florida secretary of state, who is now a congresswoman. She recently wrote to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, asking him about the status of the Fanjuls' claim that Sotheby's and others have violated trade sanctions against Cuba by dealing in the Sorolla.
 A State Department official responded to Ms. Harris about 10 days ago, saying that the agency was investigating the claim and was ''committed to aggressively pursuing'' cases involving ''foreign nationals trafficking in confiscated property.''
 For his part, Pepe Fanjul says that he has been trying to reclaim his family's artwork since 1959 and that he wishes he had ''45 more years'' to pursue that goal. But he also says he does not think he will have to wait that long.
 ''I think that the Cuban government or whoever fronts for Castro and his henchmen are using this Sorolla to test the market,'' he said. ''I'm not fighting this because it's the most valuable Sorolla we have. It's about property rights and my family's heritage.''
 Pausing for a moment, he offered another thought: ''When I see those things being sold, I feel outraged.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 21 about disputed sales of art previously seized by the Cuban government misidentified the country where the Cintas Foundation, which awards scholarships to artists of Cuban descent, unsuccessfully sued Sotheby's, the auction house, in 1995. It was Britain, not Spain. 
An article on Nov. 21 about disputed sales of art that had been seized by the Cuban government referred imprecisely to the responsibilities of Alex Apsis, a former employee of the Sotheby's auction house. Mr. Apsis says he handled the consignment of three works by the Cuban impressionist Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida at Sotheby's in 1990 but never oversaw all of Sotheby's dealings in Latin American artwork. The Times was informed of the issue in a letter dated Nov. 30, and a correction was prepared then, but delayed by an editing oversight.

HEADLINE: Who's Who, and What They Paid

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
IN a city where real estate is both spectacle and obsession, the Time Warner Center has played a prominent role in New York's millennial epic. Emerging from years of struggle over the future of Columbus Circle, the project passed through the crucible of Sept. 11, 2001 (steel was going up and condominium sales were in their fourth week when the World Trade Center was leveled) and into a real estate boom of big-name architects (David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill designed it), celebrity buyers (the pop star Ricky Martin took an apartment) and stratospheric prices. 
 If nothing else, the two-pronged complex, like a giant tuning fork vibrating to the zeitgeist, has given the current boom its biggest number and the city its most expensive apartment ever: the 76th-story, full-floor condo that the Mexican-born financier David Martinez bought in the summer of 2003 for $42.25 million.
 A little over a year later, the 198 apartments at Time Warner are about 85 percent sold, according to Louise M. Sunshine, the chairwoman and chief executive of the Sunshine Group, which marketed and sold the condos for the developers, the Related Companies and Apollo Real Estate Advisors. Ms. Sunshine trademarked the term ''five star living'' as the mantra for the center, which includes stores, the corporate offices of Time Warner, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and restaurants. Total apartment sales so far, she said, add up to $810 million. 
 It would seem, then, a good time to try to answer the perpetual question of New York real estate watchers: Who is buying, and where did the money come from? 
 A study of transactions at the Time Warner Center, based on deeds, mortgage documents and other papers filed with public agencies, and interviews with real estate professionals and condo buyers, paints a picture of a diverse and exceedingly wealthy cast of characters culled from the upper ranks of the global economy. 
 Infinite permutations of possible lobby encounters or elevator rides spring to mind. Prince Turki bin Khalid of the Saudi royal family might chat with the Turkish construction magnate Ali R. Bozkurt, who has worked on major projects in Mecca and Medina and was held hostage by Iraqi forces during the invasion of Kuwait. Pamela and Richard Kramlich, collectors of avant-garde video art, might strike up a conversation with Gerard L. Cafesjian, a collector of the glass sculptures of Dale Chihuly. At least 10 doctors are involved in Time Warner transactions, as well as a hospital administrator, a pair of cosmetic dentists and entrepreneurs in the fields of insurance and drug plans, and New Yorkers might be forgiven if they fantasize about one particularly crowded elevator car stuck somewhere on a high floor. 
 In other words, for all its global trappings and glitz, the Time Warner Center is still a New York apartment house, which means it is a place of stories, chance meetings and crisscrossing lives. Here are a few of them:

South Building, One Central Park
 76th floor, full floor with terrace, $42.25 million. David Martinez is the managing partner of Fintech Advisory, a firm with offices in London and New York that specializes in buying and selling the debt of countries and corporations. For his record payment, Mr. Martinez acquired two units, filling the entire 76th floor and half the 77th. (Actually, the buildings have only 53 floors, according to the condominium's offering plan, but, reasoning that a more prosaic structure might squeeze 80 stories into the same 700 feet, the developer decided to number them from the top down, starting at 80.)
 Mr. Martinez knocked out the floor separating the two units to create a massive, south-facing living room with a 25-foot ceiling and panoramic windows. He took possession of the apartment in August 2003, but people who have seen the unit say it remains largely raw space. A person informed of some of the financier's plans said Mr. Martinez intends to install a large reflecting pool, some 15 feet across, in the center of the living room. Plans for a giant aquarium were scrapped because of complications in reinforcing the floor, the person said. Mr. Martinez and his architect, Peter Marino, did not return calls. 
 74th floor, three bedrooms, $9.1 million. Gregory H. Olsen's apartment seems almost like a bargain next to the $20 million he has reportedly paid to go into space with a crew of Russian cosmonauts, perhaps next year. Mr. Olsen's company, Sensors Unlimited, based in Princeton, N.J., makes infrared sensors used by the military and by industry for things like detecting spoiled fruit. He sold the company for $700 million in 2000 at the height of the technology boom, then bought it back for close to $7 million two years later. Mr. Olsen, who lives in New Jersey, finished work on the apartment this month and says he will use it two or three nights a week. He said he is looking forward to having his grandchildren over for Thanksgiving. ''It's a great view of the parade,'' he said. 
 72nd floor, three bedrooms, $9.5 million. Using a company called Harbour-Land Enterprises, David Kwok Po Li, 65, agreed to buy this four-bedroom apartment four days before Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Li is chief executive of the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong and a director of Dow Jones, Campbell Soup, Hong Kong and China Gas and other corporations. Calls to Mr. Li's representative in New York were not returned. 
 71st floor, three bedrooms, $8.2 million. Susan A. Hancock and Raymond W. Otis sold their computer marketing firm, the Hancock Information Group, in 2001 to a subsidiary of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp for an undisclosed amount. The couple's primary residence is in Winter Park, Fla., and they used the Florida-based designer Sam Ewing to create an apartment that would accentuate their collection of modern art, which has an emphasis on Japanese artists like Takashi Murakami. Ms. Hancock is on the acquisition committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Otis said he likes his new apartment because it's not like home. ''You walk out the front door and you're right in New York,'' he said. ''It hits you right in the face.'' 
 70th floor, 4 bedrooms, $9.1 million. Keith L. Reinhard is the chairman of DDB Worldwide, one of the world's largest advertising agencies. He is credited with coming up with the McDonald's slogan ''You deserve a break today.''
 69th floor, two apartments, $8.1 million. Prince Turki bin Khalid picked out these two units while in New York the summer before 9/11, although documents filed with the city show the contracts were not made final until a month after the terror attack. His lawyer, Nancy Dutton, said he did not consider pulling out of the transaction. The prince, a sports aficionado who works with the Saudi national soccer team, will keep the apartments and hopes to use them once American sentiment toward his country becomes more favorable, she said. In the meantime, one of the apartments is being used by friends as a pied-a-terre and the other is vacant. In at least one way, the details of the prince's purchase suggest an alternative to the popular perception of the Saudi royals as an undifferentiated clan with uniformly bottomless pockets. About two-thirds of the purchases at Time Warner were made in cash. The prince got a mortgage. 
 66th floor, three bedrooms, $5.3 million. Time Warner's marketing team focused on art collectors and successfully sold several of them on the complex. The addition of Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher to the roster of condo owners could only have made their job easier. Mr. Meyer is director of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. Mr. Fletcher is a consultant who works with collectors. They moved in August from a prewar building on the East Side. ''We came from a very respectable apartment on Park Avenue and sort of shook off the respectable life,'' Mr. Fletcher said jokingly. Calling the view ''totally addictive,'' he added, ''You can stand in your kitchen and make your cappuccino in the morning and see the park.'' 
 66th floor, two bedrooms, $2.3 million. Ali R. Bozkurt is the chairman of BMB, a Turkish firm that specializes in the construction of roads, airports, tunnels and power plants. Mr. Bozkurt also owns a stake in an American company with a license to drill for oil in Kazakhstan. In August 1990, Mr. Bozkurt was at a construction project in northern Kuwait when the Iraqi army invaded. In his self-published memoir, ''When I Was Saddam's Hostage,'' Mr. Bozkurt recounts the eight-day ordeal of his captivity in brutal desert conditions at the hands of Iraqi soldiers. The experience, he wrote, made him see the world differently, and he has since worked to promote democracy. Mr. Bozkurt's broker, Michael Shvo, president of the Shvo Group, said his condo is being offered for rent for $9,800 a month. 
 65th floor, four bedrooms, $6.7 million. It didn't take long for a pair of Time Warner tenants to land in court, although the dispute had nothing to do with the sort of neighborly spats typical of other New York buildings. The deed filed with the city shows that the Latin pop star Ricky Martin signed a contract for this condo in late February, not much more than a week after his lawyers were in state court in Manhattan filing a $2.5 million lawsuit against Angelo Medina, his longtime manager. Mr. Martin had opted not to renew Mr. Medina's contract the previous year, and the lawsuit charged the manager had not delivered on services for which he'd been paid in advance. 
 But Mr. Medina was not only Mr. Martin's former manager, he was his future neighbor. Mr. Medina's condo, a two-bedroom, $3.7 million unit, is also on the 65th floor, but in the north tower. Mr. Medina's unit faces north and Mr. Martin's faces south. 
 Mr. Medina responded to Mr. Martin's legal action in May, filing a $63 million lawsuit in Puerto Rico, alleging that the singer had broken a promise to let him continue representing him on the island. Peace was restored last month, however, when the two men agreed to settle their differences. Mr. Medina, who also owns a television sports channel and a professional basketball team in Puerto Rico, said he ran into Mr. Martin earlier this month in the lobby of his building, and they exchanged a quick hello. ''It was nice,'' he said. 
 64th floor, five bedrooms, $8.8 million. Verna R. Harrah worked as a cocktail waitress and a real estate agent before marrying her first husband, Bill Harrah, the Nevada casino magnate, in 1973. After his death in 1978, the casino business was sold for $300 million and Mrs. Harrah received a large portion of the proceeds. She went on to become a movie producer, scoring a hit with her first film in 1997, the reptilian thriller ''Anaconda.'' The movie took in $136 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to the Web site boxofficeguru.com. A sequel, ''Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,'' has taken in $42 million since its release in August, according to another Web site, the-numbers.com. 
 56th floor, two-bedroom duplex, $4.2 million. Chester C. Davenport is the managing director of Georgetown Partners, a private investment firm based in Bethesda, Md. He is considered one of the wealthiest black entrepreneurs in the nation, with a net worth estimated in 1999 at $100 million. Mr. Davenport declined to discuss his plans for the apartment. 
 52nd floor, two bedrooms, $2.1 million. John W. Kluge was once the richest man in America, parlaying the sale of television and cellphone companies into a huge fortune. Last year he stood at No. 17 on the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people, with an estimated net worth of $10.5 billion. Edward A. Hopkins, an associate of Mr. Kluge, said the apartment was bought at Mr. Kluge's ''direction,'' but declined to discuss his plans for the condo.

North Building, Residences at Mandarin Oriental
 76th floor, five bedroom duplex, with terrace, $24 million. At 6,511 square feet, only the full-floor penthouses are larger than this duplex unit, which is under contract to Jack Silver, the president of SIAR Capital. Mr. Silver's firm runs a fund that invests in companies poised for growth. ''We bought ourselves a one-of-a-kind apartment,'' said Mr. Silver, who expects to take possession of the condo next month. ''The views from the north tower are much better,'' he said. ''You see the entire park, you can see well into New Jersey, well into Nassau County and it's just extraordinary.'' Mr. Silver and his wife, Shirley, both grew up in New York. ''I'm from Queens and she's from Brooklyn and we started with nothing,'' he said. 
 76th floor, four bedrooms, with terrace, $15.7 million. Michael Hirtenstein, the chief executive of WestCom, is in contract to buy this apartment, which he said he chose because of the terrace and the perks of living over a hotel. ''It's 32 seconds into the swimming pool,'' he said. ''I've timed it.'' December will be a busy month for Mr. Hirtenstein, whose company provides bandwidth and telecommunications services to the financial industry. He said he expects to close a deal on Dec. 9 to sell an 80 percent stake in WestCom to J.P. Morgan Chase. Papers were filed with the Federal Trade Commission this month to clear the way for the sale. One week later he will close on the apartment.
 75th floor, six bedrooms, $15.6 million. At least 10 doctors were involved in purchases at the Time Warner Center. Topping the list is Dr. Joseph H. Levine, a cardiologist at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y., where he is the director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia and Pacemaker Center. In March, Dr. Levine and his wife, Karen T. Levine, formed a company called KJ Home Acquisition, which bought an apartment created by combining two units into a single 5,325 square foot condo, according to documents filed with the city and state. 
 A lawyer for the couple, Stuart Gross, said that Mrs. Levine holds a majority interest in the company, and that other family members hold a stake as well. The Levines declined to discuss their plans for the apartment. Other doctors in the complex include dermatologists and fertility experts. 
 75th floor, three bedrooms, $8.5 million. Nurzhan Subkhanberdin is the chairman of Kazkommertsbank, the largest private bank in Kazakhstan. The bank has reported assets of $4 billion. Mr. Subkhanberdin's lawyer, Scott Segal, said the banker plans to use the apartment during trips to New York.
 75th floor, two bedrooms, $2.9 million. This unit was purchased by Pacific American, an import-export company. Pacific American had offices on the 47th floor of the World Trade Center's north tower at the time of the terrorist attack. The firm's managing director, George F. Meng, told a reporter from The San Francisco Chronicle that after the first plane hit, he hunkered down in his office, waiting for rescuers and trying to keep the smoke out by sealing his door with paper towels and tape. Finally, after the south tower collapsed, he made his way down the stairs and got out of the building just before it came down. Reached at his new office at One Penn Plaza, Mr. Meng was reluctant to talk about his high-rise acquisition. ''We're going to use it for the company's purposes,'' he said. 
 74th floor, three bedrooms, $8.4 million. Veronica Atkins, the widow of Dr. Robert C. Atkins, reportedly sold her stake in his diet products company after his death last year. In a report in June, The Boston Globe estimated the doctor's estate at $600 million, with much of it expected to go toward financing diet research. 
 73rd floor, three bedrooms, $8.7 million. Michael A. Spencer is chief executive of ICAP, a London-based bond trading firm. Mr. Spencer was No. 163 on a list of the wealthiest people in Britain published this year by The Mail on Sunday. The paper estimated his net worth at $:253 million (the equivalent of about $470 million).
 71st floor, six bedrooms, $15.3 million. Gerard L. Cafesjian was executive vice president of West Publishing when it was sold to Thomson in 1996 for $3.4 billion. Mr. Cafesjian, who was born in Brooklyn, cashed out his partial ownership stake for an undisclosed amount. A collector of glass pieces by artists such as Dale Chihuly, he has given more than $50 million toward the creation of a contemporary art museum in Yerevan, Armenia. 
 69th floor, two bedrooms, $3.8 million. Pablo Ardila, 35, took office earlier this year as governor of Cundinamarca, the Colombian province that includes the capital, Bogota. Mr. Ardila and his parents, Jaime Ardila and Hellen Sierra Ardila, arranged for the purchase of the Time Warner apartment this summer through a company they control, Mr. Ardila said. 
 ''My parents always wanted to have an apartment in New York,'' Mr. Ardila said by telephone from Bogota. ''It was some sort of wish and, well, my father is 85 and my mother is 71 and I kind of figured that should be something they should have.'' The older Mr. Ardila is the founder and owner of the Colombian tabloid El Espacio and a former governor of the province of Santander. The family also has real estate in Florida and farmland and cattle in Colombia, his son said. The older Mr. Ardila was kidnapped by guerrillas in 1993 and held for about a month before being released. 
 68th floor, two bedrooms, $3.7 million. William Hall Wendel Jr. retired two years ago as chairman of Polaris Industries, a Minnesota company that manufactures snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles. He continues to hold a major share of stock in the company, which reported $1.6 billion in sales last year. A dedicated mountain climber, Mr. Wendel has climbed the world's seven highest peaks. He scaled the summit of Mount Everest in 1994. Mr. Wendel could not be reached.
 68th floor, a two bedroom unit for $3.9 million and a three bedroom unit for $4.7 million. These apartments were purchased by companies controlled by the Turkish sisters Sevil Sabanci Sabanci and Dilek Sabanci. The women are daughters of Sakip Sabanci, a Turkish industrialist who was considered the richest man in Turkey when he died in April at age 71. He was ranked last year at No. 123 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, with an estimated $2.8 billion family fortune. The Sabancis did not respond to a request for an interview made through their lawyer. 
 67th floor, two bedroom, $3.8 million. Alan B. Miller is chief executive of Universal Health Services, one of the nation's largest for-profit hospital operators. His compensation last year was $9,315,065, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Miller is from Brooklyn and his wife, Jill, is from Queens. The couple live in Pennsylvania, but Mr. Miller said they see their new Manhattan pied-a-terre as a kind of homecoming. 
 67th floor, two bedrooms, $3.9 million. Alexander M. Vik is chief executive of Xcelera, a firm based in the Cayman Islands that invests in and develops Internet-related companies. Xcelera was delisted from the American Stock Exchange last Monday because it was late in filing financial statements. The company announced the next day that its stock would begin over-the-counter trading and be quoted on the Pink Sheets, a clearinghouse for information on penny stocks. Xcelera started out several years ago as a fund specializing in Scandinavian stocks and later became an operating company running a hotel in the Canary Islands. It changed its spots again in 1999, with the announcement that it had invested in an Internet firm. Before the announcement, however, Mr. Vik's family was given options to buy one million shares of Xcelera stock at $3.25 each. The stock price subsequently soared, reaching $139.50 by the end of 1999. 
 Taking stock splits into account, published reports in 2000 estimated the value of the Viks' option position at $415 million. The same stock was quoted at 33 cents a share on the Pink Sheets last week. Mr. Vik could not be reached for comment.
 66th floor, one bedroom, $1.5 million. Dennis Mangone, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group, represented the buyers of eight apartments at the Time Warner Center, most notably Ricky Martin. He also bought one for himself. 
 65th floor, two bedrooms, $2.6 million. Elizabeth L. Sample and Brenda S. Powers are two of the leading brokers at Brown Harris Stevens. They worked on at least three transactions in the towers. 
 64th floor, two bedrooms, $3.8 million. C.Richard Kramlich and Pamela Kramlich. Mr. Kramlich is general partner at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm that finances tech companies, and a director of the Chalone Wine Group and Zhone Technologies. The couple are known as leading collectors of video and new media art and Mrs. Kramlich is a director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

HEADLINE: Struggling Airlines Compete Fiercely for China Routes

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Five United States airlines are fighting for a business opportunity not seen in a decade and a half: flights to China. 
 Over the next 15 months, the authorities in Beijing will allow two daily round trips from a major American city to Shanghai or another large city in China. They have also approved, in principle, additional routes for both passengers and cargo, and those flights would be phased in over five years. 
 The first of the new routes is to begin in March 2005, the next one added in 2006, and the Department of Transportation will determine whether this second route will be for a passenger or cargo flight. 
 One or two routes to China do not sound like a big source of revenue for an airline, but this represents a growth market for United States airlines struggling with troubled balance sheets and increased domestic competition from low-cost carriers. 
 Since 1987, only two passenger airlines, Northwest and United, have flown to China, because Beijing restricts air traffic from overseas. But in July, the Transportation Department and the Civil Aviation Administration of China negotiated an agreement that would allow the number of flights between the two countries to increase nearly fivefold over the next five years, to 249 a week. 
 Almost as soon as the agreement was announced, the United States airlines started lining up. Three long-haul carriers -- Delta, American and Continental -- are competing against two smaller carriers, Hawaiian Airlines and North American Airlines. United hopes to expand its business in the China market, and so has also submitted a bid with the Transportation Department to fly the new route. Northwest has filed for only a future cargo route and not for passenger flights.
 The airlines are to submit their final bids today to the Transportation Department, which will then choose the carriers for the two new trans-Pacific routes. 
 Unlike the airline market in the United States, where intense competition is making it difficult for most of the large carriers to be profitable, routes to Asia make money. 
 ''China is obviously a big and growing market,'' said D. Scott Yohe, Delta's senior vice president for government affairs.
 Since 2000, passenger traffic between the United States and China has increased 53 percent, to 185,000 passengers, in the first five months of this year, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
 ''There's no question it's an important route for any airline,'' said Dan McKinnon, the founder and president of North American Airlines, which is based at Kennedy International Airport in New York. ''It doesn't matter if it's American, Delta or Continental. It's important for all of us.''
 Delta projected that it would get an overall economic boost of about $400 million annually if it added service to China, though some analysts called that optimistic. Hawaiian Airlines said the state of Hawaii could expect about $11 million more in tax revenue from it during the first year of service to China.
 American, while indicating that it did not have hard figures for revenue, said its plan would be to fly 136,000 passengers to China the first year. ''In the long run, we think this is a very profitable area of the world to be in,'' said William Ris, American's senior vice president for government affairs. 
 The competing airlines have started campaigns to win the routes. American, the largest carrier, outlines its case on a separate Web site, http://flyaatochina.com, and lists more than 100 members of Congress who have sent letters of support to Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta. 
 Delta has set up a similar section on its Web site where people can e-mail a letter to Mr. Mineta that says in part, ''Delta's proposal to provide daily nonstop service from Atlanta to Beijing in March 2006 is the best proposal.'' A company spokeswoman said Delta supporters had sent at least 9,000 messages.
 Since September, the airlines have been trading jabs in thousands of pages of legal filings with the Transportation Department. 
 Hawaiian Airlines said in its filing, ''Chicago simply cannot adequately serve those passengers most in need of new service to China, those in the western United States.'' 
 That was a jab at American Airlines, which would fly to China from Chicago. Then, Hawaiian took aim at Delta and Continental, declaring, ''Atlanta, much like Newark, is simply not a good choice for this service.'' 
 Delta has proposed flying to China from its hub in Atlanta, and Continental from Newark.
 Of North American Airlines, Hawaiian added, ''Little can be said that provides a hint that North American understands the market or has the background or capability to serve the market.''
 In its filing, North American was more subdued. ''Two legacy carriers and the three major alliances already serve China,'' it said. ''Given this fact, why shouldn't the public have access to a low-fare carrier to China?''

HEADLINE: International Conference Seeks Consensus on Iraq

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
For the first time since the Bush administration began its now-troubled enterprise to reshape Iraq, an international conference of foreign ministers and other senior officials will gather Monday to try to reach a rudimentary consensus on how to stabilize the violence-soaked nation. 
 Washington's past determination to go it alone in Iraq and staunch opposition from many quarters to the American-led occupation have long stymied any international effort on Iraq. So organizers are calling the meeting at this beach resort a milestone in itself even though few sweeping changes are expected. 
 ''It is a conference aimed at reconciling things,'' Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the Egyptian foreign minister, said in an interview. ''It is not a conference to add to further confrontations.'' 
 ''People have come to the conclusion that the stability of Iraq has to be the objective,'' he said. ''The chaos, violence, bombings, civilian killings and whatever is happening right now in Iraqi cities is not stability. The conference will have to address that and to try to help put Iraq on a certain course to bring it stability.''
 The two-day gathering of about 20 foreign ministers from the United States, Europe, Russia, China and the Middle East, as well as the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, the leader of the Arab League and others, is occurring at an awkward time for the Arab and Muslim world.
 Emotions remain raw amid the American assault on Falluja, with the fate of its civilian population still unclear and with the repeated broadcasting of a videotape that shows what appears to be a marine shooting a wounded insurgent. 
 ''How can any Muslim understand having his brothers shot dead, in cold blood, at a mosque?'' said Sheik Youssef Qaradawi, an Egyptian-born cleric based in Qatar whose pronouncements often reflect broad public opinion in the region, in an appearance on Saturday night on Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite network. ''How can he accept to see houses destroyed and children slaughtered? Resistance is a legitimate matter. Even more, it's an obligation.'' 
 Iraq's neighbors and the Arab world at large have been deeply ambivalent about the enterprise from the beginning. If it succeeded, they feared the United States would be tempted to continue to throw its military weight around in the region. 
 But if it failed, Iraq might crack apart and the ensuing flames singe them all. 
 Support for the conference by national leaders, despite domestic objections, reflects a growing consensus that Iraq is tipping dangerously toward the latter outcome, and that it is time to find some way to help the United States, at least to help usher its military out of the region. 
 ''Rather than turning our backs on the U.S., we should get more engaged and put them on the right track,'' said a senior Turkish official who will attend the conference and spoke on condition of anonymity. ''If we just yelled at them all the time but did nothing, that is not a rational move. We should get more engaged to make them think big and correct.''
 That attitude has caused no small amount of public grumbling that Arab and other governments in the region may be merely supplying cover while the United States continues to kill Arabs. 
 ''This conference is to provide a kind of legitimate cover for the United States,'' said Dr. Awad Al-Qarny, a Saudi writer and one of 26 prominent religious figures who recently signed a public petition supporting jihad against the American forces. ''Streams of blood are flowing in Iraq, and Sharm el Sheik will not change an iota of that reality.'' 
 Even if the Arab and other leaders want to solve the problems in Iraq, they cannot because they have no cards to play, he added. 
 In the weeks before the conference, the most heated wrangling over various issues -- including defining a timetable for an American military withdrawal and the reduction of Iraq's debts -- occurred between the United States and France, with occasional involvement by the Germans, Russians and Chinese, diplomats who participated said. 
 Those countries traditionally hostile to the United States in the region, such as Syria and Iran, kept a low profile. The United States hopes the conference will press both to do more to prevent insurgents from flowing over their borders. 
 Rumors have suggested that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell might meet with his Iranian counterpart on the conference sidelines. But both sides downplay the prospect. 
 In Tehran on Sunday, Hamidreza Assefi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, maintained that Iran had no interest in such a meeting because Mr. Powell had announced his resignation. ''Powell had four years to change America's policy and its attitude towards Iran but did not succeed,'' Mr. Assefi said. ''Now he has no position, so negotiations cannot be useful.''
 The spokesman also said Iran wanted to attend the conference to voice its strong opposition to the United States' presence in Iraq. 
 The United States considers the meeting, especially given Mr. Bush's recent re-election, a forum to reaffirm United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, passed last June, urging increased security, a transition to a new constitutional government by January 2006 and support for economic reconstruction. 
 Washington has tried to ensure that nothing at this conference goes beyond that resolution. It blocked France, for example, which had pushed hard to include representatives of other Iraqi political parties and non-governmental organizations. 
 Instead, the final declaration will call for the Iraqi government to hold a meeting that broadens the number of political parties and other participants in the national elections in January. On Sunday, the body organizing the Iraqi elections announced that they would take place on Jan. 30, although violence has thrown that date into question. 
 Pushing for broader political participation is one important way this conference will differ from the United Nations discussions and push the process of stabilizing Iraq forward a little bit, Mr. Aboul Gheit, the Egyptian foreign minister, said. 
 The final agreement will make clear that the American presence is not open-ended, he said, with the idea that announcing a more open political process and a time frame for elections might encourage some elements of the resistance to stop the bloodshed. 
 He said that one issue in the United Nations resolution unlikely to be raised except on a bilateral basis was sending troops to protect the United Nations workers who are expected to supervise the elections. Iraq has made clear that it does not want soldiers from any neighboring states, who will form the core of this conference. The foreign ministers of Iraq's neighbors plus Egypt will hold their first session on Monday, before the main conference on Tuesday. 
 Egypt's foreign minister said one reason that the United States and other countries may finally be able to approach agreement on Iraq now is that supporters and opponents of the war have seen their ambitions and fears overwhelmed by the harsh realities of Iraq. 
 ''There have been these voices saying 'Let's turn Iraq into Germany,''' Mr. Aboul Gheit said. ''Germany, prior to the Second World War and after it, was part and parcel of Western civilization. Iraq is not. Iraq is an Arab country with an Arab and Kurdish culture, an Islamic culture. Iraq is not and will not be Germany.''

HEADLINE: On New York's Streets, Warning of a Crackdown by China

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
Cendana Wirasari Adiwarga sat perfectly still, her eyelids shut tight as Quincy Sun dragged a toothpick soaked with fake blood across her plump left cheek.
 ''There, all done,'' Ms. Sun said, appraising her handiwork. Ms. Adiwarga's smooth skin had been transformed into a garish tableau of bloody cuts and bruises. Ms. Adiwarga then rose to take her place inside a tiny metal cage, where she planned to sit for three hours on a blustery late October morning opposite a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. 
 ''Maybe if people here see me suffer, they will know just one tiny speck of suffering in China,'' Ms. Adiwarga said. 
 The two women had flown long hours at considerable expense from the Far East to spread the word about the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice of calisthenics and meditation that the Chinese government has banned and branded an ''evil cult.'' 
 They and hundreds of other demonstrators from across the globe are flooding the streets and subways of New York, cheerfully but very persistently pressing stacks of literature into the hands of harried passers-by, waving gruesome photographs of victims and simulating brutal acts of torture. They claim that the Chinese government is not only suppressing the practice in China, as has been widely known and largely condemned, but that it is using harassment, spying and intimidation to destroy Falun Gong in the United States. 
 Supporters of the Falun Gong movement say 1,100 have died and thousands more have been tortured and imprisoned for their beliefs, chiefly in China, but increasingly in other countries.
 Independent human rights groups say that practitioners of Falun Gong in China have been sent to labor camps, subjected to physical and psychological torture and killed since the Chinese government cracked down on the movement, which claims 100 million followers worldwide, in 1999. 
 While the situation in China attracted a good deal of attention in 1999 and 2000, its plight has largely fallen off the radar screen as the Chinese government has repressed the movement there, human rights officials say. 
 Thus the demonstrations in New York, which play out in parks and on street corners from City Hall to the Museum of Natural History. They began in earnest with the Republican National Convention in August but have continued, buoyed by volunteers from around the world like Ms. Adiwarga and Ms. Sun, from Indonesia and Australia. Others come from Taiwan, Singapore and New Zealand. 
 ''Not content with torturing and killing in their own country, the Chinese government has carried out campaigns of intimidation'' against practitioners in the United States, said Levi Browde of the New York Falun Dafa Association. ''They send consular officials to intimidate practitioners here in the United States, even American citizens. We think Americans should be aware of what the Chinese government does in their own country.'' 
 Demonstrators say that the effort grew out of an e-mail and Internet daisy chain rather than a centrally organized campaign, and that they are paying their own way, bunking six to a room in cheap hotels or staying with practitioners who live in New York. Most who come are ethnic Chinese; few speak much English. They stay for a week or two, longer if they can afford it, and then are replaced by new volunteers. 
 The demonstrations are graphic. Photographs depict emaciated corpses, or victims with faces burned or battered. Over the past couple of months they have become a fixture on the city's streets, deeply unironic bits of street theater, drawing very mixed responses. 
 ''The pictures are so gross, but when you see it day after day you just get desensitized,'' said Staci Singer, a stockbroker for TD Waterhouse, as she stood on Water Street last week, a few feet from Falun Gong demonstrators. ''I just wish they'd go away.'' 
 But the displays also elicit sympathy. 
 ''At first I thought it looks like a performance, some kind of art theater,'' said Reinhard Kressner, a Berliner visiting New York, who stopped to look at a particularly gruesome demonstration in Lower Manhattan, and was moved enough to sign a petition supporting Falun Gong. ''This is about human rights. No one should suffer like this.''
 Falun Gong, which literally means ''Law Wheel Cultivation,'' is a form of qigong, an ancient Chinese practice of breathing exercises. It is related to tai chi, and incorporates elements of Buddhism and other Eastern religions. 
 Falun Gong differs from most qigong practices in that it combines spiritual elements of moral self-improvement with some strange-sounding beliefs (practitioners believe that there is a wheel spinning in their bellies, expelling evil and attracting good) and an apocalyptic vision, said Maria Hsia Chang, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, who wrote a book about Falun Gong. 
 ''They believe that as you do the exercises not only will your health improve, it will also transform you spiritually until one reaches enlightenment,'' Dr. Chang said of Falun Gong members. 
 While some are sympathetic to the plight of its practitioners, other qigong groups have been quick to distance themselves from Falun Gong and its religious, messianic overtones, in part to spare their practitioners harassment in China. The practice is based on the writings of a former Chinese government clerk named Li Hongzhi, whose teachings inspired a huge following in China in the early 1990's after the government relaxed restrictions on private social groups. As the movement grew, the Chinese government cracked down, Dr. Chang said, perceiving in its popularity a threat to the central government's dominance. 
 Mr. Li fled China in the late 1990's and is thought to live in Queens, Dr. Chang said. He rarely appears in public. The group claims no central organization. There are no clergy members and no houses of worship. Practitioners meet in public places. 
 The current protests, the most intense the group has mounted in New York, are aimed largely at publicizing what the practitioners claim is a concerted effort by the Chinese government to harass practitioners and their supporters in the United States and other countries. 
 Practitioners of Falun Gong have filed several lawsuits in recent years against Chinese officials and embassy employees. They have compiled a list of incidents that runs 300 pages. 
 In an example cited in a federal lawsuit, a practitioner was attacked by men believed to be associated with the Chinese consulate in San Francisco while handing out Falun Gong literature in a public park. Tires were slashed on the car that a practitioner in Flushing used to transport Falun Gong materials, the papers said. 
 The complexity of serving papers on a sovereign government has held up the lawsuit, which was filed in Federal Court in Washington in April 2002, according to Jason Dzubow, a lawyer handling the case, but arrangements to serve papers though the State Department are currently being finalized, he said. 
 It is difficult to determine the veracity of the claims of harassment and even harder to ascertain whether the Chinese government has any connection to them. Practitioners have filed complaints with the police and with the F.B.I., according to the lawsuit, but it is unclear how law enforcement views the charges. 
 After residents of his district said they had been hassled while picketing the Chinese consulate in New York, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey asked the Manhattan district attorney to investigate, but said he did not know the outcome of the cases.
 Mr. Dzubow said the similarities in complaints across the country is evidence that the harassment is coordinated. He said that at least one defendant in the case, the leader of a Chinese-American business association in Chicago, met with high-level Chinese officials. But he acknowledged that the plaintiffs had little evidence of direct involvement by the Chinese government. 
 The spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Sun Weide, denied that anyone connected with the Chinese government had broken United States laws. But he said repeatedly in a telephone interview that Falun Gong is an ''evil cult has ruined lives, destroyed families and harmed society,'' and that efforts to limit its spread were legitimate. 
 ''We think it is the responsibility of any responsible government to combat this kind of evil cult,'' Mr. Sun said. 
 Gail Rachlin, a real estate broker in Manhattan who serves as a sort of unofficial spokeswoman for Falun Gong in New York, said that the practice was peaceful, and that its adherents had no political aims.
 ''People engaged in gentle exercises to improve their health who embrace truthfulness, compassion and forbearance are no threat to the Chinese government,'' Ms. Rachlin said. ''All we seek is the right to practice without fear of death and torture.''
 Congress passed a resolution last month demanding that the Chinese government ''immediately stop interfering in the exercise of religious and political freedoms within the United States, such as the right to practice Falun Gong, that are guaranteed by the United States Constitution,'' and urging the attorney general to investigate allegations of harassment and intimidation by Chinese officials. 
 But the practice's supporters say worldwide pressure has relaxed in recent years as China gains greater acceptance from the United States and others. 
 ''I think a lot of human rights violations in China have dropped off the radar screen since the Chinese have been taken under our bosom as our allies in the war on terror,'' said William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. He questioned whether the notion that increased economic exchange with and in China would improve human rights. 
 And so Henny Chen, a 35-year-old merchandiser for a garment company in Jakarta, took two weeks off work, paid $865 for a round-trip ticket to New York and crammed into a room with other practitioners at a cheap Times Square hotel.
 ''If American people know how the Chinese government hurts people, maybe they would ask their government to help us,'' Ms. Chen said. ''We are here to show the truth.''

HEADLINE: Shhh, Don't Say 'Poverty'

BYLINE: By Bob Herbert. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas who was known for his orneriness, once said, ''We're the only nation in the world where all our poor people are fat.''
 That particular example of compassionate conservatism came to mind as I looked over a report from the Department of Agriculture showing that more than 12 million American families continue to struggle, and not always successfully, to feed themselves.
 The 12 million families represent 11.2 percent of all U.S. households. ''At some time during the year,'' the report said, ''these households were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food for all their members because they had insufficient money or other resources.'' 
 Of the 12 million families that worried about putting food on the table, 3.9 million had members who actually went hungry at some point last year. ''The other two-thirds obtained enough food to avoid hunger using a variety of coping strategies,'' the report said, ''such as eating less varied diets, participating in federal food assistance programs, or getting emergency food from community food pantries or emergency kitchens.''
 These are dismal statistics for a country as well-to-do as the United States. But we don't hear much about them because hunger is associated with poverty, and poverty is not even close to becoming part of our national conversation. Swift boats, yes. Sex scenes on ''Monday Night Football,'' most definitely. The struggle of millions of Americans to feed themselves? Oh no. Let's not go there.
 What does that tell you about American values?
 We are surrounded by poor and low-income people. (The definitions can be elastic and easily blurred, but essentially we're talking about individuals and families that don't have enough money to cover the essentials -- food, shelter, clothing, transportation and so forth.) Many of them are full-time workers, and some have more than one job. 
 A new study by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research group, found that more than 550,000 families in New York -- a quarter of all working families in the state -- had incomes that were too low to cover their basic needs. 
 We just had a bitterly contested presidential election, but this very serious problem (it's hardly confined to New York) was not a major part of the debate.
 According to the study: ''Most low-income working families do not conform to the popular stereotype of the working poor as young, single, fast-food workers: 88 percent of low-income working families include a parent between 25 and 54 years old. Married couples head 53 percent of these families nationwide. Important jobs such as health aide, janitor and child care worker pay a poverty wage.''
 In its introduction, the study says, ''The implied bargain America offers its citizens is supposed to be that anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can support his or her family and move onward and upward.''
 If that was the bargain, we've broken it again and again. Low-income workers have always been targets for exploitation, and that hasn't changed. The Times's Steven Greenhouse had a troubling front-page article in last Friday's paper about workers at restaurants, supermarkets, call centers and other low-paying establishments who are forced to go off the clock and continue working for periods of time without pay.
 The federal government has not raised the minimum wage since 1997, and has made it easier for some employers to deny time-and-a-half pay to employees who work overtime.
 Franklin Roosevelt, in his second Inaugural Address, told a rain-soaked crowd, ''The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''
 I can hear the politicians in today's Washington having a hearty laugh at that sentiment.
 There are advocates and even some politicians hard at work addressing the myriad problems faced by beleaguered workers and their families. But they get very little in the way of attention or resources from the most powerful sectors of society. So the health care workers who can't afford health insurance will continue emptying bedpans for a pittance. And the janitors will clean up faithfully after the big shots who ignore them.
 These are rough times for the American dream. But times change, and the people who have broken faith with the dream won't be in power forever.

HEADLINE: Iran to Suspend Uranium Enrichment Today

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Iran pledged Sunday to meet its deadline and suspend its uranium enrichment activities on Monday, in a sign of cooperation even as the United States has been stepping up pressure over the country's nuclear program. 
 ''The suspension will begin tomorrow,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Assefi, told journalists. ''We have said that we will suspend our enrichment activities, and we will do it.'' 
 Iran agreed earlier this month with Britain, Germany and France to suspend its uranium enrichment program in return for economic benefits. The country said it would halt production on Nov. 22 in a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will meet Thursday to decide whether to send Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. 
 While Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for electricity production only, the United States has accused it of trying to make nuclear weapons. The Bush administration increased its pressure on Iran after diplomats familiar with the country's case accused it last week of racing to produce significant quantities of uranium hexafluoride, a gas that can be enriched for use in nuclear weapons, right up to its deadline. 
 An Iranian opposition group also said last week in Vienna and in Paris that Tehran was deceiving the world and conducting a secret weapons program at an undisclosed site. 
 Mr. Assefi dismissed accusations about its nuclear program and said the report about uranium hexafluoride production was ''just a part of the propaganda to weaken relations between Iran and the agency and the work on building trust with the Europeans.'' 
 ''What we have been doing over the past few days conforms with the Paris accord and had been carried out under the supervision of the agency,'' he added. 
 Mr. Assefi accused the United States of ''trickery,'' and said the Bush administration's recent allegations about Iran's nuclear activities were ''a sign of its anger.''
 ''The Americans are not happy about our cooperation with the Europeans, but taking into account that we have cooperated with the I.A.E.A. and Europe, there is nothing to be worried about,'' he said.
 Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, also denied the charges that Iran had accelerated enrichment activities, the official IRNA news agency reported.
 A team of inspectors from the I.A.E.A. is in Iran to police the complete suspension of activities related to uranium enrichment.
 In addition, a four-member group from the agency's Board of Governors visited Iran's conversion plant in the city of Isfahan on Saturday. The team is scheduled to return to Vienna on Monday.

HEADLINE: Music Industry Is Trying Out New Releases As Digital Only

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

 BODY:
As an unsigned band, the Shazam has never gotten the perks enjoyed by acts attached to major record labels. 
 ''The budgets we've used probably wouldn't even pay the catering on a major-label release,'' said Hans Rotenberry, a singer and guitarist for the Nashville band, which he said had sold several thousand copies of its self-produced recordings over the last 10 years. 
 But this week, the Shazam and seven other relatively unknown acts will get a shot at the kind of exposure that only the major record labels can provide, after being recruited for an experiment by Universal Music Group. Universal, which like other record companies has heavily relied on profits from sales of CD's, has signed the artists to a digital-only label. Starting Tuesday, it will release songs through services like iTunes from Apple Computer, Rhapsody from RealNetworks and MSN Music from Microsoft. 
 The move says a great deal about how record companies are grappling with the Internet, which has toppled established techniques for promoting talent and threatened the industry's economic structure. After years of dithering over how to sell music online, the major labels are eyeing digital sales in some cases as a first step on the road to the larger marketplace. 
 It is partly a matter of necessity. Since sales of CD's began to fall almost four years ago, hundreds of record stores have shuttered, while the remainder have devoted more shelf space to DVD's and video games, leaving less space to stock CD's. 
 But music industry executives say they can also use the Internet to measure fan interest or start a buzz for a new act before releasing an album. Universal's new label represents another leap -- the belief that by signing enough acts with small, established audiences, the company can earn a profit on digital sales alone. The new unit, Universal Music Enterprises Digital, could become a model for labels that are seeking a low-risk way to market an act without producing a physical album or underwriting a band's tour or music videos. 
 ''It's just so expensive these days to record an artist and make a video and put them out on the road to properly develop them,'' said the executive responsible for the digital label, Jay Gilbert, a senior director at Universal's Music Enterprises unit. ''This is an alternative to that that's not very expensive but can be highly effective.''
 But for the companies, shifting to a digital world means treading on unstable financial ground. Instead of plunking down $16 for an album, fans can now visit free file-sharing networks to grab songs. Even when fans pay for the music, they buy singles over albums at a ratio of more than 25 to 1, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. 
 Labels usually carry out global marketing campaigns that include several radio singles and music videos spread out over a year or more. How, executives ask, can they turn a profit if they spend the money to turn an unknown into a star and then only sell singles, which usually cost 99 cents each?
 ''The economics don't necessarily work today,'' said Bruce Resnikoff, head of Universal Music Enterprises. ''But the economics of the business are constantly changing.'' 
 To keep up with the shifts in where and how fans shop, the record companies are grasping for new approaches. As they move toward licensing their music catalogs to companies that plan to filter unauthorized material out of the free file-sharing systems, Universal has made a deal with one such company, Snocap, started by Shawn Fanning, the creator of Napster, the former file-sharing Web site. 
 Warner Music Group is developing a unit similar to Universal's, initially to sign artists and finance recordings for online sales, with the potential for later CD releases. 
 Mr. Gilbert of Universal said he came upon the idea for a digital-only label after getting to know a few Los Angeles musicians who didn't have major-label deals. 
 Mr. Gilbert said the effort provided a chance for acts whose music did not fall into the dimensions crafted by radio formats and music video television. Universal has signed acts including Rusty Anderson, a singer and guitarist who has played in Paul McCartney's band; John Jorgenson, a guitarist for Elton John; and Parthenon Huxley, who performs with former members of the art-pop act Electric Light Orchestra. 
 For the artists, the deals do have a downside. The company does not pay them an advance or cover the cost of producing an album. That part is up to the musicians, who finance their own recordings and in most cases have been selling their music -- in the form of regular plastic CD's -- through their own Web sites or outlets like Amazon. 
 The artists retain ownership of their master recordings but license them to Universal for a limited time; if online sales of an artist's music reach a certain point -- around 5,000 copies of a particular song -- the company has an option to pick up distribution of the CD to record stores. 
 Universal is paying the musicians an estimated 25 percent royalty on the retail price of the downloads, without taking the industry's standard deductions for CD packaging and promotional giveaways, according to people with knowledge of its contracts.
 In exchange for the music, Universal is throwing its considerable muscle behind promoting the artists, including them in its own advertising and seeking to license their music to films and television shows. The company will also handle online marketing. 
 The trick will be to ''reach the next frontier of consumer, the consumer searching in the digital world,'' said Mr. Resnikoff of Universal Music Enterprises.
 Other labels have been using the Internet to promote artists whose physical CD's are to be released later. Warner Brothers Records released the major-label debut of the band the Secret Machines to online services like iTunes in February, three months before it was available in stores. 
 ''What I think the physical world has told us is that there isn't a lot of room or patience for putting out an album that people don't want to buy right away,'' said Tom Whalley, the label's chairman. ''You can't let it sit in the store 6 months, 12 months, while you build up the demand.''
 The Internet music stores, however, offer endless space and the chance for artists to release new music any time, instead of taking a year or more between releases, which major labels often require. In Universal's effort, the Shazam is starting with a previously unreleased song in addition to its latest album, ''Tomorrow the World.'' 
 ''Even a token gesture from their promotional department is going to be more powerful than anything we've ever had,'' said Mr. Rotenberry, the band's singer. ''The old model never worked for us anyways.''

HEADLINE: On the Pistons' Court, a Basketball Game Breaks Out

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
This time there were no flying cups of beer. No players lunging into the stands and fighting with fans. In all, Sunday's basketball game was subdued and uneventful, everything Detroit wished Friday's contest against the Indiana Pacers had been.
 Added security was evident at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Sunday. With the number of security officers increased by 50 percent, to 200, a well-behaved crowd of 22,076 saw the depleted Pistons defeat the Charlotte Bobcats, 117-116, in double overtime. Four Pistons were suspended for the game: Ben Wallace, Derrick Coleman, Chauncey Billups and Elden Campbell. 
 For their part, the Bobcats were taking few chances; they requested and were given five additional security guards to protect the team during the game.
 But the calm at the Palace masked a growing unease among Pistons fans and management that the incident had forever sullied Detroit's image.
 Pistons Coach Larry Brown questioned whether his team and the city of Detroit had squandered the respect they earned around the country after their blissful N.B.A. championship victory last spring.
 ''Everyone kind of looked at this city and this franchise in a special way,'' Brown said, ''and now watching TV, it's just such a black eye.'' 
 He added, ''I don't know how we can overcome that.''
 Having heard on national television all weekend about how damning the brawl was for Detroiters, fans attending Sunday's game worried that the city's attempt to rebuild its image was being undermined.
 ''It sets us back,'' said Rich Burrell, 43, of Walled Lake, Mich. ''We've got more work to do. It's unfortunate that a handful of obnoxious fans made some poor judgments. Some 19,000 fans were a class act. And from my perspective, it was one guy who threw a plastic cup.''
 Burrell attended the game with his 9-year-old stepson, Alex Watson, who clutched a neon yellow sign that read, ''This fan is not a punk!''
 The melee erupted Friday night after a fan tossed a cup filled with liquid onto Indiana's Ron Artest. Artest had just committed a hard foul on the Pistons' Ben Wallace, who responded by forcefully shoving Artest. As the situation on court settled down, Artest lay on the scorer's table, where he was hit by the cup. He responded by charging into the stands and fighting with fans. The fighting escalated, drawing in more fans and players and resulting in nine injuries.
 Pistons fans had no uncertainties in assigning blame for the mess.
 ''One second we saw Artest running away from Ben, laying on the scorer's thing, and then two seconds later he was running into the stands,'' said Erin Murray, 21, of Warren, Mich., who attended Friday night's game and watched the fight unfold. For Sunday's game, Murray wore a headband on which she had written ''Arrest Artest.'' 
 Many fans said they felt that Detroit was being unfairly maligned.
 ''Detroit gets a bad rap for a lot of things, especially in sports,'' said Tom Hofstra, 52, of Grand Rapids, Mich. ''That same incident could have happened anywhere.''
 Local officials have tried to convince the nation that Detroit is not the violent, economically depressed and racially divided city it once was, and their efforts seemed to be paying off. Detroit will play host to the Super Bowl in 2006, and the city's past several sports championships have been celebrated peacefully.
 But the local history with sports championships is not all tranquil. In 1984, when the Tigers won the World Series, crowds overturned and burned cars, resulting in one death and more than 100 injuries. In 1990, when the Pistons won the N.B.A. title, rioting caused seven deaths.
 Tom Wilson, the president and chief executive of Palace Sports and Entertainment, said that based on the city's experience with previous riots, the fallout from this latest fracas would linger.
 ''We already have two strikes,'' he said. ''I think it's going to take some time to get over.''

HEADLINE: New York Port Hums Again, With Asian Trade

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
The deck of the freighter Hyundai Glory was stacked so high with cargo -- acres of containers packed with shoes, toys and living-room sets -- that it was hard to see how the ship stayed afloat as it glided into New York Harbor after a 23-day trip from China.
 The arrival of the tremendous ship, nearly as long as the Chrysler Building is tall, drew almost no notice one recent day, except from some cruise passengers who waved excitedly. But it was a testament to something equally enormous, and perhaps as overlooked, happening in the Port of New York.
 The sprawling harbor, which transformed New York into a world commercial capital in the 1800's, fell into a humiliating slump in the second half of the 20th century as other North American seaports thrived, particularly on the West Coast and in the South. But the tide has reversed for New York, driven by the explosion of trade with China, which each year is manufacturing a larger share of goods for American stores. 
 Trade through the port, which was shrinking or flat a decade ago, has grown faster in the last five years than at any point since just after World War II. The rate of that surge -- a 65 percent increase in overall container traffic since 1998 -- has been nearly twice the national average, and faster than that of any other major East Coast port except Savannah, Ga. Last year, $100 billion worth of wares moved through the port, up 12 percent in just a year.
 That new bustle signals a startling change in global shipping. Vessels like the Hyundai Glory, one of eight floating warehouses that form a weekly shuttle called the NYX or New York Express, are sailing directly from Asia, taking what used to be a prohibitively time-consuming route across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal to the Atlantic Coast. 
 These so-called All Water Route services to New York have cut traveling times so drastically that many goods once unloaded in California and carried across the country by train are now shipped straight to New York; there are nearly 20 lines today, most of them started in the last five years. 
 Having cut labor costs, New York is winning the confidence of ship lines, manufacturers and merchants, effectively becoming a satellite of the Pacific Rim. Last year, four centuries after being settled by the Dutch, a milestone was reached: New York became an Asian-dominated port instead of a European one.
 It is uncertain whether the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was caught off-guard by the strength of the resurgence, can exploit or even handle all the trade headed its way. But it is straining to respond. The authority and the operators of ship terminals that lease its land have begun $1 billion worth of expansion projects, including towering new cranes, bigger railyards, and new and enlarged wharves, a waterfront investment that is financed in part every time a commuter uses a bridge, tunnel or regional airport. 
 As the ships become larger, too, the Port Authority and the Army Corps of Engineers have embarked on one of the most extensive and expensive harbor-dredging projects in the nation's history to make way for a new generation of freighters that are even bigger than the Hyundai Glory, and cannot call on New York because the channels are too shallow. The $2.25 billion dig will continue, night and day, seven days a week, through the next decade.
 Far beyond the harbor, immense warehouses and distribution centers are under construction in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Railyards are being expanded and barge links are being created to carry the cargo to distant markets. And all of this activity is stoking the region's economy. 
 To move the goods pouring in, about 3,500 longshoremen have been hired in the last five years, and thousands of workers have been added to the more than 100,000 the port directly supports, including truck drivers, railroad workers, warehouse stockers and marine bankers. As the expansion enables the port to accept bigger ships, goods should get to New York and into the stores more quickly and cheaply, reducing prices for consumers and manufacturers in the region, according to an Army Corps study.
 New York is not the only seaport lifted by the tide of Asian imports. No one expects it to regain its status as the world's busiest container port -- a title it held until 1985 -- or the nation's. Today it is ranked 15th in the world, 3rd in the United States. 
 But the port is at a pivotal moment that offers huge promise and a stiff challenge. Though the port will certainly continue growing, it is unclear whether it will make good on plans to recapture its historic role as the dominant hub for the Midwest and Canada, or slide back to what it was becoming two decades ago: a narrower gateway serving mostly the Northeast. 
 ''The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 effectively linked our coastal seaport to a rich and burgeoning interior market; that was absolutely a defining moment,'' said Peter Stanford, founder of the South Street Seaport Museum. ''Today we again have an opportunity to capture and handle an overwhelming majority of trade coming to the East Coast. We can't afford to muff this.''
 Indeed, some question whether the Port Authority, a lumbering giant of an agency that was slow to react to the port's decline in the 1970's, can keep up with the rising demands. Already, long lines of tractor-trailers form at the entrances to the ship terminals, waiting to pick up growing loads of containers. The port has physical limits -- its open land and the narrowness of some of its most critical channels -- and these will restrict just how much it can expand. 
 Ultimately, the expansion projects are a costly gamble because the port's success or failure may hinge on forces beyond its control, from the competitive efforts of other East Coast ports to a narrow sluice of water 2,300 miles away in Panama. The Hyundai Glory squeezed through the canal recently with inches to spare, and the newest ships will not fit unless Panama decides to widen the waterway, a move that could become tangled in Central American politics.
 Port Authority officials say they are confident their investment will pay off. But first they must perform the equivalent of a U-turn for an ocean liner. Over its 83 years, the authority shifted most attention and resources from the waterfront to airports, bridges, tunnels and its grandest project, the World Trade Center. Now it has resolved to return to its original mission.
 ''We absolutely don't want to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past by ignoring how important the ports are,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the Port Authority chairman. ''We're now at a point where we're executing on a commitment to not make that mistake again. History is going to judge us as to our ability to execute.''

The Roots of Recovery
Costs Fall as Faster Ships Sail a Direct Route
 The first men to attack the Hyundai Glory were the lashers, scampering like an army of ants across its deck, after the harbor pilots and tugs had maneuvered this behemoth ever so gently from Upper New York Bay through the narrow tidal inlet to a wharf at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island.
 At a terminal where business was so scarce in the late 1980's that it shut down for a decade, the still night air began to echo with a clanging as the lashers feverishly unbuckled the steel anchors that tied down the containers, 2,087 of them, stacked 13 high from the bottom of the hull to the top of the deck, and then again 13 across. Matt Zuco, a crane operator, climbed into his glass-walled cab, 90 feet off the ground, and maneuvered his praying-mantis-like tower into place. Six cranes worked the Glory straight into the next afternoon. 
 The longshoremen are thrilled at the surge in work, which pays an average wage of $85,000 a year. The inventory of several hundred idle longshoremen who were paid not to work a decade ago -- part of a job guarantee that many seized when the port slumped -- has shrunk to fewer than 40. In just the last two years, more than 1,000 new union members, mostly young men who had never worked on the waterfront before, have been hired, and the terminals have extended their hours.
 ''You can sense it, you can see it,'' said Santo Lanza, a member of Mr. Zuco's gang. ''There is more work, more production. There is a future here.''
 But the boisterous dock scene immortalized in ''On the Waterfront'' is long gone. The heart of the port has shifted west from the Hudson piers and Brooklyn to the Elizabeth-Port Authority Marine Terminal and Port Newark in New Jersey, where rail lines and highways link the terminals to the rest of the country. The goods come in huge containers rather than in smaller crates, and most of their handling is automated. Only about 5,500 longshoremen work on the wharves today, down from 39,000 in 1955.
 And the people in charge are not the union bosses and stevedores who once forced shippers and merchants to use the Hudson and Brooklyn piers. The real power brokers today are global importers like M. Richard Markovich, the director of international logistics at Michaels, a chain of 850 arts-and-crafts stores based in Irving, Tex.
 Last year, Michaels moved nearly 140,000 tons of imports to the United States, 99 percent of them from Asia. One-quarter of these goods came through New York. Five years ago, not a single shipment did.
 How and why Michaels shifted so many deliveries to New York explains, in large part, the port's new vigor. During the 1970's and 80's, when America's trade with Asia started to take off, the standard route was to ship containers to the West Coast, then double-stack them on rail cars that carried them across the country. By 1993, this route, nicknamed the ''mini land bridge,'' turned Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., into the nation's two biggest container ports.
 The route became so popular that in 1990 the New York port handled fewer containers than in 1980, even as imports surged nationwide. By then, major ship lines had set up the first All Water Route lines, using the Suez Canal to serve Southeast Asia and then the Panama Canal to serve Northeast Asia, bringing cargo directly to New York and other Atlantic ports.
 The big retailers say they knew all along that the mini land bridge did not make complete sense; the Northeast, after all, is the nation's biggest consumer marketplace. ''You want to go where the people are,'' Mr. Markovich said. 
 But before the new water services could flourish, retailers had to build enormous East Coast distribution centers where imported products could be stored or processed before going to stores. The warehouse construction began in Southeastern ports like Savannah, which Wal-Mart has adopted as one of its most important import hubs. Now it is the New York region's turn.
 In 2002, Michaels opened a warehouse with 13 football fields' worth of floor space in Hazleton, Pa., handling deliveries that arrive in New York, destined for stores from Maryland to Maine and as far west as Ohio. Lowe's, the home improvement chain, has a new distribution center in nearby Pottsville, Pa., as does Big Lots, a 1,400-store discount retailer. Vast warehouses have also opened or are under construction in central New Jersey, where Home Depot and Williams-Sonoma have set up camp. 
 Meanwhile, New York's reputation as a forbiddingly expensive port has been tempered by a 1990 agreement with longshoremen that allows lower salaries for newly hired workers; half of the workers are paid at this reduced rate, cutting labor costs by $46 million just last year. On the West Coast, an 11-day strike by dockworkers in 2002 had retail executives like Mr. Markovich demanding that the ship lines increase their services to the East Coast. Since then, the flow of Asian wares into West Coast ports has become a flood; at times, as many as 80 ships are waiting to unload.
 So to get merchandise to the East Coast, ship lines have invested in larger, faster ships with more powerful engines. Ships like the Hyundai Glory can move at 25 knots, instead of the 16 knots for a 1960's-vintage ship. As New York's popularity has grown, more ship lines have added direct service to the port, which might have been a ship's third or fourth American port of call.
 On a nonstop route, Michaels can move sewing kits or paintbrushes from China to New York in as little as 22 days, instead of the roughly 35 days the trip took five or so years ago. That is still about three days longer than the overland route, but it costs about $300 to $600 less per container, a significant savings for cost-conscious retailers.
 ''Three or four years ago, nobody wanted to listen to talk about All Water,'' said Dave Akers, managing director of the Toy Shippers Association. ''The transit direct to the East Coast just would not put it in the stores in time. Now, it is fast enough in most cases to be competitive. It is a huge change.''
 New York consumers who buy Asian goods are still more likely to pick up a product that landed first in California; about 65 percent of the merchandise sent last year from Northeast Asia to the Atlantic Coast arrived first on the West Coast. But that was down from 86 percent in 1999, according to an analysis by the Panama Canal Authority. 
 And so far, the mounting Asian trade has been largely a one-way affair. After unloading 1,120 containers from the Glory, the longshoremen reloaded the ship for the return trip. Of 667 containers to be sent back, 419 were empty, being returned to Asia to carry more goods back to the United States. Of the rest, most were stuffed with two of New York's biggest exports: wastepaper and scrap metal. This is just one manifestation of the enormous trade imbalance between China and the United States. Howland Hook itself, where the Glory landed, used to be home to a sprawling Ivory Soap manufacturing plant. What remained of the factory has been leveled to create what in effect is a giant import depot.

The Transformation
Agency Races to Meet The Growing Demand
 The piers seemed a world away as 17 executives assembled around a table on the 11th floor of a Midtown office building for the 8:30 a.m. weekly Port Authority staff meeting. Yet in the head seat, wearing a tie dotted with tiny red anchors, was a retired Coast Guard rear admiral, Richard M. Larrabee, whose leadership will determine, perhaps more than anything else, whether the port is in the midst of a historic and sustainable resurgence or a fumbled opportunity.
 Port officials have talked for years about investing more in the ship terminals. But the talk was based on predictions, as recently as 1999, that the number of containers passing through might start to grow by 3.5 to 4 percent a year. Now, after five years during which the average annual growth in container cargo has been 8.6 percent, those vague plans have become an urgent sprint to finish all expansion projects before the spike in traffic overwhelms the port. 
 Mr. Larrabee knows that several Atlantic ports, from Savannah to Halifax, Nova Scotia, are poised to grab any business that New York cannot manage.
 ''It is absolutely critical,'' said Mr. Larrabee, director of the authority's Port Commerce Department, interrupting a colleague who was describing the dredging of the channel that serves Howland Hook. If the ship terminal operator ''does not get deep water by the end of the year, he is going to have some of his customers looking elsewhere,'' he said.
 On one wall, a mammoth map, labeled The Game, marked New York as the center of a bull's-eye with rings radiating out as far as Illinois and Canada, identifying the richest consumer market in the world, where 80 million people live within a 24-hour truck trip. Next to that, a timetable with more than 1,000 tiny boxes detailed tasks and deadlines to be met.
 The Port Authority has not been the most nimble agency. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani complained that it mismanaged the city's airports. Squabbling between New York and New Jersey over how to split the port's resources has stalled construction projects, and even held up the current expansion for more than a year. Security measures after the Sept. 11 terror attack added another level of planning and expense.
 But the work has begun. At Port Elizabeth, home to the authority's two busiest terminals, demand for space was so low in the 1970's and 80's that the authority leased valuable property for low-rent storage. Nearly 50 acres of those warehouses have been knocked down to make room for arriving ship containers, which are now stacked across the lots like loaves of bread at some out-of-control bakery. 
 At Maher Terminal, new gates -- a toll-booth-like complex where cameras automatically record identification numbers on trucks and containers -- will allow 10,000 trucks to move in or out each day, nearly double the current capacity. Nearby, dozens of construction workers spent 11-hour days last summer building an 18-track express railyard to replace the existing 4 tracks, permitting as many as 750,000 containers a year to move through by rail by 2008, compared with 230,000 last year.
 Across a narrow inlet, at the Port Newark Container Terminal, the wharf has been rebuilt to handle heavier cranes and cargo. At Howland Hook, the summer brought something that would have seemed inconceivable just a decade ago: new wharves. Enough new dock space is being built to allow three large container ships to unload at the same time, and there are plans for another berthing area to handle four. 
 Near the spot where the Hyundai Glory was unloaded, Peter Clerkin, a mechanical engineer from Ireland, is supervising a team installing four huge new cranes, costing $6.6 million apiece. Nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty, the cranes can load and unload the new generation of ships that cannot fit through the Panama Canal. Harborwide, 19 of these cranes have been constructed or ordered in the last two years.
 ''We are changing the skyline of this area, for miles around,'' Mr. Clerkin said. ''These are the port's new landmarks.''
 The most complicated project is re-establishing a freight-rail link between Staten Island and the rest of the country, at a cost of about $150 million. New York City bought and repaired the Arthur Kill Lift Bridge and a 15-mile spur of track a decade ago, but until now, the revival of this rail service, which should start at the end of 2005, has been no more than a dream.
 But the port can expand only by moving many more containers over the same terminal space. Although the Port Authority is considering opening a new container port in Bayonne, N.J., there is little other waterfront land available with easy access to railroads and highways. 
 The quest for greater productivity makes the modernization complex and risky. The authority has set extremely high goals, predicting, for example, that by 2020 each acre will handle an average of 3,000 containers a year, twice as many as today. Trucks carry about 85 percent of all freight in and out of the port, so to keep from overloading the highways, the authority hopes to nearly double the use of rail by 2020.
 For Mr. Larrabee, the most delicate part of his Port Authority job is coordinating the teams of contractors, agencies and corporations, stretching from New Jersey to Korea, so they finish at the same time. Dredge a deeper harbor without rail access, build a longer wharf without new cranes, construct a new rail terminal without a bridge -- miss any piece -- and the plan could falter.
 ''There's a lot of variables,'' he said. ''But at some point, you have to say to yourself, 'I'm willing to take the risk.'''

The Panama Canal
A Crucial Waterway Is Pushed to Its Limit
 The sun had not yet risen above the lush hills that slope gently to the Pacific Ocean at the entrance to the Panama Canal. But the Hanjin Los Angeles, another in the stream of container ships traveling nonstop from Asia to New York, was already waiting at the entrance, the 11th in line one morning for the 50-mile journey between the seas.
 New York was four sailing days away. Yet what was happening here, as the Panamanian pilot, Luis Prescod, climbed a ladder to board the Los Angeles, had clear implications for the future of New York's port. 
 With the rise of China and Northeast Asia as leading manufacturing centers, the canal has suddenly become as important as the George Washington Bridge for freight headed to New York. But while the Port Authority owns the bridge, Mr. Larrabee and his team have no say over affairs in Panama, manager of the canal since 1999.
 For the moment, the canal link is working for New York, though just barely. 
 The Hanjin Los Angeles, like the Hyundai Glory, is a Panamax-class vessel, which is just what it sounds like: a ship built to use the Panama Canal to its maximum. At 951 feet long and 105 feet wide, the Los Angeles, once the pilot steered it into the canal's Miraflores lock, had just two feet to spare on each side and 25 feet at each end.
 The Hanjin's bow bounced briefly against a bumper on the wall of the lock, prompting a ''stop engines'' order from Mr. Prescod. But because he has been performing this kind of miracle for 15 years, the trip through the canal otherwise proceeded uneventfully.
 One day last year, 24 of these Panamax ships inched through, carrying nearly one million tons of cargo. The Panama Canal Authority heralded those record numbers as a sign of the canal's growing popularity. But they were also a warning that this water superhighway is closing in on its limits.
 Hanjin, the South Korean shipping company that owns the Hanjin Los Angeles, has 22 post-Panamax ships, and more on order. These ships are also just what they sound like: too big to squeeze through the locks. Over the next four years, the 227 post-Panamax container ships due to be built and delivered represent more than half of the total number of container ships on order, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants of London. One Port Authority consultant, Sir William Halcrow & Partners, estimated two years ago that by 2020, two-thirds of the nation's container imports would be aboard ships too big to navigate the canal.
 Their size is not the only concern. In the fiscal year that just ended, 267 million tons of goods passed through the canal, up 10 percent in one year, and closing in on the canal's capacity of 284 million tons. Traffic is so heavy that if a ship misses its crossing time, it must sometimes wait a day or longer before it can slip into the queue, delaying its arrival on the East Coast.
 ''The growth in traffic has exceeded all expectations,'' said Rodolfo R. Sabonge, the director of corporate planning and marketing for the Panama Canal Authority.
 There is a plan to build a new canal lane, Panama's third, and a larger set of locks, a project that would cost billions and take at least a decade. The canal authority will most likely ask Panama this year to schedule a national referendum on the plan. 
 Even if the canal is not widened, Port Authority officials say, there will be enough trade to justify an expanded New York port. It is also possible to reach New York from China through the Suez Canal, which can accommodate even the biggest ships, although the trip takes three or four days longer.
 For now, what is beyond debate is that the ships that cross the world have changed their course. That was evident on the bridge of the Hyundai Glory as it slowly pulled into New York, its crew in their bright orange uniforms standing alongside harbor pilots who sipped green tea. New York, once again in a big way, is at the top of the schedule.
 ''Stop engines,'' Mike Schnepp, the pilot, called as the Glory drifted the final few feet into Howland Hook. K.J. Yoo, his hand on the thruster, called back, ''Stop engines, sir.''

HEADLINE: Sports Rage Has Yet to Reach the Ovals

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla. 

 BODY:
THE economics of fan hostility has yet to catch Nascar drivers, who still talk in Tobacco Road speak with their red-state base as a nifty camouflage for their Wall Street wealth as living, breathing commodities.
 A racial undertone has yet to develop into an unspoken tension between the stars of Nascar and their racing audience because many of the drivers and their fans share a conservative ideology, evangelical roots and white privilege.
 Nascar does not suffer from the kind of fan derision that is tainting the N.B.A., college sports, pro football or Major League Baseball -- not yet, anyhow. 
 For now, the bond between driver and fan still manifests the kind of devotion that leaves Nascar followers in public mourning when tragedy hits a team, as it did when the Hendrick family was devastated by a plane crash last month. Loyalty also prompts members of Lug Nut Nation to change Internet carriers, ink pens and erectile remedies depending on the paint job of their favorite driver's racecar. 
 Imagine how euphoric these devotees were yesterday. In a cleverly conceived, first-ever race to the Nascar championship -- giving at least five drivers a shot at the Nextel Cup -- Kurt Busch managed to hold off Jimmie Johnson, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the title as the final race of the season unfolded inside the Art Deco motif of Homestead-Miami Speedway.
 Miami, as in the diverse un-South. Art Deco, as in pastel colors of teal and sand.
 Apparently, twang is where you make it. At least this is what Nascar is betting on as it has begun dipping into urban markets, from places like Las Vegas to Phoenix, with Staten Island all but lined up with bagels and lox as a potential stop along the lucrative circuit operated by the legendary France family.
 The France dynasty has always been innovative, driven to broaden the appeal of a sport that has defied a stagnant landscape. But now they're risking their Carolina roots by exiting charming outposts like Rockingham, N.C. In expanding north and west, capitalizing on big-dollar sites, Nascar has left some of its core crowd dealing with abandonment issues.
 ''I still love the racing, but we have celebrities in the cars now, for sure,'' said Scotty Patterson, a fan from Macon, Ga. ''It's all big, big, big.''
 What happens when a sport's identity becomes lost in its excess? What happens when burdened fans feel entitled to mock and taunt players after paying higher ticket prices to witness millionaire moneyball? Or when access to their faves is just a sepia-toned memory? Or when they can no longer relate to the athletes in front of them? 
 Anger issues happen. It raged to the surface during the disturbing N.B.A. melee that left brazen fans swinging at players, unglued players clocking fans and the habitual hothead Ron Artest rightly suspended for the season by a disgusted N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern.
 This is not about the punches at the Palace on Friday night -- on many nights fan-player rifts unfold without a fist thrown -- but about the fan resentment that is ribboning through sports. 
 Two weeks ago, hecklers prompted Nebraska Coach Bill Callahan to come dangerously uncorked as he directed a profane outburst at Sooners fans, who were raining oranges on his Huskers. A week ago, outraged football fans phoned ABC to protest the racy skit between Terrell Owens and a desperate housewife, even though N.F.L. games are laden with commercials extolling the virtues of football, beer and busty twins.
 Fan interaction has flooded baseball, too. Over the last four years, Dodgers players were punished for brawling in the bleachers, a Royals first-base coach was attacked by two White Sox fans, Rangers outfielder Carl Everett was clunked in the head by a cellphone, and, in September, Texas reliever Frank Francisco bloodied the nose of a woman when he whipped a chair into the stands. 
 ''I can't see Nascar fans turning on the drivers like that,'' said David Goss, of Jacksonville, Fla.
 But is this unconditional love truly without presets? Nascar's niche popularity was founded on the accessibility of Richard Petty, and then the cantankerously lovable Dale Earnhardt.
 Earnhardt was known to sit in his $1 million trailer, eating Bumble Bee tuna from the can with a plastic fork, never forgetting his country-grown identity despite his unfathomable wealth. Fans understood him. 
 This is the trick for Nascar -- maintaining its appeal as it grows outside the vacuum of its core. Even now, fans are finding routes to coveted drivers cut off, particularly if the star is Dale Earnhardt Jr.
 ''You got to put Junior in a separate category when it comes to popularity,'' Gordon said. Junior is the mainstream face of Nascar, the heartthrob of teens, and the son of a grand ghost who drove the black No. 3 car to his death. 
 ''You definitely can't hide from the popularity of the sport,'' Junior said.
 And yet, Little E does hide from the dust devil of fame to preserve his sanity for races. Longtime Nascar fans get it, but will a Garbo act play in Portland, Ore., -- another potential race site? 
 It will be intriguing to see how the France monarchy approaches new followers who may not be charmed by Southern accents, who may be more blue than red in their politics, who won't identify with Nascar's roots. As other sports have learned, a fan's love doesn't always grow with the sport.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Constituencies Split on Tax Change

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Stephen Moore, the president of a conservative fund-raising group, wants to overhaul the tax code. So do Dr. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention and Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group.
 They just don't agree on how to do it.
 Even though it will be months before President Bush proposes an overhaul of the income tax, key Republican groups are already divided about how or even whether to proceed. Regardless of which path Mr. Bush pursues, he is likely to be pulled by conflicts between parts of his political base. 
 Economic conservatives share an ideological belief in flattening income tax rates and eliminating as many tax preferences as possible. And business groups want to preserve breaks for research, oil drilling, health insurance, equipment leasing and scores of other purposes. 
 Christian conservatives want to promote charitable deductions and ''family values,'' and may want to defend tax breaks for married couples with children. 
 ''People are not going to give the kind of support necessary for tax reform that leaves the investor class untaxed,'' said Dr. Land, who is president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Commission. ''That is not going to be politically viable.'' 
 These differing constituencies pose a significant challenge for Mr. Bush, so much so that many Republican lawmakers are openly doubtful about whether to attempt a tax overhaul. Some Senate Republicans wonder about public enthusiasm for tax reform, despite widespread discontent with the complexity and apparent unfairness of the current tax code.
 ''You can't very well claim there was a mandate in this election for tax reform,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona. ''It was just one of many ideas, and it wasn't specific. There is no consensus in the country about what to do.''
 Mr. Bush has offered few specifics, saying he will create a bipartisan advisory panel before the end of the year that will make recommendations within a fairly short time.
 While Republicans agree about the general goal of flatter income tax rates and some form of a consumption tax, they disagree sharply about the best way to accomplish this.
 In the House, dozens of Republican lawmakers favor junking the income tax altogether and replacing it with a national sales tax or a flat tax.
 Many of Mr. Bush's advisers, by contrast, prefer a piecemeal approach that would reduce if not eliminate most taxes on savings and investment, leaving a system that only taxes consumption. 
 ''You can accomplish the same thing in different ways,'' said Mr. Moore, the president of the conservative fund-raising group, called Club for Growth. ''What we would settle for is tax reform in three or four or five easy pieces, and I think that is where Bush is headed.''
 In a speech last week, Deputy Treasury Secretary Samuel W. Bodman focused almost entirely on issues like dividend taxes and savings accounts, suggesting that the administration wanted to expand on its earlier tax cuts. 
 The measures include an elimination of taxes on stock dividends, expanded tax-free health savings accounts and big new ''lifetime savings accounts'' to shield almost all savings from taxes.
 Another idea in circulation, which has been promoted for years by advocates of a consumption tax, is to let companies immediately write off the cost of new buildings and equipment -- another way of eliminating taxes on investment.
 To offset those tax cuts, many proponents of tax overhaul outside the administration have suggested eliminating major deductions, like those for state and local taxes and corporate interest payments. 
 But the political hazards are enormous. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local income taxes would infuriate people in high-tax states along the East and West Coasts. And while many of those states voted Democratic in elections three weeks ago, Mr. Bush would find himself in bruising battles with Republican governors like George E. Pataki of New York and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.
 Mr. Bush has narrowed his room for change further by promising to protect home ownership and charitable giving. That effectively locked in the biggest tax deduction in use today, for mortgage interest payments, as well as the deduction for charitable contributions. 
 ''To me, that said he intends to keep an income tax in place,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and a longtime supporter of tax changes. 
 The political hazards of more radical tax overhaul were underlined in the battle in South Carolina to succeed Senator Ernest F. Hollings. The odds-on favorite had been Representative Jim DeMint, a Republican who is also the sponsor of a bill to replace the income tax with a national sales tax. Democrats set up a big advertising campaign, accusing Mr. DeMint of proposing a 23 percent sales tax that would steeply raise the price of everything from groceries to gasoline. Mr. DeMint won, but only after his challenger pulled close enough in the polls to make the race competitive.
 ''We will avoid what happened to DeMint in South Carolina,'' said Mr. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that has pushed for tax cuts since the Reagan era.
 Mr. Norquist supports the idea of a stealth tax overhaul, achieving the similar goal as a national sales tax but accomplishing it through backdoor changes like a big expansion of tax-free savings accounts.
 Indeed, Mr. Bush has twice proposed the lifetime savings accounts, allowing people to set aside up to $15,000 a year and pay no taxes on the income the accounts earn. Besides being bigger than today's individual retirement accounts, the new accounts could be tapped anytime before retirement for any purpose. 
 Still, some House Republicans continue to push for a national sales tax. Representative John Linder of Georgia has 54 co-sponsors for a bill that would scrap all individual and corporate income taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax. 
 Because a sales tax would shift a big share of the tax burden to lower- and middle-income people, some of whom now pay little or no federal income tax, Mr. Linder's proposal calls for monthly rebates that could total thousands of dollars a year.
 ''If we eliminated taxes on business and labor, we would become the biggest tax haven in the world,'' said Mr. Linder, adding that his system would free up hundreds of billions of dollars now spent on tax compliance and tax avoidance.
 The House speaker, Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, supports a similar approach and has dangled the lure of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. 
 But Republicans who have been through past battles over tax laws scoff at such ideas.
 ''To what extent do you want to accomplish something that cannot be accomplished?'' asked Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a speech last week to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed research group. ''You have to be realistic about what you can do and what you can't do.''
 R. Glenn Hubbard, who was chairman of the Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers in 2001 and 2002, said the administration still has to make up its mind.
 ''They need to decide what they really want to do,'' Mr. Hubbard said. 
 Many Republican lawmakers, especially those who on tax-writing committees, are skeptical about opening a Pandora's box. ''I don't sense a great deal of excitement in the halls of the Senate,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho. And Representative Thomas warned against pushing for more than ''the system'' in Congress can deliver.

PERSON: Walter Mintz

HEADLINE: Walter Mintz, 75, Investor And Hedge Fund Co-Founder

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Walter Mintz, an investor who was co-founder of one of the country's first hedge funds and later promoted free-market approaches to education and city governance, died Nov. 16 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75. 
 The cause was neuroendocrine cancer, said his wife, Sandra. 
 When Mr. Mintz and a colleague, Donald Cecil, started Cumberland Associates in 1970, only a handful of firms invested in such a wide variety of ways, assumed such potentially high risks or pledged such lofty returns. Now, there are roughly 7,000 hedge funds, and Cumberland Associates has reported returns of more than 18 percent a year on average.
 Mr. Mintz's investing success allowed him to retire at 53 and devote his time to applying the economic theories he had studied and espoused while a doctoral candidate at Columbia. As an early supporter and vice chairman of the Manhattan Institute, a free-market research organization in New York, he designed and funded studies promoting the idea of charter schools in the early 1990's. ''You couldn't even talk about school choice without people getting upset,'' said Lawrence Mone, president of the Manhattan Institute. ''Walter helped the Institute start that conversation in New York. He talked about using the forces of competition in the marketplace to encourage better education and more accountability.''
 Mr. Mintz was born Feb. 23, 1929 in Vienna and immigrated with his family to the Bronx when he was 9. 
 He graduated from Reed College in 1950 and became a trustee in 1971, a post he held for 33 years. He became the board's vice chairman in 1991, was chairman from 1998 to 2002, and oversaw the investment committee for two decades of record returns. He funded two scholarships that bear his name, and he recently endowed a professorship in economic history.
 After college, Mr. Mintz was a reporter at Barron's magazine. He left to become a stock analyst at Shearson, Hammill and Co., then one of the largest brokerage firms, and advanced to director of research and then executive vice president. In a company advertisement in 1965, he was featured with hands folded and a knowing sideways glance. ''Professional skeptic,'' said the caption.
 In addition to his wife of 33 years, the former Sandra Earl, Mr. Mintz is survived by a sister, Marjorie G. Perloff, of Pacific Palisades, Calif.

HEADLINE: Banks Are Staying Clear of a Proposed Soccer Club Takeover

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Manchester United has 42 players from which to select a starting 11, but the American businessman who wants to acquire the soccer club appears to be having trouble fielding his own team.
 The suitor, Malcolm Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League, still has to hire an advisory banker. Last week he was deserted by the previous banker he had hired, J.P. Morgan Chase, and his public relations firm, Brunswick, after he voted three of Manchester United's directors off the board. 
 Manchester United has been the dominant force in the English Premiere League over the last decade, although its glow has dimmed in recent seasons and the team is currently in seventh place. But the prospect of a foreign takeover has been so unpopular with fans and management that there seems to be scarcely a banker around willing to help Mr. Glazer. In interviews this week, executives from 8 of the 10 biggest banks in London said either that they were not eager to take the job or that they had ruled it out altogether. They spoke on the condition they not be identified by name.
 ''We're not going near it,'' said an executive from one of the top five investment banks in London.
 It is unusual for investment bankers to turn down possible deals. Indeed, competition for advisory positions on mergers and acquisitions has grown even more fierce in recent years. But in the case of Manchester United, the prospect of a foreign takeover has led to stadium protests and more intimidating tactics. Thousands of e-mail messages, harassing phone calls and even boxes of pizza were delivered to Mr. Glazer's former advisers. The bankers expressing reluctance to work on the deal say that the angry fans contribute to their trepidation. 
 ''Do you really want to be the bank that gets paint-bombed for the next 10 years by enraged fans?'' asked one banker. 
 People close to the negotiations said that Mr. Glazer's move indicated he was planning a hostile deal, something that J.P. Morgan had advised against and was not willing to back. (On Thursday, Manchester United appointed Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, as a new nonexecutive director.)
 With a 29 percent stake, Mr. Glazer is the largest shareholder in Manchester United, which has a market a value of $1.3 billion on the London Stock Exchange. If Mr. Glazer does not abandon his effort and makes a bid, he will need the support of 75 percent of the shareholders to win control. 
 Trying to do a deal without a banker is not an option for Mr. Glazer. His personal wealth is estimated at about $1 billion, including a 51.3 percent stake in Zapata, a holding company with a $145.4 million market cap, and the Buccaneers, estimated at about $700 million. But the American football team cannot be pledged as collateral on any deal. 
 Several messages left for Mr. Glazer at Zapata, which is run by his son Avram, were not returned. Messages left with Jeff Kamis, the spokesman for the Tampa Bay Buccaneer, were also not returned.

HEADLINE: Comic Books Of the West Head East

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
He has faced Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin, but can Spider-Man survive an encounter with Deepak Chopra?
 Mr. Chopra, the author of best-selling self-help books, is part of an effort to bring Western comic-book titles like ''Batman'' and ''Superman'' to India's booming youth market and, at the same time, sell original stories to India and the world.
 The newly formed Gotham Studios Asia is a joint venture between the media company Intent, run by Mr. Chopra with Shekhar Kapur, the director of movies like ''Bandit Queen'' and ''Elizabeth,'' and Gotham Entertainment Group, South Asia's biggest licensee for international comic magazines such as Marvel Enterprises, the publisher of ''Spider-Man'' and ''X-Men'' as well as DC Comics and Warner Brothers Worldwide Publishing. 
 Gotham Studios will offer an adaptation of ''Spider-Man'' in which the hero is a young Indian named Pavitr Prabhakar, who is shown bouncing off rickshaws in a dhoti, a loose Indian garment. There will also be a comic-book version of ''Ramayana,'' an Indian tale about faith, loyalty and war, to be retold in a sweeping style reminiscent of the ''Lord of the Rings.'' The titles are to be released in the middle of next year. 
 Gotham Studios is one of many companies trying to take advantage of an expected boom in the sale of books and music in India, fueled by rising literacy rates and buying power and changing spending habits. India's population of more than one billion is the youngest in the world. Projections are that, by 2015, India will have 550 million people under the age of 20. 
 ''Imagine a country with a population of kids twice the size of the entire population of the United States,'' said Mr. Kapur.
 Arvind K. Singhal, chairman of the retail consultant KSA Technopak of New Delhi, said that the Indian youth market was ripe for all kinds of entertainment. 
 ''These kids are liberalization's children,'' said Mr. Singhal, referring to an economic boom in India that resulted from reforms put in place in 1991. ''They are exposed to global trends through TV and the Internet and are not spending-averse as the previous generation.'' Until now, despite a thriving culture of myths that lends itself to the art of the comic book, Indian comic books have had poor visual content and production values. The market for Indian comics has been meager, too, and licensing extensions into toys or movies nonexistent. 
 Gotham Studios is banking on the creative cachet of its founders. Mr. Kapur, who was nominated for an Oscar for ''Elizabeth,'' will be the chief creative officer of Gotham Studios. The comic-book genre affords Mr. Kapur a creative outlet that is less expensive than Hollywood, where the economic risk can be huge. Mr. Chopra will infuse spirituality and mysticism into the characters. For instance, in the Indian version, Spider-Man gains his powers from a mysterious yogi, not from a radioactive spider. Spider-Man's enemy, the Green Goblin, is the reincarnation of an ancient Indian demon called a rakshasa.
 ''The superheroes of tomorrow will be cross-cultural and will transcend nationalistic boundaries,'' said Mr. Chopra, the chairman of the new company. His son, Gotham Chopra, who is the story editor of the comic book ''Bulletproof Monk'' and was executive producer of the movie version, will write many of the comics for Gotham Studios.
 The principals acknowledge there are challenges. The biggest will be in redefining popular art so that the style of stories and artwork remain authentic to Indians, yet accessible to a global market. ''The big question: 'Are people ready to get this?''' said Gotham Chopra.
 An even bigger challenge will be in finding and training Indian talent. ''We know they are out there but grooming them will require a bulk of the investment,'' Gotham Chopra said. Gotham Studios has 30 employees and plans to expand to 150 by the end of 2005. Among five original comic books in production is Devi, a series woven around an overworked detective in a crime-ridden city who has a novel romantic problem: he is torn between his devoted and dutiful wife and her alter ego, a superpowered, crime-fighting seductress. 
 The growing success of Japanese-influenced comic books called manga has reinforced Gotham Studios' belief that Asian-infused content is becoming popular and relevant to mainstream Western audiences. ''We see a template there for us,'' said Sharad Devarajan, the chief executive of Gotham Studios.
 Across the world, the sale of manga is driving the comic book industry. For instance, the series ''Dragonball Z'' has sold more than 100 million copies. Tokyopop, a relatively new comic book company, is specializing in licensing, translating and publishing Japanese comics for American retail outlets like Target and Wal-Mart. Tokyopop has doubled sales every year for the last six years. 
 Still, Gotham Studios is playing it safe by offering something else to the comic-book industry: outsourcing. The company plans to use its Indian talent pool to provide illustrators to United States businesses seeking to reduce their costs. The studio already has its first client, and is in discussions with others. 
 ''A legion of Indians became software programmers, but we hope the new generation of Indians returns to what India was renowned for -- its creativity,'' said Mr. Devarajan.

HEADLINE: MAJOR CREDITORS AGREE TO CANCEL 80% OF IRAQ DEBT

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
The world's leading industrial nations agreed Sunday to cancel 80 percent of the nearly $39 billion debt owed them by Iraq, a critical step in rebuilding the country's devastated economy and an important precedent for its other creditors to follow.
 The agreement, after a year of intense lobbying by the United States, puts pressure on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq's other Middle Eastern neighbors to forgive obligations owed them, including billions in reparations Iraq owes from the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
 The Bush administration welcomed the agreement as evidence that relations between the United States and its European allies, frayed over disagreements on Iraq, remain fundamentally strong.
 ''This is a real milestone and shows that the trans-Atlantic alliance remains a strong force for good in the world,'' John W. Snow, the United States treasury secretary, told reporters in Berlin after the announcement here by the so-called Paris Club of 19 wealthy creditor nations.
 President Bush issued a statement congratulating Iraq's interim government for the agreement, saying it represented a major international contribution to Iraq's political and economic reconstruction. ''I encourage non-Paris Club creditor nations to agree to comparable debt reduction for Iraq,'' he said. 
 The agreement was reached only a few months before the first elections since the downfall of Saddam Hussein are scheduled to be held in Iraq, which continues to be roiled by recurrent waves of insurgent violence. In Baghdad on Sunday, Iraqi electoral officials announced that the voting would take place on Jan. 30, but United Nations officials supervising the preparation said many voter registration centers had been shut down because of violence and threats. [Page A13.] 
 Clearing the liabilities from Iraq's books is considered almost as important to its future as defeating the insurgency, because the country cannot hope to attract investors while carrying the current amount of debt. 
 The Group of 7 nations that are the core of the Paris Club -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- had vowed earlier this year to complete a debt relief package before the end of the year and before Iraq's planned elections. 
 The reduced debt load could add momentum to the elected government's economic program, although some experts argue it is insufficient.
 ''This is a step in the right direction but it's still not anywhere near as far as it should go,'' said Frederick Barton, co-director of the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 He said Iraq's shattered economy would not be viable without the forgiveness of greater debt. War reparations alone, he said, ''have Iraq on the ropes.'' 
 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries have also agreed to negotiate debt reduction, but Kuwait continues to insist that Iraq pay reparations, arguing that they are required by the United Nations Security Council. About $30 billion in U.N.-approved, war-related claims against Iraq are still outstanding and a further $10 billion in claims could be approved soon. 
 Iraq's foreign debt totals $120.2 billion, a legacy of Mr. Hussein's ruinous wars and his last decade in power, when United Nations sanctions severely restricted the country's oil revenue. Nearly $39 billion of that debt -- $42 billion including penalties and late interest -- is owed to members of the Paris Club, a group formed in 1956 to help ease the financial obligations of heavily indebted countries. 
 Iraq stopped making payments on its debt after its invasion of Kuwait.
 The United States had lobbied hard for the Paris Club countries to forgive as much as 95 percent of those obligations so that Iraq can get on with building a future instead of bailing out its past. Last year, Mr. Bush appointed former Secretary of State James A. Baker III as a special envoy to press Iraq's creditors to write off money owed them. 
 The former secretary, who helped negotiate the restructuring of Latin America's mountain of debt in the 1980's, toured the world cajoling countries to sign on to the debt forgiveness plan.
 While the 80 percent writeoff falls short of the American goal, it is the best deal the Paris Club has ever given a developing country: the previous record was a 66 percent debt reduction for the former Yugoslavia after the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic. 
 The treatment being given Iraq has in the past been reserved for so-called heavily indebted poor countries, mostly aid-dependent nations in Africa.
 But without substantial writeoffs from the Arab world, which holds the bulk of Iraq's remaining debt, even the generous agreement on Sunday would leave Iraq with a hobbling burden. 
 According to one widely used benchmark, countries run into trouble when their external debt level exceeds one-and-a-half times their annual exports. Iraq's exports, primarily oil, are expected to reach about $20 billion this year. ''In the 1970's and 1980's, Iraq was a donor country,'' Iraq's finance minister, Adel Mahdi, said at a news conference here. ''Now Iraq needs the help of others.''
 Without more debt relief, foreign governments and private companies are likely to remain reluctant to invest the amount of money needed to get the Iraqi oil industry back on its feet because much of any oil revenue will have to go toward interest payments.
 France, Germany and Russia had resisted American efforts to forgive so much debt, arguing that Iraq, with the second-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, had the capacity to repay if given enough time. They had argued that such a drastic reduction in Iraq's debts would be unfair to other nations that are saddled with onerous debts but that lack the potential oil wealth to pay.
 But a breakthrough was made Saturday in Berlin after talks between Secretary Snow and Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, who agreed to write off 80 percent of the debt due his country. France followed Germany's lead. 
 Russia, which is owed about $8 billion and is a new Paris Club member, was the last to concede to the compromise debt reduction package, according to Paris Club officials here.
 France and Germany, owed about $3 billion and $2.5 billion respectively, have been eager to find some way to take part in Iraq's reconstruction without committing troops. But the two are struggling to contain budget deficits that already breach European Union rules, so coming up with substantial cash contributions to Iraq is difficult. Writing off debt that may not be repaid in any case is one of the few politically palatable alternatives they have for showing support to the American-led effort.
 Under the plan announced Sunday, Paris Club members would immediately forgive 30 percent of their Iraqi debt and write off an additional 30 percent in 2005 once the International Monetary Fund has approved an economic reform program for Iraq. A final 20 percent would be canceled in 2008 provided Iraq has carried out the I.M.F. program. The remaining debt owed to Paris Club members is to be repaid over a 23-year period, with no principal or interest due for the next three years.
 A conference on Iraq will be held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik this week, bringing together the United States and other leading industrialized nations with the interim Iraqi government and its regional neighbors.

HEADLINE: Japanese Official Warns of Fissures in North Korea

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
After weeks of reports from North Korea of defecting generals, antigovernment posters and the disappearance of portraits of the country's ruler, the leader of Japan's governing party warned Sunday of the prospects of ''regime change'' in North Korea.
 ''As long as Chairman Kim Jong Il controls the government, we have to negotiate with him, but it is becoming more doubtful whether we will be able to achieve anything with this government,'' said Shinzo Abe, acting secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, on Fuji TV, referring to talks on North Korea's abductions of Japanese in the 1970's. ''I think we should consider the possibility that a regime change will occur, and we need to start simulations of what we should do at that time.'' 
 By breaking an unspoken taboo on talking publicly about ''regime change'' in North Korea, the powerful Japanese politician underlined a feeling spreading in the region that cracks are starting to show in the Kim family's control over North Korea after nearly 60 years.
 Hard intelligence is difficult to come by in North Korea, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies, where people are barred from sending letters abroad, making international telephone calls, emigrating or talking to foreigners without supervision. To dissuade defections, the government routinely imprisons relatives left behind. 
 But in recent months, there have been signs of fissures in these walls. There are indications that news is leaking out of North Korea by cellphone and that criticisms of the government are being posted in public places. Those developments and the angry response to recent legislation in the United States intended to flood the country with radios that can pick up foreign broadcasts suggest that the leadership realizes its one great achievement -- near total information control -- is threatened. 
 With the reports of Mr. Kim's portraits being removed from some public buildings and news of military defections, outside analysts are speculating that the personality cult around ''Dear Leader'' is being curbed, either to advance painful economic reforms or to head off a military coup fomented by China. 
 Persistent reports that anti-Kim leaflets and posters have recently appeared gained more credibility with the publication last Thursday in Sankei Shimbun, a conservative Tokyo newspaper, of what was described as a photograph of a hand-printed flyer smuggled out of North Korea.
 ''Juche philosophy made people slaves,'' it read, referring to the nationalist ideology of self-reliance created by Mr. Kim's father, Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994. ''Juche philosophy created an absolutist hereditary kingdom, rather than one where the people are the main players.'' 
 ''The Kims, father and son, made our people miserably poor and this country a world dropout that is far away from the situation of meat soup, a tile-roofed house and silk clothes that Kim Il Sung promised by 1957,'' it continued.
 Douglas Shin, a Korean-American pastor who helps North Korean refugees flee through China, said his contacts told him that posters opposed to Kim Jong Il had appeared in three northern cities this fall. On Sunday, the Kyodo news agency of Japan reported that North Korea was cracking down on people in border cities who helped pass letters to foreigners or used cellphones to communicate with the outside world.
 ''Some residents have contacts with people in neighboring countries by hiding mobile phones in places with good reception, like tall buildings and hilltops,'' warns a North Korean document photographed by a Japanese aid group, Rescue the North Korean People Urgent Action Network. The group said the directive was published by the governing Workers Party of North Korea in November 2003. 
 Last spring, after a huge explosion narrowly missed Mr. Kim's armored train, the North Korean authorities banned most cellphones. 
 ''Mobile phones have become a weapon in antigovernment movements,'' Lee Young Hwa, an assistant professor at Kansai University and a leader of the Japanese aid group, told Kyodo. 
 Analysts also say they have seen more high-level defections of late, possibly a result of more permeable borders and greater dissatisfaction. 
 In Seoul, an editor at Monthly Chosun, a magazine that closely follows North Korean affairs, said in an interview that when he was in northern China earlier this year, Chinese officials showed him North Korean wanted posters for generals who had managed to reach China with their families. The editor, who asked not to be identified, estimated that in recent years, 130 North Korean generals had defected to China, about 10 percent of the military elite.
 Of this group, the most significant, he said, are four who have been integrated into active duty with the Chinese military in the Shenyang district, along the Korean border.
 Last May, Lt. Gen. O Se Ok, a rising member of the military elite, left the North Korean port of Chongjin by boat, met a Japanese boat in the Sea of Japan and eventually made his way to the United States, according to NHK television of Japan and Kazuhiro Araki, a professor of Korean politics at Takushoku University in Japan. The general's 73-year-old father, O Kuk Ryol, ranked second on the Central Military Commission at the time, after Kim Jong Il. 
 ''The defection of such a person was a great shock to the North Korean establishment,'' Professor Araki said.
 During World War II, the Soviet Union armed a group of Korean exiles in Khabarovsk, just across the Amur River from what was then Japanese-controlled Manchuria. Among them was Kim Il Sung, who in 1945 was installed as the leader of Soviet-occupied northern Korea.
 Now, the South Korean editor speculated, China may be forming a fallback plan should Kim Jong Il prove incapable of reforming or holding on to power. ''The scenario the Chinese are looking into is to make a buffer regime through such North Korean general defectors,'' he said. 
 And then there is the mystery of the portraits, which disappeared this fall from some hotels, meeting halls and government buildings. In a country where mishandling the ruler's portrait has resulted in prison sentences, the change is believed to have required high-level authorization.
 A North Korean diplomat who defected last year told the South Korean news agency Yonhap last Thursday that the embassy where he was posted received an order in early 2003 to remove the pictures.
 ''It was a direct order from Kim Jong Il, but no one, not even high-ranking officials had the nerve to follow the order, so the portraits continued to hang,'' Yonhap quoted the defector as saying.
 Rudiger Frank, who teaches East Asian political economy at the University of Vienna, wrote last week of his visit to North Korea in September. He said he ''found no picture of any leader in my hotel room, as well as only Kim Il Sung's portrait in a conference room where just a few months before images of both father and son could be seen.''
 ''An estimated 50 percent of all slogans in the capital read 'The Great Leader Kim Il Sung will always be with us,' hinting at a strong emphasis on the deceased founder'' of North Korea ''at the expense of his successor,'' he wrote in an essay posted on the Internet.
 ''Kim Jong Il might be resolving one of the most pressing issues in North Korean domestic politics: his succession,'' he continued. ''We might be witnessing the first step out of many, which will eventually lead to the establishment of some kind of collective leadership in the D.P.R.K., in the name of Kim Il Sung,'' using the initials for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
 Bradley K. Martin, author of a biography of Kim Jong Il, speculated that Mr. Kim might want to adopt a lower profile to avoid blame at home for North Korea's economic failures and to avoid ''coming into the cross hairs of U.S. hawks, who were demonizing him the way they had demonized Saddam Hussein.''
 ''Sooner or later, large numbers of North Koreans would hear that he was an object of derision to outsiders, would hear that the official version of his birth in a log cabin on Mount Paektu was false,'' Mr. Martin, wrote in an essay last week, alluding to the end of North Korea's information monopoly. ''His admiring references to the Thai and Swedish systems in recent years suggested that Kim Jong Il was looking to transform the country into something like a limited monarchy rather than the absolute dictatorship it had become.'' 
 Meanwhile, North Korean officials insist that no change is under way.
 Li Sang Su, an official with the Korea News Service, which distributes reports of the North Korean news agency in Japan, said the portrait change was merely a routine updating of images.
 ''They change the portraits after some years to new ones because the portraits get worn and the person gets older,'' he said. 
 On Friday, China's official New China News Agency carried an interview with a North Korean Foreign Ministry official, Ri Gyong Son, who attributed reports about the disappearing portraits to the United States and its allies who ''want to overthrow'' Mr. Kim.

HEADLINE: The 28th Amendment

BYLINE: By William Safire. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
Like a cloud no bigger than a man's hand, the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution is gathering on the political horizon.
 No, it's not the anti-same-sex amendment that President Bush supports. Only if the Supreme Court strikes down the federal Defense of Marriage Act -- or if it overturns the changes in state constitutions adopted to block recognition of same-sex marriages legal elsewhere -- will that proposed amendment have a remote chance of gaining support of two-thirds of the Congress and 38 states.
 The founders made it hard to amend the Constitution, but since the Bill of Rights, it's been done on the average of once every 12 years. It's time to end discrimination based on place of birth that denies the equal right of every citizen to run for president. 
 Article II of the Constitution directed that in the future only ''natural born'' citizens would be eligible for the nation's highest office. There may have been reason for suspicion of the foreign-born as the nation was in formation, but that nativist bias has no place in a nation proud of its ''golden door.''
 When an immigrant is naturalized, his or her citizenship becomes as natural as ''natural born.'' The oath taken and the pledge of allegiance given make the immigrant 100 percent American, with all the rights, privileges and obligations appertaining thereto. All except one -- the right to the greatest political success. 
 That makes all naturalized citizens -- including taxpayers, voters, servicemembers -- slightly less than all-American. Even children born abroad of U.S. citizens have fallen under the shadow of Article II; this has caused pregnant women to race back to our shores to make certain their children's political potential is not somehow beclouded.
 The unequalizer in our Constitution cries out for fixing. Some of us have been muttering about this for decades, but it's always been academic -- a theoretical exercise in excising a discriminatory phrase whose purpose has long since atrophied.
 Comes now Arnold Schwarzenegger, an immigrant from Austria who by a fluke of recall was able to circumvent the centrist-blocking primaries and get himself elected governor of California. Four of the last ten presidential elections have been won by former officeholders of that largest state in the Union.
 Suddenly the theoretical possibility has taken human shape. If we cannot change Schwarzenegger into ''natural born'' (lay on, Macduff!), we can change the law to give ''naturalized'' its complete meaning. 
 He's a libertarian conservative, a man of the right whose popularity is rising on the Left Coast. Under the tutelage of former Secretary of State George Shultz and former Gov. Pete Wilson, he is using his celebrity, charisma and political moxie to break up the logrolling logjam that put this state into the hands of easily rolled legislators and budget-busting initiative rule.
 Would he make a good national campaigner? No doubt. Would he make a good president? Much too soon to tell. He picks the best advisers and has been acting on their advice, but I get the impression Ah-nold is too full of himself. He would do well with the humility gained by a setback and a comeback.
 He has been traveling to Israel and Japan, ostensibly for California's economy while burnishing his image as a potential world leader. Though modesty does not come easily to him, he professes to demur at the ''Amend for Arnold'' buttons that some supporters have been sporting to push for the 28th Amendment: Equal Rights for Immigrants.
 My guess is that most liberals will be conflicted as this issue develops; antidiscrimination is an article of faith, but they don't want a yodeling Republican cowboy in the White House. Contrariwise, some right-wingers who look askance at a pro-choice candidate who is comfortable with gays are also closet nativists.
 Yet both camps know that Hispanics make up the swingiest ethnic vote, growing each year, and could be influenced mightily by an issue like equal rights for immigrants. 
 One step up at a time. After ratification of the 28th Amendment in 2007, I envision a G.O.P. ticket the next year with Rudy Giuliani or John McCain on top and Schwarzenegger as running-mate. For Democrats, Evan Bayh or Hillary Clinton for president, Peter Jennings (Canadian-born) for v.p.
 Chew that one over.

HEADLINE: Dispute Over Stadium Becomes Political, and Personal

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
One man came from working-class roots and built a media empire that surpassed its rivals, while the other was brought into the family business and has struggled to make it succeed. When angered by aides, one rips into them privately; the other is openly incandescent, covering his subordinates with expletives for all to hear. One is a billionaire who sometimes rides the subway to his job in City Hall; the other prefers a black Mercedes stretch limousine with special license plates issued by the police. 
 Both men get blamed for the troubles of the New York Knicks. 
 The two -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and James Dolan, the head of Cablevision -- are at the center of the most vicious battle of the Bloomberg mayoralty. It pits Mr. Dolan, a very rich man with an enormous attachment to his legendary Madison Square Garden, against an even richer mayor whose passion to leave his mark on the West Side of Manhattan is rivaled only by his distaste for the man trying to stop him. 
 The battle between these two men over whether the city should help finance a new football stadium for the Jets gets nastier daily, and it is quietly becoming a factor in next year's race for mayor and is likely to affect the future of the Garden and its parent company, Cablevision. 
 Indeed, Mr. Dolan, while wrestling with his embattled sports franchises and struggling television business, has managed through sheer perseverance and large sums of money to get deeply under Mr. Bloomberg's skin, and seems prepared to go further. ''I'd help a candidate that could convince the Jets to build a stadium on their own dime,'' Mr. Dolan said in an e-mail message relayed through his spokesman. 
 It did not start out this way.
 When Mayor Bloomberg announced last spring that he intended to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center by building a $1.4 billion football stadium for the Jets, community opposition was almost immediate. 
 But Mr. Dolan quickly became the central critic. Cablevision is behind the television ads that increasingly attack the mayor personally, and recently Mr. Dolan wrote a vitriolic letter against the stadium and placed it in ads in every major city newspaper. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who usually tries to sweet-talk his enemies into acquiescence, has hit back equally forcefully, in recent weeks calling Mr. Dolan selfish and uncooperative and accusing him, among other things, of denying the dreams of New York City children. The larger municipal battle over whether the stadium is a good idea is quickly being eclipsed by the personal battle. 
 ''It is a fascinating soap opera,'' said Steven Cohen, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. ''I think what Dolan is doing is giving everybody who is against the stadium a reason to be for it. He is a figure who does not evoke a lot of sympathy from the average sports fan in New York. But at the same time, it is a very serious issue, and there are some serious questions about whether this kind of development is appropriate for the city.''
 Both sides have plenty of weapons in their arsenal, and many people observing the fight -- current and former government officials and employees of Cablevision, political experts and others -- believe that each is prepared to use them.
 For instance, the Garden is planning a huge renovation, and so it must apply for numerous city permits before so much as a paintbrush can be lifted. And the city also controls Cablevision's substantial cable franchises for parts of New York City, which are up for renewal in 2008 and subject to competitive bidding.
 Further, if the city wanted to -- and government officials insist they are not considering it -- it could challenge the Garden's current tax break worth $11 million a year, which is contingent on its having an operating hockey team. A players' labor dispute has resulted in a league owners' lockout that may keep the Rangers sidelined all season. 
 For his part, Mr. Dolan, who has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic political candidates, appears to be trying to insert the battle against the stadium into the mayor's race. Besides spending millions on television ads opposing the mayor's stadium plans, Cablevision recently hired a seasoned Bronx political operative, Lorraine Cortes-Vasquez, a contributor to past campaigns of Fernando Ferrer, to head its government relations unit, which deals directly with the stadium issue.
 The stadium has its supporters, like Gov. George E. Pataki, trade unions and others, as well as its detractors, including elected officials from the West Side and neighborhood groups, but it is Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Dolan who have become the public diptych of the dispute, two larger-than-life New York characters whose fight embodies some central obsessions of New Yorkers: sports, money, politics and raw ambition. 
 Their contest is the subject of sports talk shows and newspaper columns as each man's fighting style has come into sharp relief.
 Mr. Dolan, who once eviscerated subordinates for giving him an outdated can of Diet Coke, has become a corporate Captain Ahab, raging at Mr. Bloomberg with few people in his company echoing him. Current and former employees, who agreed that Mr. Dolan was spending an increasing amount of time on this fight, said they expected him to continue until he can declare the stadium dead.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who typically opens each battle with the salesmanship he honed in the private sector, took Mr. Dolan's father, Charles, out for cocktails in May, hoping for his intervention, the mayor's aides said. Getting nowhere with that technique, Mr. Bloomberg took the gloves off, using his public appearances, radio show and the like to attack Cablevision with increasingly hostile language.
 ''In a spat like this between Cablevision and the city,'' said Seth Abraham, a former executive at Cablevision, ''there are a lot of tools that they can hurl at each other. Jim is a liberal Democrat, he has backed liberal Democrats consistently, and I guess he can always say, 'I am going to find myself a liberal candidate to run for mayor.''' Mr. Abraham now supports the stadium plan and sits on the board of NYC2012, which is seeking the 2012 Summer Olympics. 
 Both Mr. Dolan and Mr. Bloomberg have operated as outsiders in their business lives and are known among their peers to dig in for a battle. Mr. Bloomberg, after being fired from a Wall Street firm, created an information company that many initially thought ludicrous, and subsequently made billions before becoming mayor. Mr. Dolan's father also took an unorthodox approach to building his cable company, and the younger Mr. Dolan learned at his side. 
 But many of James Dolan's moves have raised questions in the business community. While other cable companies are trying to buy programming, Cablevision is selling off such assets, and recently the Knicks and Rangers have struggled just to be competitive. Cablevision's ill-fated acquisition of the Wiz electronics-goods chain was also a drain on the company.
 While Wall Street is more concerned with Cablevision's earnings than the personal style of its leader, the stadium battle, as well as publicized fights with the Yankees and the Mets, has drawn some unwelcome attention to the company and Mr. Dolan. ''I think people respect him for building Cablevision to the extent that he has,'' said John Eade, the president of Argus Research. ''But you don't see Comcast get into those kind of battle, you don't see Cox in those types of battles.'' 
 Several high-level executives have left Cablevision in recent years, though few would return phone calls to discuss why. ''The job was fabulous,'' said Mr. Abraham, the former president of Madison Square Garden/Radio City Music Hall. ''But I really felt Jim and I needed a divorce.'' He would not elaborate.
 Other executives, who declined to be quoted by name, acknowledged the difficulties of working with Mr. Dolan but said the company was still an exciting place to work. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides, who have been deeply aggrieved by what they see as an increasingly dangerous plan to foil their stadium dream, are not amused by the timing of Mr. Dolan's anti-stadium campaign so close to the mayor's race, particularly the way it features Mr. Bloomberg in such an unflattering way. 
 ''The timing and the hiring of Freddy Ferrer's political operative to run their campaign against jobs and economic opportunity certainly hasn't gone without notice,'' said Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, ''and I am sure the Campaign Finance Board will look at this relationship very closely.'' Ms. Cortes-Vazquez did not return calls to her office.
 Oddly enough, as the two men attack each other, the city and the mayor remain involved with the Garden. Mr. Bloomberg has season tickets to the Knicks and the Rangers and has used them frequently to bond with his younger daughter, Georgina, who is an enthusiastic sports fan. And the city's Olympic bid includes Madison Square Garden as a venue for various important events. 
 Further, the Garden served as the site of the Republican National Convention, although host committee officials later complained that Mr. Dolan declined to donate money for the event and complained that the company overcharged them for some items. Cablevision, in turn, complained that it did not make money from the event. 
 Each side agrees that it is personal but insists that the other started it. ''The mayor is attempting to make it personal in order to divert attention from the real issues,'' said Mr. Dolan, who agreed to answer a handful of questions only though his spokesman, Charles Schuler, via e-mail.
 Here is Mr. Skyler's assessment of the situation: Cablevision's efforts are ''all so Jimmy Dolan can protect the monopoly he inherited,'' he said. ''Do we really want one of the worst businessmen in history to be dictating the city's economic development policy?''
 The war for now is one of words, but the possibility of hardball looms. In a re-election campaign, the mayor may have to contend not just with a candidate attacking him, but also with a corporation willing to spend millions to attack him. And meanwhile, the fate of the West Side is just as much at stake. 
 ''What can be done to really make the far West Wide a vibrant part of New York City and whether the stadium will help or hinder that is something we should be discussing,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But instead we have a debate between two advocates, one for the development and one who is trying to protect his turf.''

HEADLINE: Security Dispute Dulls Luster of Bush's Trip to Chile

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush's visit to Chile ended on a bizarre note here this evening when the Chilean government disinvited more than 200 guests to a dinner with the president rather than let the Secret Service screen them for weapons on their way into the presidential palace.
 Mr. Bush and President Ricardo Lagos of Chile did not mention the dispute when they gave a news conference at the palace this evening, with Mr. Lagos hailing the ''modern and mature'' relationship between Chile and the United States. ''Most of the time we will be in agreement,'' he said. ''Sometimes we won't.''
 On this trip, the disagreements were more visibly on display. On Saturday night, attending a dinner with leaders from the 21 countries that make up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that was meeting here, Mr. Bush had to wade into a group of security agents to pull his lead Secret Service agent out of a shoving match with the Chilean police. The tape showing the president assuring the Chileans that his agent could come with him played over and over on television screens in the region this weekend. 
 By Saturday night -- though it had not been announced -- Chile had already begun calling the guests to the dinner planned for Sunday at La Moneda, the presidential palace that was the site of the coup that overthrew Salvador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. The dinner dispute over the dinner on Sunday centered on the question of whether the Chilean guests would be required to go through metal detectors before dining with Mr. Bush, a standard practice for the Secret Service. The Chileans told Mr. Bush's delegation that the practice was humiliating. ''Can you imagine someone like the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court having to submit to an inspection by gringo security agents in order to get into our own seat of government?'' asked one of the disinvited Chileans, who spoke on condition that he not be named. ''That's an affront no Chilean was going to tolerate, and Lagos had no choice but to act the way he did.''
 In the United States, such screening has become such standard practice that when Mr. Bush attends an event at a stadium, tens of thousands of people are put through the airport-style magnetometers.
 Not here. So instead of the gala, Mr. Lagos quickly downsized the event to a ''working dinner'' limited to a handful of senior staff members. Among White House aides and correspondents on the trip, no one could remember the last time a long-planned dinner had been canceled so precipitously. 
 It clearly lessened the glow of a trip that Chilean officials had hoped would highlight their status as Washington's best friend and closest ally in South America, and as a partner in a recently ratified free trade agreement.
 ''Success of our free trade agreement is a model for other countries,'' said Mr. Bush, who came to office with an aggressive agenda for expanding trade with Latin America that had been largely derailed after the 2001 terror attacks. ''Exports have risen dramatically in both our countries, and both the Chilean people and the people of the United States have benefited,'' he said. ''And through the establishment of free trade in the Americas, we are committed to a future in which every free nation in the hemisphere can share in the benefits of open markets and in the creation of new jobs.''
 Despite the economic closeness, Mr. Bush received what appeared to be a cool reception here. No crowds were on the streets to greet him as his motorcade sped through the city to the presidential palace late this afternoon, only small clutches of protesters. 
 A Chilean reporter reminded Mr. Bush at the news conference that Mr. Lagos had opposed the Iraq war, and he then asked the president, ''Who was right and who was wrong?'' Mr. Bush launched into a defense of his action, but only after saying: ''President Lagos didn't agree with my decision, and I respect that. He's still my friend.'' 
 Earlier, Mr. Bush met with President Vicente Fox of Mexico, the foreign leader with whom he was closest when he came to office. Relations grew far more distant after Sept. 11, when action was delayed on Mr. Bush's plans for loosening immigration rules. 
 Congress has balked at Mr. Bush's plan to change the law so that millions of illegal Mexican laborers could obtain temporary work visas in the United States but would not be able to use those visas as path to obtain citizenship. Mr. Fox is under pressure to persuade the president to expand the plan, and Mr. Bush said Sunday that he would use the political capital he gained in his re-election to get it passed. 
 ''We'd much rather have security guards chasing down terrorists or drug runners or drug smugglers than people coming to work,'' he said. ''And so, therefore, I think a guest worker program is important, and I look forward to working with Congress on it.'' 
 Mr. Bush said at the news conference that at the meeting of Pacific rim leaders today he was asked a number of questions about the fall in the value of the dollar -- a major issue for Asian and Latin American nations that are finding their products less competitive on the international market. He was also asked about America's soaring budget deficits -- the kinds of questions his father used to receive in Japan in the late 1980's, before the deficits were turned to surpluses in the late 1990's. 
 ''The best way to affect those who watch the dollar's value is to make a commitment to deal with our short- term and long-term deficits,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit began in 1993 as a counterweight to the annual summit that brings the American president together with old allies -- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Italy -- and most recently with Russia.
 After a dozen years, the meetings have allowed the American president to have at least one annual, face-to-face meeting with the leader of China -- something that previously required endless, difficult negotiations over which leader would visit the other. (Mr. Bush and Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, agreed Saturday that each would visit the other next year.)
 Perhaps more important, it brings together important regional heads of state who rarely have high-level interchanges with Washington, including the leaders of Vietnam and Indonesia. It is also a chance for small nations to showcase their progress -- as Chile did this year, and Brunei did in 2000.
 But Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation has never become a serious decision-making body. It has only once been the stage for significant negotiations -- in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990's. At that time, the assembled leaders agreed to steps to prevent future economic failures from rippling through the world financial system. Some of the provisions were adopted; others forgotten and never mentioned in follow-up meetings. 
 On Sunday, the leaders announced some modest goals in liberalizing trade but made no assessment of their progress toward a goal set in the 1990's: completely free trade among developed nations by 2010, and among the developing nations by 2020. An accord on controlling portable, shoulder-fired missiles, a huge threat to commercial aircraft, largely repeated goals the group set last year. An agreement on fighting corruption echoed an accord from several years ago. 
 The first sign of social misunderstanding between the United States and Chile came Saturday night, when Chilean security agents initially prevented Mr. Bush's lead agent from following him into a dinner for heads of state attending the conference. When Mr. Bush noticed the commotion, he walked back outside, reached into a group of scuffling guards, grabbed his lead agent by the suit and pulled him out of the melee. Mr. Bush then shook his head, as if in disbelief, and escorted the agent into the dinner. 
 In a videotape of the incident, which played over and over throughout the region on Sunday, it appears as if Chilean security officials tried to restrain Mr. Bush before they recognized him -- perhaps thinking he was another member of the Secret Service detail. One of Mr. Bush's aides said that the president had been alerted before the incident that there was some disagreement with the Chileans about whether the detail would be allowed to enter the dinner.
 Security for the 21-nation conference is being provided by the Chilean national police, who have been widely criticized by human rights groups here and abroad for heavy-handed tactics, during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and under democratic rule. On Friday, the police used water cannons and tear gas to break up an anti-Bush street demonstration after a relatively small group of protesters threw rocks and bottles at them.
 At the news conference here on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lagos indirectly acknowledged the dispute, saying his government likes to receive foreign visitors ''with the full honors they deserve,'' but minimized its importance. ''We are going to have a work meeting, a news conference and then a working meal with President Bush, which is all that I would like to say about that in particular,'' he said.
 The most important thing, the Chilean leader said, is not the social arrangements but to ''gain the maximum advantage from a visit.'' When he last visited the United States in July, Mr. Lagos added, he followed the same format, that of a small working meal rather than an elaborate banquet.

HEADLINE: Frequent-Flier Miles Can Vanish Into the Air

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT. 
Readers are invited to send stories about business travel experiences to businesstravel@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
It took a decade for Michael Sommer to earn more than two million frequent-flier miles on United Airlines. It took a single dispute over a ticket refund for him to lose his elite status, dozens of flight coupons and every last mile he had collected.
 How did Mr. Sommer, a technology consultant from Jacksonville, Fla., get all of his points confiscated? Like an increasing number of frequent fliers, a majority of them business travelers, his mileage account was subjected to a secret audit by his airline. He says he learned of the review only when he checked in for a recent flight to Buenos Aires. 
 ''I was ambushed,'' he said. ''I was about to board the flight when a United Airlines supervisor at the gate said, 'We have something for you.' He handed me a letter that said I had been stripped of my status and miles as the result of an audit.'' 
 Mr. Sommer called a friend at United to find out what had happened. The employee retrieved his electronic flight record, which was even more damning than the letter. It claimed he had improperly used a denied-boarding certificate as partial payment for his ticket. It instructed United Airlines representatives to confiscate all of his flight upgrade coupons, discount vouchers and free tickets, and to collect an additional $977 for the flight to Chile, which included a $377 change fee and $600 for the use of ''bogus denied-boarding certificates.''
 United acknowledged that it had removed Mr. Sommer from its rewards program, but declined to discuss the particulars of his audit, ''out of respect for his privacy,'' according to an airline spokeswoman, Robin Urbanski.
 She said, however, that the customer was punished after a string of program abuses dating back more than two years and the action was not a result of a single infraction.
 Indeed, in a 2001 letter to Mr. Sommer, United accused him of collecting miles for flights he had not taken and trying to claim credit for a first-class seat booked in economy class. The carrier warned him to observe the rules. ''Should your abuse of the program rules continue,'' the letter added, ''we will have no choice but to terminate your membership.'' Mr. Sommer denies he broke any program rules.
 Few audits lead to such stark outcomes as Mr. Sommer's did. But they are becoming more common, according to experts. That is because more airlines are either on the verge of bankruptcy or are already flying under Chapter 11 protection and are trying to whittle away their liabilities. With close to 10 trillion unredeemed frequent-flier miles among the nation's carriers, rewards programs have quietly become a target.
 ''To make their liability as small as possible, airlines are auditing more mileage accounts and enforcing their frequent-flier mileage program rules more strictly,'' said Ted Wright, an Atlanta consultant and former brand manager for Delta. 
 He said frequent travelers are upset, in part because airlines used to routinely bend award-program rules, particularly when it came to their best customers, and in part because of the zeal with which recent audits have been conducted. 
 ''There is a sense among passengers that they are entitled to their miles,'' he added. ''There is a sense that airlines don't have any business taking miles away.''
 The airlines apparently disagree, as Paul Bingham, an economic consultant in Washington, discovered. A frequent flier on US Airways, he claimed 3,000 miles he thought he had earned in a contest. Unbeknownst to him, he had submitted more certificates than the rules allowed. Several months after filing the paperwork, he got a letter from the carrier notifying him of an audit. ''The airline didn't inform me in advance of the audit, nor did they offer me an opportunity to appeal,'' he said. ''They just did it and then sent me a letter saying they'd done it and what action they took as a result.''
 A US Airways spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of Mr. Bingham's case ''because we respect his privacy.'' But she said a review of his account revealed that no audits had taken place since 2001. ''There have been a handful of times in the past where a promotional code has been improperly applied,'' said Amy Kudwa, a spokeswoman for the carrier. ''But in those cases, it was largely a matter of crediting the customers, not deducting miles.''
 How do audits work? Airlines are tight-lipped about the reviews. But according to people who have been involved in the process, they rely on software that monitors mileage accounts for suspicious patterns like claiming miles for a nonrevenue ticket or using the wrong frequent-flier number when requesting mileage credit.
 Generally, a fishy account is red-flagged and then investigated by an auditor. Fliers are not notified until the audit is completed and an ''adjustment,'' a euphemism for having miles deducted, is made.
 At United Airlines, passengers who have been audited can provide ''additional or clarifying documents'' if they disagree with the results of the review, said Ms. Urbanski, the airline spokeswoman. ''There are no further appeals.''
 Sometimes, an airline does not even notify an audited customer.
 Christina Zimmel, an information-technology analyst in Clawson, Mich., was preparing to redeem her frequent-flier miles on Northwest Airlines for a vacation to Hawaii when she noticed her account was suddenly 10,000 miles lighter. 
 ''I called the airline and asked, 'What's this about?''' she remembered. A Northwest representative explained that an ''accounting error'' had been made and that she was not entitled to the miles, which had already been subtracted from her account. 
 Ms. Zimmel said she was not as upset about losing 10,000 miles as she was about the way Northwest handled her case. ''It would have been nice if they'd told me about the audit,'' she said.
 According to Northwest, Ms. Zimmel had two frequent-flier accounts. She had qualified for a first-time booking bonus when she made her initial reservation through each one. Later, when she tried to merge them, the airline deducted one of the bonuses, worth about 4,000 miles, from the combined account. Northwest's records did not reflect whether she had been notified of the action.
 Airlines appear to be well within their rights to strip travelers of their miles, according to loyalty program experts. The fine print on most programs stipulates that the miles belong to the carrier and can be removed for any reason.
 But Hal Brierley, a co-founder of the award-program consulting firm e-Rewards in Dallas, said airlines were no longer afraid to turn up the heat on passengers staking a claim on miles that did not belong to them, even if it meant going after their best customers.
 Travelers should not take it personally, he added. ''I think there is growing evidence that airlines are looking for creative, aggressive ways to reduce the number of miles as a way of lowering costs,'' he said.
 Travelers like Mr. Sommer say it is difficult not to take it personally. 
 For starters, he said, the results of United's first investigation in 2001 exonerated him of any wrongdoing because the airline restored most of the miles it claimed he had not earned. After learning of the results of its latest audit, the former elite-level frequent flier grudgingly paid the difference for his flight to Buenos Aires.
 Mr. Sommer's lawyer, Barry Roberts, said United's actions had troubling implications for all frequent fliers. ''United and other airlines are taking in hundreds of millions, and perhaps billions, of dollars in cash for these miles,'' he said. ''How can they turn around and say, 'These miles belong to us. If we don't like you, we can confiscate them'? I think consumers have rights, and those rights have to be defined either by a court or a regulatory authority.''
 A mileage specialist, Tim Winship, who edits the Web site Frequentflier.com, describes the sale of miles as a ''huge business'' but said exact numbers were difficult to come by. ''It is definitely in the hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ''It's a profit center for the airlines, so in the sense that they can sell their miles but at the same time keep their awards liability in check, it's a good thing.''
 Mr. Roberts said his client was considering suing United to recover his rewards. ''They can't just arbitrarily take his miles away from him,'' he added. ''I mean, if you violate a bank's rules, do they take all the money you have on deposit away from you?''

HEADLINE: Charter Schools Fall Short In Public Schools Matchup

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
A new study commissioned by the Department of Education, which compares the achievement of students in charter schools with those attending traditional public schools in five states, has concluded that the charter schools were less likely to meet state performance standards.
 In Texas, for instance, the study found that 98 percent of public schools met state performance requirements two years ago, but that only 66 percent of the charter schools did. Even when adjusted for race and poverty, the study said, the charter schools fell short more frequently by a statistically significant amount.
 The study added new data to a highly politicized debate between charter school supporters, including senior Bush administration officials, and skeptics who question the performance of the publicly financed but privately managed schools.
 Deputy Education Secretary Eugene W. Hickok minimized the report's significance even as he released the results. But academics who have been critical of charter school performance called it an important contribution. 
 ''In five case-study states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools,'' the report said. Those states, Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts and North Carolina, all have made significant public investments in charter schools.
 The report's finding appears to present a new complication for the Bush administration as it seeks to carry out the No Child Left Behind law, which says that public schools failing to meet achievement objectives over several years may be converted into charter schools. 
 ''How can we consider charter schools to be an option for dealing with failing public schools when this study, commissioned by the Department of Education, shows that about half of them don't appear to be doing any better at meeting performance standards than other public schools?'' asked Gary Miron, a researcher at Western Michigan State University who has written a book on charter schools. 
 The study also provided new statistical data showing that charter schools, which tend to be located in cities, serve higher percentages of minority youths than traditional public schools, but fewer special education students. African-American students made up 27 percent of charter school students in the 1999-2000 year, compared with 17 percent in regular public schools, the report said. Some 21 percent of charter students were Hispanic, compared with 15 percent in regular schools, it said.
 Paul E. Peterson, a professor of government at Harvard who has written frequently of the benefits to parents of offering new choices, including charter schools and vouchers, called that finding a significant contribution to the educational debate that ''confirms that charter schools are identifying and serving a disadvantaged population.'' 
 Dr. Peterson cited the high number of minority students in charter schools as evidence that they are not ''creaming,'' or recruiting a preponderance of easy-to-educate, talented students. Their higher populations of minority students, he said, help to explain the report's conclusion that charter schools were less likely to meet state achievement standards than regular schools, he said.
 ''When you have targeted a needy population, you will have more difficulty reaching state standards,'' Dr. Peterson said.
 The report found that in two states, however, Texas and Colorado, even when allowances were made for race and poverty, the charter schools were still less likely to meet state standards than regular schools.
 Charter schools have gained considerable popularity among some parents and educators since 1992, when the first one was created in Minnesota. A new survey, by the Center for Education Reform, a Washington group that supports charters, says there are now about 3,300 of the schools, operating in 41 states, educating nearly one million students. Still, they are a relatively minor force in the nation's overall kindergarten through high school education effort. There are about 90,000 traditional public schools, educating more than 50 million students.
 The new study is the third and final report on a broad examination of charter schools, commissioned in 1998 by the Department of Education in the Clinton administration. Conducted by SRI International, a research firm in California, the final report was delivered to the department in June, its authors said. The department did not make the 127-page report public until Friday afternoon, after The New York Times filed a Freedom of Information Request last month to obtain it.
 Susan Aspey, a spokeswoman, said the department had released the report ''as fast as we could.''
 Dr. Hickok, in a statement accompanying the report, said, ''As can be evidenced by their growing popularity, charters are an important educational option'' for the students who attend them. . Noting the finding that charter schools were less likely to meet performance standards than traditional public schools, he said the study ''does not mean that traditional schools are outperforming charter schools or vice versa.''
 ''The study is a snapshot, and it is impossible to know whether charter students are catching up or falling behind,'' Dr. Hickok said. 
 The study follows several recent efforts to track charter performance, including a report by the American Federation of Teachers, which showed students in charter schools lagging behind their public school peers on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Advocates of charter schools, including Education Secretary Rod Paige, criticized that report for generalizing about charter schools, which offer extremely varied educational programs in states from Massachusetts to Oregon.
 Partly in response to the A.F.T. report, a Harvard economics professor, Caroline M. Hoxby, sped up release of a study she had been conducting comparing students in charter schools nationwide with students in the nearest neighborhood school, and with the closest public school with a similar racial makeup. 
 She found charter students were 4 percent more likely to have mastered reading and 2 percent more likely to have mastered math than students at the neighborhood schools. The proficiency levels increased by one percentage point in each subject when she compared charters to local schools with a similar racial makeup. Dr. Hoxby's strongest findings were in Washington, D.C. 
 Her report also provoked debate, with charter supporters praising her methods and findings and other researchers, who have tried to replicate her data, criticizing her for excluding some Washington charter schools from her study set and using a lower measure to determine success in charter schools. 
 Another recent study of charter schools in Washington, where 17 percent of publicly educated students attend charters, found that charters were somewhat more likely to enroll low-income students than regular public schools, less likely to enroll students with limited English, and as likely as traditional schools to enroll disabled students, said Mark Schneider, a political science professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a co-author. The study was financed by the National Science Foundation. 
 The new Education Department report found that 43 percent of charter students were from low-income families, compared with 38 percent in regular public schools nationwide. Nine percent of charter students were disabled, compared with 12 percent in regular public schools, it said.
 The new report attracted immediate criticism from groups representing charter schools. 
 Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for the Charter School Leadership Council, an umbrella group, said it ''sheds no light on the actual performance of charter schools or the value they add to student learning'' because it did not include measurements of the evolution of student achievement over several years at charters. 
 ''In this respect it probably clouds the picture rather than clarifies it,'' Mr. Gerstein said.

HEADLINE: Red, White and Blue, but No Greenbacks for Nationals

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
STILL without approval from baseball club owners or the city they plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born yesterday in a sea of red, white and blue. These are not your grandfather's Washington Nationals, because those Nationals played in the American League and were alternately called the Senators.
 The new National League Nationals were named not only before they have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they have a new owner.
 Major League Baseball, the owner of record, has moved so slowly on the transfer and the sale of the team that a new owner isn't guaranteed to be in place in time to make marketing plans for next season or to have a say in off-season player decisions. 
 For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, the new guy doesn't even get to name his team.
 ''We need a name for marketing,'' Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said yesterday. ''We're not going to have an owner for some time. What if we don't have an owner by the start of spring training?''
 Nearly 30 individuals or groups have submitted expressions of interest in buying the team. Baseball expects about half of that number to bid seriously when the time comes to put up their money.
 One owner said yesterday that he believed the leading contender for the team was Mark Broxmeyer, a Long Island builder from New York, but another hopeful said there was no way anyone could be a leading contender because the first dollar hasn't been bid.
 If there is a leader in the bidding, having nothing to do with finances, it could be the group headed by Stan Kasten, who for many years was the president of the Atlanta Braves. Kasten has been exploring multiple opportunities in multiple sports, but if he decides to reach for the Nationals, he would have an advantage over other prospective buyers.
 Why? Study recent baseball history. The winning bidder for the Boston Red Sox three years ago was John Henry's group, which was loaded with baseball people who had a close relationship with Commissioner Bud Selig. He might not have known it at the time, but Cablevision's Charles F. Dolan never really had a chance. Kasten has had a good, long relationship with Selig.
 The Washington bidding will be a show worth watching. Not long after Major League Baseball took control of the Expos, baseball people talked about an eventual sale bringing in $400 million, giving the other 29 teams a rewarding payday for their $120 million purchase.
 Then the economy turned south, and some people felt baseball would be fortunate to get $200 million. Maybe that's why baseball officials dragged their feet in deciding where to put the Expos. They were trying to wait out the economy.
 Time hasn't done much for the economy, but it did give baseball time to find a knight on a big white horse. The Washington mayor, Anthony Williams, came riding in and pledged that the District of Columbia would build a new ballpark for the new team, whatever the cost, which some estimates say could exceed $600 million.
 The new owner, whose team will play at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium for the first three seasons, will have what might be the best stadium deal ever. The Nationals will pay nothing for the construction of the park, pay $3.5 million a year for rent and receive all stadium-related revenue from tickets, concessions, parking, signs and naming-rights fees.
 The prospect of getting that combined revenue and money from a regional sports network to be shared with the Baltimore Orioles will drive up the sale price.
 A financial investment adviser said yesterday that he would never advise a client to pay $400 million for the Nats, although maybe $300 million, but he acknowledged the possibility that some bidder might make a $400 million bid if he really wanted the team and wanted to break away from the crowd.
 Just like the old Nationals, who became the Senators in 1957, these Nationals will have the right to change their name. ''When they move into the new stadium, the owner will have the right to petition to change the name,'' DuPuy said.
 Club owners are expected to approve the team's move within the next two weeks, whether or not baseball officials have concluded an agreement with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, on compensation for intruding on what he considers his turf. The Washington city council will vote on stadium financing next month.
 Meanwhile, even though no owner is in place to decide which players he might want or how much he would spend on them, Jim Bowden continues to do his job as interim general manager.
 Bowden has already demonstrated his acumen in running a low-budget operation, having served as general manager of the economically deprived Cincinnati Reds for 10 1/2 years. And in the space of a few days last week, Bowden signed half an infield's worth of free agents -- third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Cristian Guzman -- and traded for a productive, if volatile, outfielder in Jose Guillen.
 Bowden hasn't been told if he can exceed the $41 million payroll with which the Expos opened last season, but baseball officials have estimated that the Nationals will take in at least $100 million more in revenue than the Expos did. That should give Bowden a little more to play with.
 Even if he doesn't know whom the new owner will be.

HEADLINE: The Handbag? Total Knockoff. The Price Tag? All Too Real.

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
It is as much a rite of the New York holiday season as sidewalk Santas or crowded Fifth Avenue sidewalks: the proliferation of hawkers selling counterfeit products like the fake Fendi handbag, the replica Rolex watch and the pirated DVD.
 The problem, according to City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., appears to be getting worse, and is hurting New Yorkers in ways they don't see: for instance, by costing New York City government more than $1 billion in lost tax revenue. 
 In a report assessing the economic consequences of the counterfeiting industry, the comptroller estimated that more than $23 billion in counterfeit goods changes hands in New York City each year.
 ''While they may pay a fraction of the cost of goods like a fake Coach bag that may look good, the people of New York City suffer,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''There is a ripple effect. You can save in the short run but in the long run there is a loss.'' 
 City officials and counterfeiting experts from the fashion and entertainment industries say that it is not just Times Square tourists who buy pirated products. New York natives are interested in bargain-hunting for knockoff Kate Spade handbags and Louis Vuitton look-alikes, too. 
 And the merchandise doesn't all come from overseas. Warehouses stocked with counterfeit electronics and clothing can be found from Chinatown to Queens, and nearly 42 percent of all counterfeit CD's seized in the United States are made within the metropolitan area, the report said. 
 ''We don't have to look to China to find bad actors,'' said David Benjamin, a senior vice president in the Universal Music Group's anti-piracy unit. ''We can look right here.''
 According to the report, the $1 billion in lost city tax revenue comprises about $380 million in unpaid sales taxes, $360 million in personal income taxes and $290 million in business income taxes. And when combined with $1.6 billion in lost state tax revenue from the sale of counterfeit goods across New York State, the total loss of tax revenue reaches over $2.6 billion for 2003, the report said. 
 ''The illegal trade activity is depriving our residents of necessary tax revenue at a time when New York City is trying to overcome one of its worst fiscal crises ever,'' Mr. Thompson added. He suggested that the figures had grown considerably over the past decade even though they had remained stable the past few years.
 But the city's role in the counterfeiting industry is in itself staggering, the comptroller's report suggests. New York City accounts for roughly 8 percent of the $287 billion in counterfeit goods sold in the United States, the report said. And the comptroller said that the city's large population, its popularity as a tourist destination and the volume of merchandise that moves in and out of the Port of New York make it a major center for such illegal trade activity. More than $456 billion in counterfeit goods are exchanged worldwide each year, the report said.
 Mr. Thompson called for the creation of a government task force and additional state and federal money to step up enforcement against counterfeiting. He also suggested increasing public awareness and enacting new rules to make it easier for customers to know when they are buying from legitimate street vendors. 
 The comptroller's call to crack down on counterfeiters comes as Hollywood lobbyists and Washington lawmakers have tried to curb the sales of bootlegged CD's and DVD's that infringe intellectual property rights and eat away at royalty fees. Fashion companies and law enforcement officials have been aggressively pursuing those who make and sell cheap imitation goods. But with every high-profile arrest, new merchants and manufacturers open their doors to take their place, industry experts said.
 The report, released just days before the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, is a result of several meetings between industry and city government officials.
 The comptroller's office said it decided to study the impact of the black market about a year ago over concerns about the lost tax revenue from the transactions that were visible on the street.
 But a vendor hawking DVD's of current movies like ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' from a cardboard box, just a block from the comptroller's office in the Municipal Building, shook her head and smiled when asked about the plans. Would it really work? She declined to comment, but went back to peddling her pirated merchandise to passers-by.

HEADLINE: A Tradition at Risk In Northeastern Bogs

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: WAREHAM, Mass. 

 BODY:
As the cranberry harvest draws to a close here in southeastern Massachusetts, workers send a strange menagerie of machinery across the bogs. They dry-harvest the berries with devices that resemble giant lawn mowers or cross flooded bogs on four-wheeled paddle contraptions that roil the shallow water, painting it crimson as loosened berries bob to the surface behind them. 
 This is a good year for cranberries. They are abundant and their quality is high. But in this state, where Wampanoag Indians first taught English settlers how to use their ''bitter berries'' in Thanksgiving feasts, the outlook for cranberry farming itself is not so bright.
 Sprawling towns compete for water the farmers need to harvest and irrigate their crops, and to protect them from frost. The banning of some pesticides has brought a resurgence of previously vanquished insect pests, and substitute pest management methods are more complicated and time-consuming. New hybrids have sharply increased bog yields, but introducing them is costly and means taking bogs out of production for three or four years, while newly planted vines mature. 
 If they are to survive growing competition from states like Wisconsin, now the nation's leading producer, cranberry farmers here must find new capital and new customers for their fruit, which most market through their cooperative, Ocean Spray. But that takes money and marketing reach, said Michael Hogan, the chief executive of the A.D. Makepeace Company, which has been growing cranberries in Massachusetts since the 19th century and is one of the world's largest producers. 
 Meanwhile, developers wait metaphorically at the edge of every bog, ready to pay soaring prices for farmers' land. Wetland regulations put the bogs themselves off limits for building, but growers typically have three or four acres of dry upland for every acre of bog, said Jeffrey B. LaFleur, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association. And it is exactly the kind of land that developers covet, since its sandy soil easily passes the percolation tests required for septic systems.
 When Makepeace put five building lots on the market, ranging from three and a half to five acres, it expected them to bring $185,000 each, Mr. Hogan said. Instead, builders bid them up to $300,000 or more. He said lot prices had risen 30 percent in the last year.
 But people in this region, with their Cranberry Highway, Cranberry Industrial Park, Cranberry Plaza shopping center and so on, are eager to maintain the cranberry tradition. So as growers sell out, Falmouth, Mashpee and other towns have bought their bogs to operate or lease to other growers, Mr. LaFleur said. The Nantucket Conservation Foundation operates a 200-acre bog on the island, he said, and the Vineyard Open Land Foundation, on Martha's Vineyard, is reconstructing a bog there. 
 The American cranberry, a woody vine, grows wild from the Carolinas to the Canadian Maritimes, but it is particularly well adapted to the bogs of southeastern Massachusetts, with their relatively long and warm growing season and their cold winters, where vines can huddle under ice. 
 The plant spreads its shoots along the ground, sending out fruit-bearing ''uprights.'' According to the 1990 book ''Cranberry Harvest: A History of Cranberry Growing in Massachusetts'' the Wampanoag gathered berries for pemmican and sauces and as a poultice for wounds. 
 Soon after the English arrived, they started eating them too. Among other things, the berries staved off scurvy.
 Cranberry cultivation began in earnest in the mid-19th century, in natural cranberry bogs, Mr. LaFleur said, or in places where ''bog iron'' had been mined to make cannons for the Revolution and the War of 1812. Today, this long history is a problem for growers here. 
 Unlike their competitors in other states, who laid out expansive, level bogs to order and built them from scratch, Massachusetts growers inherited small, scattered, irregular plots, now surrounded by roadways and suburban neighborhoods. Some are as much as three feet out of grade, Mr. LaFleur said, making them harder to flood and harvest. 
 Growers can renovate their bogs and use laser equipment to level them exactly, he said, but that can cost as much as $15,000 an acre, an investment many growers are unwilling to make.
 Families who have been growing cranberries here for generations are beginning to wonder if they will be able to continue. A plunge in prices in the late 1990's and a few disappointing harvests since then have sent many growers into the ''off-bog'' labor market, at least part time. The average age of cranberry farmers is now over 55, Mr. LaFleur said, and many are loath to improve their bogs if it means saddling their children with long-term debt.
 Many of these children are meanwhile abandoning the cranberry tradition for more lucrative work in the region's high-tech or retail economy, a trend reflected in the makeup of the harvesting crews. Nowadays, many of the harvest workers are Cambodian immigrants who live miles away in the old industrial city of Fall River.
 Even though cranberries bring in more dollars than any other food crop in Massachusetts, Mr. LaFleur said, they still make up a tiny part of the nation's agricultural business, which means they may be ignored when it comes to research -- on pesticides, for example. 
 Dr. Hilary Sandler, an entomologist at the Cranberry Experiment Station, a scientific outpost established in East Wareham in 1918 by the University of Massachusetts, said: ''There are major crops and minor crops, but I really consider us a micro crop. It's hard for us to register on a chemical company radar screen.''
 So the research station, comprising a few frame buildings and an 11-acre test bog, picks up the slack. The 15 scientists here along with their graduate students and technicians try new vine varieties, test soil treatments and pesticides and develop water-saving irrigation practices.
 Cranberry growers farm ''in a wetlands environment next to people,'' Dr. Sandler said, pointing to new houses nosing up to the edge of the experimental bog, just as they do along the edges of commercial bogs. So they must use extreme care in choosing and using chemical insecticides or herbicides. ''When our neighbors see us come out in our protective gear, they get concerned,'' she said. 
 Dr. Sandler said scientists at the station had devised application regimens for insecticides and measured residues on fruit, data she said the Environmental Protection Agency must have before it will approve the use of a chemical on a food crop.
 With the banning of broad-spectrum pesticides like malathion, she said, researchers are testing whether changes in flooding, applications of sand or pruning can help control insect pests and weeds. Poison ivy, also a woody vine, is a particular problem.
 ''When you used broad-spectrum pesticides it was simple,'' Dr. Sandler said. ''Spray and you're done.'' Substitute insecticides are less risky but they must be applied far more often and more selectively, she said, depending on whether their target is adult insects, larvae or eggs. That means growers must closely monitor their bogs, set insect traps and otherwise keep track of insects like the black-headed fireworm and the blunt-nosed leafhopper, two pests that reappeared recently here. 
 Mr. LaFleur said the experiment station had also helped growers learn to use less water. ''Old wisdom was cranberries need an inch of water a week,'' he said. ''Now we know it depends, bog to bog.'' 
 He said scientists at the experiment station were teaching growers how to use instruments to monitor underground water levels so they knew exactly when and how much to irrigate.
 But if they are to survive, Mr. Hogan said, cranberry growers need to think beyond the bog, something he said that he, as the first non-Makepeace to head the family company, has been hired to do. Makepeace is committed to cranberries, he said, but it is looking to expand sand and gravel operations on its land and, in particular, to turn some of its upland acreage into ''conservation communities,'' high-end housing that sits easily near the bog landscape. 
 He said Makepeace executives hoped that Ocean Spray would sell out to Pepsico, but the cooperative's 900-plus growers narrowly rejected the plan this year.
 Mr. LaFleur said 70 percent of the cooperative's members farmed fewer than 20 acres. Even with cranberry prices hovering around $35 a barrel this year -- up from less than $20 a few years ago -- he said few growers could make a living on their bogs as they once did. 
 Even the experiment station, also an Ocean Spray grower, produced a good crop this year, Dr. Sandler said. But she said the scientists there were looking way beyond this year's harvest, into an uncertain future.
 ''We try to look 10 to 20 years down the road,'' she said. ''What are our problems going to be? Because it takes that long to get research answers.''

HEADLINE: Iraq's Neighbors Discuss War, Elections and Reconstruction

BYLINE: By NEIL MACFARQUHAR

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The lingering anxiety and antagonism prompted by the American military presence in the Middle East surfaced Monday at a meeting of foreign ministers from Iraq's neighbors, on the eve of the first international conference aimed at easing the tensions created by the entire United States enterprise in Iraq. 
 The Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, questioned his Iraqi counterpart about who decided on the military attacks carried out inside Iraq and the level of force used in bombing cities and other targets, several of those taking part said. 
 ''He suggested the kind of weapons used is disproportionate,'' one minister said of Mr. Sharaa. The response from the Iraqis was that the transitional government was trying to end the insurgency. 
 Iraq hopes to emerge from the larger gathering on Tuesday with some of the bitterness over the war eased and with a renewed assurance that the United Nations will play an active role in overseeing the elections scheduled for Jan. 30. 
 Much of the session on Monday night was occupied with a presentation by Ashraf Qazi, the United Nations secretary general's special envoy to Iraq, about how the elections might unfold. Mr. Qazi said they were technically feasible, but he did not join in discussions of whether the country would be stable enough for the vote to proceed on schedule. 
 Several ministers said widespread participation was more important than meeting the deadline, those at the session said, describing the overall mood as cordial. 
 Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the Egyptian foreign minister, said the meeting ended with unanimous backing for the full conference on Tuesday to support the political transition in Iraq, via elections, as well as stabilizing the country and ensuring its economic reconstruction. 
 The full conference is not expected to discuss any delay in the elections. With the vote just two months away, only several hundred troops have been committed by a few nations to help guard the process, and far more important, the United Nations has 25 or fewer election experts on deck in Iraq, said its foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari. 
 ''It is important for them to be there -- not the troops, but more U.N. personnel staff, technical assistance and aid to that effect,'' Mr. Zebari said in an interview. 
 Ayman Safadi, the spokesman for Mr. Qazi, said that the organization's role was to provide technical support to the Iraqi election commission, which is organizing the vote, and that for this purpose the number of advisers was considered adequate. 
 One measure of the violence racking Iraq and the bitter international rifts over the war is that no one has stepped forward to take the lead on the issue of organizing the elections. 
 A brief communique is expected to emerge from the conference backing the elections in general terms, along with the overall process of establishing a new constitution, stabilizing the country and aiding reconstruction. 
 As the main organizer of the meeting, Egypt avoided being too specific, trying to focus on solving past rifts rather than creating new ones. The meeting on Tuesday will group the foreign ministers of some 20 countries, including the United States, China, Russia, France and Britain, with the heads of four major regional or international organizations, including the United Nations. 
 The basic idea is to provide a forum for Iraq's neighbors, deeply suspicious of the American presence, to air their differences directly with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and officials from other countries whose troops are occupying Iraq. 
 ''The aim of this conference is to build confidence and to establish some kind of a dialogue between those countries who have forces and troops in Iraq and those countries that neighbor us,'' said Mr. Zebari, the Iraqi foreign minister.
 Qualms about the American presence in Iraq are not felt only by its neighbors. Some of the sharpest arguments in shaping the final communique came from France, supported periodically by Russia, China and Germany. 
 France and the Arab League were particularly insistent that the resolution call for widening the political participation in Iraq and that it include a timetable for withdrawing the American troops. The proponents of such measures argued that they would encourage more Iraqis to look to the elections as a means of changing the country and not toward continued violent attacks. 
 Iraq, along with Egypt and the United States, argued that withdrawal of American forces was unlikely to influence the most violent groups and that foreign forces could pull out only when the Iraqi security forces no longer needed help. 
 Mr. Zebari said he wanted to use the international gathering to make a push for more nations to aid in building a viable Iraqi security force. If they are so interested in getting the Americans out, he said, they should be eager to help create a replacement. 
 ''My message to them is if you want that to happen, why don't you help us to accelerate this process, why don't you provide arms, training, assistance, security cooperation, border control,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Tightening of Belts For Symphony Players

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Many of the people who bring you Mozart and Mahler from some of the nation's greatest symphony orchestras will be working harder over the next few years and without raises this season. 
 They will be paying more for health insurance and retiring, at least for many in the near future, with the same old pensions. Yet they will still be making solid six-figure incomes and will have new opportunities to have their performances heard on radio, Internet and CD.
 Labor season in the world of Big Orchestra is over. 
 By a quirk of timing, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra all had contracts that expired in late summer. With ratification of a new contract in Philadelphia this weekend, the final terms have been sewn up, and some general trends have emerged. 
 Administrators say they hope the contracts will both improve the orchestras' current financial condition and solidify their futures. A holdback on salaries in the early part of the contracts, for example, will help the administrators repair deficits, and looser work rules will allow more Sunday and educational concerts, to build audiences, they argue.
 In one of the costliest future areas, pensions, Cleveland and Chicago will keep them frozen, and the New York Philharmonic put the matter off until the second year of a three-year contract, in a move seen as a time-buying exercise to improve financial health before dealing with the issue. The players in all orchestras got raises, but only starting in the second year in Cleveland, Chicago and Philadelphia, and after six months in New York.
 ''Orchestras in general are being a little more temperate, a little bit more careful,'' said Rita Shapiro, executive director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, which also reached a settlement this month. ''We tend to be making shorter deals. Everybody's hoping for an upturn in the economy.''
 Negotiations this time around were generally more bitter than in the recent past. Attendance and endowments were down, and costs and deficits were up. Strikes loomed, angry rhetoric flew and mediators were called in. Jan Gippo, president of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians and a piccolo player with the St. Louis Symphony, said he was convinced that a strike somewhere was inevitable. ''In each case, reason and true bargaining took over,'' he said.
 Even after settlements, there was criticism of orchestra managements. Stephen Lester, a bass player and head of the musicians' committee at the Chicago Symphony, blamed the bloating of management and the loss of focus on playing concerts for financial problems.
 ''The boards all of a sudden woke up and said, 'Man, we can't afford this,''' he said. ''They did the thing American industry is world-class at -- taking it out on the employees.''
 Joseph H. Kluger, president of the Philadelphia Orchestra, countered that as ticket revenues have shrunk, as a means of covering costs fund-raising -- and robust staffing for development and marketing staffs -- became crucial.
 ''Orchestras are more complex today,'' Mr. Kluger said. ''We're doing more than servicing audience members who want to come every Saturday night. We're serving school systems and communities. That's our mission. It's what donors want to support.''
 Most strikingly, the musicians in Chicago and Philadelphia agreed to reductions in the number of full-time positions through attrition, developments bitterly opposed by orchestra players in a world where hundreds of people can audition for a single job. 
 Mr. Lester, the Chicago musician, said his committee knew it was setting a ''dangerous precedent.''
 ''We felt that we had to show willingness to cooperate,'' he said. ''We also expect to see a willingness to support the orchestra down the road.''
 After big-time orchestra players made major gains in salaries and job stability starting in the 1960's, work conditions on their factory floor -- the stage -- became vital . 
 Many musicians say peace of mind is important to good performance, and that limits on their playing are important to their health, when blasting brass can cause hearing loss and constant minute movements of fingers can cause repetitive-stress injuries. Rehearsal and concert time, they argue, is only one part of a daily routine that includes practicing and teaching. 
 ''Happy musicians make great music,'' Ms. Shapiro, of the National Symphony, acknowledged.
 Managers say that time can be better organized, and musicians who may not be on stage during a smaller Mozart concert, yet are still being paid, should be prepared to put in some work hours. They also say that concerts should be played on the musicians' sacrosanct Sunday, when it is easier for many audience members to attend.
 That is exactly what will happen in Philadelphia, where orchestra players have agreed to 30 more concerts a year by the end of the contract, including four Sunday dates. The extra concerts include performances for students and families. The Clevelanders and Chicagoans will also play more Sunday and educational concerts. The New York Philharmonic musicians agreed to play one concert without pay to raise funds.
 But with all the extra work, the minimum salary is still decent, representatives of players and management say. (Virtually all players earn more with seniority pay, overtime and extras, and principals can negotiate much larger packages.) By the end of Year 3, the players in Philadelphia and Chicago will make at least $2,200 a week; the New Yorkers will make $2,180 (unless a penalty for failure by management to increase pensions enough kicks the pay grade up to $2,330); and in Cleveland, which has a smaller budget and endowment, weekly pay at the end of the two-year contract will hit $2,010.
 In one ripple effect, the contracts will provide a big pay bump for the Pittsburgh Symphony, where the weekly minimum is $1,735. The contract there calls for next season's minimum to equal 95 percent of the average salary of the four orchestras. 
 The relatively flush Boston Symphony Orchestra, the only one of the so-called Big Five orchestras, with a contract in course this season, will end next season at a salary of $2,170. 
 Several orchestras negotiated provisions designed to increase their presence on the airwaves. 
 In Cleveland, the contract permits the broadcast of 60 concerts over the next two seasons on radio and through streaming on the Internet. The Philadelphia Orchestra players agreed to terms allowing for 26 national and international broadcasts a year. 
 The Philadelphia players also broke away from the national American Federation of Musicians recording contract to allow four audio recordings on separate, less costly terms, which include revenue-sharing, Mr. Kluger said.

HEADLINE: A decline in the dollar is making American markets look less attractive to foreign investors.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
ARE foreign investors souring on Wall Street? The data say yes. 
 In September and August, foreign investors were net sellers of $5.9 billion of American stocks, according to the latest Treasury data available. These two monthly declines highlight a sharp slowdown in inflows from abroad since the beginning of the year, when the 12-month total through February was $58 billion. In September, the 12-month inflow had dropped to $18.7 billion. 
 While there have not been negative consequences for the American stock market so far, a steeper decline in the dollar could increase the net outflows and make American equities less attractive. 
 The net selling of American stocks by foreigners has probably continued since September, said Ian Scott, a global equity strategist with Lehman Brothers in London, ''because the dollar has continued to fall, and I think that is one of the motives behind the outflow.''
 He also said that Lehman's recent surveys showed that global investors were less interested in stocks generally and that those who were buying stocks were looking for value stocks, which are easy to find outside the United States. 
 Bob Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management, said that fear that the United States' current-account deficit would continue to grow, along with the belief abroad that the federal budget deficit will be difficult to reduce because of the war on terror and President Bush's promises to make his tax cuts permanent, ''has spooked some investors outside the United States.''
 Such fears have yet to have any impact on the recent performance of the United States stock market. Indeed, as William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics in Boston, noted, ''It is an old rule of thumb that foreigners are the last in and the last out.'' So it is possible that this outflow is a contrarian signal for the stock market.
 Foreign investors, for example, were pouring their money into American stocks at a 12-month rate of $153 billion in March of 2001, a year after the American stock market peaked at all-time highs. On the other hand, as the 1990's stock rally took off in 1995, foreign investors were selling American equities at a 12-month rate of $8.4 billion in March of that year. 
 In fact, if the net outflow of foreign investors from the stock market did continue in October and November, domestic investors clearly did much more than pick up the slack. Since Oct. 25, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has jumped 7.5 percent and is now up 5.9 percent for the year. At its recent closing peak of 1,184.17, the S.&P. 500 index was at its highest level in more than three years.
 Mr. Rhodes also argued that a Wall Street rally driven by domestic investors was healthy.
 ''We would like to have foreign participation, but it is healthier to have a domestic rally,'' he said, ''because foreign money is more likely to leave.''
 But many analysts think that the dollar, which is down 2.7 percent this year against a broad index including the United States' trading partners and much more against some individual currencies, will fall sharply in the months ahead. Such a decline, they argue, would not be good for stocks here.
 If there is a steep dollar decline from here, Mr. Froehlich of Deutsche Asset Management said the stock market ''will be hard pressed to get positive returns in that environment.''
 The United States and its allies are clearly willing to let the dollar fall further without any coordinated statements or coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market to slow the decline, analysts said yesterday, citing recent statements from the Bush administration and the meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized countries over the weekend in Berlin. Only the Japanese are expected to intervene to slow the yen's climb in value and the dollar's fall in an effort to protect the country's export business. 
 If the dollar continues to decline, Mr. Froehlich said the best performers on the United States market would be the big American companies that get a great deal of their earnings from abroad, because a weaker dollar increases the value of foreign profits. Among this group, based on annual sales abroad, are Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, I.B.M., General Electric, General Motors, Intel and Procter & Gamble, according to Standard and Poor's.
 He said that in such an environment, stock picking would be very important because he suspected that only about 50 of the 500 stocks in the S.&P. stock index would have gains.
 Mr. Froehlich, however, is not predicting a sharp decline in the dollar. He expects that it will fall 3 or 4 percent more by the end of the year, based on the Federal Reserve's broad dollar index. At that level, the dollar would be about 9 percent from the recent low that the dollar reached in 1995 and about 10 percent from the record low the dollar hit in 1978, based on the Fed's index. 
 He said the dollar could rally then as foreign investors realized that the American economy is still growing nicely and that the Federal Reserve will keep pushing interest rates higher, making investments in bonds here more attractive. 
 But other analysts are predicting a steep fall for the dollar, one that could take it to or below the record lows against it reached in 1995 against major European currencies and the Japanese yen.
 One reason for those predictions is that the American current-account deficit, which the broad gap between the nation's exports and imports of goods and services, is heading to a record of more than $600 billion this year.
 And Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned on Friday that such a deficit could mean foreigners would be net sellers of not only American equities, but also bonds, helping send stocks lower and interest rates higher.
 ''It seems persuasive that, given the size of the U.S. current-account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,'' Mr. Greenspan said in a speech in Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: In a Land Torn by Violence, Too Many Troubling Deaths 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: RIOSUCIO, Colombia 

 BODY:
At 15, Leida Salazar had just learned to ride a bike, eagerly watched after her smaller siblings and was among the extroverts in a throng of giddy indigenous girls. But a year ago, she fashioned a noose out of a wraparound skirt, hoisted it over the wood-beam rafter of her home and hanged herself.
 A note she left for her father voiced anguished fears that Colombia's drug-fueled guerrilla war would engulf her family, refugees to this poverty-stricken village along with dozens of others. But the death of the outwardly happy girl continues to confound her parents and the leaders of a once-sheltered indigenous tribe, the Embera, who never before knew suicide.
 ''When it happened, I thought it was the conflict,'' said Marino Salazar, 33, Leida's father, sitting on a stool next to the room where his daughter died. ''But there are other children who can continue to stand it.'' 
 The Embera and three related tribes, the Wounaan, the Katio and the Chami, who hunt and fish in this northern swath of thick rain forests and limitless waterways, have helplessly watched as 15 young people, many of them girls barely out of puberty, have committed suicide since March 2003.
 With barely 3,000 people in the tribes the yearlong spate of deaths adds up to a suicide rate of 500 per 100,000 people. The overall suicide rate in Colombia was 4.4 per 100,000 in 2003, according to government statistics.
 ''For us, for one to die is like losing 100,'' said Victor Carpio, a Wounaan leader.
 Colombia's 40-year conflict, pitting rebels against right-wing death squads and state security forces, is an easy culprit. But it is not the only one. Encroaching modernity, from logging to settlements, threaten the Emberas, who worry that their whipsawed young are losing the indigenous identity at the root of the tribe's existence.
 More troubling still is how to deal with a plague -- psychiatrists call it a suicide epidemic -- in a clan of hunter-gatherers who have little understanding of the complexities of mental disorders and their ramifications, including suicide.
 ''It is a mystery and of terrible concern to us,'' said Jorge Alzate, who works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the region. ''The problem is trying to determine exactly why.''
 The U.N. refugee agency, which has long aided the displaced here, has embarked on an assistance program to help stem the deaths. Financing is funneled to the Embera's shamans, known as jaibanas (pronounced hie-bah-NAHS), so they can reach nearly inaccessible hamlets by motorboat to conduct rituals. Teachers have been trained to nurture students and to spot trouble signs in young people scarred by war.
 Embera leaders have gone further, asking for help from mental health professionals.
 But sending a team of outsiders into this dangerous region is harder than it sounds. Colombia has no psychologists trained to deal with indigenous groups like the Embera, with many members who barely speak Spanish and have no experience with Western forms of therapy.
 Tiziana Clerico, a United Nations communications officer who is a psychologist by training, also said it was unclear if the inhabitants of remote villages would accept treatment. ''Here, the idea may sound fine,'' said Ms. Clerico, minutes after holding a meeting with several Embera women in Riosucio, a mostly Afro-Colombian village here in the Choco Province. ''But it could be different out in the reservations.''
 What everyone does agree on is that the stakes could not be higher. Embera leaders say that as many as 25 other young people have tried to commit suicide, generating intense fears in isolated communities that bad spirits, in essence the unburied souls of the war dead, are possessing the young. 
 Suicide is rare in Latin American Indian tribes that are intact and thriving. But in the United States, Canada and in a few tribes in Latin America, suicide rates have risen among tribes caught in the vise-grip of the modern world, fighting for survival. 
 In Brazil, the Kaiowa, with some 30,000 people, have seen hundreds of young people take their lives in the last two decades as the tribe has fought to keep loggers and farmers off its land.
 In Colombia, the Guambianos in the southwest suffered a spate of suicides in the 1970's, with several young people drinking poison. And in 1997, the Uwa, near the Venezuelan border, drew worldwide attention when they threatened mass suicide in a successful protest to stop oil production.
 ''These are groups that are facing a very bleak future,'' said Jeanne Jackson, a medical anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has been studying Colombia's Indians since 1968. ''And the response is not just migrating to urban areas and disappearing, but it's something much more pathological.''
 Suicide is, of course, related to mental disorders like depression and substance abuse, said Dr. David Brent, an adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. But cultural disintegration and transition can erode traditional supports and values that affect parents' skills in raising children, self-esteem and hope for the future, which in turn can precipitate these type of problems, Dr. Brent said.
 Although the literature on suicide in Latin American tribes is scant, Dr. David Shaffer, a professor of psychiatry at Colombia and an expert on adolescent suicide, said there were parallels between the Embera deaths and the cases of multiple suicides he has studied in the United States.
 Once the first suicide or two takes place, receiving widespread attention, what was once seen as unacceptable behavior can become an option for other teenagers who are troubled for one reason or another, or who are depressed, Dr. Shaffer said.
 The Embera, whose existence once revolved around the hunt for monkeys, deer and other game that filled the rain forest, have seen their lives inexorably altered.
 In a five-day tour, Indians here in Riosucio -- a honky-tonk town increasingly home to displaced Emberas -- and in two secluded Embera hamlets spoke about the pressures on their communities and the deaths that resulted.
 Some say that the idea of suicide might have begun after four young Indians from an adjacent tribe, the Arquia, committed suicide between 1998 and 2000. Then, on a December day in 2001, Nelson Guaseruca, who was in his 20's and lived in the Embera's most important hamlet, Union Embera, walked into the woods with his hunting rifle and shot himself. The death, apparently spurred by the death of his wife, introduced the tribe to suicide, village elders said.
 On March 15, 2003, a 12-year-old Embera girl hanged herself.
 The deaths continued throughout 2003 and 2004. The last suicide occurred in April, but indigenous leaders say that others have since attempted to kill themselves, only to be saved by relatives.
 Carmen Casama, 19, recounted how she had felt that ''something had taken a hold of me,'' prompting her to try hanging herself from a tree. Her husband found her unconscious and untied her. Another girl, Yarledys Tocamo, 14, was found tying a noose. 
 ''She had some sort of attack,'' her mother, Luz Angela Velasquez, said. ''She screamed. She acted like someone was going to take her. Others were not so fortunate.''
 Marvilia Marmolejo lost two of her children to suicide, Ketty Salazar, 15, and Yuber Salazar, 18. ''I did not think this could ever happen,'' she said, as a group of other concerned parents listened. ''This had never happened around here before.''
 In an insular jungle community like Union Embera -- the village has 380 people and has had 5 suicides -- the deaths are often attributed to supernatural forces.
 ''She was fine, but then she fell in love with a witch,'' Jose Dojirama, 45, said of his sister, Rosa Elena Jumi, 17, who hanged herself in April in Union Embera. ''She treated him badly, so he said to her, O.K., but you'll get it in the end.''
 But indigenous leaders, with one foot in modern Colombia, acknowledge that conflict, poverty and desperation play a role.
 ''The jaibanas say its the spirits, but looking at it all, it could be the violence, too,'' said Arinson Salazar, 38, governor of Union Embera. 
 What is clear is that the Embera have been squeezed in the last 20 years, their world grown tighter. Settlers have depleted the jungles of animals, like the tapir, that the Embera once hunted, forcing the once-nomadic tribe to form permanent communities. They turned to farming, which they have yet to master.
 Guerrillas and paramilitaries have brought more disorder, recruiting young members of the tribe. The vast river ways that the Embera and other tribes fish have become transit zones for cocaine and arms smuggling. Hundreds of Indians have been displaced by war, and 30 Embera have been killed since 1996.
 The army, to shut off supplies to guerrillas, limits the amount of food that can be moved into regions where the Embera live, leading to shortages.
 Displaced or pushed by economic need, young people have left their villages to face a world in which they cannot compete, said Ciro Pineda, an anthropologist who has lived in Choco for 20 years. Many young Embera do not speak Spanish well, and cannot read or write. Entering the larger world, they become quickly and painfully aware of their inabilities.
 ''They feel so lost that some say, 'I'll kill myself,''' said Mr. Pineda. ''They feel small. They lose self-esteem.''
 The question now facing the tribe is how to prevent more deaths. Many of the Emberas are certain that another round of suicides is coming. After all, the shaman, the jaibanas, have been predicting it.
 Delia Casama, 53, an Embera who with United Nations financing is meeting with youths to talk about their lives, said the focus must be on emphasizing the good. ''We want to take away that idea they have, that I don't want to live,'' she said.
 In Riosucio, in his simple wood-frame home, Marino Salazar is still stumped. His daughter Leida seemed happy, he recalled, holding a picture of a smiling girl in a green dress and pink shirt.
 Still, he added, he has moved on, for the sake of his other four children. He watches over them closely. 
 ''What else can I do?'' he said. ''I just try to talk to my other kids.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Costs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Increasing incentives and competition are not magic potions to control health care costs (Economic Scene, Nov. 18). 
 Independent studies in a number of states have demonstrated that a single-payer system would cover everyone and eliminate the wasteful profits and administrative costs of the middlemen that plague our current system. 
 When large corporations begin to see a single-payer system as the means by which they can be relieved of providing health care for their employees and thereby be more globally competitive, the political imperative for Medicare for all will be overwhelming.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Delays Delivery of 54 Jets

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
American Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, has delayed the deliveries of 54 planes from the Boeing Company to save $2.7 billion in spending over the next six years. 
 The agreement with Boeing lets American, which has lost $6.9 billion since the end of 2000, delay the deliveries for as long as seven years, the airline said yesterday in a statement. They were set for delivery from 2006 through 2010. American's action included all except two aircraft that Boeing was to deliver in the period. 
 American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, is trying to cut costs to stem losses and compete with low-cost carriers as airline industry capacity exceeds demand. American, based in Fort Worth, said last month that it had canceled orders for 18 jets that were to be delivered to its regional airline, American Eagle, in 2005 and 2006.
 ''They clearly are not in a position where they want to be adding capacity or taking on the obligations for new airplanes,'' said Daniel Kasper, an airline economist with the consulting firm LECG in Cambridge, Mass. ''It's a positive step.''
 American's chief financial officer, James A. Beer, said in the statement that the delay would ''substantially enhance our ability to restructure our finances.'' Mr. Beer said on Nov. 3 that the two companies were close to an agreement on the delayed delivery of 47 of Boeing's 737-800's and 7 of its 777's.
 Major airlines are trying to reduce costs by cutting jobs, wages and benefits, sending more work to outside contractors, delaying aircraft orders and renegotiating leases of planes and contracts with suppliers. They have stepped up efforts to reduce expenses this year amid record fuel prices and growing competition from low-cost rivals.
 The 10 biggest airlines in the United States are expected to report combined losses of as much as $8 billion this year, after more than $20 billion in losses since 2001, according to the Air Transport Association trade group. United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and the US Airways Group are in bankruptcy protection, and Delta Air Lines earlier this month won $1 billion in wage and benefit concessions from pilots as it tries to avoid a filing.
 David Strauss, a UBS analyst in New York, wrote in a report to investors that American's delay ''confirms what continues to be a difficult environment for the U.S. majors and validates that the U.S. majors are unlikely to order, let alone take delivery of, significant aircraft over the near term.'' The agreement with American was expected and is included in Boeing's financial forecasts, said Nicolaas W. Groeneveld-Meijer, a spokesman for the aircraft manufacturer, which is based in Chicago. 
 Shares of AMR fell 14 cents to $8.76; Boeing's stock rose 20 cents, to $53.97.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:

FLYING CHEAPER -- Companies in the United States are paying the lowest average air fares for their employees since 1999, according to data from Eclipse Advisors, an American Express subsidiary that compiles a survey called the Business Travel Monitor. The reason is the intensifying competition between low-cost carriers and major carriers, and its pressure on popular routes, Eclipse said. The average one-way fare paid for a business trip on a basket of domestic routes studied by researchers was $217 in the third quarter, down 10 percent from the period a year earlier. Philadelphia provides one example of the impact of low-cost carriers; Southwest Airlines started operating there in May against US Airways. In the third quarter, the average fare for a business trip in Philadelphia fell 40 percent.

RECORD TRAFFIC -- While fares stay low, domestic airlines are projected to carry a record 685 million passengers this year, while losing as much as $8 billion, according to industry data. ''Even with all those extra passengers, the airlines just haven't been able to break back into profitability, mainly because fuel prices are killing them,'' said David Swierenga, an economist who runs the consulting firm AeroEcon. The previous passenger traffic record was in 2000, when domestic airlines carried 666.1 million customers. That number fell to 622.2 million in 2001 and dropped again to 612.9 million in 2002 before beginning a recovery last year, when 646.5 million passengers flew on carriers based in the United States, according to the Air Transport Association.

MINE'S FASTER -- At a certain niche in the corporate jet world, speed is considered the ultimate luxury. Flexjet, which sells partial ownerships of the jets it operates, recently claimed a certified world speed record for one of its aircraft, a Challenger 300, which took 4 hours and 41 minutes to get from Carlsbad, Calif., to Bangor, Me., carrying eight passengers at an average speed of 572 miles an hour. Not so fast, responded the Cessna Aircraft Company, which sells the Citation X, an aircraft that also carries about eight passengers and has long been regarded as the swiftest corporate jet of them all. The Citation X is rated at a top speed of Mach 0.92, while the Challenger 300 is rated at Mach 0.82. ''The Challenger 300 could have set a world record for that specific flight'' between those two points,'' said Jessica Myers, a Cessna spokeswoman. ''Just as the Challenger 300, the Citation X has also set many world records. The Citation X is the fastest nonmilitary jet in the world. It travels at 0.92 Mach, or over 600 m.p.h.'' JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: AMERICANS SHOW CLEAR CONCERNS ON BUSH AGENDA

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
After enduring a brutally fought election campaign, Americans are optimistic about the next four years under President Bush, but have reservations about central elements of the second-term agenda he presented in defeating Senator John Kerry, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 At a time when the White House has portrayed Mr. Bush's 3.5-million-vote victory as a mandate, the poll found that Americans are at best ambivalent about Mr. Bush's plans to reshape Social Security, rewrite the tax code, cut taxes and appoint conservative judges to the bench. There is continuing disapproval of Mr. Bush's handling of the war in Iraq, with a plurality now saying it was a mistake to invade in the first place.
 While Democrats, not surprisingly, were the staunchest opponents of many elements of Mr. Bush's second-term agenda, the concerns extended across party lines in some cases. Nearly two-thirds of all respondents -- including 51 percent of Republicans -- said it was more important to reduce deficits than to cut taxes, a central element of Mr. Bush's economic agenda. 
 The poll also found pervasive concern about what Americans view as the corrosive effect Hollywood and popular culture have on the nation's values and moral standards. Seventy percent said they were very or somewhat concerned that television, movies and popular music were lowering moral standards in this country.
 While this sentiment was voiced by supporters of Mr. Bush and of Mr. Kerry, it appears that the concern about a decline in values is becoming another point of polarization in American politics. Mr. Bush's supporters were more likely to cite it than were Mr. Kerry's voters, and it was an issue that had particular resonance in the South and among weekly churchgoers, rural voters and women.
 The poll found that 55 percent of Mr. Kerry's supporters said that Mr. Bush's supporters did not share their views and morals; 54 percent of Mr. Bush's voters said the same thing of those who voted for Mr. Kerry.
 In addition, 70 percent of Mr. Kerry's supporters said they were more worried about candidates who ''are too close to religion and religious leaders'' than about political leaders who ''don't pay enough attention'' to religion, after a campaign in which Mr. Bush repeatedly spoke of God and his faith. By contrast, 52 percent of Mr. Bush's supporters said they were more worried about public officials who ''don't pay enough attention to religion and religious leaders.''
 Still, in a telling contrast with the 2000 election, 82 percent of respondents said that Mr. Bush legitimately won on Nov. 2. Just before Election Day, 50 percent of respondents said they considered Mr. Bush's defeat of Al Gore in 2000 a legitimate victory.
 And even after this tense and vituperative campaign, 56 percent said they were generally optimistic about the next four years under Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush's job approval rating has now inched up to 51 percent, the highest it has been since March.
 The Times/CBS News poll was taken from Thursday through Sunday, after a three-week period in which some pollsters questioned some findings of the survey of voters leaving polling places on Election Day. The nationwide telephone poll of 855 adults has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 The poll reflected the electoral feat of the Bush campaign this year. He won despite the fact that Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs and the war in Iraq. There has been a slight increase in the number of Americans who believe the nation should never have gone into Iraq. A majority of Americans continue to believe the country is going in the wrong direction, traditionally a warning sign for an incumbent.
 Across the board, the poll suggested that the outcome of the election reflected a determination by Americans that they trusted Mr. Bush more to protect them against future terrorist attacks -- and that they liked him more than Mr. Kerry -- rather than any kind of broad affirmation of his policies. As such, the result was reminiscent of the state of play Ronald Reagan found in 1980, when he defeated President Jimmy Carter.
 Even as two-thirds of respondents said they expected Mr. Bush to appoint judges who would vote to outlaw abortion, a majority continue to say they want the practice to remain either legal as it is now, which was Mr. Kerry's position, or to be legal but under stricter limits.
 Americans said they opposed changing the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, which Mr. Bush campaigned on in the final weeks of his campaign. A majority continue to support allowing either same-sex marriages or legally recognized domestic partnerships for gay people.
 The public appears ambivalent about the two proposals that Mr. Bush has identified as his major domestic initiatives for a second term: rewriting the Social Security system and reshaping the tax code, including more tax cuts. 
 On the tax code, administration officials are discussing plans that would, among other things, lower the tax rate on higher-income Americans and eliminate some deductions. In the poll, more than 6 in 10 of the respondents said people with higher incomes should pay a greater proportion of their income in taxes; 3 in 10 said all income groups should pay the same proportion.
 About one-third of the respondents said the tax cuts passed in Mr. Bush's first term had been good for the economy; but nearly a fifth said they had done more harm, and just under half said the tax cuts had made little difference. 
 ''I don't mind cutting taxes to some extent, but I think we've cut them quite a bit,'' Ron Clark, 63, a Republican from Livingston, Mont., said in a follow-up interview. ''I'm not really against making the current reductions permanent, but I don't think we need to go beyond where we've gone, because I do worry about the deficit. It's gone up a heck of a lot in the last couple of years.''
 On Social Security, 45 percent said a proposal to permit people to invest their Social Security withholding money in private accounts was a bad idea; 49 percent said it was a good idea. The poll also found little confidence among Americans that Mr. Bush would assure the future solvency of the program: 51 percent said that Mr. Bush was unlikely to ''make sure Social Security benefits are there for people like me.''
 Among the disputed results of the Election Day survey of voters was the finding that moral issues were critical in determining the outcome. 
 That survey found that 22 percent of respondents called it the most critical issue in making their decision. Some pollsters criticized the way the question was asked because it was presented as a general category, without any kind of explanation, along with a list of six other specific issues, including Iraq and health care.
 In this poll, when allowed freely to name the issue that was most important in their vote, 6 percent chose moral values, although smaller numbers named issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. On a separate question in which voters were given a choice of nine issues, 5 percent chose abortion, 4 percent chose stem cell research and 2 percent chose same-sex marriage.
 The top issue was the economy and jobs, which was cited by 29 percent of respondents.
 That said, there is a little question that Americans have grown increasingly unhappy with the influence of popular culture on daily life, and that was a significant dynamic in this election. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that Hollywood was lowering the standard of popular culture. And 70 percent said that all popular culture -- music, movies and television -- was lowering moral standards in America.
 The poll also found, though, that Americans were evenly divided on whether television, movies and books were including too many gay themes and characters.
 The poll and follow-up interviews found that Bush supporters and Kerry supporters were in different camps on these issues, eyeing each other with suspicion. 
 ''I think they're driven by hatred and homophobia and vitriol,'' said Paul Cuthbertson, 53, a Democrat from Atlanta. ''The Republicans in recent years have turned 'liberal' into a dirty word, which it isn't. I'm a liberal and proud to be so. This so-called Christian ideal of being against gay marriage is neither American nor Christian. I think it's un-American to discriminate against fellow citizens, and God does not call upon Christians to be vigilantes to punish people that they perceive him not to like.'' 
 Pat Gilbert, a Republican from Battle Creek, Mich., said, ''The two sides will be as far apart as can be forever.'' 
 ''I'm sure there are different pockets of voters who voted for Kerry, but I think they believe more in society in general -- if you're not hurting anybody it's all right to do it,'' Ms. Gilbert said, adding: ''I don't think they have a firm belief system that they base decisions off of. It's whatever today's climate is. In the long term, you'll have a society of chaos.''
 By 48 percent to 40 percent, respondents said they believed four more years of a Bush presidency would divide the nation more than it would unite it.
 For all the attention paid to the effort Mr. Bush made to increase his support from religious supporters, 31 percent of respondents said they thought that evangelical Christians had too much influence over the administration. By contrast, 66 percent said they thought big business had too much influence over the administration. 
 Finally, in one bit of presumably good news for a party that is looking for it, Americans now have a better opinion of the Democratic Party than of the Republican Party: 54 percent said they had a favorable view of Democrats, compared with 39 percent with an unfavorable view. By contrast, 49 percent have a favorable view of Republicans, compared with 46 percent holding an unfavorable one.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Colombia, Promises More Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and JUAN FORERO; David E. Sanger reported from Cartagena for this article, and Juan Forero from Bogota.

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush stopped Monday in one of the less discussed corners of the American battle with terrorists, promising President Alvaro Uribe that he would push Congress to add to the more than $3.3 billion that Washington has spent since 2000 to destroy coca crops and support Colombia's battle against Marxist rebels.
 ''This man's plan is working,'' Mr. Bush said, pointing to Mr. Uribe, who since taking office in 2002 has become the American president's closest ally in Latin America. 
 At a joint news conference in this port city, Mr. Bush cited the reduction in terror attacks, homicides and the production of drug crops as evidence that American aid, coupled with Mr. Uribe's steady hand, is helping Colombia turn the corner in its four-decade, drug-fueled conflict.
 ''My nation will continue to help Colombia prevail in this vital struggle,'' Mr. Bush said.
 The four-hour visit was an addition to Mr. Bush's trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Chile over the weekend. 
 It was proposed by Mr. Uribe during a congratulatory call to Mr. Bush after he won re-election earlier this month, and was rich with symbolism for the Colombian leader. 
 While not mentioned publicly by Mr. Bush during his visit, the United States backs efforts to amend the Constitution to permit Mr. Uribe to run for a second term when his four-year presidency ends in 2006, a change expected to win support in Colombia's Congress. 
 Mr. Uribe's strategy over the past two years has been to fight Colombia's most powerful guerrilla force while co-opting the rebels' main adversary, a 15,000-man paramilitary organization, into disarming through negotiations. Both have been labeled terrorist organizations by the State Department.
 The visit gave Mr. Bush a chance to trumpet what the United States considers successes in a bruising, if little understood, war just a three-hour flight from Miami. It allowed him to do so with a reliable ally in a region where anti-American sentiment is rife and which the Bush administration has largely ignored since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''For Bush, what matters is friendship and loyalty, and in Uribe he has a loyal friend, and there aren't many others in Latin America,'' said Michael Shifter, a senior analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group that tracks the region. 
 ''Bush doesn't have a lot to show in terms of Latin American policy, but Colombia can be seen as a relative success story,'' Mr. Shifter added. ''It's a place where the United States has put a lot of money, and there are some positive signs.''
 But while an American-backed defoliation campaign has halved the acreage of Colombian land devoted to growing coca, the plant used to make cocaine, the eradication has not made a discernible difference on American streets, as Washington's drug warriors had promised. 
 Coca has instead spread from 12 to 23 Colombian states, which has made destruction of the crop increasingly difficult, said Ricardo Vargas, director of Andean Action, a Colombian policy group that monitors antidrug efforts. 
 ''We are still going round and round here in Colombia,'' Mr. Vargas said. ''So the question is how sustainable this fumigation can be.''
 Also troubling to some American members of Congress, the United Nations and human rights groups is Mr. Uribe's approach to disarming the paramilitaries of the United Self-Defense Forces, which exert great influence in much of northern Colombia.
 It is a cornerstone of Mr. Uribe's effort to bring peace to this country, twice the size of France, with 44 million people. Critics say the Uribe government is pushing for an accord that would lead to demobilization but offer scant punishment for paramilitary commanders accused of atrocities and cocaine trafficking.
 To compound the problems, Mr. Uribe's government also has to protect its southern flank, where the country's biggest Marxist rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been relatively quiet in the face of aggressive army offensives but remains potent.
 Wearing a Caribbean-style guayabera shirt, Mr. Uribe made it clear he had a lot of work to do.
 ''While the Colombian people fight for growth, employment and social justice,'' he said, ''terrorism has halted our economy, it has made poverty more acute, and produced internal displacement and a stampede toward other countries.''
 Colombia's government, though, offers a largely optimistic future, noting that the economy may expand by as much as 5 percent this year, one of the highest growth rates in Latin America. Mr. Uribe's administration is now hoping to sign a free trade accord with the United States that the countries say will enhance commerce between them, now valued at $11.2 billion.
 After Mr. Bush left for Washington, Mr. Uribe took the unusual step of wandering through the military officers-club-turned media center for White House reporters, encouraging them to write about Colombia as a tourist destination. 
 He wore a Boston Red Sox cap, in honor of Orlando Cabrera, the team's Colombian-born shortstop, who had also greeted Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Big Spending Bill Makes a Winner of Mars Program but Many Losers Elsewhere

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM; Reporting for this article was contributed by Edmund L. Andrews, Elizabeth Becker, Robert Pear and Diana Jean Schemo.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush uttered hardly a word during his re-election campaign about his proposal to send a man to Mars, but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its moon-to-Mars program were big winners in the $388 billion spending bill that Congress approved over the weekend.
 In fact, NASA was such a priority that the increase of $822 million to its budget prompted deeper cuts in other agencies.
 Before the NASA increase, the spending bill already provided for an across-the-board cut, for each domestic agency, of 0.75 percent from what Congress had planned to spend in the new fiscal year, budget aides said. Once the NASA money was added, the across-the-board cuts were raised to 0.8 percent.
 The president had actually asked for $44 million more for NASA than Congress gave him. But in broad outlines, the bill, which brought together nine appropriations measures that Congress failed to pass before the Nov. 2 election, adhered largely to Mr. Bush's wishes. 
 Details of the 1,690-page bill, which was rushed to passage over the weekend, were only beginning to come to light on Monday. Some agencies, like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, received more than the White House had wanted. Others, like the Internal Revenue Service, wound up with substantially less.
 In the end, administration and Congressional budget analysts expect, domestic discretionary spending will increase about 1 percent in the 2005 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, and will decline slightly after adjusting for inflation. The effect of inflation is concrete, because Congress approved a 3.5 percent pay increase for federal employees. That is likely to mean additional cuts in programs for labor-intensive agencies, like the I.R.S. and the Environmental Protection Agency.
 But for all the intense fighting over specific agencies and programs, the most striking feature of the new bill is how little it affects the budget deficit, which climbed to $412 billion in 2004. Mr. Bush promised during the campaign to cut the federal deficit in half by the end of his term.
 More than 80 percent of the budget was shielded from cuts. Two-thirds of the $2.4 trillion budget is in mandatory spending that includes interest payments on the national debt and financing of entitlement benefits like Social Security and Medicare. An additional 20 percent is consumed by spending on the military and domestic security.
 The total amount approved for all discretionary programs, including the military and domestic security, is to be about $891 billion, some 4 percent higher than in 2004.
 Military spending is likely to climb by well over 10 percent in 2005, to more than $500 billion, if war costs for Iraq are included.
 In discretionary domestic spending, Congress made some substantial increases, like allocating a total of $2.3 billion for the global fight against H.I.V. and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. This is $99 million more than the president requested and $690 million more than last year.
 Another significant allocation was $403 million in humanitarian and refugee assistance for Sudan, including $93 million as an emergency appropriation. Congress had already provided $95 million earlier this year.

Health Programs
 For the National Institutes of Health, whose budget doubled from 1998 to 2003, Congress approved an increase of 2.1 percent, to $28.4 billion. That is the smallest percentage increase in more than 15 years, Congressional aides said. The institutes finance a wide range of biomedical research.
 Anthony J. Mazzaschi, senior associate vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said, ''That's a lot of money, but it's a little disappointing given what the president requested,'' which was an increase of 2.7 percent.
 Community health centers, a high priority for President Bush, will receive $1.7 billion, an increase of $130 million from 2004. Congressional aides said that was not only less than what the House and the Senate had originally wanted but also less than the president had requested.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will receive $4.5 billion, an increase of about 4 percent over last year and more than the president requested.
 The bill provides $105 million for abstinence education programs, an increase of $29 million over the 2004 level.

Low-Income Assistance
 Advocates of more federal aid for the poor had hoped Congress would reallocate to the state children's health insurance program $1 billion that for one reason or another went unspent in the last fiscal year.
 But the bill did not provide for the reallocation. As a consequence, enrollment in the program, for low-income children, may drop by as many as 200,000 children nationwide, according to calculations by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute that advocates more spending on antipoverty programs.
 Nutrition aid for poor families and rental assistance for the poor received modest increases in allotments, but some other programs for the poor were cut.
 The nutrition program for women, infants and children, called WIC, received its largest budget ever, $5.2 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the last fiscal year. Experts said this should be sufficient to serve the eight million families that are expected to apply for aid.
 Congress approved $20 billion, about $1.5 billion more than Mr. Bush requested and almost $1 billion more than last year, for the Section 8 housing program, which helps poor people meet their rent payments and is the government's largest housing program.
 The lawmakers did not accept the administration's proposal to convert the program into a block grant to states with a $1 billion cut in financing.
 Several smaller housing programs for the poor were cut somewhat, including those for public housing, housing for people with disabilities, housing for the elderly and homeless assistance grants.
 The Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program was allocated an increase of more than 15 percent, to $2.2 billion this year from $1.9 billion last year. But the increase in the program, which helps poor people meet their winter home-heating costs, lags far behind increases in fuel prices. Heating oil is expected to be 38 percent more expensive this winter than last, and overall fuel costs for heating are expected to be 24 percent more.
 Head Start, which provides a wide range of services to preschool children, will receive $6.8 billion, about 1 percent more than last year.

Agriculture
 The new budget cuts more than $1 billion from agricultural conservation and rural development programs that were part of the 2002 farm bill. But lawmakers left intact the program that is estimated to pay $16.4 billion in subsidies to farmers to grow basic crops like corn and wheat. That program has been criticized as favoring the nation's wealthiest farmers and agribusinesses, and is being challenged under international trade laws.
 In a reflection of a growing need among the working poor, demonstrated in lengthening lines at food banks and pantries, Congress approved an increase of nearly $1.5 billion in the food stamp program.
 Among the biggest cuts in conservation programs were $142 million taken from the program to protect wetlands and a $38 million reduction that pared by nearly half a program to protect wildlife habitat.
 ''The subsidies are an important safety net, but we are disappointed in cuts to conservation programs,'' said Matthew Hartwig, an aide to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.

Environment
 Congress cut spending for the Environmental Protection Agency. The biggest cut is to the fund that helps state and local governments maintain water-quality programs; Congress provided more money than the president had asked for, but 20 percent below last year's level. 
 The bill also rejected a proposal from the Senate to spend $30 million to help communities meet new standards for arsenic in drinking water.
 Congress included language that will allow snowmobilers to continue to ride in Yellowstone National Park this winter. Ever since the Clinton administration tried to ban snowmobiles in the park, there have been a flurry of rulings and vast confusion over the policy, prompting a decline in snowmobilers there and resulting pain for local businesses.
 Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, wanted to assure snowmobilers and the businesses that even if new rulings were issued, the park would still allow up to 720 snowmobilers a day, as long as they traveled with commercial guides and their machines met the latest standards for air pollution. The language affects only the 2004-5 winter season.
 Congress refused to divert money to one of the White House's priorities on so-called clean coal, FuturGen, a coal-fired power plant that would produce zero emissions.
 The bill provides financing for a Flight 93 National Memorial, in Pennsylvania, where one of the hijacked planes crashed on Sept. 11, 2001.
 It also extends by 10 years the federal government's authority to charge fees on Park Service and Forest Service land. A demonstration project is now under way in which such fees are charged, but critics, including many Republicans, have questioned them and how the proceeds are spent.
 Congress rejected a proposal that would have allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to approve pesticides without having to consider their effect on endangered species.

Education
 The bill puts the brakes on large increases for high-poverty schools and disabled children that marked the first Bush term and were part of the president's signature education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act. 
 Spending on poverty-stricken schools, which had been increasing by roughly $1 billion a year during Mr. Bush's first term, will rise by only $400 million this year. Federal financing of special education, which covers more than 6.5 million disabled children, will increase by $520 million, which is $480 million less than the president requested.
 The bill leaves the maximum Pell grant unchanged, at $4,050; a $355 million increase in spending that Congress approved will go to cover an existing shortfall in the Pell program.
 In addition, the bill dropped a provision that would have barred the Education Department from revising a formula for calculating financial assistance. As a result, nearly 100,000 fewer students will receive Pell grants, according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, which was created by Congress to advise it on student aid.

Government Waste
 While overall spending was kept in check, citizens' watchdog groups said the bill included millions of dollars' worth of pet projects for individual lawmakers.
 The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste cited a lengthy list of such items, including $1.5 million for a demonstration project to transport naturally chilled water from Lake Ontario to Lake Onondaga; $500,000 for the Kincaid Park Soccer and Nordic Ski Center in Anchorage; $250,000 for the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville; $80,000 for the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in San Diego; and $75,000 for the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame in Appleton, Wis.

HEADLINE: A Decline in Oil Prices Spurs a Late Rally in Share Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A drop in oil prices spurred an afternoon stock rally yesterday, bringing investors back into the market despite lingering concerns over the strength of the dollar and the nation's trade deficit.
 Stocks opened lower on fears that the economy could slow further. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned on Friday that the budget and trade deficits were causing undue pressure on the dollar and the economy. Those concerns weighed heavily on Wall Street on Friday, prompting a 115-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 But investors were cheered yesterday afternoon as oil prices fell slightly, and used the dip as an excuse to continue buying stocks, analysts said. A barrel of light crude settled at $48.64, down 25 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 ''I think this is a market that really wants to go up,'' said Michael Murphy, head trader at Wachovia Securities in Baltimore. ''Yes, we're worried about the dollar, but it was down for weeks and nobody paid attention until Greenspan said something.''
 The Dow rose 32.51, or 0.3 percent, to 10,489.42. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 6.90, or 0.6 percent, at 1,177.24, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 14.56, or 0.7 percent, to 2,085.19.
 Prompted by Mr. Greenspan's comments last week, investors worried that a free-falling dollar, which has been setting record lows in recent weeks, could harm the flow of foreign investment into American stocks and bonds. The dollar was little changed yesterday against the euro and the Japanese yen.
 Thanksgiving week has traditionally been a strong time for stocks, despite light volume.
 Oracle slipped 7 cents, to $12.68, after PeopleSoft's board said Oracle's $24-a-share takeover bid remained inadequate, setting the stage for a bruising takeover battle. PeopleSoft rose 19 cents, to $23.36.
 The board of Mylan Laboratories, a generic drug maker, rejected a $5.4 billion offer by Carl C. Icahn to purchase the company, calling it a ''self-serving'' effort to intimidate the company as it prepares to purchase King Pharmaceuticals. Mylan skidded 23 cents, to $18.65, but regained 14 cents in after-hours trading. King, meanwhile, climbed 14 cents, to $11.29.
 Apple Computer rose after a Piper Jaffray analyst, Gene Munster, nearly doubled his price target on the stock to $100 a share. Mr. Munster said customer satisfaction with the iPod music player was helping Apple sell Mac computers and other products. Shares of Apple jumped $6.18, or 11 percent, to close at $61.35.
 Google fell $4.30, to $165.10, as the company's founders and top executives filed plans to sell 16.6 million shares over the next 18 months, unnerving investors who fear an influx of stock could hurt the share price. 
 Krispy Kreme Doughnuts swung to a loss in the third quarter, though it managed an operating profit of 4 cents a share excluding one-time costs. Wall Street had expected earnings of 13 cents a share. Krispy Kreme was down $1.86, or 16.2 percent, at $9.64.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where preliminary consolidated volume came to 1.76 billion shares, compared with 1.92 billion on Friday.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 8/32, to a price of 100 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.18 percent from 4.2 percent on Thursday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Ukraine: Looking for a Fair Vote Count

 BODY:
The choice facing Ukrainian voters on Sunday, in the second round of their presidential election, was about as clear as choices get: East or West. In the shorthand of the race, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich was pro-Russian, and his opponent, Viktor Yushchenko, the head of the opposition and a former prime minister, was pro-Western. President Vladimir Putin of Russia openly threw his support to Mr. Yanukovich, and the West not quite so openly threw its weight behind Mr. Yushchenko. But the outcome of the election seemed less important than how fairly it was conducted. If a nation as sharply divided and as strategically important as Ukraine showed it could handle a hard choice, wouldn't democracy throughout the former Soviet empire benefit? 
 It was not to be. Ukraine last night was in a state of upheaval, after preliminary vote counts indicated that Mr. Yanukovich won the race narrowly. But international observers described widespread voting abuses, and Mr. Yushchenko refused to accept official results. Mr. Yushchenko's supporters turned out by the thousands in Independence Square in Kiev claiming that the election was rigged and vowing to demonstrate until results were released reflecting the will of the people.
 Mr. Yushchenko's supporters had plenty of backup from international observers. In a joint statement, officials from NATO, the European Parliament and the Council of Europe criticized the fairness of the election. Separately, Senator Richard Lugar, visiting Ukraine to observe the elections, called the polling a ''concerted and forceful program of election day fraud and abuse.''
 The campaign was passionate. Mr. Yanukovich was openly supported by the outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma, whose 10-year tenure has been marked by extensive corruption and scandal. Mr. Yushchenko's followers accused the government of exploiting its control of the media, and, after Mr. Yushchenko fell violently ill, they even accused the government of poisoning him. 
 Mr. Yanukovich, for his part, was aided by an upturn in the economy and garnered strong support in eastern Ukraine with promises to make Russian a second official language. In the West, commentaries depicted the contest as a fateful clash between Western democracy and Putinesque authoritarianism; in Russia, it was depicted as a rebuff to Western encroachment.
 In fact, neither candidate would likely be so absolute. Ukraine's relations with Russia are determined by hard realities. Mr. Yushchenko has no alternative to Russian energy; Mr. Yanukovich, like his mentor Mr. Kuchma, would likely continue to seek the good will and investment of the West. 
 Mr. Putin would do well to prod his Ukrainian friends to heed Senator Lugar's call for a review of the poll results. It is a pity that the Bush administration has apparently decided it won't push Mr. Putin any further. This election should not lead to an even greater divide within Ukraine. What Ukrainians need now is to shape their institutions and democratic habits to get to civil reform peacefully.

HEADLINE: PREMIER CLAIMS HE'S THE WINNER IN UKRAINE VOTE

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Ukraine approached a political stalemate on Monday, as vote counts of the presidential runoff election indicated that Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich had won but international observers alleged systemic voting abuses and the opposition candidate refused to accept defeat.
 With more than 99 percent of ballots counted, the government tally gave Mr. Yanukovich 49.42 percent of the vote to 46.7 percent for Viktor A. Yushchenko, whose supporters turned out in the tens of thousands in Independence Square here, vowing not to move until results were reversed.
 ''To victory!'' said Nina Kovalevskaya, 53, who stood in the cold Monday evening air. ''To our victory!'' 
 With the opposition filling the landmark square, an international election observer mission -- from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Parliament, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Europe -- released a preliminary report that buoyed them, declaring that the election did not meet democratic standards.
 The observers' findings were seconded by Senator Richard G. Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who had led an American mission to Ukraine to urge the departing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, to organize fair elections. 
 ''A concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse was enacted with either the leadership or cooperation of governmental authorities,'' the senator said Monday in Kiev. 
 At stake is not only the prize of the presidency of a nation of nearly 48 million, but also the direction of the overwhelmingly Slavic country during the next five-year presidential term. The outcome will decide whether Ukraine will draw closer to Russia, its historical and cultural partner, or move toward greater economic and military integration with the West. 
 Mr. Yanukovich is the personally selected successor of Mr. Kuchma, a former Soviet technocrat who ruled the country in a centralized fashion for 10 years, amid sometimes tense relations with Washington and allegations of corruption and abuse of power.
 The prime minister has vowed to continue on Mr. Kuchma's course, and to steer the county closer to Moscow. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, telephoned Mr. Yanukovich on Monday from an official visit to Brazil to congratulate him, according to Interfax.
 Mr. Yushchenko, himself a former prime minister, has described the incumbent bloc of state power as crooked and hidebound, and pledged to maintain ties with Russia while encouraging business and expanding Ukraine's relationship westward into Europe. 
 His support in the capital, and among young voters, is palpably high. His campaign -- deprived of equal media coverage and pressured by the resources of the Ukrainian state, according to the reports of international observers -- has adopted the tactics of the underdog.
 The victory for the prime minister, by a margin of nearly 3 percentage points, that was given in official results diverged sharply from a range of surveys of voters at polling places that gave the opposition as much as an 11-point lead. Opposition organizers pushed for protest and mass action. 
 Mr. Yushchenko, addressing the public, began a multipronged effort to block Mr. Yanukovich's claim on office. He urged his supporters to remain united and in the streets, and called for an urgent session of Parliament to review extensive allegations of state manipulation of the election, and for the judiciary to investigate documented complaints. 
 ''We express no confidence in the Central Election Commission because of its being a passive, or maybe a too active, participant in falsifications,'' he said.
 Yulia Tymoshenko, a member of Parliament and one of Mr. Yushchenko's most visible supporters, called for a general strike. 
 Still, even while Mr. Yushchenko supporters tried to force a political confrontation, the state maintained a position of official calm. It appeared to have the upper hand through the crucial first day. The prime minister's once-crowded campaign headquarters declared victory and closed down before lunch. 
 ''We won, and we are going to sleep,'' said Gennady P. Korz, a senior campaign spokesman.
 And while the demonstration grew, the police presence in the capital remained light. State security agencies did release a joint statement saying they were on high alert.
 The findings of the international election mission included abuse of state resources in favor of the prime minister; the addition of about 5 percent of new voters to the rolls on election day; pressure on students to vote for the state's choice; pressure on state workers to turn over absentee ballot forms for presumptive use by someone else; widespread abuse of absentee voters, including some who were bused from region to region; the blocking of poll workers; suspiciously, even fantastically, high turnouts in regions that supported the prime minister; inaccurate voter lists and overt bias of state-financed news media.
 Marek Siwiec, head of the delegation from the European Parliament, said certain electoral abuses ''cast a shadow over the genuineness of the election.''
 Other prominent Western observers were unsparing in their criticism of the state's conduct of the election.
 ''Fundamental flaws in Ukraine's presidential election process subverted its legitimacy,'' the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, sponsored by the Democratic Party in the United States, declared in its preliminary report. The institute, which had an observer mission in Ukraine, cited ''systematic intimidation, overt manipulation and blatant fraud'' that were ''designed to achieve a specific outcome irrespective of the will of the people.'' 
 Many of the same criticisms had been levied against that state during the first round of presidential elections three weeks ago. Mr. Yushchenko narrowly won that round among a field of 24, leading to the two-candidate runoff on Sunday. Because the result on Monday conforms to the state's wish, few expected a significant presidential review.
 Even stronger criticism came from the Dutch foreign minister, Bernard Bot, whose country holds the European Union presidency. ''We don't accept these results. We think they are fraudulent,'' he said at a news briefing, Reuters reported. Mr. Bot said that each of the union's members would call in the Ukrainian ambassadors to their countries to express concern, and that the election would be discussed at a European Union-Russia summit meeting in The Hague on Thursday. 
 Dr. Charles Tannock, a British member of the European Parliament, said the conduct of the election was less what he expected from Ukraine than from Turkmenistan, an authoritarian state. 
 He then worried aloud that what seemed to be the election's illegitimacy might serve to split Ukraine into a north and west supporting Mr. Yushchenko, and a region in the east supporting the prime minister. There were hints of this by nightfall, as Mr. Yushchenko claimed the support of at least four Ukrainian cities, including the city council in Kiev, which rejected the election results.
 As the anxious rally continued through Sunday night to Monday morning, then through Monday, at times the crowd chanted, ''Freedom cannot be stopped!''
 There were signs of careful planning and organization, which suggested the protesters were prepared for a long standoff. Within minutes of the opposition leaders' speeches in the morning, for example, young men set up rows of new tents in the crowd.
 Food quickly appeared, as did blankets, foam mattresses, hats and winter coats. As the work continued, posters were taped to the tents and to some of the protesters' winter coats. They were messages to the police. ''Don't shoot!'' they read. 
 One detail was meant to lift the protesters' spirits. 
 Throughout the rally, young men had been waving white-and-red Georgian flags among the sea of orange banners, a not-so-subtle reminder of the so-called rose revolution of a year ago, when Mikhail Saakashvili deposed President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia, another Soviet-era leader, in a bloodless coup. 
 Mr. Saakashvili was elected to the presidency by a landslide, and has made pushing his country westward and fighting corruption principal elements of his policy. Some in the crowd on Monday spoke openly of the Georgian model of shrugging off a tired state. But they discussed these hopes in a more difficult setting.
 Mr. Kuchma and his supporters have pointedly said there will be no revolution here, and some differences were clear. The Ukrainian economy is stronger than Georgia's, as are its security agencies. Moreover, Ukraine is culturally far more closely bound to Moscow than Georgia had been. 
 Mr. Yanukovich's supporters predicted that they would weather the demonstrations, and said they planned to have an inauguration next month.

Stoppard Out of 'Dark Materials'?
 Has Sir Tom Stoppard been dropped from the movie adaptation of the fantasy series ''His Dark Materials''? Sir Tom, who won an Oscar for his script for ''Shakespeare in Love,'' was hired by New Line Cinema to adapt ''The Golden Compass,'' the first book in Philip Pullman's Tolkienesque (or is that Rowlingesque?) trilogy. He delivered a script a year ago, and said he did not hear anything from New Line until the studio hired a director, Chris Weitz (''American Pie,'' ''About a Boy''), at which point Sir Tom was told to cease any further work on the project. And then silence again. ''They called me and said, 'We're now talking to Chris Weitz and we think we're going to make a deal with him,''' Sir Tom said. '''We don't want you to do any more work on the script and we might come back to you.' And I literally haven't heard, had a postcard or an e-mail since.'' Toby Emmerich, the president of production at New Line, said that as a writer-director Mr. Weitz has special leeway and that he might adapt Sir Tom's script or write his own. ''If we'd hired Robert Zemeckis or Steven Spielberg, it'd be different,'' Mr. Emmerich said. ''It's not about whether Stoppard's script is good or bad. It's about Chris Weitz's overall vision of the book.''

Aging Beatle a Safe Bet For Super Bowl
 A wardrobe malfunction seems unlikely; in fact, it has been promised that there will be none. The musical star for the halftime show at the Super Bowl this year will be Sir Paul McCartney, right, and a spokesman for the National Football League said there would be no hanky-panky like last year, when Janet Jackson's costume ripping earned CBS a $550,000 fine from the Federal Communications Commission. ''We're very cognizant we'll be under spotlight with this year's halftime show and we've looked at all facets of the show, including talent selection, song selection and costume selection, to ensure we wouldn't have a repeat of what happened last year,'' Brian McCarthy, the spokesman, told Reuters. The game will be broadcast on Fox on Feb. 6, and Sir Paul's performance is to last 12 minutes. It will be his second appearance at the Super Bowl. He sang in the pregame show in 2002.

Senate Targets Film Pirates
 Bad news for movie-theater camcorder sneaks: the United States Senate has passed a bill that could send them to jail for up to three years. The law, approved on Saturday, would outlaw many common techniques used to illegally copy and distribute movies, and would create stiff penalties for movie industry insiders who leak copies of films before their release dates. ''This bill strengthens the intellectual property laws that are vital to the ongoing growth of our economy,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. The bill also shields groups like ClearPlay that create ''family friendly'' versions of films by taking violent or sexually explicit scenes out of movies. But measures to punish Internet music traders, including users of networks like Kazaa and LimeWire, were dropped from the bill. Most elements of the bill have already been passed by the House of Representatives, but the changes will need to be approved by the House next month.

Footnotes
 Visitors flocked by the thousands to the Museum of Modern Art for its reopening this weekend. Admission was free on Saturday, the first day the museum was open to the public, and attendance totaled about 19,500, the museum says. On Sunday, when the $20 admission price went into effect, attendance dropped to 10,500. That may sound like a precipitous slip, but consider this: during a 12-hour day on Saturday, about 1,625 people went to the museum each hour; for the 7-hour Sunday, the average was 1,500 per hour Delta Burke and Christine Ebersole are joining the cast of ''Steel Magnolias,'' opening on Broadway this spring. Ms. Burke will play Truvy (the owner of the beauty shop, played by Dolly Parton in the 1989 film), and Ms. Ebersole will be M'Lynn (Sally Field's character). The show, directed by Jason Moore, starts previews in March and is scheduled to open on April 4 at a theater to be announced.

HEADLINE: Economic Adviser Leaving Job

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The White House said Tuesday that Stephen Friedman, the director of the National Economic Council, was leaving his post, the latest in a string of departures that is reshaping the face of the Bush administration as it heads into a second term.
 A prominent Republican in Washington with close ties to the White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been told by the White House to expect as many as a half-dozen further cabinet changes in coming weeks. 
Among the senior officials almost certain to depart, he said, are Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary; Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary; and Tommy G. Thompson, the health and human services secretary.
 The fate of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow remains uncertain, as does that of Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative. N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, is widely expected to leave within six months.
 Mr. Friedman has held the job for two years, a period in which Mr. Bush signed into law several tax-cutting bills and an overhaul of Medicare, but faced political peril from an economic recovery that generated fewer jobs than the White House and most economists expected. 
 Administration officials said the announcement of Mr. Friedman's departure was precipitated by rumors, which they said were unfounded, that he was seeking another high-level job in the administration, like Treasury secretary. Administration officials and friends of Mr. Friedman's said he had always intended to leave at the end of Mr. Bush's first term.
 Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House, said Mr. Friedman had been an ''outstanding member'' of the administration. Ms. Buchan would not say who might replace him.

Some Older Vioxx Users Could Have Bleeding
For all the risks associated with Merck's arthritis and pain drug Vioxx, the company has always pointed to one virtue: Vioxx was less likely to cause ulcers or stomach bleeding than cheaper, over-the-counter medications.
 But as far back as 2001, Merck executives had evidence that this might not be true for some Vioxx users -- those, mostly middle-age and older, who regularly took low doses of aspirin, not for pain, but to reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke. [Page A1.]

S.E.C. May Be Near AOL Settlement
Shares of Time Warner rose after it was reported that the company was close to settling a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into accounting at America Online. The S.E.C. and the Justice Department are investigating a $400 million payment that America Online received from Bertelsmann, which formerly owned half of AOL Europe. They are looking into whether the payment was used improperly as part of an effort to inflate the growth of AOL. [C5.]

HEADLINE: Food Imports Close to Matching Level of Exports, Report Says

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Next year, for the first time in nearly five decades, the United States could import as much food as it exports, the Department of Agriculture said. Until now, the United States exported more food than it imported. One out of every three acres in the United States is planted for export and agriculture has been one of the few economic sectors that produced a predictable trade surplus. 
 But in a revised quarterly report issued this week, the Agriculture Department predicted that in 2005 the imports of farm products would equal exports, which are estimated at $56 billion. Foreign competition and record crop production in the United States, which pushed down world prices for grains, oilseeds and cottons, were blamed for the drop in export sales from the record of $62.3 billion set in this fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.
 With the United States trade deficit deepening, reaching 5 percent of the gross domestic product in its fullest expression, this forecast was unwelcome news.
 Earlier this year, the Agriculture Department had predicted a $2.5 billion surplus in agriculture for 2005. 
 This turnaround has occurred in less than a decade. Throughout the 1990's agricultural products were racking up increasingly large trade surpluses; the record, of $27.2 billion, was earned in 1996.
 Indeed, political support for the $16 billion in federal farm subsidies every year is based in part on the importance of agriculture exports.
 But as the United States concentrated on farm exports, American consumers have been buying more imported goods. This year the rise in imports was especially marked for processed foods, essential oils used in food and beverage processing, snack foods, red meat, wine, beer and fresh vegetables, according to the Agriculture Department.
 Canada remains the United States biggest market for agricultural products, buying $9.7 billion. The next four projected big buyers are Mexico, at $8 billion; Japan, at $7.7 billion; the European Union, at $6.5 billion; and China, at $4.6 billion.
 Several Congressional aides said this forecast could have an effect on the debate over the financing of farm programs in the next Congress.
 New regional and international trade agreements have been held up by agricultural and farm policies.

PERSON: Martin Malia

HEADLINE: Martin Malia, 80, Soviet-Era Skeptic, Dies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Martin Malia, a historian of Soviet Communism who persistently challenged the prevailing notion of that system's durability, died last Friday in a convalescent home in Oakland, Calif. He was 80 years old.
 The cause was pneumonia, said a statement from the University of California at Berkeley, where he taught for more than 30 years.
 During the final three decades of the Soviet empire, Mr. Malia, who retired in 1991, provided an often provocative voice from the conservative flank of Soviet studies, which scorned the idea that Communist rule would ever be capable of reforming itself and assailed those of his fellow academics who foresaw such possibilities. 
 In his books and numerous magazine articles, Mr. Malia advocated the position that the Soviet Union was constituted ideologically -- and became as he put it an ''idiocracy'' that was alien to the currents of Russian and European history and thus could not endure. He took issue with those scholars who he felt had overlooked the distinct ideological nature of the state in their writings. 
 ''It really drove him crazy when people wrote about the Soviet Union as if it was just another state with economic and political problems,'' said Terry Emmons, a retired Stanford history professor who had been Mr. Malia's student and then his colleague during a span of more than 40 years. ''He had a polemical approach to scholarship, though I think he thought that it was those on the other side who were belligerent.'' 
 The most dramatic expression of Mr. Malia's views on Communism's dismal prospects and impending doom took the form of a January 1990 article in the quarterly Daedalus titled ''To the Stalin Mausoleum.'' The author was identified only by the single initial ''Z.'' 
 At the time, Mikhail Gorbachev and his policies of perestroika were generating optimism and enthusiasm in much of the West, including academic circles. But the article lambasted the Soviet leader, insisting that his rule would bring neither democracy nor free markets to the Soviet Union, though they might extend the life of the Communist Party, whose existence, the article contended, lay at the heart of the Soviet Union's problems. 
 Partly because of speculation over the identity of the author, the article gained international attention and a crucial portion was excerpted on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. One line of conjecture held that the ''Z'' in the signature was meant to recall the famous 1947 article in Foreign Affairs in which George F. Kennan's proposed policies for the containment of the Soviet Union were presented under the pseudonym ''X.'' In the fall of 1990, after the Berlin Wall had come down and Mr. Gorbachev was being eclipsed by Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Malia acknowledged in another Op-Ed piece in The Times that he was ''Z,'' and not a diplomat, as Mr. Kennan had been, but a university professor who eight months earlier had hidden his identity to avoid compromising his sources in Russia and Eastern Europe.
 A devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Malia was quick to recognize how Poland's Solidarity movement was gaining cultural and popular support in its challenge to Communism and wrote about the struggle for The New York Review of Books. He saw no prospect of similar upheavals in Russia, and in contrast to many colleagues he refused to believe that significant changes could emerge from party structures. Yuri Slezkine, a history professor at Berkeley, observed that Mr. Malia's views were regarded as controversial by many in the field, but added, '' things kind of came together in the end, and he was very grateful.'' 
 His major works included ''Russia Under Western Eyes,'' which appeared in 1990, which was followed three years later by ''The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia 1917-1991.'' Both continue to be widely read and cited both in the West and the lands of the former Soviet Empire. His 1961 work about the pre-eminent 19th-century Russian Socialist, ''Alexander Herzen and the Birth of Russian Socialism 1812-1855,'' touched on themes upon which Mr. Malia elaborated in his later studies of Soviet decline. 
 Indeed some of these were also evident in his latest article, which went to press on the day he died. The article, to appear in the Nov. 29 issue of The New Republic, is titled ''The Archives of Evil,'' and reviews recent books based on newly available Soviet-era archival material. ''That article summarized a lot of his thinking,'' Mr. Emmons noted.
 ''Now that Communism is at last 'history,' what do we understand about its workings that we failed to grasp when it seemed a permanent fixture of modernity?'' Mr. Malia asked in the article. Along the way he pointed out that the Central Intelligence Agency had greatly overestimated the Soviet Union's economic strength and that ''academic Sovietology exaggerated its potential for reform, thereby fostering the wishful hopes that culminated in late 1980's Gorbomania.'' 
 Mr. Malia did not find major revelations in the new archival works and wondered what it would take for historical writing about the Soviet period to match the studies of Nazi Germany or the French Revolution. What was needed, he wrote, were not new facts ''but an act of conceptual imagination, a fundamental rethinking of the Russian Revolution.''
 Mr. Malia was born in Springfield, Mass., on March 14, 1924. He served in the Navy in World War II and started to teach himself Russian aboard ship. He did his undergraduate work at Yale where he majored in French and received his doctorate from Harvard in 1951. Before he joined the Berkeley faculty in 1958, he was an assistant professor of history at Harvard and assisted in the acquisition of Russian books for the Library of Congress. 
 He is survived by a niece and four nephews.

HEADLINE: For an Old Hospital, New High-End Uses

BYLINE: By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
A developer who faced resistance and skepticism when he announced plans to convert a 1970's-era psychiatric center in the Bronx into a modern, suburban-style office park seems to have been vindicated. Another major tenant has taken a long-term lease, and plans are being drawn up to build more offices there.
 The development is the Hutchinson Metro Center, the reborn and recast Bronx Developmental Center. The New York City Housing Authority recently announced that it would move its six Bronx locations into one open-floor, 63,000-square-foot space at the center, which is at 1200 Waters Place just off the Hutchinson River Parkway near Pelham Bay Park. 
 The Housing Authority's 20-year lease represents a major step toward filling what is easily the largest high-end office development in the Bronx.
 The original hospital structure -- with its rippling, fingerlike appendages -- was transformed through a $70 million renovation that included building a high-ceiling circular lobby as well as a day care center, dry cleaners and fitness center. In addition, the developer replaced a gymnasium with a cafeteria, removed the swimming pool, elongated porthole-shaped windows, landscaped a 1.5-acre courtyard and added 1,142 parking spaces.
 The effort seems to be paying off. The Hutchinson Metro Center, whose first tenant arrived last fall, is occupied by Mercy College -- whose main campus is in Dobbs Ferry, in Westchester County -- plus health care practices and even an Internal Revenue Service office. Tenants occupy spaces ranging from 2,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet and, with the Housing Authority contract, about three-quarters of the building's 460,000 square feet is leased. 
 In addition, its developer and owner, Joe Simone of the Simone Development Company, based in New Rochelle, said banks and law firms were in talks about leasing some of the remaining 120,000 square feet.
 The center's top selling point, Mr. Simone said, is location: 10 million employable people live within a 30-minute commute.
 ''Geographically, this is the primest location you can ask for,'' said Mr. Simone, who paid $3.4 million in 2001 for 18.5 acres, including the hospital building, without public financing and without first lining up anchor tenants.
 The newest tenant, the Housing Authority, said that both the Bronx address and the room for 270 employees attracted it to the building. Its current Bronx operations, in Housing Authority residential buildings, are at sites on East 156th Street, Alexander Avenue, Bronxwood Avenue, East 146th Street, Boston Road and Hoe Avenue. 
 Besides the advantages from centralizing operations, moving to the Hutchinson Metro Center frees up apartments, office space and recreation areas, a Housing Authority spokesman, Howard Marder, said.
 Construction on the third floor will not begin until May, with November 2005 as the likely move-in date, according to brokers involved in the deal. The Housing Authority will pay $30 a square foot for the space, they said. That rate, lower than the $35 a square foot that the doctors' offices are paying, is still some $40 less than in Midtown Manhattan. 
 Another comparison is with rents in Westchester County, a short drive from the Hutchinson Center's East Bronx location and the area where many employees live. In Westchester, similar space, offering up-to-date amenities, ample parking and close proximity to highways, buses and trains, is leasing for about $25 a square foot, said Al Gutierrez, a broker with CB Richard Ellis. 
 ''The fact that there is a lack of quality office product in Bronx County contributed to the successful rental rate that they are getting,'' Mr. Gutierrez said. He is the agent for a mixed-use development, Ridge Hill Village in Yonkers, which aims to compete for tenants with the Hutchinson Center, though at 75,000 square feet it is much smaller. 
 Designed by Richard Meier and completed in 1976, the Bronx Developmental Center won high praise from Day 1 for its space-age design. In 2001, there was some scattered opposition to the plan to turn it into an office park, but the opponents were unsuccessful. 
 The architect who designed the conversion said the renovations were an attempt to make the building more suitable for conventional business uses, rather than for use by psychiatrists and their young patients. 
 ''Somehow, I never thought of it as a hospital,'' said Mitchell D. Newman of the Newman Design Group of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., ''and by the time we got done with it, there was very little of the old building left.''
 The Hutchinson Metro Center's first tenant was the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, which moved there in October 2003 from three Bronx locations. It is in a 50,000-square-foot space, stacked on the first, second and third floors, and is paying $30 a square foot, brokers said. The service's 907 employees, many of whom drive from Connecticut, Long Island or New Jersey, are satisfied with the move, especially because parking is so much easier than near the previous offices.
 ''People were getting a lot of tickets before, and the community was upset we were taking spots,'' said Eileen Campbell, a regional administrator for the visiting nurses. ''Parking here is excellent, and free.'' 
 For Mr. Simone, the next step is to build offices on surrounding property, which can accommodate 1.9 million square feet of commercial real estate, including the existing center, he said.
 And because that land -- a mixture of stubby trees and overgrown baseball fields -- is zoned for industrial use, Mr. Simone can build quickly, bypassing community board hearings and zoning-review processes, as he did with the first phase.
 The early success of the Hutchinson Metro Center has been consistent with other commercial activity in the Bronx, where a number of creative conversions are under way.
 ''Certainly, it is a sign of the continued revival of the Bronx since the dire days of the 1970's,'' the Bronx borough historian, Lloyd Ultan, said. ''It is a trend in almost every neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers' Favored Projects From Home States Lay Deep Inside $388 Billion Spending Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The $388 billion spending bill approved by Congress in the last few days is a cornucopia full of money designated for specific highway projects, locks and dams, parks, libraries, airports, museums, zoos, hospitals, schools and universities in every corner of the country, from the northernmost reaches of Maine to the southern tip of Texas and the most remote islands of Hawaii.
 The projects are so numerous, so diverse and so scattered through the legislation that no one -- not even Congressional aides responsible for the programs -- knows all that has been stuffed into the bill.
 The bill includes $300,000 to save the Pennsylvania home of the first speaker of the House, Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, and $1.5 million to establish an archive for the papers of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is retiring after 28 years in Congress.
 The measure also provides money to suppress all sorts of agricultural pests, like cattle ticks, screwworms, boll weevils, golden nematodes, witchweed, jointed goatgrass and apple fire blight. 
 It also includes money to keep running an airfield on Midway Atoll in the Pacific, which the Bush administration had threatened to shut down, over objections from the nation's airlines.
 Hundreds of projects are earmarked for special attention in the omnibus appropriations bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. There is money for the poorest communities, like Clarksdale, Miss., and Hidalgo County, Tex., and for affluent places like Fairfax County, Va., and Newton, Mass. There is money for projects celebrating the achievements of racial, religious and ethnic minorities, including blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Arab Americans and Chaldeans.
 Money is explicitly provided to zoos in Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Memphis; New York ; Philadelphia; and Syracuse.
 Congress extended its largess to the Frederick Douglass Museum here in Washington, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and the Please Touch Museum for children in Philadelphia.
 Rivulets of money will run from Washington to Aroostook County, Me., for a north-south highway; to Vermont, to preserve its covered bridges; to Brownsville, Tex., to lengthen airport runways; and to Kauai, Hawaii, for a homeless shelter and transportation projects.
 In earmarking money, Congress left little to chance -- or to the judgment of officials in the executive branch of the government. It set forth long lists of specific projects to be financed with federal money. One list itemizes 1,032 economic and community development projects. Some of the grants are relatively small: $20,000 for a jail in Winston County, Ala., and $25,000 for a park in Chambersburg, Pa. 
 Another part of the bill sets aside $15,000 for cameras to be installed in police cars in Berryville, Va., and a similar amount for the Police Department of West Buechel, Ky. 
 Critics of such local projects sometimes refer to them as pork barrel spending, or simply pork. The 2005 spending bill includes $1 million for the Missouri Pork Producers Federation, to see if hog waste can be used as a source of energy. 
 The bill also includes $1 million for seafood marketing efforts in Alaska, $269,000 for harvesting seafood in Mississippi, $200,000 for a new seafood plant on the coast of Oregon, $4 million for ''shrimp aquaculture'' in seven states and $443,000 for research to develop ''baby food containing salmon,'' plus $236,000 for blueberry research in Maine and $133,000 for maple research in Vermont.
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, so it is no surprise that the bill is studded with grants to projects in his state. Waterloo, Iowa, a city of about 70,000 people, will receive $135,000 for its arts center, $500,000 for a museum of history and science, $450,000 for a school injury prevention program, $2.5 million for highway improvements, $250,000 for a technology center and $200,000 for an industrial park.
 Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, is the fiscally conservative chairman of the House Budget Committee. But he boasted this week of all the money he had secured for his district, including $500,000 for a hospital in Dubuque and $1 million for sewer construction in Davenport.
 Another Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, boasted that he had secured $1 million for a flood-control project on the Rio Grande, $1 million for a clinic to treat children with heart problems in San Antonio and $300,000 to improve emergency communications in El Paso.
 Not to be outdone by the Republicans, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, issued more than 50 news releases in the last two days boasting that he had obtained millions of dollars earmarked for constituents. 
 The money includes $500,000 for the New York Botanical Garden, $100,000 for the American-Italian Cancer Foundation, $500,000 for the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, $3 million for research on the genetics of grapes and $199,000 for the control of Canada geese. ''The geese have overrun and polluted our water and land,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 Congress also parceled out millions of dollars to hundreds of hospitals, clinics and medical schools, including the University Hospitals of Cleveland, Yale University, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Awaken the Charitable Impulse

 BODY:
Among the most haunting lines in 20th-century theater is Vladimir's in ''Waiting for Godot'': ''Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now?''
 The holiday season calls all of us to charity, to rouse ourselves from routines that allow us to endure -- ignore? -- the contradictions of life in New York City. One-third of the city's children live in poverty, double the national average. They are the largest and most vulnerable contingent among the 20 percent of city dwellers who are poor. New York is also home to one of the largest concentrations of high earners in the country. 
 Most of us live comfortably between these extremes. One reason we can is that charitable agencies help the city's poor, stricken and, at times, unloved. Without them, the daily struggles of the poor -- to pay rent and buy food, to care for children while holding down a job -- would also overwhelm the emotional and economic capacity of all of us. 
 To continue their work, the charities need the support of all New Yorkers. Since 1912, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has served as a conduit for this help. Every penny is routed to one of seven local charities: the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York. The Times pays the fund's administrative costs. 
 Please send your check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. You may also contribute with a credit card by telephone at (212) 556-5851 (Extension 7), or at www.nytimes.com/neediest.

HEADLINE: Fixing the Way We Vote: Some More Ideas

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''No More Sham Elections,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Nov. 20): 
 To Mr. Kristof's three excellent ideas to be actively pursued by citizen activist groups -- have nonpartisan experts draw up Congressional districts after each census, eliminate the Electoral College and funnel campaign donations through a blind trust -- I'd add two more: voting on Sunday and availability of early voting. 
 Although some states have established Election Day as a holiday or require employers to provide two hours off for voting, it's not universal and imposes a penalty on employers. 
 Almost every other democracy has Sunday voting, and voter participation is often over 90 percent, compared with our recent more than 55 percent. 
 With few people having to return to work on Sunday, many more could vote without suffering economic penalties. Undoubtedly, the original reason for establishing Tuesday was motivated by concern for churchgoers. But this consideration should no longer apply in our society, which, in most areas, permits shopping malls and, in many cases, liquor stores to open Sunday.
 Ending voting in each time zone at 9 p.m. Eastern time would help as well.

HEADLINE: Mixed End to Light Trading As Oil Surges, Then Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Shares shuffled to a mixed finish yesterday, rebounding from earlier lows as oil prices retreated after surging past $50 a barrel.
 An analyst downgrade of the Intel Corporation pressured technology shares. With the euro reaching past $1.31 against the dollar, a new record for the European currency, Wall Street worried about a falloff in foreign investment and more expensive imports that could curtail consumer spending. Crude oil futures briefly topped $50 a barrel amid concerns about low inventories of heating oil ahead of winter, but then retreated in volatile trading. Crude oil for January delivery soared as high as $50.25 a barrel before settling at $48.94, an increase of 30 cents, in New York trading. 
 ''Oil is obviously pressuring the market, the euro is at a record high, so the dollar is reacting to that as well to general concerns about the deficits,'' said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management for Oakbrook Investments. ''I think those are the two things really pressuring the market today.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.18 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,492.60, after spending most of the day in negative territory. Broader stock indicators were narrowly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.30 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,176.94. The Nasdaq dropped 1.96 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,083.23, largely on weakness in the chip sector. 
 Traders attributed some of the day's lackluster trading to light volume ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but few were concerned about it after several weeks of robust performance. The markets will be closed on Thursday and will close at 1 p.m. on Friday. 
 ''We have overextended ourselves a little bit, but over all I think the economy has held in much better than expected, crude has gone back down and a lot of those bubbles of uncertainty are gone,'' said Bill Groenveld, head trader for vFinance Investments. ''We'll see what the holiday season brings, but I think it's starting a little early today.''
 Technology stocks retreated largely on a downgrade of Intel, a Dow component, by Credit Suisse First Boston, which lowered its rating on the semiconductor manufacturer to underperform. Intel lost 73 cents, or 3 percent, to $23.37, on the downgrade, with First Boston citing high inventories and lower demand for the move. The brokerage firm said that it would move some assets into Texas Instruments, which dropped 22 cents, to $24.33.
 Another Dow component, Hewlett-Packard, slipped 4 cents, to $20.16, after it said in a regulatory filing that it planned job cuts to increase its 2005 earnings.
 The McDonald's Corporation, the restaurant chain, another Dow component, rose 72 cents, to $30.10 after the company announced that the chief executive, Charles H. Bell, was stepping down to focus on his battle with cancer. The vice chairman, James A. Skinner, will succeed Mr. Bell.
 TiVo, the maker of television recording devices, said its loss widened in the third quarter as it spent money to increase its subscriber levels. Still, its per-share loss was 11 cents less than Wall Street expected. TiVo shed 68 cents, or 12 percent, to $5.20.
 World Wrestling Entertainment tumbled $1.36, or 10 percent, to $12.04, as its second-quarter net income fell sharply because of dropping revenue and increased costs of producing its live wrestling events. W.W.E. missed Wall Street profit forecasts by 7 cents a share.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note lost 2/32, to a price of 101 17/32. The note's yield remained unchanged at 4.18 percent.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes and four-week bills:

HEADLINE: In Congress, Growing Doubts on Spending Process

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The power of the purse has always been the ultimate power of Congress. But the way Congress is exercising that power is causing a ruckus on Capitol Hill, where members of both parties say the system for financing the government is broken.
 This year, for the third year in a row, lawmakers delayed passing spending bills until the very last minute, then rolled most of them into a catchall measure called an omnibus. This year's bill, which passed Saturday night, was a 3,300-page legislative behemoth -- stuffed with special projects for lawmakers and an embarrassing provision that would have allowed Congressional aides to examine citizens' tax returns -- delivered to lawmakers just hours before they voted on it. 
 Many confessed they had not read it.
 ''We've reached the bizarre point where we approve hundreds of billions of dollars of bills without anyone seeing them,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in an interview Tuesday. ''And then we're shocked -- shocked! -- that a provision should sneak in which is onerous.''
 On Tuesday, with lawmakers still in a dither over the tax-return provision, the spending bill encountered yet another delay in its tortured journey to President Bush's desk. Though the Senate, whose members say they were unaware of the language on tax returns, has approved a resolution stripping it from the bill, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, refused to allow the House to do so without formal debate.
 ''The assault on taxpayer privacy was not a simple mistake, and Democrats will not let Republicans sweep it under the rug,'' Ms. Pelosi said.
 She called provision ''a Saturday night massacre on Americans' privacy.'' In holding up the bill, Ms. Pelosi said she was seeking a promise from Republicans not to bring legislation to the floor so hastily in the future. 
 Her objection means the House must reconvene on Dec. 6 to take up the Senate resolution. If it is approved, as expected, the $388 billion omnibus, which includes nine separate bills and covers spending for myriad government agencies, can go to the White House, more than two months after the fiscal year started.
 A spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, John Feehery, said Ms. Pelosi was playing ''political games.'' 
 In the meantime, Congress is expected to give routine approval on Wednesday to a measure continuing government spending at current levels until Dec. 8, a move that is necessary to avoid a government shutdown of the sort that occurred in 1995 when Bill Clinton was president. 
 Though the parties are bickering about the omnibus, both sides agree that the process that produced it is in tatters. Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who has served on the Appropriations Committee for his entire 46 years in the Senate, found the measure, which was passed on his 87th birthday, so odious that he voted against it. 
 ''We have seen within these last few years, especially, this excrescence of the body politic grow until now it has become malignant,'' Mr. Byrd said, calling it ''a disgrace upon the escutcheon of the Senate.''
 The problem with an omnibus, lawmakers and independent analysts agree, is that it creates an opportunity for what Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, called ''legislative mischief.'' Others call it pork, and this year's bill is chock full of it. The measure will send taxpayer dollars all over the country, from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to a homeless shelter in Hawaii.
 Passing spending bills is one of the few jobs that lawmakers can trace directly to the Constitution, which does not permit the president to spend money unless Congress approves. Under the current system, lawmakers are responsible for passing 13 separate spending bills each year. But in recent years, the Senate especially has been unable to complete its appropriations work.
 This year, for instance, the House passed 12 of the 13 appropriations bills but the Senate passed only 4. Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, blamed the Senate for failing to adopt a budget resolution, which helps guide the appropriations process. 
 Mr. Byrd said ''it was never that way in the old times.''
 Mr. Reischauer says appropriations bills were less contentious in the past, when one party or the other had a large majority in the Senate and deficits were not the problem they are today.
 ''It's a lot easier to pass an appropriations bill,'' he said, ''when the bottom line is going up 10 percent than when the bottom line is going up less than inflation. Then what you're really doing is voting to distribute pain, rather than handing out pleasure.''
 At the same time, there is no public clamor for passing spending bills; the process is so arcane that almost nobody understands it. And Congress has a tradition of procrastinating. In the 1800's, said Donald A. Ritchie, the associate Senate historian, lawmakers would debate appropriations past midnight on the night of adjournment, and instruct Senate doorkeeper ''to stand on the chair with a broom handle and turn the hands of the clock back to give them more time to debate.''
 But the recent delays trouble Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican in line to become chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He said Tuesday that the appropriations process was ''in need of reform'' and that overhauling it would be one of his panel's priorities when the new Congress convened in January. 
 ''It's very much on my mind,'' Mr. Cochran said.
 He said he had several proposals, but declined to discuss specifics. Asked if he had read the omnibus bill in its entirety, Mr. Cochran laughed, and then paused for a long time.
 ''Do you think anyone read it all?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: Inflation and Interest Rates

 BODY:
If the Federal Reserve Board were free to manipulate interest rates solely in response to business conditions, it would make sense to stand pat in December, and avoid a rate hike despite recent signs of inflation. Unfortunately, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, doesn't have that kind of flexibility these days. Raising interest rates looks like the more prudent route -- even though stagnating wages could really use a little help right now. 
 A probable December rate increase is noteworthy in and of itself, but even more so for how it highlights the growing divergence in monetary and fiscal policy. By continuing to raise rates, Mr. Greenspan would be easing off the economic accelerator of rock-bottom rates. President Bush, meanwhile, plans to go full speed ahead with more tax cuts. For the Fed and the administration to be at cross-purposes does not bode well for the economy. 
 The unexpectedly large 0.6 percent inflation spike in October was driven mainly by increases in the costs of oil and food -- which have since abated. The spike was not in any way related to wage gains. In fact, wage gains have not outpaced inflation in eight of the last 12 months. Economists generally regard the price of labor as far more important than the cost of commodities when it comes to inflation. So all things being equal, Mr. Greenspan might choose to hold rates steady to spur hiring. 
 Alas, all other things are not equal. As much as the job market might benefit from a pause in rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to take a break. For one, rates are already very low -- a holdover from the Fed's effort to stimulate economic growth in the last few years. Mr. Greenspan needs more room to maneuver in the event of a body blow to the economy -- an oil shock, say, or terrorist attack. The chairman has to get rates up, in case he needs to bring them down. 
 That is particularly true since the Fed cannot count on other stimuli being available. Mr. Bush's fiscal policies -- tax cuts, chief among them -- have already busted the federal budget, and the outlook is for more deficit-financed giveaways. Nor can Mr. Greenspan fall back on a strong dollar. The weakening dollar, a result of global imbalances that are also traceable, in part, to the budget deficit, increases the pressure for higher rates because it is, in itself, an inflationary force that is gathering steam. Speaking at an international banking conference in Germany last week, Mr. Greenspan said that foreign investors who are financing America's huge deficits would eventually resist lending more to the United States. That, in turn, would cause the dollar to fall even further than its recent historic lows, risking an upsurge in American prices and interest rates. 
 Given the policy bind, the Fed would be justified if it raised rates next month. That doesn't make a rate hike an unambiguously good policy. The Fed is being reduced to making the best of a bad situation.

HEADLINE: Nafta, Redux

 BODY:
Dogfights in Capitol Hill over free-trade pacts usually pop up not long after presidential elections. Back in 1993, Bill Clinton doled out promises to everybody and their mother to get the North American Free Trade Agreement passed, while President Bush in 2001 had his Congressional allies actually hold a vote open for an extra 23 minutes so they could force a weeping North Carolina congressman to abandon his textile constituency and give the president the single-vote margin he needed for trade negotiating authority.
 Next spring promises to be no exception. Mr. Bush has indicated he will try to push through a Central American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, or Cafta. Like Nafta, Cafta would open up trade -- valued at $32 billion -- between the United States and El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
 The usual suspects are already lining up -- business leaders for, labor unions against -- and many Democrats are protesting that the pact does not go far enough to protect labor and environment in Central America. It would be easier to believe Congressional opponents really did care about protecting labor and environmental standards in other countries if many of them had not also voted in favor of an American-Jordan free trade accord, which included nearly identical language on labor and environment. Cafta actually goes further than the pact with Jordan, since penalty fines collected for not enforcing labor laws would be sent back to the offending country to fix the offense. If, for instance, the United States won a case charging that El Salvador didn't have enough inspectors in its factories, the fine that the El Salvadoran government paid would go toward hiring more inspectors, instead of just ending up in the United States Treasury.
 It is easy to see why leading House Democrats like Representative Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking minority member on the House Ways and Means Committee and a normally sound voice on trade, are distancing themselves from Cafta. Mr. Rangel has been pushed around for so long by highhanded Republican behavior that he is not feeling particularly bipartisan these days. The few Democrats who do sometimes support free-trade pacts are waiting to see what they might be offered as the legislative equivalent of the ever-popular swing voters. 
 We hope President Bush and the Republican leadership can come up with compromises in other areas that might woo Mr. Rangel and the Democrats. The Central American accord is a good idea that will help job growth in a needy region. And if Mr. Rangel and his associates can convince the other side to pare back some of their other plans -- those tax cuts for the wealthy come to mind -- so much the better.

HEADLINE: Campbell Soup is looking beyond its big agency for ideas to pump up the sales of Goldfish.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A LARGE client of Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York, the Campbell Soup Company, has quietly decided to seek ideas to promote a major product line from a far smaller agency specializing in unconventional creative approaches.
 The Pepperidge Farm unit of Campbell Soup has asked BrightHouse Live in Atlanta to develop concepts for advertising the Goldfish line of crackers, pretzels and other snacks, which Y.&R. Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, has handled since 1998. 
 Although Y.&R. Advertising remains the agency of record for Goldfish, as it does for other Pepperidge Farm products, it is now BrightHouse Live's assignment to present Pepperidge Farm with what the company hopes will be the next clever campaign. 
 The decision by Pepperidge Farm is the first such step affecting the Campbell Soup account at Y.&R. Advertising, which also includes brands like Pace salsa, Chunky soup, V8 beverages and Prego pasta sauces. The move is emblematic of the attempts by big marketers to search beyond the usual suspects for more effective selling strategies. 
 Marketers besides Campbell Soup that are expanding their agency relationships in unexpected directions include Anheuser-Busch, BMW, Burger King, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. 
 ''We have a very solid relationship with Y.&R.,'' Nan Redmond, director for corporate and brand communications at Pepperidge Farm in Norwalk, Conn., said yesterday. 
 ''There has been no realignment of agency-of-record status,'' she added, ''but now BrightHouse Live is working on developing some new creative communication directions for the Goldfish brand.''
 ''There's a special strategic direction here we're looking to,'' Ms. Redmond said, which she declined to discuss, citing competitive reasons, ''and we felt it requires additional capabilities.''
 Neither Pepperidge Farm nor BrightHouse Live previously disclosed the agency's new role on Goldfish. After this reporter received an e-mail message last week from an unfamiliar address discussing the decision, Ms. Redmond confirmed it, as did executives of Y.&R. Advertising and BrightHouse Live. 
 ''We've been doing it for a couple of months,'' said Michael Edmeades, who joined BrightHouse Live as president when it was opened in November 2003 by BrightHouse, a strategic consultant described by its founder, the adman Joey Reiman, as an ''ideation corporation.'' 
 Mr. Edmeades said Goldfish was the first packaged-goods assignment for BrightHouse Live, which he called ''a hybrid between an advertising agency and a marketing consultancy.'' BrightHouse Live also has clients like the ESPN cable television network.
 Pepperidge Farm spent $6.5 million to advertise Goldfish in major media during the first eight months of the year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, compared with $11.1 million in the period a year ago. For all of 2003, spending totaled $16.3 million, TNS reported, almost unchanged from $16.7 million in 2002.
 Pepperidge Farm sells more than a dozen varieties of Goldfish, from the traditional orange-colored fish-shaped crackers to exotic styles like Baby Goldfish, Giant Goldfish, Flavor Blasted Goldfish and Goldfish Colors. Many campaigns are aimed at children and teenagers, with others geared toward the more traditional adult snack buyers.
 Sales of the myriad Goldfish lines totaled $249.9 million in the 52 weeks that ended Oct. 31, according to Information Resources, down 0.4 percent from the period a year ago. The data include sales in supermarkets, drugstores and mass-merchandise chains except for Wal-Mart Stores. Goldfish marketing was fairly prosaic for many years, and sales had been flat, until 1995, when Pepperidge Farm tried new advertising, additional varieties and improved distribution. The agency then was Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, which lost the Goldfish assignment along with the other Pepperidge Farm products in 1998 to Y.&R. Advertising in a consolidation by Campbell Soup.
 The most recent work for Goldfish from Y.&R. Advertising, Ms. Redmond said, has been aimed at the so-called tween market, ages 8 to 12, as well as teenagers. One campaign reintroduced Flavor Blasted Goldfish with new flavors and packages. The data from Information Resources showed a 43.4 percent increase in dollar sales of the line in the 52 weeks that ended Oct. 31.
 Another recent campaign, Ms. Redmond said, introduced Goldfish Sandwich Snackers, two crackers with fillings between in flavors like cheddar cheese and peanut butter.
 In September 2003, Y.&R. Advertising brought out a major campaign for the Pepperidge Farm brand that introduced an animated character, a driver of a Pepperidge Farm truck, meant to personify brand traits like quality and freshness.
 Liz Reilly, a spokeswoman for Y.&R. Advertising, said the agency has had ''extreme success with the Campbell brands'' it handles.
 Y.&R. Advertising has been closely watched since Ann Fudge, an executive with a background in packaged-goods marketing, joined Y.&R. Brands last year as chairwoman and chief executive.
 In that time, the agency has landed clients like Callaway Golf, Toys ''R'' Us and Weight Watchers International and kept one account, 7Up, from departing. But some clients like Burger King and Kraft Foods have left, and the large Jaguar account was placed in review this month.

HEADLINE: A Tug of War Over Ukraine

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Not since NATO's war in Kosovo, or perhaps the cold war itself, have the political differences between Russia and the West appeared so starkly as they have in Ukraine's disputed presidential election.
 It is not just that Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin himself have come out so strongly for the candidate promising closer relations with Moscow, Viktor F. Yanukovich, while Europe and the United States are supporting Viktor A. Yushchenko, albeit more subtly.
 It is that both sides -- rivals in what the United Financial Group, a Moscow investment banking company, calls ''a cold-war-style proxy confrontation'' -- have staked out diametrically opposed views of what unfolded in Ukraine.
 Mr. Putin, through a Kremlin spokesman, called ''open and honest'' an election that the European Union, the United States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe called everything but that. The returns of the Sunday vote showed a victory for his candidate, whose opponent disputes the results. 
 Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who led an American delegation to Ukraine, cited ''a concerted and forceful program of election-day fraud and abuse.'' The speaker of Parliament, Boris V. Gryzlov, whose presence in Ukraine no doubt was intended as a counterweight to Mr. Lugar's, declared that ''the election was as democratic as they come.''
 The collapse of the Soviet bloc was supposed to erase the old divisions of Europe. For a time, even the words East and West sounded faintly anachronistic as the former Soviet republics and satellites of Eastern Europe embraced democracy, however hesitantly.
 Increasingly, a new division has become apparent, defined not by competing political ideologies but by competing economic and political interests and contradictory ideas about what democracy represents.
 In Mr. Putin's Russia, the use of government resources on behalf of loyal candidates or the state's control over the media -- both factors criticized by international observers in Ukraine -- are accepted tools of politics. So is wielding the president's personal prestige, carefully preserved on those state channels, to influence elections, even those outside the country's borders.
 Mr. Putin stepped on accepted diplomatic protocol by campaigning so overtly on Mr. Yanukovich's behalf, playing host to him in Moscow and visiting Ukraine before each round in the election. Imagine the reaction if President Vicente Fox of Mexico had hit the campaign trail for President Bush, or the reverse.
 The Russian president trampled on protocol altogether on Monday by congratulating Mr. Yanukovich on a victory that his opponent had not yet conceded and that even his patron, President Leonid D. Kuchma, still had not acknowledged as official.
 Joining Mr. Putin on Tuesday in offering congratulations was President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, the man often called the last dictator of Europe.
 ''We do not want their values imposed on us,'' Mr. Lukashenko said earlier this month, dismissing the Western criticism heaped on the presidential referendum in October that effectively lifted any limit on his own stay in power.
 Masha Lipman, an analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research institute, said the election in Ukraine highlighted what she called ''a value gap'' between Russia and Belarus on one side and the rest of Europe on the other.
 ''The fact that Russia does not think of itself as part of the West has become very explicit,'' she said.
 It was inevitable that Ukraine would become a battleground.
 The candidates offered starkly divergent visions for the country's future. Mr. Yanukovich promised to carry out Mr. Kuchma's legacy, while deepening relations with Russia. Mr. Yushchenko fashioned himself as a liberal, democratic reformer eager to break the power of the state as it turns to Europe.
 Given the distribution of votes in the runoff on Sunday, with the Russian-speaking eastern half of the country strongly behind Mr. Yanukovich and the capital and the more ''European'' western half strongly behind Mr. Yushchenko, Europe's new dividing line seems to run somewhere east of the Dnieper River.
 Sergei A. Markov, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Moscow, who was among the many Russian advisers to Mr. Yanukovich's campaign, said in an interview that the election was not a struggle over ideas as much as influence.
 In Russia's view, the country remains a vital part of the ''near abroad,'' the former Soviet republics with deep economic, historical and, in Ukraine's case, cultural, linguistic and ethnic bonds. Mr. Putin has invested considerable effort in drawing Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan into an economic and political union.
 Mr. Markov dismissed Western criticism of the election, saying Mr. Yanukovich had won fairly. Europe and the United States protested, he said, only because their favorite lost.
 Increasingly, though, Russia and the West seem to be talking past each other. ''I think there could be a new cold war,'' Mr. Markov said, ''not a result of competition of interests, but because of miscommunication.''
 It only intensified Tuesday. In Portugal, where he was making the first state visit of a Russian leader, Mr. Putin called European criticism of the results ''inadmissible'' in the absence of official results. Ukraine, he added pointedly, according to The Associated Press, ''does not need to be lectured.''

HEADLINE: As Dollar Falls Further, Talk That Europe Won't Intervene

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar declined further against the euro yesterday amid speculation that the European Central Bank would refrain from trying to stem a further rise in the value of its region's currency. 
 European central bankers have been somewhat subdued recently in their complaints about the dollar's decline, even though exports, roughly a quarter of the euro zone economy, would be ''crushed'' if the euro advanced beyond $1.35, according to Paresh Upadhyaya at Putnam Investments in Boston. 
 ''Outright intervention is not likely at this point,'' said Mr. Upadhyaya, a currency portfolio manager who helps oversee $29 billion. 
 In New York yesterday, the euro settled at $1.3179, compared with $1.3080 late Tuesday. The Japanese yen rose to a rate of 102.81 to the dollar from 103.43 yen on Tuesday, its strongest since March 2000. 
 The dollar is also down against the British pound, which settled yesterday at $1.8818, up from $1.8678 Tuesday. 
 In the last year or so, these major currencies as well as the currencies of Switzerland, Canada and Australia have risen notably against the dollar. 
 The yen advanced yesterday after the secretary general of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, Tsutomu Takebe, told a press dinner in Tokyo that the yen was not at a level that merited policy changes. Japan sold a record $320 billion worth of yen in the fiscal year through March, and has not sold yen since, according to Finance Ministry data through October. 
 The euro has risen 1 percent since Friday, when Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, reaffirmed his view that the euro's moves were ''brutal,'' although he backed away from any argument with remarks by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, that market forces might have to resolve currency value problems. 
 A currency strategist in London at the investment banking unit of Credit Agricole, Kristjan Kasikov, said that European Central Bank policy makers might well refrain from selling the euro to halt further gains unless it rose to $1.35 in the next few weeks, adding, ''At the moment, they might still be hoping this is a temporary speculative move.''

HEADLINE: Despite Mixed Data, Economists See Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods, or items made to last at least three years, decreased 0.4 percent in October after a 0.9 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday. 
 In other reports, the government said that initial jobless claims dropped last week to the lowest level since early September, and October sales of new homes rose to their third-highest level. Consumer confidence also rose this month, a University of Michigan survey found. 
 ''The economy is in quite good shape,'' Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn., said in an interview. ''We are looking at good growth, not blowout numbers.'' 
 Shipments of durable goods increased in October, figures showed. Morgan Stanley economists increased their fourth-quarter gross domestic product forecast to 4.3 percent from 4 percent as a result. Initial jobless claims fell to 323,000 last week from 335,000 the week before, the Labor Department said. The four-week average declined to a four-year low of 332,000. 
 Sales of new homes increased 0.2 percent in October, to an annual rate of 1, 226,000, which is 200,000 higher than the rate in September, the Commerce Department said. The median selling price of homes rose to $221,800, up 14 percent from a year earlier. 
 The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 92.8 in November from 91.7 in October, probably reflecting payroll increases and higher stock prices. 
 Economists had expected orders for durable goods to rise 0.5 percent, based on the median of 70 forecasts in a survey by Bloomberg News. Instead, excluding transportation equipment, orders fell 0.7 percent, the first decline in four months, the Commerce Department said. 
 Orders for motor vehicles dropped 2.8 percent after falling 1.8 percent in September. Orders for commercial aircraft fell 0.4 percent, the third consecutive monthly decline, after dropping 17.1 percent in September and 46.2 percent in August. 
 Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, an indicator of future business investment, dropped 3.6 percent, the first decline in five months, after rising 5.2 percent in September. Orders for computers and electronic products fell 5.7 percent last month after rising 14 percent in September. 
 Shipments of nonmilitary capital goods, which the government uses to calculate the gross domestic product on a quarterly basis, rose 3.1 percent, the biggest increase since March, after falling 0.4 percent. 
 The report showed increased spending on machinery and communications equipment. Orders for machinery rose 3.7 percent last month after rising 3 percent in September. Communications equipment orders rose 7.9 percent after jumping 35 percent. 
 ''Companies are willing to spend money, if they see the benefit in productivity,'' Anne M. Mulcahy, chief executive at Xerox, said. Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., said two days ago that it expected sales next year to increase for the first time since 1999. 
 Military spending also was keeping manufacturers busy. Orders for defense hardware rose 19 percent last month after an increase of 28 percent in September. A 35 percent jump in orders for military aircraft propelled an increase for all transportation equipment, even as orders for motor vehicles and civilian aircraft declined.

HEADLINE: Waving Hello, From a Distance

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
WHEN Melody Wilt, a new grandmother, made the 10-hour drive from her home near Reading, Pa., to her daughter's house in Chapin, S.C., for Thanksgiving, she took along more than a 20-pound smoked turkey. 
 She went bearing a U.S.B. Web camera, sophisticated teleconferencing software and an Internet-inspired vision that will allow her to continue visiting even after she returns home. ''I want him to be able to see me, to hear my voice,'' she said of her 3-week-old grandson, Joseph Sinclair Lewis. ''I want to be able to read stories to him and share some of his firsts.''
 Mrs. Wilt, a manager at a regional educational services agency, said videoconferencing technology had gotten so good, so affordable and so easy to install and use that she is comfortable using it to open a two-way video window between her and her grandson when she is unable to visit in person. 
 ''It's great timing that this technology has gotten to this point,'' Mrs. Wilt, 52, said shortly before making the drive south with her husband, Arthur. ''It seems like the perfect way for me to see all the many changes he is going to go through.''
 There are no definitive numbers on how many people use Web-based videoconferencing. But there is anecdotal evidence that face-to-face electronic communication is gaining a foothold beyond the executive suite, and that the typical home users are no longer the stereotypical geeks straining to see each other over crude Webcams connected by sluggish modems.
 ''It was in a novelty phase,'' John Carey, a professor of communications and media management at the Fordham University Graduate School of Business Administration, said of the first wave of Webcam use. ''It was mostly techies and exhibitionists, people who show themselves, and pornography and all of that.''
 Today's consumers have more options. A high-end system can cost as much as a flat-screen plasma television. Some modestly priced units, including the Packet8 VideoPhone, plug into an electrical outlet and use the Internet.
 Long a mainstay of science fiction, the concept of being able to see and speak with someone over a vast distance, or even a short one, languished for decades in laboratories and tangles of technological choke points. Chief among them was adequate bandwidth, said Robert C. Hagerty, chief executive of Polycom, the market leader in videoconferencing, which makes the $149 PVX system that Mrs. Wilt has in Pennsylvania and is installing for her grandson in South Carolina.
 ''You need a good connection,'' he said, acknowledging that broadband adoption in North America is rapidly increasing. He noted that today's typical high-speed connection is capable of carrying, in both directions, at least the 128 kilobits of data per second that ''rich media'' requires. In other words, that is the baseline for television-quality color images that sync reasonably well with equally clear audio.
 Additionally, Mr. Hagerty said, significant improvements in videoconferencing software, like the new H.264 video compression standard, are helping to make the technology more efficient and accessible. 
 ''We talk with our hands; we show our body language,'' he said. ''We lose all those things in a phone call.'' 
 With improved videoconferencing, he added, ''we get them all back.''
 Professor Carey said consumers' desire for videoconferencing had been partly stoked by the popularity of instant text messaging, which has been adding video capabilities. Even blogs, he said, are including video.
 ''What didn't work three years ago now works reasonably well,'' he said.
 Professor Carey also noted that early tests of videophones found that many people, particularly women, were put off by the prospect of being seen by callers before they were prepared to be seen. ''A lot of people were concerned that they'd get a videophone call and they'd be in a bathrobe or their underwear.''
 Those concerns have been eased by technology, he said. Most modern systems give users the option of transmitting their images.
 In Eagan, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul, Greg Scott, the unofficial information technician for the Eagan Hills Alliance Church, is setting up high-speed videoconferencing to help local families electronically visit loved ones stationed in Iraq.
 Mr. Scott, a member of the church and operator of an information technology company in the area, said he conducted a fairly successful test of the system a month ago using limited bandwidth. But his expectations rose recently when a local telecommunications company donated a T1 connection for the project.
 ''This is going to let lots of soldiers in Iraq with families here talk face-to-face,'' Mr. Scott said. 
 Bryan Martin, the chief executive of 8x8 in Santa Clara, Calif., the maker of the Packet8 videophones, said it was not surprising that face-voice communication had a powerful hold on people. The box in which its phones are sold is covered with almost a dozen words that mean hello in various languages. More telling, perhaps, is the invitation printed on the box to ''speak in color.''
 The Packet8 phone has a five-inch liquid-crystal display so callers can look at each other as they chat. Mr. Martin said he did not have to look any farther than his own home to observe the warmth that screen-to-screen communication can create. He also said he had ample in-house proof that the system was extremely easy to use.
 ''We're finding that my 4-year-old son knows how to use the videophone,'' he said. ''Even his grandmother knows how to use the videophone, which is impressive. This is not just for early adopters, geeks and techno folks like myself.''
 Convinced that almost anyone who can use a telephone can use his videophones, Mr. Martin said he planned to set up call centers in the coming weeks, including at hospitals where children can talk to (and see) hired ''Santas at the North Pole.''
 Christopher Swann, 34, an investment analyst from Atlanta, said his 1-year-old son got a kick out of the phones. Mr. Swann's biggest complaint about the Packet8 phones is that they are not compatible with other Web-based videoconferencing systems. ''It would be great if everyone in the family had one,'' he said.
 He also noted that costs were not limited to the hardware. He said he spends about $60 a month for his broadband service, a requirement to use the Packet8 phones, and less than $40 a month for the phone's service, which includes unlimited videoconferencing and Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VoIP.
 ''It's little more than a gadget right now,'' Mr. Swann said of his pair of videophones. Because of the firewall protecting his company's computer system, he cannot use one in his main office as he had intended, he said, ''but it is a very cool gadget.''
 Packet8 phones also do not use the new H.264 video encoding and decoding scheme, which provides high-quality, 30-frames-a-second images with half the bandwidth requirements. In some ways, Mr. Hagerty of Polycom said, the new codec may mean to video what the MP3 compression format has meant to audio. 
 The Packet8 videophones use the older H.263 compression, Mr. Martin said, but they are likely to be upgraded to the new standard next year. Images using the older compression are more prone to breaking up. Nonetheless, Mr. Swann said, his videophones' images are ''better than I expected.''
 Once equipped, the next step -- as in the early days of the telephone -- is to find those similarly equipped. Jason Katz, founder and chief executive of PalTalk, a site that fosters online video messaging, said innovation and falling telecommunications costs allowed him to offer his basic service free. This lets users who install his software to speak to up to six people at a time (they appear as still images). For $40 a year, users can broadcast video images as well as see them, for two-way video conversations.
 In the last six years, Mr. Katz said, there have been 30 million downloads of the free PalTalk software. Today, he said, there are some three million users on his system speaking to and seeing friends and family members. Some are even meeting new friends, as is the case with Dennis Ludwig, a ''40-something'' communications technician in Dayton, Ohio, who has been using the service for four years.
 ''It's almost like being in a room with someone,'' said Mr. Ludwig, who routinely juggles six video windows at a time on his computer screen. Friendships he has made on PalTalk are so genuine, he said, that he thinks of many of the people he knows only over the Internet as his extended family.
 ''My mom had open heart surgery three weeks ago,'' Mr. Ludwig said. ''People in my room from nine different countries are praying for her.''

What It Takes
The Virtual Visit Becomes Easier and Saves People the Drive
 THE options for home videoconferencing equipment range from the economical to the high end.
 Ken Fontaine chose the high end. For the last year and a half, he has been able to look in on a corner of Connecticut where he once ran a family-operated packaging company and where his children and grandchildren now live. He does this from a condominium in Boca Raton, Fla., where he lives in retirement.
 When he is in Florida and wants to see his two sons, daughter and five grandchildren, he arranges a virtual visit over an $8,000 system called CallerVision. (A system is required on each end.)
 He picks up what looks like a television remote control, and with a click his family sits before him in stunning clarity and color.
 ''You don't experience that sense of absence,'' said Mr. Fontaine, 64. ''It is certainly a marked improvement to be able to communicate visually as well as verbally.''
 Mr. Fontaine's system, whose cameras can be controlled by remote, has been primarily used by corporations, said M. Walter Levine, chairman of High Speed Video (highspeedvideo.us), which makes CallerVision. And yes, he said, the system and its service fee ($2,200 a month for unlimited use) are expensive. But, he points out, so were the first cellphones.
 ''The costs will come down,'' he said, sitting in front of a CallerVision screen and robotic camera in his Manhattan office. Until they do, here are some less expensive systems: 

POLYCOM V500 -- $2,000 for set-top box (polycom.com) that includes video camera and microphone. Plugs into a standard television set and high-speed Internet connection.

POLYCOM PVX -- $149 software (polycom.com) requires at least a 1.6-gigahertz processor, Windows 2000 or later, a U.S.B. Webcam (with microphone) and a high-speed Internet connection.

PACKET8 VIDEOPHONE -- An Internet-based phone with video screen (with rebate, $300 for a single unit and $500 for two) from 8x8 (packet8.net). Requires high-speed Internet access; unlimited video and audio calling in North America is available for $30 a month.

PALTALK -- A free software download (www.paltalk.com) for multiscreen real-time audio and text messaging with video broadcasting. A $40 annual fee lets users receive as well as send video images. Michel Marriott

HEADLINE: China Sees Chances for Fun and Profit Offshore

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Asian leaders flying home this week from a regional meeting with President Bush in Chile might have looked down over the widely scattered South Pacific islands and believed that they were flying over an American playground.
 But judging by the swelling flood of Chinese tourists to these sunbathed islands, the Pacific is rapidly becoming a destination for Chinese tourism, fishing and investment. In July, China Southern started flying here twice a week from Shanghai. In October, China gave the green light to mass tourism in the Northern Marianas, granting approved-destination status. On Jan. 2, direct flights are to start from Beijing.
 ''Almost every flight is full; tomorrow night's flight is overbooked; Friday's flight is overbooked,'' said Tom Liu, the general manager of Tinian Dynasty Hotel and Casino, a $150 million Chinese-owned investment on Tinian, Saipan's next-door island. Speaking by phone from his hotel, which features Chinese dragon decor and a plush disco, Club de Macau, Mr. Liu said that since limited flights from Guangzhou began in April 2002 occupancy at his 412-room hotel has risen to 65 percent from 15 percent. 
 With Chinese tourism doubling this year and expected to hit 50,000 visitors next year, he predicted confidently: ''China will definitely be our largest market.''
 Washed by warm Pacific breezes, these small volcanic islands have floated with the ebb and flow of world maritime powers: 350 years of Spanish rule, 15 years of German rule, 30 years of Japanese rule and now, 60 years of American rule.
 But now, with Chinese tourism worldwide forecast to hit 100 million in 2020 -- a tenfold increase in two decades --Tinian is betting on China. Next year, the island hopes to have direct flights from China at a brand-new $23 million, 8,600-foot airstrip. Built by Americans, the runway is already being called ''the Chinese airport'' by residents.
 China is emerging as an economic power in the Pacific, an area that covers one-third of the globe. Although populations are small, the mini-states of Oceania straddle crucial shipping lanes and valuable fishing grounds. The arrival of tourists, aid projects and investment signifies China's penetration of the Pacific.
 ''The Chinese will dwarf the Japanese in tourism and business,'' said Dirk A. Ballendorf, an American who teaches Micronesia's history at the University of Guam. ''I recommend that all my students study Chinese.''
 This spring, China joined the South Pacific Tourism Organization -- a move that came after granting preferential tourism status to the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and now the Northern Marianas, which are only a four-hour flight from Shanghai.
 With a Chinese airline considering direct flights to Fiji, China's ambassador to Fiji, Cai Jinbiao, has said that China will be a major contributor to Fiji's five-year target of turning tourism into a $1-billion-a-year industry.
 In Tahiti, the China Travel Service, which is China's biggest tour operator, recently announced that it would invest nearly $100 million in two hotels. French Polynesia wants to open tourism offices in Beijing and Shanghai and the local airline, Air Tahiti Nui, is studying starting flights to Shanghai. In Tonga, Chinese investors spent $4 million to renovate the International Dateline Hotel.
 Roughly 3,000 Chinese companies do business in the Pacific, with nearly $1 billion in hotels, plantations, garment factories, fishing and logging operations. China is building a 50-boat tuna fleet for Fiji -- a reflection of China's interest in the huge fisheries of the Pacific.
 In a classic case of mixing investment with aid and public relations, China announced a plan to invest $3 million in a tuna-freezing factory in Papua New Guinea on Sept. 9, one week after reporters from The People's Daily interviewed the prime minister, Michael Somare, in Port Moresby.
 With purchases of black pearls from Tahiti, logs from Papua New Guinea and nickel from New Caledonia, China's trade with the Pacific has steadily grown. China now plans to subsidize the establishment of trade offices in Beijing and Hong Kong for the Pacific Islands Forum, a regional government group.
 In Tonga, a Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, is investing $17 million in a cellphone expansion project of the Shoreline Group, a telephone and power conglomerate controlled by Tonga's royal family. Shortly after the investment was announced in July, Tonga announced the appointment of its first ambassador to Beijing.
 Forging economic links with local rulers is common as China courts Pacific leaders with trips to Beijing. In recent years, China has played host to the leaders of Fiji, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. Beijing also flies diplomats, journalists and tourism officials to China for training or get-acquainted tours.
 Although Japan is still the region's largest aid donor, China has concentrated on high-profile projects: a China Friendship Sports Center in Pohnpei for the Micronesia Games; a stadium in Fiji for the South Pacific Games; a parliament building for Vanuatu; a courthouse and a police station for the Cook Islands; a 52-classroom high school for Tonga's capital; a Foreign Ministry for Papua New Guinea; a multistory government office for Samoa; a larger-than-life-size bronze statue of King Tupou IV of Tonga; and a ferry service for Kiribati, a republic spread over one million square miles.
 With the flag following trade, China's South Sea Fleet has started to venture from its home port in Zhanjiang, dropping anchor since 2000 in Hawaii, Palau and Tahiti, and last October, in Guam, the forward bastion of American military power in the Western Pacific.
 Just the way 50 Guam residents of Chinese heritage waved Chinese and American flags to welcome the ships of China's Navy, a Chinese minority throughout the Pacific is easing the way for spreading Chinese influence.
 In the Pacific, the Chinese diaspora ranges from newly arrived illegal immigrants to middle-class Chinese who have bought Pacific Island nation passports to local elites who are descendants of Chinese who arrived in the 19th century to work in plantations and mines.
 On Fiji, a nation long torn by ethnic rivalries, Chinese immigrants are becoming the new commercial class, displacing departing ethnic Indians. In French Polynesia, Robert Wan, a businessman of Chinese origin, has won Beijing's approval to open a Chinese cultural center in Tahiti. The parliaments of Papua New Guinea, Samoa and the Solomon Islands have prominent members of Chinese origin.
 Taiwan also plays on the ethnic ties.
 Anote Tong, president of the Republic of Kiribati, is the son of a Chinese immigrant, who helped China open its embassy in Tarawa, the capital, in 1980. This ethnic affinity did not help Beijing last fall when Mr. Tong extended diplomatic relations to Taiwan, apparently in return for $8 million in annual aid through 2007.
 Playing China off Taiwan, small islands often offer recognition to the highest bidder. A few months after Nauru broke with Taiwan and opened ties with Beijing in 2002, China extended a $2.4 million loan to the virtually bankrupt nation of 12,000. At latest count, five Pacific nations -- Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu -- maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
 During two weeks of flip-flops this month, Vanuatu, a nation of 200,000 people northeast of Australia, broke with Beijing, recognized Taiwan and finally returned to Beijing. Prime Minister Serge Vohor cited a lack of aid as his primary reason for breaking with Beijing, despite numerous agreements. China is financing an agricultural college, a rice farm and a biogas project and has promised two ferries for the nation of 82 islands.
 Beyond aid, China's biggest economic attraction for island nations is tourism.
 By January, Boeings and Airbuses will disgorge tourists almost daily in Saipan, one of China's closest Pacific island destinations.
 ''The Chinese go with their gut, that's why we like them,'' said Ken Barberis, general manager of the Tinian Dynasty casino, among the rings and whirs of slot machines and the cheers -- and groans -- from card tables.

'Hip: The History'
By John Leland
405 pages. HarperCollins. $26.95.
 Norman Mailer, in his famous essay ''The White Negro,'' ascribed the birth of the American hipster, that subversive romantic archetype, to a Greenwich Village ''menage a trois,'' in which ''the bohemian and the juvenile came face to face with the Negro.'' That was 1957, the year Jack Kerouac published ''On the Road,'' and two years after the release of Allen Ginsberg's ''Howl'' -- a couple of first-order anthems of rebellion that helped lay the groundwork for the countercultural revolution.
 According to John Leland, in ''Hip: The History,'' the Beats and the Fourth Street world that they inhabited were central elements (along with bebop and its variants) in what amounted to a ''golden age of hip,'' a ''Cold War convergence of art, image, dope, clothes, celebrity, intellectual arrogance and rebel grace.'' And while Mailer may have been correct to identify racial interplay -- the uneasy dance of assimilation, counter-assimilation and exploitation -- as the source of this phenomenon, he was also about a hundred years late to the party. 
 The progenitors of American hipness -- the O.G.'s, or original gangstas, in Mr. Leland's formulation -- were actually 19th-century writers like Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and most of all Walt Whitman, whose ''Leaves of Grass,'' published in 1855, serves as the ''founding hipster manifesto.'' Not the earnest naturalist we often remember him as, Whitman was, by Mr. Leland's lights, a pioneering dissident, exhorting the masses to ''stand up for the stupid and crazy,'' and to ''re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book.'' (By contrast, Nathaniel Hawthorne, a contemporary, does not make the grade; his novels were ''too singularly moralizing for our purposes here.'')
 Mr. Leland, a reporter for The New York Times and the former editor of Details, is a confessed ''punk rock kid'' who now lives in the East Village with his wife and son. He is the kind of guy, evidently, who buys used drum sets out of the back of The Village Voice. And check out that author photo on the dust jacket: the soul-patch goatee. 
 Though he professes to nerdiness, this is a man who wouldn't be caught dead without his ironic A-game; in other words, he is likely to be a good deal hipper than you or me. Not only that, he has clearly done his homework. ''Hip: The History,'' despite its pop-cultural sensibility, is a proper work of scholarship, with 30 pages of endnotes, and sources that extend beyond the obvious social critics (Mr. Mailer, Ralph Ellison, Stanley Crouch) to authors as varied and unlikely as Robert Wright and the developmental economist Richard Florida.
 But scholarship about what, exactly? Hip, it turns out, is a concept as elusive as it is self-evident. In Mr. Leland's telling, hip is: ''a romantic idea,'' ''a competitive sport,'' ''an instant payoff,'' ''a social relation,'' ''self-defeating or kitsch,'' ''utterly mongrel'' -- and that's all by Page 11, at which point the author himself asks, ''So what is hip?'' (Moving along, he gives us: ''the process beneath the mask,'' ''a system of order that incorporates chaos,'' ''the frisson of the bullet or blue note still in the air, dangerous but remote'' and so on.) 
 Hip, apparently, can be used as a noun, an adjective or a verb. And as we read deeper into the book, this versatility becomes problematic, a recipe for circularity. ''Hip is an operating system of alpha-hipsters,'' we learn. Hip also ''separates the hip from the square.'' And, occasionally, ''hip is not hip at all.'' Such verbal tap dancing may, in its own way, be hip, but it is less instructive than it is confusing.
 So let's back up. The etymology: ''hip'' derives from ''hepi,'' or ''hipi,'' Wolof words meaning, roughly, to see, or to open one's eyes. Hip, then, broadly speaking, is a state of awareness or enlightenment, particularly on the part of a social outsider -- in historical terms, beginning, at least in embryonic form, with the slaves arriving from West Africa in 1619. They developed, by necessity, a kind of doublespeak that was at once deferential and subversive (but only to those in the know): a precursor to the multilayered, ambiguous sentiments expressed by the blues and, later, jive.
 ''Hip: The History'' unfolds essentially as a series of capsule biographies of the sufficiently worthy figures in American culture, from the mid-19th century onward. (This is a story, thankfully, about the all-stars of hip, not the untold wannabes, with their over-studied mimicry.) For example: ''Born in 1942 in Brooklyn, the son of an accountant who changed the family's name from Rabinowitz, Lewis Alan Reed grew up in the middle-class suburb of Freeport, Long Island, struggling with his sexuality and the smother of home life.'' (Thus began the Velvet Underground.) There are dozens more: for Samuel Clemens and Robert Zimmerman and Jesse James and Chet Baker and James Ellroy and Richard Pryor. 
 Even the narcotics ingested by these legends-of-hip get the Micropaedia treatment: ''The opium poppy was first cultivated in lower Mesopotamia around B.C. 3400. The Sumerians called it hul gil, or 'joy plant.''' The result is a sort of alternative survey of American history, with the avant-garde in the foreground and political movements and leaders tagging along for added color and perspective. Indeed, Mr. Leland argues, without much in the way of support, that ''if you compare the bombs dropped over Europe with the beats dropped in New Orleans or Chicago, it would be hard to tell from today's society which was the diversion and which the main event.'' President Eisenhower may have overseen the birth of the containment doctrine, but, well, the Soviet Union no longer exists; Ike is now an irrelevance compared with Ginsberg, whose ''Howl'' still changes teenagers' lives everyday. (Or does it?)
 We are now, as Mr. Leland says, living in the post-hip era. With the democratization of information brought on by the spread of the Internet, outsider and insider distinctions quickly evaporate. If hip is a state of enlightenment, and everyone has more or less instant access to the same knowledge, then what becomes of the hipster? He acquires his ironic quotation marks, of course.
 What is lost in the breadth of this coverage -- which includes extensive treatment, as well, of the cultural interplay between blacks and Jews, and men and women -- is any kind of lasting, drawn-out illustration of hip (or its opposite) at work. Sure, we can all recognize, on some level, that Miles Davis was hipper than Wynton Marsalis ever hopes to be. But how, specifically, does Mr. Marsalis fall so short? We are never shown. 
 Mr. Leland's most vivid material, oddly, is about a fictional character: Bugs Bunny, the ultimate comic rebel, who even gets a chapter named after himself. (That chapter, about cartoons and their championing of ethnic self-reinvention, may be worth the book's price alone.) Bugs ''made his debut in circumstances of grave danger, calmly seeking enlightenment, as any hipster would,'' Mr. Leland writes. ''Staring down the barrel of a gun, he uttered his first words: 'Eh, what's up, doc?'''

HEADLINE: Fighting for Independence And a Mother's Acceptance

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
When Regina Ward decided, in the middle of her senior year of high school, to inform her mother that she was gay, she wrote her a letter.
 Ms. Ward's mother read it and asked, ''What is this?''
 ''It's exactly what it says,'' Ms. Ward replied. 
 Those are some of the last words they ever exchanged. 
 The women moved around each other in silence, sharing rooms but not conversation in their home in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. 
 ''In the letter I told her that I'm gay and that I'd like her to meet my girlfriend,'' Ms. Ward, now 20, said. ''She didn't really accept it. She stopped talking to me.''
 Ms. Ward, who wears rainbow-colored beads, a symbol of gay pride, and two silver female symbols on a chain around her neck, was once the captain of the girls' basketball team at Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn. She is a natural leader and was voted most valuable player. A former point guard, she knows how to respond to an offensive. So at age 18, after more than a month of silence, she left home. 
 ''My lifestyle makes me happy,'' Ms. Ward said. ''I can't hide it from people. I have to be me and let it be known.'' 
 But even a tough teenager craves a parent's approval, and Ms. Ward's rift with her mother took its toll. She lost interest in school and dropped out. 
 ''We only have one mother,'' Ms. Ward said from behind tinted sunglasses, her voice breaking. ''God forbid she dies and I have no relationship with her.'' 
 Turning to her father was not an option.
 ''My father's been in and out of my life, all my life,'' Ms. Ward explained. 
 And so the former star of the basketball team had to grow up fast. Luckily, she knows how to play hard. 
 After leaving home at 18, she stayed with a friend for a couple of months before moving into a homeless shelter in the Bronx in January 2003. She enrolled in security-guard training classes, found work at a nursing home, and by last November she was out of the shelter and living in her own apartment in the Bronx. The rent is $957; Ms. Ward pays $407, plus utilities. The remainder of the rent is paid with a Section 8 voucher. 
 ''The only thing I was missing was school,'' Ms. Ward said. ''I wanted to go to college.''
 Aiming to achieve that, Ms. Ward visited the Career Development Institute in the Bronx, which is run by the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 The institute offers services including employment exploration, occupational skills training and pre-G.E.D. and G.E.D. classes to economically disadvantaged adults ages 19 to 21. Ms. Ward, who found the institute through a friend, calls it her second home. She arrived there in March, took the G.E.D. exam in April and by May was running around the building telling anyone who would listen that she had passed. 
 ''My first shot taking the test, I passed!'' Ms. Ward said, sounding like a teenager for an instant. ''You just got to know what you want. Set goals for yourself.''
 She will enter Borough of Manhattan Community College's Small Business/Entrepreneurship Program in January, provided there are no problems with her financial aid paperwork. But tuition is still a concern, a potential obstacle to her goal of independence. Tuition, she says, costs $1,500 a semester. The employment and guidance service has helped her out by tapping the Neediest Cases for $500, which Ms. Ward will use to buy textbooks. 
 ''It's extremely important to give these kids a chance,'' said Rob Cameron, a case manager with the career institute. ''Regina is a success story. She really did this on her own. The money will be going to a good cause because she is so driven and self-motivated.''
 Ms. Ward now works as a security guard at the Staten Island Ferry terminal in Manhattan. But she plans to combine her two greatest loves, basketball and children, by opening her own recreation center one day. Naturally, she says, it will have a basketball court where she, too, can shoot hoops. 
 Basketball coaches at Borough of Manhattan Community College have approached her about joining the team, and Ms. Ward is looking forward to playing again. But what she really wants has nothing to do with basketball. 
 ''I want a relationship with my mom,'' Ms. Ward said. ''I want her to talk to me, to tell me how she feels.'' 
 Ms. Ward still sees her mother sometimes, at family gatherings, but words, she says, are few and far between.
 ''She's a very nice, caring person.'' Ms. Ward said. ''I get that from her.''
 What she is also hoping to get is a phone call. But that ball, she says, is in someone else's court.

HEADLINE: Our Smiles Are in the Mail

BYLINE: By Michelle Slatalla. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ACROSS America, many people face the same quandary when designing holiday cards. A nation wonders: Which family photo should I choose?
 What made my situation unusual last week was that in the photos under consideration, the look on my family members' faces was not one of good cheer. A more accurate description would have been abject terror.
 I am a very bad photographer. This year on vacation I took photos my family later called the Fear Series after I posed them at the edge of a cliff on Maui. As I peered through the viewfinder, urging my children to take just one more step backward, the littlest one asked if she was too young to write a will. 
 Other choices from my holiday portfolio include blurry shots, poorly composed shots and pictures in which my children's faces are partly obscured by a thumb over the lens.
 Yet like a growing number of card senders, I cannot imagine a holiday season in which I do not widely distribute a current photo of my family. Nearly 40 percent of Americans expect to receive a personalized photo card this year, according to a recent nationwide survey of 1,000 adults that RoperASW conducted for the online photo service Shutterfly.
 And I do not want to deny them.
 ''Photo cards are a growing trend, and it's because it's becoming easier to do more things with images than ever before,'' Bridgette Thomas, a Shutterfly spokeswoman, said. ''Upload images and you can send photo mugs, photo albums, framed photos. It has a viral effect. You receive this good-looking photo card and you think, 'Oh, if my friend can do this, I can, too.'''
 Unless you're my friend. Then you think, That poor little girl on the left is about to fall off a cliff.
 Not to be deterred, I turned to the Internet last week for help in designing a holiday card with a photo. At www.ofoto.com (where I bought holiday photo cards the past two years), chelseapaper.com, invitingsmiles.com and about a zillion other sites, I could browse a huge selection of photo cards. I could choose cards as simple as the classic flat photo card (58 cents apiece at photoworks.com) or as elaborate as one by Royal Imprints from finestationery.com ($8.40 a card, described as a pearlized fold-over card mounted atop a flat silver card with a silver sheer ribbon). 
 Although Ofoto still had the trusty, budget-conscious designs I'd chosen previously ($19.99 for a set of 20 cards and envelopes, $14 for each additional set), I was intrigued by the possibilities at www.shutterfly.com.
 Among Shutterfly's selection of photo cards (prices vary by quantity; they are 61 cents each for 50 cards if you order by the end of the month) and photo greeting cards ($1.43 each for 50 cards if you order by the end of the month) were more than 50 new holiday-theme borders like snowflakes, reindeer and Santa.
 This year Shutterfly has made it easier to send cards directly to recipients. Customers who use the direct mail service, which costs an additional 49 cents a card, upload their address books and can specify personalized messages for each card.
 Of all the styles at the Shutterfly site, I was partial to the no-border fold-over greeting card. 
 My plan was to upload a few photos to see how they looked online after I cropped them and played around with various effects like turning them into black-and-white or sepia-toned images.
 The Fear Series and the rest of my portfolio of thumbnail images were stored online at ofoto.com (I mailed film to Ofoto for developing months ago). I chose a few, then saved the thumbnails to my computer. From there I uploaded them to Shutterfly. 
 The process was seamless until I started designing the card. Trouble started on the page that said, ''Click here to choose a picture.''
 Shutterfly.com did not like my photo. ''Not recommended for printing,'' it told me.
 I clicked on Why?
 ''The resolution of your image is too low for the card,'' Shutterfly.com told me.
 Although this didn't come as a total surprise -- after all, for years people have been rolling their eyes at my blurry pictures -- I was disappointed. The picture, which depicted my husband and three daughters against a backdrop of palm trees, looked pretty good to me.
 In fact, the more I looked at the picture, the more I decided it was the perfect image for my holiday cards.
 Could I get away with using it in a smaller print size? This possibility led me to chelseapaper.com, a site that sells cards and stationery from nearly four dozen manufacturers. More important, it offers customized design advice.
 ''The first thing we do with a photo after you place an order is to hand-adjust it in our graphics department,'' Lauren Marrus, the chief executive of the Chelsea Paper Company, said. ''We may suggest different cropping, or play with contrast or coloring to sharpen the image, and then we send you a proof. Our paper is really nice. And savvy customers know they can ask for all kinds of things that aren't shown on the site, like italics or two different fonts.''
 Among Chelsea paper's selection of holiday photocards I found a small postcard (4 1/4 inches by 5 1/2 inches) on which my photo would be reduced to a size that looked no bigger than 2 inches by 2 inches.
 The price was steeper, $125 for 50 cards, but the design was simple and classic. And maybe the graphics department could save my photo.
 I placed my order, which totaled $129.95 (including $4.95 for shipping), and crossed my fingers.
 But the low-resolution problem still nagged me. The next morning I phoned Shutterfly to ask why the quality of my photos was so low. Could I really be that bad at taking pictures?
 After I explained the situation to Ms. Thomas, she said: ''Here's the thing: When you get the film developed, they don't put the high-resolution version of the picture on the site because the site is easier to use if there are not a lot of cumbersome files. The thumbnail version is low resolution, but if you order photos, the prints would be at an appropriate resolution.''
 I said: ''So, if I had sent you an actual print of the photo, it would have had better resolution?'' 
 She said: ''Yes. You need a photo with 300 dots per inch.''
 I hung up. I had a bad feeling about my pending order.
 Sure enough, I had an e-mail message waiting from Chelsea Paper's graphics department. 
 ''Hello, Michelle,'' it began. ''I have attached two PDF proofs of the front and back of your custom photo card. As you will see, the size of the photo on the page is not that large. That is because the quality of your photo is not as high as I would normally recommend. If you have a version of the photo that is higher resolution or bigger in size, I can easily substitute it.''
 All was not lost. One of the proofs attached to the e-mail message had a great design that repeated the photo, filmstrip style, across the card.
 I wrote back to say that I had ordered a higher-resolution print from Ofoto and that I would send it to Chelsea Paper as soon as it arrived.
 I received a prompt response: ''That's good news about your photo. Also, I am really glad you like the proof. There will be no additional charge to use the repeated photo design.''
 The cards are going to look really great. Emboldened, I started thinking ahead. Maybe next year I can persuade my family to do a group skydiving shot.

HEADLINE: Consumers Give Signs of a Free-Spending Holiday Season

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Jim Bernau is expecting to enjoy this Christmas a lot more than last year's. Mr. Bernau, the founder and president of Willamette Valley Vineyards of Salem, Ore., is used to seeing holiday-season sales begin in earnest right after Thanksgiving. But last weekend, people were already three deep at the counter of his winery's tasting room.
 ''This holiday season is going to ring some pretty loud bells,'' Mr. Bernau predicted. ''Consumers are definitely shaking off whatever was bothering them.'' 
 Wine is the kind of discretionary purchase that provides a good indication of how flush people are feeling. So as retailers nervously enter the all-important holiday season, the strong sales of a winery's pinot noirs, along with other indicators, suggest that consumers are poised to keep spending through the end of the year. Indeed, the pinot noirs on Mr. Bernau's Web site, www.willamettevalleyvineyards.com, sell for $17 to $50 a bottle. 
 Business in other areas is showing promise. Retail chain store sales rebounded from a dismal spring and summer to rise 1.3 percent in September and 0.8 percent in October. Last month, employers added 337,000 jobs, the most since March, and the help-wanted index compiled by the Conference Board, a barometer of future job demand, rose for the first time in three months.
 The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, after falling for three months in a row, finally ticked up this month.
 ''Things seem to be improving,'' said Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the National Retail Federation, the sector's trade group. ''We will have a solid holiday season, but not a spectacular one.''
 To be sure, consumer spending has slowed from the overall pace of the last few years -- when it grew right through the recession and then the weakest job-market recovery in recent decades. Behind that unusually strong growth -- normally, spending falls, at least briefly, during a recession -- were the lowest benchmark interest rates since the late 50's and a surge in home refinancing. 
 Now, as interest rates continue to rise, sustained job growth will be necessary for Americans to pay the bills on their oversubscribed credit cards and keep the economy afloat.
 But barring new emergencies -- another terrorist attack, oil prices soaring again or a flight from the dollar that pushes long-term interest rates up sharply -- analysts expect the economy to maintain its momentum.
 ''There is sufficient job growth to sustain income growth,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, a small investment advisory firm.
 Consumer spending has been on a roller-coaster ride this year. Americans slowed their buying spree abruptly in the spring as many were pummeled by the sharp rise in gasoline prices. The summer looked a little better as gas prices receded.
 Energy prices rebounded in September and October, but by then consumers seemed more used to the pain of expensive energy. Excluding vehicle sales, which have bounced around at the mercy of changing financial incentives by automakers, spending at retailers is back on an upward track.
 So while consumer spending may well slow in the final three months of the year from the torrid pace of the third quarter, when it increased 4.6 percent after adjusting for inflation, it is not likely to wilt.
 ''The gas shock is pretty much behind us,'' said Robert Mellman, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, adding that the higher heating oil prices expected this winter would pack a much lighter punch because they will be largely confined to customers in the Northeast and upper Midwest. 
 A survey released this week by the Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association found that consumers were more enthusiastic about holiday purchases than last year. 
 Consumers usually say that they will buy about the same or a little less than the year before, explained Bill Hampel, chief economist of the Credit Union National Association. But this year, 32 percent of those responding to the survey said they would cut spending, slightly less than the 34 percent that said so in 2003. Moreover, 17 percent of respondents said they would buy more -- the highest level since 2000.
 ''I don't see any lingering concerns,'' said Richard A. Feinberg, professor of consumer sciences and retailing at Purdue University. ''It will be a pretty solid holiday spending season for retailers.''
 Perhaps the more important question is how consumers will emerge from their holiday shopping into 2005, as rising interest rates can be expected to hinder spending by making the burden of increased debt harder to handle.
 With interest rates still relatively low, debt is providing a significant boost to consumption. The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will average 5.9 percent this quarter, the same as over the summer. It expects mortgage refinancing to reach $235 billion, about 10 percent more than during the summer.
 And the appetite for credit seems unsated. Consumer credit rose by 5.8 percent in September, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve, to more than $2.05 trillion. Credit card debt and other revolving loans soared 10 percent, the fastest increase since January. In September, consumer spending grew 0.6 percent, though wage income increased only 0.4 percent. 
 Americans' propensity to spend more than they earn drove the personal savings rate last quarter to merely 0.4 percent of disposable income -- the lowest on record.
 Yet only 38 percent of those responding to the survey by the consumer federation and the credit union association said they were concerned about meeting their consumer debts, down from 46 percent in 2003.
 ''If you offer people a free lunch, you shouldn't be surprised if they take it,'' Mr. Hampel said.
 Eventually, though, rising interest rates will bring the days of debt-powered hyper-consumption to a close. Real improvements in the number of jobs and in the level of wages will be needed to take debt's place.

HEADLINE: Google and Apple Lead Shares Higher in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday, with technology stocks Google and Apple Computer leading the way in quiet trading as Wall Street wound down for Thanksgiving.
 The technology strength helped the broader market offset another rise in oil prices. Crude oil futures closed above $49 a barrel, reversing an earlier tumble caused by a big rise in supplies of domestic distillate fuels. January crude futures settled at $49.44 a barrel, up 50 cents. 
 ''The two major things that are on the barometer right now are oil and the dollar,'' said Evan Olsen, head of equity trading at Stephens Inc.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 27.71 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,520.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 4.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,181.76. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 18.26 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,102.54.
 United States markets will be closed today for Thanksgiving and equity markets have shortened trading hours on Friday.
 ''It was very slow ahead of Thanksgiving,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. ''Equity investors were very cautious ahead of what is considered to be a four-day holiday for the market.'' Technology stocks were helped by Internet company gains. Goldman Sachs gave a boost to shares of the Web search company Google, giving it a $215 price target. 
 Google rose 4 percent, or $7.24, to $174.76, while Yahoo rose 3 percent, or $1.21, to $37.61 and the online marketplace eBay was up 2 percent, or $2.18, at $111.71.
 Apple, the maker of iPod, rose a second day after Piper Jaffray raised its price target on the stock to $100 from $52. It was up 4.5 percent, or $2.78, at $64.05.
 ''The bottom line is that Apple is clearly going into this holiday season with the iPod (music device), which appears to be the most popular downloading piece of equipment,'' Mr. Riley said.
 Chip stocks rose a day after an Advanced Micro Devices executive said that computer chip sales had recovered from a ''hiccup'' caused by anxiety surrounding the presidential election. Advanced Micro was up 18 cents at $21.57 and Intel rose 24 cents to $23.61.
 Economic news gave a modest boost to sentiment, with data showing that the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless pay shrank more than expected last week, to 323,000.
 But the dollar fell to fresh lows against the euro. While a falling dollar helps United States exports, it can weigh on the market as a whole as foreign investors are discouraged from investing in United States assets.
 Some department stores nudged ahead before the traditional start of the holiday-shopping season, which is the day after Thanksgiving. May Department Stores rose 29 cents, to $29.64.
 ''Department stores are up a touch today and people are anticipating a fairly firm and solid Christmas season,'' Mr. Riley said.
 Shares of restaurant companies were helped by news that tests of an animal suspected of having mad cow disease were negative. McDonald's rose 30 cents, to $30.40, but lost nearly two-thirds of its gain in after-hours trading. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to a price of 10013/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.20 percent from 4.18 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Sudan Rebels Say Government Bombed Village Camp, Killing 25

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Clashes continued near a strategically important provincial capital of the Darfur region on Wednesday, as rebel commanders said they had been bombed in one village even as they ceded control of another. 
 Suleiman Jamous, a senior commander with the rebel Sudan Liberation Army, said in a satellite telephone interview Wednesday evening that a government warplane had bombed a rebel camp in the village of Tadit, roughly 25 miles southwest of the North Darfur capital of El Fasher. Reuters quoted another rebel field commander as saying 25 fighters were killed in that raid. 
 Mr. Jamous also said the rebel army had vacated another town near El Fasher, called Tawilah, but denied capturing it in the first place, as the government and United Nations officials had said earlier this week. When government troops attacked a nearby village this week, he said, rebel forces chased them out of the village and into Tawilah. ''The S.L.A. did not attack Tawilah at all,'' he said. ''We did not capture the town.'' 
 The spokeswoman for the United Nations mission, Radhia Achouri, told reporters here in the capital on Wednesday that Tawilah was back under government control, but that the atmosphere remained tense. The United Nations' top envoy for Sudan, Jan Pronk, has criticized the rebel army for attacking Tawilah early Monday morning. He called it a clear violation of repeated cease-fire deals, the most recent of which was signed on Nov. 9 in Abuja, the Nigerian capital. 
 Aid workers rescued by helicopter from Tawilah on Monday reported retaliatory government airstrikes. But so far, neither the African Union, which is entrusted with monitoring cease-fire violations, nor United Nations officials have been willing to confirm the bombings.
 The political implications are clear. Government airstrikes, if confirmed, would constitute a violation of a security protocol agreed to by Khartoum barely two weeks ago in the peace talks in Abuja. Such a violation could potentially compel members of the United Nations Security Council -- particularly the United States, which has been fiercely critical of Khartoum's actions in Darfur -- to push for punitive measures, like economic sanctions. 
 Not surprisingly, each side blamed the other for the cease-fire violations, claimed to be acting in self-defense, and promised to abide by the truces made.
 Magzoub al-Khalifa Ahmed, the agricultural minister and the government's chief representative in Darfur negotiations, said he could not say whether the military had bombed Tawilah, but argued that it was well within the government's rights to use air power when attacked. 
 Ms. Achouri, the United Nations spokeswoman, disagreed, telling reporters on Wednesday that aerial bombings, if confirmed, would be ''a breach of the agreement.'' 
 Mr. Khalifa Ahmed said the government remained willing to resume negotiations with the rebels in Abuja on Dec. 10, as scheduled. ''We are highly committed to the cease-fire agreement,'' he said in an interview. But he added that the government ''has the right to use its air force in self-defense.''
 Likewise, Mr. Jamous stressed the rebel army's willingness to hew to a peace accord but vowed to keep fighting all the same. ''We are always ready to fight, but we are not violating the cease-fire,'' he said. ''If the government is bombing and sending troops to our places, we will not surrender to the government.''
 United Nations officials, however, have accused the rebels of breaking the ''spirit and letter'' of the Nov. 9 accord with their raid on Tawilah.

HEADLINE: Undermining the Pell Grants

 BODY:
Daunted by soaring costs, as many as a quarter of low-income students with grades and test scores that make them prime college material no longer even apply to college. This is bad news at a time when skilled jobs are moving abroad and a college diploma has become the minimum price of admission to the new economy. The Bush administration, however, has actually made this problem worse by cutting the federal Pell grant program, which was developed to encourage poor and working-class students to pursue higher education. 
 The cut could cause as many as 1.2 million low-income students to have their grants reduced -- and as many as 100,000 could lose their grants altogether. That inevitably means that students will either drop out or take longer to finish their degrees. 
 The Pell program, which is meant to help students pay for tuition and other expenses, like books and housing, has been gravely underfinanced for a long time. Congress has tried to mask the problem by tricky bookkeeping. In particular, Congress failed to revise the maximum grant to keep pace with rising costs. Left untouched for a decade, the aid formula is still capped at around $4,000 a year -- far less than what it takes to support a college student. 
 The Republican leadership tried to cut the Pell program by changing the formula for distributing the money in a way that would cut out students who had higher -- although still inadequate -- family incomes. The leaders backed off when middle-income families protested and student aid threatened to become an issue in the presidential campaign. 
 Back then, Congress agreed to hold off on any changes until it could look at the student aid problem as a whole during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which is due to come before the body next year. But with the election behind it, the administration slashed the program anyway, by roughly $300 million. Eliminating the resources to help needy and qualified students go to college will not even put a dent in the nation's growing deficit, but it will greatly diminish opportunities for upward mobility for the nation's youth.

HEADLINE: Afghan Poppy Fields

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Afghan Poppy Growing Reaches Record Level, U.N. Says'' (news article, Nov. 19):
 As Barnett Rubin of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University says in your article, counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan should concentrate on intercepting the narcotics at the borders and catching the big smugglers rather than on eradication. Eradication of poppy fields implies further intimidation of Afghanistan's economically weary rural area, as well as damage to its precarious agriculture. 
 What is really needed to stop poppy cultivation is agricultural reconstruction. For this, comprehensive, area-based agricultural and community development is necessary. This kind of effort has already been started by the Afghan government, United Nations agencies and donors like Japan and Britain.
 The United States, the largest donor to Afghanistan, is urged to help this effort. Eradication of poppy fields by American forces would only increase the anti-American feelings that already exist among the Afghan farmers.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Hylsamex To Build Indiana Plant

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Hylsamex, Mexico's third-largest steel maker, will invest $7 million to build a plant in Indiana. Starting in August 2005, the plant will manufacture panels for refrigeration rooms, made up of two steel sheets separated by a foam layer. The company expects the plant's sales to reach $40 million a year, Rafael Rubio, Hylsamex's deputy director of economic studies, said in a telephone interview from his office in Monterrey. The company has increased its sales and net profit this year as the price of steel and the demand for it have increased. Hylsamex's stock, the best performer among the 33 stocks in the Mexico stock index, rose 60 centavos, or 2.1 percent, to 29.6 pesos ($2.62), its highest level since August 1999.

HEADLINE: When Curtain Rises on Property Disputes, It Helps to Have a Program

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
LAND use battles -- development, design, planning, zoning and landmarks -- offer some of the best theater in New York City. The problem has been the lack of a playbill.
 Until last month, there was no comprehensive, timely guide to the workings of all of the arms of government involved in land use: the Board of Standards and Appeals, the Buildings Department, the City Council, the City Planning Commission and the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
 There is such a source now. CityLand, an illustrated monthly newsletter produced by the Center for New York City Law at New York Law School, highlights 20 or so significant decisions made in the previous month by the agencies, the Council and the courts, with brief narrative outlines and document citations. 
 ''They are some of the most readable descriptions of complicated and technical matters I have ever seen,'' said Lawrence A. Kobrin, a real estate partner at the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, who has represented William Zeckendorf Jr. and NBC in land use matters. ''It helps to make a public process really public.''
 The November issue notes the withdrawal of a proposal to build an apartment tower near the Brooklyn Bridge, reduction in height of a hotel designed by Enrique Norten in Harlem, rezoning of a Midtown parcel owned by Verizon to increase its development potential and restoration of the Lion House at the Bronx Zoo.
 ''For those of us who live and breathe land use, it's our 'must read,''' said Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission.
 With a deliberate just-the-facts tone, CityLand illuminates cases that have been overlooked in the general press. It is also a digest to the center's CityAdmin database (www.citylaw.org/cityadmin.php), a searchable online clearing house that offers at no charge the full text of 21,040 decisions -- and counting -- by 15 municipal agencies.
 ''I hope this will become the public library on land use in New York,'' said Ross Sandler, founding director of the center and a former city transportation commissioner. His principal associates in CityLand are Molly Brennan, the editor, and Melanie Cash, the associate director of the center.
 Usefulness carries a price. A one-year, 11-issue subscription to CityLand costs $400, roughly $1.50 a page. Mr. Sandler said about 175 subscribers have signed up, including a large number of architects and engineers. He said he hoped to arrange low-cost distribution to every community board and some civic organizations.
 Subscription revenue helps the center offer its CityAdmin database without any fees, Mr. Sandler said. The decisions are sent to the center by the agencies. ''They've been more than forthcoming,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''They've really been helpful.''
 Councilman Alan Jay Gerson said the lead item in the first issue, about a development on West Street in Lower Manhattan with which he is deeply involved, was ''fair and fine as far as it goes'' but did not cover parts of an agreement that were important to the community.
 BUT CityLand's bare-bones style has won the endorsement of a devoted government watcher, Sally Goodgold, the chairwoman emerita of the City Club of New York.
 ''It's independent, impartial,'' she said. ''You're hearing it the way it happened.'' Ms. Goodgold said there has been nothing like CityLand since the calendar of the Board of Estimate, which ended in 1990.
 That body, which exercised broad power over land use and city contracts, was made up of the mayor, the comptroller, the City Council president (as the public advocate was called) and the borough presidents. It met on Thursdays and sometimes well into Friday mornings in the large chamber at City Hall now occupied by the mayoral bullpen.
 Its agenda -- ''Prepared by Miss Jacqueline Galory, Calendar Director,'' as the title page always said -- could be larger than some phone books. For instance, the calendar for June 15, 1989, was two inches thick, covering 831 items in 888 pages. The items included useful summaries that gave the background of the issue, the pros and cons as expressed in public comments and the actions by various agencies.
 ''What Ross is doing is restoring a piece of people's ability to understand the city,'' Ms. Goodgold said, ''and even the city's ability to understand the city.''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Bows To Trade Unions At Stores in China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
It may be a big step for Wal-Mart, but a tiny step for China. 
 After years of opposing unions in the United States and around the world, Wal-Mart Stores said this week that it would allow a union at its operations in China.
 But the decision appears to reflect a bow to Chinese law more than a change in Wal-Mart's approach to unionization worldwide. 
 And perhaps just as important, unions have a different role in China: they work in close concert with management -- that is, when they are not the management itself -- and traditionally with the Communist Party. 
 Analysts were perplexed by the announcement, which read: ''Should associates request formation of a union, Wal-Mart China would respect their wishes.''
 Still, some said the move suggested that Wal-Mart might deal with worker issues somewhat differently than it had in the past. For years, the company has been harshly criticized for its labor practices. 
 The company, the world's largest retailer with about 5,000 stores worldwide, has not acknowledged a single union within its operations in the United States, and has vigorously opposed the formation of unions within Wal-Mart.
 ''This is a watershed event,'' said Eugene H. Fram, a professor of marketing at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a longtime observer of Wal-Mart's operations. ''This is the first time they've given acceptance without saying 'let's go to a union vote.''' But many other analysts and union officials said it was unclear whether Wal-Mart, which has 40 stores and about 20,000 employees in China, intended to allow a real union to take shape here or whether a strong union could even be created, given the current status of labor organizations in China. 
 Unions in China operate very differently from independent unions in the United States or elsewhere. Rarely, for instance, do unions in China oppose management or press for higher wages or better working conditions, specialists say.
 ''Setting up a union won't make much difference on workers' wages because in most cases the union in China acts as a subsidiary to the employer and rarely represents the workers and fights for higher wages,'' said Fei Li, a retailing specialist at the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
 There have been small signs of independent union activity in China, however, which could be a challenge to the government-run unions. Workers in Guangzhou recently went to court to fight their company's decision to appoint a high-level manager as the head of the union.
 And other labor groups have been pressing multinational companies to improve their working conditions.
 The Wal-Mart announcement came after months of pressure from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a government-run umbrella organization. The federation had recently threatened to sue Wal-Mart and other multinational companies, like Dell and Samsung, if they did not allow the formation of unions here.
 Wal-Mart -- which operates huge procurement centers in China -- acknowledged the federation in its news release and said that it planned to comply with Chinese law, which allows the formation of unions in companies with 25 employees or more.
 Wal-Mart executives often say unions are unnecessary within the company. Managers, they say, like to deal directly with employees, not through third parties or unions.
 For that reason, the Wal-Mart announcement surprised union officials in the United States and Canada, many of whom are still battling with Wal-Mart over the formation of unions.
 Union officials welcomed the announcement but said they were skeptical about whether Wal-Mart would actually allow workers in China to form an effective, independent union.
 ''We're happy that the Chinese have forced Wal-Mart to come in compliance with the law,'' said Greg Denier, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in Washington. ''Wal-Mart always tries to deny workers a voice in the workplace, so let's see what happens.''

HEADLINE: Political Self-Celebration in a Library Guise

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: INDEPENDENCE, Mo., Nov. 23 

 BODY:
That legendary sign ''The Buck Stops Here'' gets prominent display at the Truman Presidential Museum and Library, along with a cautionary disclaimer that it is ''unclear how long it sat'' on Truman's Oval Office desk. But the sign, and its appearance here, provide a bracing contrast to the sensations inspired by the new William J. Clinton Presidential Center, 400 miles away in Little Rock, Ark. 
 Some similarities might be expected. Both William Jefferson Clinton and Harry S. Truman were Democratic presidents sometimes facing hostile Republican-dominated Congresses; both were born without inheritance or distinguished lineage; both spent their early years in small towns with metaphorically powerful names (respectively, Hope and Independence); and both proclaimed allegiance to liberal principles of government. 
 Truman was also the first president to create a library under the provisions of the 1955 Presidential Libraries Act, and Mr. Clinton the latest, and so both raised private money for their institutions before turning the buildings, with their papers, over to the government. 
 But between 1957, when Truman's library cost $1.75 million ($11.8 million today), and last week, when the $165 million Clinton Center made its debut with festivities drawing 30,000 visitors to Little Rock, lies an immense cultural and political divide. At the very least, it is difficult to imagine Truman's desk sign asserting accountability and responsibility (let alone something like the careful disclaimer that accompanies it) on display in Little Rock. 
 The institutional goals may even be different. Truman said that he hoped his library would provide ''a better understanding of the history and the nature of the presidency and of the government of the United States.'' And, at least on the surface, the widely cited statistics about the Clinton Center would seem to suggest its own documentary and educational ambitions. It is the largest of the 11 presidential libraries now administered by the National Archives and Records Administration. It houses more than 35,000 cubic feet of archival material, including 80 million documents, 2 million photographs, videos and electronic files. The main-floor exhibition space is designed by Polshek Partnership Architects of New York to look like the library in Trinity College, Dublin. As the center's publicity material stresses, it is also meant to be experienced ''the same way you would browse a library.'' 
 But the archival materials are in inaccessible boxes behind bars, held in bookshelves that divide the space into alcoves. And browsing, in this case, means hearing Mr. Clinton's voice every few feet, speaking from multiple monitors, delivering State of the Union addresses or making stump speeches, his voice punctuated by historical films and comments from admirers and staff members. After a few minutes, you yearn to see a stereotypical librarian, finger to the lips, sternly make her way through the room. Except that the exhibits, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates in New York, make it seem as if a political campaign had taken over and would allow no interference. 
 Every object, every piece of text, every sound is harnessed in service to an almost relentless message about Mr. Clinton's achievements. According to Mr. Appelbaum, Mr. Clinton was ''the editor in chief, the curator in chief and sometimes the art director, all of which is quite appropriate.''
 The library's center hall is lined with gray slabs, each presenting the timeline for a year in Mr. Clinton's administration. Each timeline also has three sections, emphasizing what Mr. Clinton sees as the main themes for his accomplishments: ''One America,'' ''One World'' and ''The Economy.'' And each alcove highlights a specific Clintonian credit, including: ''Putting People First,'' ''Building a Global Community,'' ''Preparing for New Threats,'' ''Protecting the Earth,'' ''Making Communities Safe'' and ''Restoring the Economy.'' 
 Historical background is presented only to show accomplishment. Crime graphs drop. Economic graphs rise. Terrorism is fought. Evidence numbingly repeats itself (as do exculpations). There seems nothing -- from community policing to tax cuts to fighting terrorism -- for which credit is not claimed. Even a stock ticker heralds the climactic prices of stocks in 2000, taking no notice of the imminent collapse. As for the administration's scars, if all else is a record of social improvement, moral vision and consummate governance, then doesn't any attempt to challenge that record or its claims have to represent extraordinary villainy? Perspectives of serious critics are nonexistent. And the discussion of challenges to Mr. Clinton's positions is restricted to an alcove, ''The Fight for Power.'' These challenges become part of a series of ''Ideological Battles'' in which Republican Congressional leaders engaged in ''Politics of Personal Destruction'' and endorsed dangerous beliefs in ''Isolationism and Unilateralism.'' 
 There is the brief confession of a ''serious mistake'' in Mr. Clinton's personal life -- his encounters with Monica Lewinsky -- about which he had ''not been forthcoming.'' But his opponents, that exhibit argues, ''fueled the media's hunger for constant scandal, real or imagined.'' With his impeachment proceedings, they were ''attempting to deny the very legitimacy of the president's election.'' 
 Mr. Clinton's interpretation, of course, is not totally idiosyncratic; many hold similar views. But here as elsewhere, it is not really clear what the era's debates were about because the exhibits paint with such a broad brush and use such a limited palette. At any rate, the assertion of sweeping innocence and sweeping villainy does not quite bear historical scrutiny. 
 Any more subtle scrutiny might be irrelevant, despite the center's trappings of high learning. The main point seems to be self-celebration. The political is personal. This may be the temptation of every such institution. Every president will want to present himself in the best possible light. Even the Truman Presidential Museum and Library contains a room that serves as a memorial shrine. And if the Clinton Center has a full-scale replica of the Oval Office as he used it, the Truman library has one that is nearly full-size. 
 But at least the Truman library addresses the problem of self-promotion head-on in its exhibits, which were remade in 2001. Truman's years as president marked the end of World War II, the dropping of the atomic bomb, the beginning of the cold war, McCarthyism, the Korean War and immense social change. The museum notes that there are a ''variety of perspectives'' and ''conflicting conclusions'' about Truman's role, and that the exhibits offer ''one interpretation.'' Those exhibits also include flip books that include comments by politicians of the period, along with contemporary scholars, disagreeing with Truman's decisions to drop the atomic bombs or contain Soviet Communism. Meanwhile, letters and documents expand one's understanding of the Marshall Plan or the Berlin airlift. 
 Truman's library, that is, makes the president an actor within history. Clinton's library makes him the focus of history. Arranged below each year's timeline, for example, are loose-leaf notebooks containing every one of the president's daily schedules for eight years. Most of these are uninformative, containing notices of meetings, jogs, down time and travels. And instead of showing important documents that might shed light, for example, on the failure of the Middle East peace talks, displays include flattering letters from celebrities like Oscar de la Renta, Chevy Chase, Tony Danza, Whoopi Goldberg (''You're the cat's pajamas'') and Dom DeLuise (''When I grow up I want to be just like you''). 
 The dominant impression is of a grand party that was disrupted in 2000 but that might one day be resumed under other auspices. In fact, extending out over the main floor, are two mannequins in dinner dress, standing next to a formally set White House table. They establish the tone for the exhibition's final displays of state gifts, White House kitsch and gifts from well-wishers. 
 Such items are the stuff of all such museums, but here the scale is daunting. This is true even when it comes to private fund-raising, which requires no accountability. As The Washington Post reminded readers last week, President Clinton's pardon of the financier Marc Rich was accompanied by a $450,000 donation by his former wife, Denise Rich, to the foundation raising money for the Clinton Center. 
 Given the ways in which presidential libraries are established, some of this is to be expected. But if these libraries are then to become public institutions, representing America's heritage, some other approach is required.
 One of Mr. Clinton's best lines is in his 1993 inaugural address: ''There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.'' One achievement of the Clinton Center might be to draw attention to what is wrong with the financing and design of presidential ''libraries.''

HEADLINE: Powell Says Ukraine Vote Was Full of Fraud

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that the voting in Ukraine's presidential election was riddled with fraud and that the United States could not accept a victory by Victor F. Yanukovich as legitimate.
 In an unusually tough statement that some diplomats said could widen a breach with Russia, which openly backed Mr. Yanukovich, Mr. Powell also warned that there would be ''serious consequences'' to the American-Ukraine relationship if allegations of fraud were not cleared up. 
 ''We cannot accept this result as legitimate because it does not meet international standards and because there has not been an investigation of the numerous and credible reports of fraud and abuse,'' he said. ''It is still not too late for Ukrainian authorities to find a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people.''
 Mr. Powell's comments, delivered at the State Department, came as protests have spread in Kiev over an election on Sunday that has been criticized by international monitors, including Senator Richard G. Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as by the European Union.
 The State Department said Mr. Powell had been engaging in intense diplomatic discussions behind the scenes to try to avert a showdown with Ukraine, and by extension with Moscow. He has urged both sides to be restrained in handling street protests, an official said.
 Worries about Ukraine's election have been a part of Bush administration thinking for months, administration officials said, especially because the balloting had become a test of wills between two candidates over relations with Moscow. Mr. Yanukovich backs close ties to Russia, and his opponent, Viktor A. Yushchenko, has called for closer ties to the West.
 Those concerns have mounted as relations with Moscow have grown strained over several other issues, including the crackdown by President Vladimir V. Putin on dissent and on the free press, what is seen as Russia's meddling in the affairs of neighboring countries and the use of state powers to favor political allies.
 Despite warnings by the Bush administration to Russia not to interfere in the internal politics of another former Soviet republic, Georgia, Mr. Putin openly campaigned for Mr. Yanukovich. That sent a signal that Moscow preferred Ukraine to be part of the Russian sphere of influence as in cold war days.
 It was not clear what sort of ''consequences'' Mr. Powell was referring to. A State Department official said the United States was not ready to consider any cutoff in aid or economic cooperation, particularly aid that has paid for the dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear weapons left over from the cold war. 
 Last year, the United States gave Ukraine $227 million to promote democratic reforms, help establish a market economy, support security and provide relief aid. Since the 1990's, the United States has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine's nuclear disarmament.
 Mr. Powell called on Ukrainian leaders to explore various alternatives to defuse the situation and added that ''one suggestion'' was to hold another election. Among other suggestions, a State Department official said, is selective voting in areas where the evidence of fraud was especially obvious, or some kind of power-sharing arrangement.
 In pressing for solutions to the problem over the last few days, Mr. Powell spoke on the telephone to the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine and to senior European envoys, including the European Union's foreign minister, Javier Solana, the State Department said. 
 The State Department's top official in charge of relations with Europe, A. Elizabeth Jones, has also been in contact with Ukrainian, Russian and other ambassadors.
 Administration officials spoke to concerns that relations between President Bush and Mr. Putin could be damaged, saying Mr. Powell and other American officials were arguing that neither Russia nor the United States had an interest in an unstable situation in Ukraine.
 ''We have common cause because none of us wants to see a politically unstable Ukraine,'' a State Department official said. ''It can't serve anyone's interest to have a president who lacks popular legitimacy.''
 Mr. Powell, asked whether the election results reflected Russian interference in Ukraine, said he preferred not to comment.
 ''What we stand for is free, fair, open elections,'' he said, adding: ''What I would rather do is concentrate on how we get out of, and how the Ukrainians get out of the difficult situation they find themselves in. At a later time, one can talk about how we got into this situation.''

HEADLINE: China's Latin Business Trip

 BODY:
Latin America has not gotten much sustained attention from Washington recently, but it has begun drawing remarkable high-level interest from Beijing. While President Bush managed only a four-hour stopover in Colombia on his way home from last weekend's Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Chile, China's president, Hu Jintao, has just completed a 12-day four-country trip in which he announced more than $30 billion in new Chinese investments in Latin America. Mr. Hu also signed a number of long-term supply contracts to fuel Beijing's torrid economic expansion for years to come. 
 China's growing economic involvement is largely positive for Latin America. It brings much-needed capital for modernizing creaky infrastructure and expanding the production of raw materials from mining to agriculture. There will also be painful adjustments, however, as swelling volumes of new Chinese manufacturing exports displace less efficient Latin American competitors. 
 For the United States, still the region's largest economic partner, China's increased presence poses no economic or strategic threat. It may, however, have the healthy side effect of spurring Washington to stop taking the region for granted and to begin paying more heed to its lagging development, dangerously uneven income distributions and deep misgivings about growing United States unilateralism in international affairs.
 Mr. Hu's travels took him to Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Cuba. China is now Brazil's second-largest trading partner, buying large amounts of iron ore, bauxite and soybeans. Last month it displaced the United States to become the leading purchaser of Chilean copper. 
 In Argentina, Mr. Hu unveiled nearly $20 billion in new Chinese investments, much of it in railways and energy exploration. In Cuba, China's main interest is nickel. A similar trade dynamic is already well under way in Australia and Southeast Asia, where Mr. Hu made last year's Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Thailand the centerpiece of a regional economic and diplomatic sales tour. 
 Historically, Latin America has suffered from the notorious volatility of international commodity markets. The promise of steadily increasing demand from the robust Chinese economy is clearly welcome. So is the prospect that Washington may become more attentive to Latin concerns as it competes to maintain its traditional diplomatic influence in the region.

HEADLINE: Paying more attention to corefinancial values, rather than moral values, may be the Democratic Party's answer.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His most recent book is ''Why Economies Grow'' (Basic Books/Century Foundation). E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
DESPITE all the talk that the presidential election turned on the issue of moral values, it turns out that economics did indeed matter, and mattered a lot. 
 Those households with incomes above $50,000 benefited most from President Bush's tax cuts, and they voted decisively for him. In fact, according to the surveys of voters leaving the polls, the higher the income, the more the support for Mr. Bush. 
 And those households with incomes below $50,000 generally voted for Senator John Kerry. The poorer the household, the more likely its members voted Democratic. 
 But the below-$50,000 group did not completely break Mr. Kerry's way. In particular, consider those households with incomes of $30,000 to $50,000 a year. In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton won this demographic slice. In 2000, Al Gore split it evenly with Mr. Bush, and that happened again with Mr. Kerry. Not counting minorities, Mr. Kerry probably lost the group by a substantial margin.
 Yet these are the households most hurt by a changing economy, and they were once consistently Democratic, counting on the party's social policies to help keep them afloat as their incomes shrank. In 1979, the average hourly wage for a male high school graduate was $16.32 in 2003 dollars, according to the latest edition of ''The State of Working America,'' published every two years by the Economic Policy Institute. In 2003, the average wage was $15.07. 
 Moreover, only about one of three recent high school graduates now looking for work will receive health insurance on the job. In 1979, two out of three entry-level jobs for high school graduates provided health insurance. 
 Why couldn't Mr. Kerry capture more of these voters? Some political analysts say they may be lost to the Democratic Party. They turned against government and the Democrats in the late 1970's, when inflation was soaring under President Jimmy Carter. According to an analysis done in the early 1980's by Douglas A. Hibbs Jr., then a Harvard professor of government, nearly 80 percent of Americans had come to believe by April 1980 that government spending caused inflation. 
 But if economic frustration is at least partly behind this change, then a presidential campaign that emphasized strong policies for economic growth and reviving wages might bring them back. 
 Even if moral issues were the reason Mr. Kerry lost voters, economic frustration may well be behind the rise of some of these values. ''It should not be surprising at all,'' said Richard Sennett, the New York University sociologist whose latest book is ''Respect in a World of Inequality'' (Norton, 2003). ''When people are confronted with uncertain economic times, of course they would turn to cultural certainty.'' 
 Promising credible economic relief may have reduced anxieties about moral differences with the Democrats. But Mr. Kerry often diverted to other issues. 
 There is another reason to think a good economic plan might have overcome the moral questions. Moral values have been an issue in several recent elections. As two specialists on public opinion polls, Robert J. Blendon and John M. Benson, both of Harvard University, point out, surveys of voters leaving the polls that are conducted by The Los Angeles Times have included a question about moral values since 1992. Voters have consistently ranked moral values as either the first or the second most important reason for making their decision.
 Yet a Democrat, Mr. Clinton, won in 1992 and 1996, and Mr. Gore won at least the popular vote in 2000. Mr. Kerry may not have had the same appeal on moral values, but Mr. Blendon and Mr. Benson say they also believe that a solid economic plan could have wooed more voters.
 What is the source of the Democrats' inability to connect convincingly with their old base? The answer requires a little economic perspective. Despite the Clinton economic boom of the late 1990's, America's economic growth has been at historically low levels since the early 1970's. Had this country grown at the rates that were normal in America beginning in the late 1800's, revenue from federal taxes levied on that income growth would have been much higher than they are today, as economists like Martin Baily and Paul Krugman pointed out years ago. 
 A reasonable estimate is that the federal government would have had at least $300 billion more a year to spend, and probably more. With more revenue for social programs, Democrats could talk like real Democrats. Instead, they often try to offer social programs that appear costless, like Mr. Kerry's modest rules to limit the outsourcing of American jobs. 
 Mr. Kerry's first mistake was making the deficit the linchpin of his economic plan. He, like President Bush, would have cut the federal deficit in half in five years on the way to balancing the budget in 10 years. Even the credibility of his interesting but complex health care plan was undermined because balancing the budget would leave little, if any, room for expanding social policies. 
 Mr. Kerry's second error was to promise tax reductions to the middle class. More consistent with Mr. Kerry's position would have been to claim that the American government has too much work to do to cut taxes. Economists at the Economic Policy Institute point out that federal taxes as a proportion of the gross domestic product now come to just over 16 percent, the lowest level since the 1950's. Are Democrats bound to reduce them still more? 
 A third possibility for Mr. Kerry might have been to seek more federal revenue in indirect ways. He occasionally alluded to such possibilities, but never forcefully enough to make an impact. He could have argued more strongly to raise the salary ceiling on Social Security taxes, which is now about $88,000 a year. The ceiling on allowable home mortgage interest deductions could also be lowered.
 President Bush claimed that the country could have tax cuts, pay for the war in Iraq, and have a good education and health care system at the same time. With more revenue to spend, Democrats need not have seemed like they, too, were trying to offer Americans a pipe dream. Mr. Kerry could have proposed a better health care plan. He could also have called for a stronger safety net for those who lose jobs because of globalization or technological change, including access to community colleges rather than just job training. 
 Economics did matter this time around. If Democrats think they lost simply on moral values, they are missing the message.

HEADLINE: Africa Needs a Million More Health Care Workers, Report Says

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Africa needs to nearly triple the number of its health workers if it is to reverse plummeting life expectancies and combat pandemics of disease, a research group of more than 100 scholars and experts said in a report released today.
 So far, the global health debate has focused on lowering prices for AIDS drugs and increasing financial aid from wealthy countries. But money and drugs will fail unless poor countries have enough people to tend the sick, according to the research group, the Joint Learning Initiative, financed by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others. 
 ''These are not sexy issues like a miracle drug, but they hark back to the core issues of health,'' said Dr. Lincoln Chen, an author of the report and the director of Global Equity Center at Harvard. 
 The academics, health officials and other specialists in the Joint Learning Initiative said rich countries must take steps to slow what the report calls ''fatal flows'' of nurses and doctors from poor African countries to Europe and North America. By the group's calculations, Africa needs a million more health workers.
 Wealthy nations must educate enough of their own nationals, the group says, rather than rely on doctors and nurses whose training has been paid for by African countries that are losing the fight against disease. The African Union estimates that poor countries subsidize rich ones with $500 million a year through the migration of health workers.
 The group of specialists also supports growing efforts to channel doctors and nurses from rich countries, as well as from nations that willingly export health workers -- Cuba, Egypt, India and the Philippines -- to volunteer in Africa. It mentioned that the Institute of Medicine in the United States has recommended an AIDS corps of American professionals to help care for and treat people with H.I.V./AIDS.
 The Joint Learning Initiative also called for the creation of an education fund that would pay to educate tens of thousands of health workers who are not doctors and nurses but are trained to diagnose and treat major killers in Africa -- pneumonia, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis -- as well as to perform basic life-saving surgeries like Caesarean sections. 
 Such workers, used for decades in many African countries, are not attractive to employers in Western nations that rely on credentialed professionals.
 African countries had banded together at the international assembly of the World Health Organization this year to push rich countries to compensate them for the loss of migrating health workers, but the group said in its report that computing who should pay how much and to whom was impractical in the fluid and largely undocumented global market for health professionals.
 Instead, it said rich countries should voluntarily contribute to an education fund.
 ''Political pressures and public embarrassment are likely to grow as manpower shortages in the midst of health crises become linked to rich country's poaching of medical workers from those same countries,'' the Joint Learning Initiative's report said.
 The Joint Learning Initiative commissioned studies that documented the importance of health workers in lowering death rates for infants, children under 5 and women in childbirth, controlling for the effects of higher income and female literacy in each country. 
 Researchers found that mortality rates fell with the rise of health worker density, defined as the number of doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 people.

Amgen Withdraws Drug, Spurring Patient Outcry
Earlier this year, Amgen, the biotechnology company, decided to withdraw an experimental drug for Parkinson's disease. The move has provoked an outcry from patients who say the company is robbing them of their only hope.
 Amgen said the drug had not proved better than a placebo. In fact, some patients in the trial who improved the most had received a placebo. [Page A1.]

Yukos Executives Leave Russia
Top executives at the Russian oil giant Yukos, including the company's American chief executive, Steven M. Theede, left, and the chief financial officer, have left the country, saying they fear prosecution as part of the company's power struggle with the Kremlin. No formal charges have been filed against any American or other expatriate employee at Yukos. [C4.]

Gazprom, about to become the world's largest energy company, is effectively controlled by the Russian government. Therein lies potential rewards and risks for investors. [C4.]

Steel Shortage Afflicts Nissan
Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest carmaker, said that a shortage of steel would force temporary halts in production at three of its four auto factories in Japan, an unusual step made necessary in part because of a surge in demand for steel in China. [C5.]

Japan's Exports Hit a Record
Strong demand for ships, autos and iron lifted Japanese exports to a record high in October, easing concerns about a slowdown in one of the most important sectors of the economy. [C5.]

Oil and steel stocks helped lift European markets, as dealers reported healthy trading volumes in some areas. Europe's main market indexes closed higher, despite the dollar sinking to a new low against the euro. [C5.]

'Housewives' Episode Imitates Life
A promotional ploy that helped ''Desperate Housewives'' become a hit for ABC has turned up during an episode of the show, in another example of how art imitates life -- and how advertising imitates them both. Before the premiere of the television series, marketing executives and a media planning agency came up with some unconventional promotions to help the show stand out. Among the promotions: plastic dry-cleaning bags with ads for the show. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C2.]

3 Lawyers for Scrushy Drop Out
Three prominent lawyers representing Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of HealthSouth, have dropped out of his criminal fraud trial. The government has accused Mr. Scrushy of directing a scheme to inflate HealthSouth's earnings and assets. [C5.]

HEADLINE: The Lure Of Private Waters

BYLINE: By SUZANNE HAMLIN

 BODY:
WHEN Lex Browning, 13, recently landed a big brown trout from the waters of Spruce Creek, he reeled it in, leaned down and kissed the 24-inch, four-pound fish on the head. And why not? It may have been one of the priciest fish ever caught. His father, Keith Browning, a vice president for sales at the Copeland Corporation, a manufacturer of refrigerator compressors and air-conditioning units in Dayton, Ohio, had paid more than $50,000 for the privilege of fishing on the trout-filled waters controlled by the Spring Ridge Club, probably the country's most exclusive fishing club.
 Tucked into the rolling farmland of central Pennsylvania, close by the Allegheny Mountains, Spring Ridge offers its members a cluster of cabins, cottages and lodges on 125 acres at the confluence of the Little Juniata River and Spruce Creek. More important for its members, the club leases almost 10 miles of trout-fishing waters, with ''beats,'' or sections of river, on Spruce Creek, the Little Juniata, Yellow and Penns Creeks and Warriors Mark Run. Equally rich in trout, the beats vary in water flow and vegetation. ''That's what makes it so interesting,'' said Jack Rivkin, the chief investment officer of the Neuberger Berman investment firm in Manhattan, and a Spring Ridge member. 
 There are, of course, thousands of fishing clubs in this country, often informal groups of friends who fish one spot or travel together to legendary streams. But they often have to fish in crowded waters and stay in places far from the streams. And there are also thousands of rod and gun clubs with modest annual dues, but they often have large memberships and limited territory on which to hunt or fish.
 What sets Spring Ridge apart is that it combines low-key camaraderie with guaranteed access to miles of trout-rich riverfront. Donny Beaver, the club's founder, grew up fishing in the area. After operating an environmental clean-up manufacturing company, Mr. Beaver ran a local fly-fishing outfitter and then, in 2001, started Spring Ridge. (His adult lifetime goal, Mr. Beaver said, was to be a full-time fly fisherman by the time he was 40. He is now 52.)
 His innovation was to lease stretches of river from nearby landowners, giving his members access to many different streams in the area; all of the water runs through beds of limestone chalk, an environment that encourages plant growth, which in turn attracts insects, making a seductive habitat for beautiful large trout.
 To get access to those waters, club members now pay a membership fee of about $75,000, plus thousands in annual dues and incidental expenses (members pay for overnight accommodations and meals at the club's main lodge). Over the club's three years of operation, it has grown to 70 paying members, with more spots opening up as Spring Ridge adds new sections of river to its holdings. If a member decides to leave, the original membership fee can be refunded; membership can also be handed down within a family.
 Part of the appeal is the on-site housing -- simple but luxuriously outfitted cabins and lodges spotted around the central property. There is a chef, a local cook who prepares notably good dinners in the main lodge, where a huge country breakfast is served each morning and packed lunches can be picked up for a day of fishing.
 The idea of paying for exclusive access to resorts and accommodations has become increasingly popular over the last few years, from members-only ski mountains to companies like Exclusive Resorts, which offers members resort residences and lodges everywhere from Whistler, British Columbia, to Florence, Italy. For those, members can pay as much as $375,000 in membership fees, plus up to $25,000 in annual fees. In comparison, Spring Ridge is a modest investment.
 Not that economics is a big issue for many of the members, who can -- and do -- fish anywhere in the world. Mr. Rivkin, for instance, has his own ranch with a river running through it in Argentina. But, he said, ''Spring Ridge is like home waters for me. I can drive there in four hours, I can take my family if I want, and learn something every time from the extremely patient, knowledgeable guides.''
 FOR landowners along the coveted riverfront, leasing to Spring Ridge means they get replenished and carefully maintained waters. Spring Ridge only allows catch-and-release fishing by its members and their guests, and only six fly fishers are allowed at any one time along a mile of stream; then that mile is rested for a day before fishing resumes.
 Members say they have found not only a private enclave where they can indulge their fishing habit, but a model for the future of fly-fishing, which has become a victim of its own success, with streams overpopulated by people and underpopulated by fish. 
 ''Not that there wasn't some grumbling along the river,'' said Lefty Kreh, at 80 an influential fishing writer and teacher, and a charter member of Spring Ridge. ''A lot of these landowners had just opened up their streams to anyone with a fishing license before, and people began to think they were public waters.''
 In fact, the state of Pennsylvania filed suit against Mr. Beaver and others last year over access to a stretch of the Little Juniata River, where, the state claimed, Mr. Beaver and his employees had posted ''No Trespassing'' signs and erected cables across the waterway to keep out nonmember anglers.
 At issue is whether the river should be considered navigable, in which case public access to it may not be denied, as long as those who would like to fish it don't trespass on private land to do so. The case is in discovery and no court date has been set yet, according to Kurt Knaus, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
 Mr. Beaver said that the river has never been declared navigable and that ''we believed that it was private property and we could manage it.'' Any barriers have been removed until the court finally decides the matter, he said.
 River access was not such a problem before fly-fishing surged in popularity in the 1990's, driven in large part by Robert Redford's 1992 film, ''A River Runs Through It,'' starring both Brad Pitt and Montana's fly-fishing country. While there are no hard numbers for just how many people started fly-fishing in the movie's wake, according to a 1999 survey prepared for the American Fly Fishing Trade Association, of the 10.9 million people who had gone fly-fishing in the last year, almost 40 percent of them had taken up the sport in the last decade. ''I'm not the only one who hates that film,'' Mr. Rivkin said.
 Now, many old-time fishing enthusiasts say the piscine population has been stressed by over-fishing. ''Many years ago, when there were more fish and less people, fly-fishing didn't make much of an impact,'' Mr. Kreh said. ''But now, if a certain amount of public water is not put into private hands, we're going to be in trouble.''
 In some parts of the country, the native brook trout population is perhaps just 5 percent of its historic levels during Colonial times, said Tim Zink, manager of media relations for the national conservation organization Trout Unlimited. Though most of that fall-off is due to industrialization in the first half of the 20th century, irresponsible fishing and environmental factors continue to harm fish, he said.
 Indeed, for many Spring Ridge members, part of the club's appeal is the environmental stewardship and the sense of continuity between generations -- that it is a place they can bring their children to fish and perhaps, one day, leave to them. ''Besides the terrific fishing, the idea that I can go with my family is very important to me,'' said Mr. Browning, who is often joined on his fishing trips by his three children and his wife, Pam. 
 Robert G. Freedline, the treasurer of Viacom, can spontaneously make the trip from his TriBeCa home to Spring Ridge in about four hours. ''I lead a hectic professional life, and fishing takes me somewhere else altogether,'' he said. ''You really can't concentrate on anything else when you're in a beautiful, tranquil setting and focused entirely on catching that fish.'' With trips to Spring Ridge, plus expeditions to fish everywhere from Russia to Patagonia, Mr. Freedline, who didn't fish at all for almost 20 years, now fishes almost every weekend. 
 ''I don't think many people could pull this off,'' Mr. Rivkin added, ''but I'm hoping maybe Donny can eventually do something similar in other parts of the country. And club members would, of course, have reciprocal rights.''

RIVER BEDS
Where the Wet and Wild Things Are
 THE village of Spruce Creek, Pa., about 19 miles west of State College, is where Spruce Creek flows into the Little Juniata River, joining two of Pennsylvania's finest limestone-bed trout streams. The nearest airport is in State College. Spruce Creek is a four-to-five-hour drive from New York City. It is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Washington.
 The privately owned Spruce Creek Lodge (814-632-8550; www.sprucecreeklodge.com) has about a half-mile of private water and is adjacent to public waters owned by Pennsylvania State University. Up to four guests at a time stay in the lodge, which has a kitchen, two bedrooms and two sleeper sofas in other rooms.
 A two-day fishing trip, with lodging and two guides, is $2,400 for four people. Guests usually bring their own supplies and cook for themselves, but there are restaurants and other amenities nearby. 
 The Spring Ridge Club (814-632-5827; www.springridgeclub.com) nearby, a private fishing club with its own lodging and guides, leases about 10 miles of trout waters.
 The current membership deposit is about $75,000; annual dues for 2005 will be $4,260. Food -- it has a chef -- and lodging are additional. As Spring Ridge adds more streams, it will begin to accept more members, expanding its present base of 70 paying members.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Fall Pushes Gold Above $450

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
With the dollar hitting a third straight day of record lows against the euro on Thursday, gold rose above $450 an ounce for the first time in more than 16 years, driven by investors looking for an alternative to the American currency. 
 ''Gold bulls should be dancing in the street,'' Barclays Capital said in an investment note. Gold, which is priced in dollars, has risen by about 13 percent in the past two months.
 The newest high for the euro came in light European trading with American markets closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. The euro touched an all-time high of $1.3282 before settling back slightly. 
 Gold -- a traditional safe haven in troubled markets -- reached $452.75 in London trading before easing back to $450.15. It had closed a day earlier at $448.50. Thursday's peak was the highest for gold since June 1988.
 Kamal Naqvi, a precious metals analyst with Barclays Capital, said investors might well push gold prices higher, toward $455 or $460, and other analysts suggested it could go a lot higher if the dollar weakens further.
 ''A number of people in the gold market are coming in assuming further losses in the dollar,'' Mr. Naqvi said.
 Some analysts noted, however, that the increase in the gold price had not been matched by gains in gold-mining company stocks, suggesting that investors were not convinced gold would hold its current highs.
 The weakness of the dollar affects the earnings of gold mining companies in countries like South Africa, where gold is the biggest export. The surging gold price on Thursday pushed the South African currency, the rand, close to its highest level against the dollar in five years. But that may not benefit gold-mining companies.
 ''Many gold companies are unlikely to receive the full benefit for the higher U.S. dollar-gold price due to the appreciation of their currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and South African rand,'' the Barclays Capital note said.
 The rise in the rand, moreover, reflected the broader debate about the extent of the dollar's decline, which many banks have attributed to the size of the deficit in the United States current account, the broadest measure of American trade. 
 Some analysts in London said the dollar's weakness against the euro could be countered by European moves such as intervention in the market by the European Central Bank or sales of euros by European commercial banks. Those moves, in turn, would affect the price of gold.
 ''All you need is just signs that we are approaching something like a top'' in the rise of the euro, said Mr. Naqvi. ''Stability of the euro would be sufficient for a correction in gold. The most logical indication would be some show of concern from European policy makers.''
 Indeed, European officials are under pressure to slow the euro's rise, because a strong euro makes much of continental Europe's exports more expensive, adding to other economic woes. A key German indicator on Thursday showed that German business confidence was at its lowest in more than year.
 The counterargument is that the problem is with the dollar itself, since its weakness is showing against an array of currencies, including the Swiss franc, the British pound and the yen, not just the euro.
 In South Africa, Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, seemed to rule out action to slow the rise of the rand, saying: ''The problem is not the rand. The problem is the dollar.'' 
 The remark echoed a similar argument among some analysts in London. ''It's an overall dollar problem, and I think the worrying problem for the dollar is that most people are coming around to this point of view,'' said Tony Norfield, the head of foreign exchange strategy at ABN Amro.
 ''The chance of intervention from the European Central Bank is pretty close to zero and we don't see any grounds for Japanese intervention,'' Mr. Norfield said. ''The onus is really on the American side.''

HEADLINE: Japan Exports Hit Record, Easing Concerns of Slowdown

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Strong demand for ships, autos and iron lifted Japanese exports to a record high in October, helping to ease concerns about a slowdown in one of the most important sectors of the economy. 
 Exports rose a seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent in October from September and were up 11.8 percent compared with the same month last year, according to Ministry of Finance data released on Thursday. Although exports rose to a record, the pace of growth slowed from earlier this year as demand in the United States and China cooled. Japan's trade surplus expanded by 8.8 percent in October from a year ago, to 1.164 trillion yen ($11.32 billion). 
 Some analysts have feared that a sudden slowdown in exports could push Japan back into recession after more than a year of recovery. Investors have also been watching to see whether the dollar's recent decline against the yen will slow exports enough to prompt Japanese financial authorities to try to reverse the currency's move. A fall in the dollar against the yen hurts Japan's exporters by reducing the value of revenues brought in from abroad.
 Japan spent record amounts of money to drive down the yen and protect its exporters in March. However, there have been no signs that authorities have intervened in currency markets lately, even though the yen is above the level of March. On Thursday, the dollar traded in Tokyo near a 41/2-year low at around 102.85 yen.
 Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Hiroyuki Hosoda, told reporters Thursday that the government was prepared to take action to curb the yen's ascent. ''The rapid rise in the yen does not reflect fundamentals, that is clear,'' he told reporters. 
 However, some economists said that Thursday's relatively strong trade numbers might persuade financial authorities to stay on the sidelines a while longer.
 The October figures showed strong demand for Japanese exports in Europe and Southeast Asia. Export growth to those regions could help offset expected slowdowns to China or the United States. 
 Exports to the European Union gained 10.8 percent from last year, while exports to Asia grew 12.6 percent. Exports to the United States rose 3.4 percent. Total imports rose 2.7 percent from September and 12.6 percent from October last year on higher oil prices and an increase in Japanese purchases of foreign aircraft. 
 Still, economists don't expect Japan's overall export growth to return to the consistently strong, double-digit rates seen earlier this year because global economic growth is expected to slow from last year. 
 ''There's no doubt that things are slowing down and that's not a surprise, but it doesn't seem that they're slowing too much,'' said Richard Jerram, economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo. ''It's pretty clear that the real benefits from rapid export growth over the past year are fading away,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Houses Atuned to Feng Shui: Designs That Go With the Flow

BYLINE: As told to Bethany Lyttle

 BODY:

WHO -- Purvi Sevak, 31, an economics professor, and her husband, Jeff Hubbard, 39, a portfolio manager, shown with their daughter, Qatalina, 8 weeks
WHAT -- 3-bedroom house
WHERE -- Bethel, Me.
 Purvi: We live in Manhattan, and we've always wanted a country house surrounded by nature. When we bought this land, people would say, ''If you'd clear those trees, you'd have a great view.'' We'd think: How are trees not a view?
 Jeff: I'd commiserate with a ski buddy of mine, Derek Bloom, and he understood completely. Like us, he was a proponent of sustainable building practices. He is an architect; eventually we hired him to design the house.
 At the time, our familiarity with feng shui was nearly nil. But Derek and his wife, Eliza Mellen-Smith, would point out the ways feng shui was consistent with our views. We were skeptical but kept open minds, and in the end, many elements of feng shui were incorporated into the design. We used predominantly natural materials, for example, such as stone, wood and slate. And, we sited the house in what feng shui refers to as a ''commanding position.'' It's halfway down the face of the mountain facing another peak and sits on a gently sloping plane. According to feng shui, this balances the flow of Qi, or energy, to and from the house. It also means we have a lovely view. The great room was designed with enormous windows facing south. Maximizing sun exposure is said to increase the energy flow into the home. In practical terms, it means a room that's sunny and energy efficient.
 Purvi: Even Qatalina's room was selected based on its position in the house. It's in the ''knowledge'' or ''wisdom'' corner, which promotes learning. She'll be coming here with us for years. Why not offer her every possible advantage? As told to Bethany Lyttle

HEADLINE: The Mongolians Are Coming to China! With Heavy Metal!

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
China built the Great Wall more than 2,000 years ago to keep out invaders from the north. But the Chinese are having a harder time repulsing modern interlopers like these: long-haired Mongolian men in black, whose office decor features a wolf pelt, a portrait of Genghis Khan and a music store poster of Eminem.
 So the Chinese police got nervous when they heard that Hurd was crossing the Gobi Desert, coming down from Mongolia, 600 miles to the north. With their new hit CD, ''I Was Born in Mongolia,'' Hurd, a heavy metal, Mongolian-pride group, was coming for a three-day tour, culminating Nov. 1 with a performance in Hohhot, capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
 ''The morning we were to get on the train, the translator guy called and said 'Your performances are cancelled,''' Damba Ganbayar, Hurd's keyboardist and producer, said glumly as he lounged in a white plastic chair. ''He said, 'I will call with details.' I never got the details.''
 The details, according to reports from Hohhot, were that riot policemen and trucks surrounded the college campus where the group was to play. They checked identity cards, detained four people overnight and dispersed about 2,000 frustrated concertgoers into the autumn night.
 In the next several days, the Chinese authorities shut down three Mongolian-language chat forums, according to the Southern Mongolia Human Rights Information Center, a New York-based group that tracks ''Chinese colonialism'' in what some call the southern end of Greater Mongolia.
 ''Banned in Hohhot'' may not have an epic ring to it, but it is a sign of the times.
 With reports of local protests almost daily fare in China, the authorities are increasingly nervous also about ethnic minorities. In late October, several days of fighting erupted between Hui Muslims and Han Chinese -- China's dominant ethnic group -- in central Henan Province after a traffic accident.
 During the 1960's, the Chinese-Soviet split kept Mongolia, a Soviet satellite nation, apart from China's Inner Mongolia. Today, the Chinese region is home to four million ethnic Mongolians, almost double the 2.5 million in the country of Mongolia. But Chinese migration to Inner Mongolia over the years has left the ethnic Mongolians there vastly outnumbered by 18 million Han Chinese.
 In recent years, barriers have gone down between those two Mongolias as China has become its northern neighbor's largest trading partner and foreign investor. With Inner Mongolia's economy growing by 22 percent during the first nine months of this year, officials in the two Mongolias agreed in October to open a free-trade zone where the Trans-Mongolian Railway crosses into China.
 On the cultural front, music groups from here often appear on Inner Mongolia's Mongolian-language channel. Hurd, which means speed, has done three concert tours in Inner Mongolia since 2000. It claims to be the most popular rock group for Mongolians on both sides of the border.
 ''In 2000, it was very Soviet-style, with lots of policemen around with flashlights, very disciplined concerts,'' Mr. Damba Ganbayar recalled. ''Later, it became more relaxed, like normal rock concerts.''
 ''Even so, they advised us not to say, 'We Mongolians are all together!' or 'All Mongolians rise up and shout!''' the keyboardist continued. ''People would shout, 'Genghis!' But it was nothing political.''
 But on later visits south of the border, he noticed a growth in Mongol pride.
 ''More and more the young people say, 'We want to keep the Mongolian language and the traditions,''' he said. ''I met a guy with a Mongolian name, and he shouted, 'I am Mongolian!' -- in Chinese. I met many like that.''
 Encounters between Mongolians and Inner Mongolians are a bit like encounters between Mexicans and New Mexicans. Many Mongols here say they consider Inner Mongolians to be more Chinese than Mongolian. When people here travel south, they do not say they are going to Inner Mongolia, but to China.
 ''We don't have an Inner Mongolian problem,'' a Chinese diplomat in the region said in an interview. ''Most of the Inner Mongolian population has been 'Han-ized.' They speak Chinese, think like Chinese. Hohhot is like any other Chinese city.''
 Munh-Orgil Tsend, Mongolia's foreign minister, said in an interview, ''For us, Inner Mongolia is a province of China that happens to have ethnic brother on other side of the border.''
 On the northern side of the border, Hurd's nationalist identity has grown over the last two years, a time when the group did not record any new songs.
 ''Hurd's national pride and love of homeland takes the ethos of Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the U.S.A.' to a new level,'' said Layton Croft, an American foundation representative and musician here, who attended one of their concerts in October. ''There is a loyal, mostly rural, Mongolian fan base for such music.''
 Hurd's Mongol nationalism is aimed at that audience: young Mongolians who now leave the country for work, the men in construction in South Korea, the women as 'hostesses' in Macao.
 But the ''I Was Born in Mongolia'' CD, with its paeans to a ''land of great legendary heroes,'' came out here as ethnic Mongolians in China were discovering that a Han Chinese-owned company was taking over administration of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum, the region's biggest tourist money-maker. Entrusted to the care of the Darhad Mongolian tribe since 1696, this shrine holds relics of the great conqueror, including his saddle and his black bow.
 The actual burial place of Genghis Khan, who died in 1227, is not known, and has been the object of several archeological expeditions. But construction of a new ''mausoleum'' by Dong Lian, the Chinese company, prompted protests by Mongolians who see the move as another power grab by Chinese settlers.
 From the Chinese side, ''anything associated with nationalism, separatism, political rights, they want to suppress it,'' said an Inner Mongolian trader here who asked not to be identified.
 In the best-known case, a bookstore owner who goes by one name, Hada, is serving a 15-year sentence after being convicted of separatism in 1996.
 But with the canceling of concerts by Hurd and Horda, an Inner Mongolian band, some fear new restraints on Mongolian cultural expression.
 ''The government is shutting down a lot of music shops, confiscating a lot of music tapes,'' said Enhebatu Togochog, who runs the Southern Mongolian information center in New York. ''They say they are purifying the cultural market.''

HEADLINE: A Mother Now Turns Her Attention to Her Own Future

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Sara Clarke never thought that she would have to survive on less than the $20 a week that she earned baby-sitting in New York City in 1979. Back then, she was a recent immigrant from Panama, a hopeful young mother raising a 7-year-old son alone. 
 A quarter-century and two more children later, Ms. Clarke is unemployed, overweight and coping with a variety of illnesses including diabetes, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and asthma. She can barely climb the warped stairs that lead to her third-floor apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. 
 Yet for most of her life Ms. Clarke, 52, has given care to others, not needed it for herself.
 In 1981 she gave birth to the first of two daughters by a man with whom she is no longer in contact. Her baby, Ina, was born with a deformed leg. Ms. Clarke, then working as a cashier at a Queens supermarket, quit her job so she could stay home with Ina. Ms. Clarke returned to work in 1984. In 1986, she gave birth to another daughter, Sasha. Again, Ms. Clarke stopped working to take care of her newborn. 
 ''I don't trust nobody keeping my baby,'' Ms. Clarke explained.
 But no mother can protect her children from everything. 
 In 1993, Sasha, then 7, fell out of her bunk bed and broke her left thighbone. She had to wear a cast for six months and missed a year of school. All through Sasha's long recovery, Ms. Clarke stayed home, drawing on public assistance so she could be there for her daughter. Slowly, she gained the weight that has led to many of her health problems. There followed a seemingly endless string of stressful days. 
 Last year, Ms. Clarke turned to the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, for help. 
 The bureau enrolled her in its Personal Roads to Independent Development and Employment program, called Pride, which helps adults with disabilities go from welfare to work. Ms. Clarke attended classes in computers and English as a Second Language for six months. She also took part in Pride's Work Experience Program, working four hours a day, five days a week, for five months at a day care center in Brooklyn. She is interested in doing secretarial work. 
 ''What I love about her,'' Elizabeth Grisom, her case manager in the Pride program, said, ''is that she really, really tries her best to get off the system.''
 Ms. Clarke and Ms. Grisom have become fast friends, sharing pictures of their children and Weight Watchers books.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Clarke recently graduated to the next level of the Work Experience Program, where she will prepare for and attend job interviews. This means, however, that she will no longer be working with Ms. Grisom. 
 ''She's ready to move on,'' Ms. Grisom said. ''Whatever job she gets, she will be an asset, that's for sure.'' 
 In July, Ms. Grisom drew on the Neediest Cases to help Ms. Clarke with some basic household needs so she could focus on finding a job and managing her weight. Ms. Grisom gave the family a $2,000 check to buy furniture, including beds for Ms. Clarke and Sasha, now 18. For years, they slept on mattresses on the floor.
 ''It's good for my self-esteem,'' Ms. Clarke said, patting the arm of her new sofa. There is pleasure, she says, in clucking ''don't, don't, don't,'' when visitors get too close to it with a plate of food. 
 Ms. Clarke plans to build on her increased self-esteem by losing weight and finding work. She weighs about 280 pounds and needs to shed at least 100 to regain her health, Ms. Grisom said. 
 It is important that Ms. Clarke succeed. She must set an example, especially now, because Sasha does not want to finish her final year of high school. A fight with a student wielding a broken glass bottle left Sasha with a gash across her temple and nearly 30 stitches in her face. 
 ''She's not the same,'' Ms. Clarke said. ''She don't want to go to school. She's changed. She's aggressive now.'' 
 Ms. Clarke wants to turn that aggression into ambition, to help her youngest daughter complete her education and look forward to the future, as she herself once did, back in 1979.

HEADLINE: The State of Iraq: An Update

BYLINE: By ADRIANA LINS de ALBUQUERQUE, MICHAEL O'HANLON AND AMY UNIKEWICZ. 
Adriana Lins de Albuquerque and Michael O'Hanlon are, respectively, a senior research assistant and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Amy Unikewicz is a graphic designer in South Norwalk, Conn.

 BODY:
Two months before Iraq is scheduled to hold its nationwide elections, how are things going? After the bloody assault on Falluja, in which some 50 United States troops and many times that number of insurgents died, no American needs to be reminded that the situation is very difficult. In fact, while the Falluja operation could have some eventual benefits, we cannot yet identify any objective measure of sustained progress in increasing Iraqi security. 
 Other recent trends are somewhat more encouraging: foreign aid is beginning to be spent more quickly, even if much of it is being directed toward security rather than rebuilding cities and towns; Iraqi security forces are now being trained more rigorously -- and they're beginning to perform better on the battlefield; the overall quality of public services may finally be inching ahead of late-Saddam Hussein levels; the transfer of sovereignty to the interim Iraqi government has continued to deflect some of the anti-American anger on the street; and Iraqis are for the most part bullish on their future.
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's popularity has fallen in recent months, unemployment rates remain far too high, insurgents continue to attack oil pipelines and police stations, and Iraqi security forces still cannot begin to take the major responsibility for combating the insurgents. 
 On balance, the data show that security trends in Iraq are generally poor, economic trends are promising but glacial in pace, and political trends are hopeful but fragile.

HEADLINE: Demographic Time Bomb Threatens Pensions in Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: BRIGHTON, England, 

 BODY:
With his crisp gray suit, white shirt and a lapel poppy commemorating the end of the First World War, Chris Shergold does not exactly look like a vision of the future.
 But, for many in Europe, his story is slowly becoming theirs, reversing the assumptions that this old continent has finessed life's travails so well that its people might look forward to ever shortening working lives in ever greater comfort.
 In 1997, Mr. Shergold, now a 61-year-old former banker, was forced into early retirement by the merger of his employer with another bank. At the time, that seemed fine: he had a company pension, the likelihood of part-time office work and a nest egg of investments. It looked as if the combination would provide a generous retirement, with vacations in the sun and a good life at home. 
 Then, in 2000, the stock market crashed. Now he has returned to work full time as a financial manager for a nonprofit organization, where he expects he will have to stay until he is 67 merely to return to the levels of prosperity he envisaged seven years ago. In other words, he said, he found ''that there's no sort of golden, shining cloud coming along at the end of the day.''
 Mr. Shergold's story goes far beyond the gravelly beaches and amusement pier of this southern English resort that has been his home since 1976. It represents a cautionary tale for the baby boom generation in many parts of Europe as aging societies from Sweden to Spain -- and across eastern Europe as well -- confront a demographic time bomb. With ever fewer young people to work and pay taxes, the cost of looking after growing numbers of older people with state pensions akin to American Social Security becomes ever more prohibitive.
 The dream of early retirement on a fat pension is receding with other comfortable visions of the future, like the pursuit of shorter working weeks and expanded leisure time that preoccupied many, particularly in continental Europe, in the 1990's.
 ''They got used to having that very cushy social system, and now they are slowly coming to grips with the fact that the cushy system doesn't hold any more,'' said Katinka Barysch, an economist at the Center for European Reform, a private policy research organization in London. Or, as Mr. Shergold put it, ''the majority of people will just have to stay at work that much longer.''
 The alternatives seem dire.
 In Britain, which offers Europe's least generous old age pensions, Adair Turner, chairman of the government appointed Pensions Commission in London said, ''Our problem is that we are going to have a whole lot of very poor pensioners in 30 years time.'' And in much of continental Europe, where years of social legislation have guaranteed pensions of as much as 70 percent of average retirement-age paychecks, Mr. Turner said, the continent ''is going to have reasonably well-off pensioners supported over a number of years that society cannot afford.''
 As a result, European generations after the baby boomers will have to save more, pay higher taxes and work longer to maintain the kind of retirement comforts they once considered their due.
 To be sure, this is not -- for most Europeans -- a drama of Dickensian deprivation. Consider the case of Marie Claude Hourcade, 55, who lives in Paris and retired last February from her job as an inspector in the French customs service.
 As a mother of three -- a relatively large family by European standards -- and a government employee, she fell into a small category of people whose retirement benefits left even her amazed. 
 Her pension, she said, gives her the equivalent of about $3,000 a month which, added to the salary of her well-paid husband, offers an affluent life.
 ''The money enables me to have extras,'' she said. ''I go to the theater a lot, I see exhibitions, we have a house in the countryside where we spend the summer.''
 Along with countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Italy and Spain, France ranks among the most generous of state providers with retirees expecting their pensions to be some 70 percent of their country's average earnings. (The least generous is Britain, with just less than 37 percent, compared with 45 percent in the United States, figures from Britain's Pensions Commission show.)
 But it is precisely that level of generosity that will be challenged as Europe's population ages and ever fewer working people pay the taxes to finance the soaring numbers of baby boom pensioners.
 Today, according to European and United Nations figures, people of working age in Europe outnumber people of retirement age by about three to one, compared with a ratio of about five to one in the United States. By 2050 in Europe, by these estimates, the figure is set to be two to one.
 This poses enormous problems. Italy's 18 million pensioners are used to drawing generous payments after 35 years at work. But faced with one of Europe's lowest fertility rates and biggest pension bills, the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi plans to raise the retirement age by five years starting in 2007. Germany, with almost 20 million pensioners, plans to reduce the size of state pensions compared with the average worker's salary.
 With 12 million pensioners in 2000, France, too, plans to increase the number of years people must work to qualify for pensions. Even in the so-called new Europe of former Communist countries that joined the European Union this year, a pensions crisis looms because of low birthrates. ''Anyone who talks about 'old' Europe and 'new' Europe on this is failing to recognize that it's a global problem,'' Mr. Turner said.
 Of course, nuances exist. Unlike most of continental Europe, Britain has traditionally relied on its people to augment modest state pensions by saving for their old age through private and company pension funds. But, in recent years, pension funds have lost tax breaks worth some $9.5 billion a year, stock market declines have eroded portfolios and savings have given way to a huge surge in private debt, partly because of a booming housing market.
 As private companies have limited access to generous pension plans, more than 12 million people in Britain -- one-fifth of the population -- ''are not saving enough for retirement,'' the Pensions Commission said.
 The idea of people working longer seems a simple panacea. After all, people generally remain healthier for longer and working until, say, 67 instead of 63 or 65 may not be such a burden. But that presumes that jobs exist for older people.
 In Berlin, Brigitte Beyerdorfer, like many Germans over 50, particularly those from the former East Germany, has found that economies are not quite so obliging.
 Her husband, Klaus, is a 62-year-old former truck driver who had been paying into state pension plans in East and West Germany for 46 years. But he had been receiving unemployment benefit for a statutory maximum of three years when he was obliged to go into premature retirement last Sept. 1. That brought him a reduced pension of around $1,000 a month.
 Mrs. Beyerdorfer said she takes home around $1,800 a month from her work at an employment agency in Berlin. And so, after paying bills, like the monthly rent of around $520 for their 600-square-foot apartment in the former East Berlin, the Beyerdorfers manage relatively well. The problem, though, is the job market, as it is in other parts of continental Europe where economic growth is sluggish to say the least.
 With unemployment in the former East Germany running at around 18 percent, ''if I lost my job here I wouldn't find another,'' Mrs. Beyerdorfer said. ''All my friends are already sitting at home. We have never thought it would be so difficult to find jobs.''
 Moreover, to qualify for a full state pension of $1,560, she said, she would have to work for another 10 years to reach 65. ''As long as I work it's O.K.,'' she said. ''If I can't, it's going to be pretty tight.''

HEADLINE: When Weakness Is a Strength

BYLINE: By Stephen S. Roach. 
Stephen S. Roach is chief economist for Morgan Stanley.

 BODY:
Suddenly all eyes are on a weakening dollar. In recent days, the American currency has fallen against the euro, the yen and most other currencies around the world. The renminbi is a notable exception; China has kept its currency firmly pegged to the dollar for a decade.
 The fall of the dollar is not a surprise. It is the logical outgrowth of an unbalanced world economy, and America's gaping current account deficit -- the difference between foreign trade and investment in the United States and American trade and investment abroad -- is just the most visible manifestation of these imbalances. The deficit ran at a record annual rate of $665 billion, or 5.7 percent of gross domestic product, in the second quarter of 2004. 
 While a decline in the dollar is not a cure-all for what ails the world, it should go a long way toward bringing about a sorely needed rebalancing. With a weaker dollar, economic and even political tensions among nations would be relieved, helping to promote more sustainable growth in the global economy.
 Still, a debate persists as to the wisdom of allowing the dollar to decline. The Bush administration seems to have given its tacit assent, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is finally on board. But outside the United States, where policymakers have long been vocal in their displeasure over America's deficits, officials are now objecting to America's cure. Europeans have referred to the dollar's recent decline as brutal. The Japanese have threatened to intervene again in foreign exchange markets. And Chinese officials have argued that global imbalances are ''made in America.''
 In this blame game, it's always the other guy. Yet global imbalances are a shared responsibility. America is guilty of excess consumption, whereas the rest of the world suffers from insufficient consumption. Consumer demand in the United States grew at an average of 3.9 percent (in real terms) from 1995 to 2003, nearly double the 2.2 percent average elsewhere in the industrial world.
 Meanwhile, Americans fail to save enough -- whereas the rest of the world saves too much. American consumers have borrowed against the future by squandering their savings. The personal savings rate was just 0.2 percent of disposable personal income in September -- down from 7.7 percent as recently as 1992. Moreover, large federal budget deficits mean the government's savings rate is negative.
 Lacking in domestic savings, the United States must import foreign savings to finance the growth of its economy. And it runs huge current-account and trade deficits to attract such capital from overseas.
 America's consumption binge has its mirror image in excess savings elsewhere in the world -- especially in Asia and Europe. For now, America draws freely on this reservoir, absorbing about 80 percent of the world's surplus savings. Just as the United States has moved production and labor offshore in recent years, it is now outsourcing its savings.
 This is a dangerous arrangement. The day could come when foreign investors demand better terms for financing America's spending spree (and savings shortfall). That is the day the dollar will collapse, interest rates will soar and the stock market will plunge. In such a crisis, a United States recession would be a near certainty. And the rest of an America-centric world would be quick to follow.
 The only way to avoid this unhappy future is for the world's major central banks to carefully manage a gradual but significant depreciation of the dollar over the next several years. America, and the world, would gain in several ways.
 First, there would be a gradual rise in interest rates in the United States -- compensating foreign investors for financing the biggest debtor in the world. That would suppress growth in those sectors of the American economy that are most sensitive to interest rates, like housing, consumer durables like cars and appliances, and business capital spending. The result: a higher domestic savings rate and a reduced need for foreign capital -- a classic current-account adjustment.
 Second, when the dollar falls, other currencies rise. So far, the euro has borne a disproportionate share of the change. That puts increased pressure on Asian nations -- including China -- to share in the adjustment by allowing their currencies to strengthen. Most currencies in Asia are now rising, but the renminbi has remained conspicuously unmoved.
 Third, as the currencies of Asia and Europe strengthen, their exports will become less attractive to American consumers. This will force Asia and Europe to work to stimulate domestic demand to compensate -- resulting in a reduction of both excess savings and current-account surpluses. This is easier said than done, especially since it may require painful structural reforms, like a loosening of domestic labor markets, to unshackle internal demand.
 Fourth, a weaker dollar might defuse global trade tensions. Dollar depreciation will support American exports, and higher interest rates should slow domestic demand and reduce imports. That means the United States trade deficit should narrow -- tempering protectionist risks. And with Asian countries allowing their currencies to fluctuate, Europe gets some relief and may be less tempted to resort to protectionist remedies.
 What's certain is that a lopsided world needs to be put back into balance. The dollar is the world's most widely used currency, but its fall affects more than just foreign-exchange rates. A weakening dollar is an encouraging sign that the world's relative price structure -- essentially the value of one economy versus another -- is becoming more sensible. If the world can manage the dollar's decline wisely, there is more reason for hope than despair.

HEADLINE: Markets Higher in Europe, Led by Oil and Steel Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Oil and steel stocks helped lift European markets Thursday, as dealers reported healthy trading volumes in some areas. Europe's main market indexes closed higher, despite the dollar sinking to a new record low against the euro.
 The FTSE-100 in London ended 0.72 percent higher at 4,753.40 points, helped by a 2.8 percent rise by the Shell Transport and Trading Company and a 2.2 percent gain by its rival BP. 
 The French oil giant Total also rose 1.5 percent, outpacing the 0.98 percent increase in the CAC-40 to 3,797.59, while Germany's DAX closed 0.85 percent higher, at 4,160.35.
 Traders said data from Germany's Ifo institute showing a deterioration in economic sentiment had been largely expected, after similar surveys in neighboring countries.
 Jason Kenney, an analyst with ING Financial Markets, said growing expectations of heating oil shortages and higher crude prices had underpinned Thursday's trades. 
 Mr. Kenney also cited ''implicit supply concerns'' provoked by the apparent flight from Russia of senior managers of the oil business Yukos, the target of a tax investigation by Moscow authorities.
 January Brent Crude futures were 33 cents, or 0.7 percent, higher in London at $45.15. Trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange was suspended for the United States holiday. 
 The dollar's latest slide -- falling below $1.32 against the euro for the first time -- held back European exporters and other companies with significant dollar sales. A stronger euro makes their products and services less competitive.
 Shares in EADS, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, which owns 80 percent of the aircraft maker Airbus, fell 1 percent, the CAC-40's biggest decline. The French luxury and retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute dipped 0.1 percent.
 Steel makers in Asia and Europe cashed in on buoyant commodity prices, with a 5.6 percent gain by Arcelor topping the CAC-40 risers in Paris.
 Earlier, Nippon Steel Corporation and Kobe Steel advanced in Tokyo, where the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues closed 0.26 percent higher, at 10,900.34 points. The automakers Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor were among Japanese exporters that ended down, after the sliding dollar reached a near-five-year low against the yen.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Ready to Take Action Against U.S. Over Trade Law

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization was expected to approve the imposition of $150 million in trade sanctions against the United States by the European Union, Japan, Canada and four other countries Friday in response to an American antidumping law that was declared illegal in 2003. 
 As a result, tariffs could be imposed on American exports of steel products, textiles, machinery, footwear and some food like corn. 
 The law, known as the Byrd amendment, states that levies raised from antidumping tariffs collected on cheap imports to the United States should be distributed to the American companies that compete against the importers. 
 The seven trading partners of the Unites States complained that this punished importers twice -- once with the levy and again by giving a financial gain to their American competitors. 
 The figure of $150 million was based on an estimate of the damage caused to importers by the Byrd amendment.
 Japan and the European Union are the hardest hit by the Byrd amendment. Japan is claiming about $80 million in damages and the union is claiming about $50 million. The union has drawn up a list of 80 products it might impose the sanctions on. Japan is also said to be considering imposing sanctions on steel products. 
 The W.T.O.'s approval for sanctions was to have been granted on Wednesday but American negotiators questioned some of the terminology in the demands submitted by the union and others, a person close to the negotiations said. But the wording of the demands remains unchanged after American officials discussed them with the seven complainants Thursday, this person said. 
 ''Whatever the Americans' concerns were, the solution didn't entail changing the documents at all,'' the person said. 
 Peter Mandelson, the union's new trade commissioner, said earlier this week that the union would impose sanctions early next year if the Byrd Amendment law was not repealed. 
 His spokeswoman, Claude Veron-Reville, said Thursday that the union remains on course to impose sanctions. ''Nothing has changed,'' she said, referring to the delay in the W.T.O.'s approval.

 BODY:
Spain's ambassador met with Cuba's foreign minister in the first high-level contact between a European Union state and Cuba since the European Union imposed sanctions last year to protest death sentences for Cubans trying to flee to the United States and heavy jail sentences for 75 dissidents. After 1996, the European Union established a common policy toward Cuba, conditioning better diplomatic ties on political reforms. However, Spain's Socialist government has been pushing for a new relationship in the belief that sanctions have produced only a stalemate.

HEADLINE: Nissan to Halt Auto Output At 3 Plants in Japan for 5 Days

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company said Thursday that a shortage of steel would force it to temporarily halt production at three of four of its auto factories in Japan, an unusual step made necessary in part by a surge in demand for steel in China.
 Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, said it would suspend work at the plants for five days starting at the end of this month, a move that will reduce its output by some 25,000 vehicles. The carmaker plans to make up for the setback by increasing production early next year and said it did not expect the temporary shutdown to hurt its profits much. 
 None of Nissan's Japanese rivals reported having problems with steel supplies, though analysts said Nissan's troubles could spill over to other manufacturers. Toyota, the No. 1 automaker in Japan and the world's second largest, said in a statement that ''we are doing our best to secure steel through various measures,'' including reducing the kinds of steel it uses.
 The supply shortage arose for Nissan after it offered six new models in Japan this year, and stronger than expected sales of some of these exacerbated already thin supplies, a spokeswoman, Mia Nielsen, said.
 ''There's a tight supply squeeze globally,'' she said, ''and that's why we can't get the steel we need.''
 The company is curbing production of four compact cars that are sold primarily in Japan, including the Tiida and March hatchbacks. The action will not affect production at Nissan's factories in the United States.
 Its steel suppliers, Nippon Steel and JFE Steel, are already operating at capacity and have not been able to increase their production enough to meet Nissan's requirements. JFE Steel aims to increase its capacity by about 10 percent next year to meet the strong demand industrywide, a company spokesman told Reuters. 
 Steel prices have risen and supplies have dwindled in the last year, much of that the results of demand from Chinese builders and manufacturers as the country pursues economic growth. 
 With the acquisition of a dominant stake in Nissan by the French automaker Renault, Carlos Ghosn took over as Nissan's chief executive four years ago. He led a drive to cut costs by decreasing the number of suppliers and pressing those that remained to lower their prices. The cost-cutting campaign helped turn Nissan, then nearly bankrupt, into one of the world's most profitable automakers. 
 While trimming the supply chain may be partly to blame for the shortages Nissan faces today, analysts here say that the company is still better off because of the effort. 
 ''The benefits that have been accrued far outweigh any potential losses that they are facing now,'' said Kurt Sanger of Macquarie Securities. Mr. Sanger said he expected the lost production might cut Nissan's profit at most by a few billion yen. The company forecast a net profit of 510 billion yen, or $4.96 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.

HEADLINE: The New Russian Energy Company

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
It is about to become the world's largest energy company. And it is making plans to supply the hugely lucrative market of North America. 
 But that company -- Gazprom -- is effectively controlled by the Russian government, and therein lies the rich potential and risks for investors. 
 ''We see Gazprom as a sort of government-controlled Yukos,'' says Soeren Rytoft, strategist at Metzler/Payden European Emerging Markets Fund. ''It will be the new Russian energy company -- with all the good and the bad related to that.'' 
 Gazprom, already the world's largest natural gas company, controls 20 percent of global supply and an extensive pipeline network. For American consumers, the company represents one of the best alternatives to Middle Eastern suppliers. Gazprom executives recently visited the United States to talk with ChevronTexaco and other companies about future supply deals. PetroCanada and Gazprom have already signed a memorandum of understanding to ship Russian gas to North America by 2009. 
 Sometime next year, Gazprom will merge with Rosneft, a Kremlin-friendly oil company. With 3.1 billion barrels of oil and 16.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas, Gazprom's reserves will top all other energy companies. 
 After that deal is completed, Moscow has promised to scrap Gazprom's notorious ring-fence -- a two-tier share structure that allows local investors here to buy cheaper shares and requires foreign investors to buy more expensive American depository receipts. 
 If the ring-fence is abolished, Gazprom will become more attractive to investors. For one thing, it would draw in investors who use Morgan Stanley's emerging markets index as a benchmark. Gazprom would account for about 2.9 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, up from 0.25 percent currently, and would have the third-largest weighting behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea and Anglo-American, a mining and paper concern based in South Africa.
 Currently, only a small amount of Gazprom stock is available through A.D.R.'s, about 2.5 percent of the shares outstanding. The premium for the A.D.R.'s has been as high as 100 percent, although recently it had dropped to about 30 percent. Still, big American investors like Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch have been buyers of Gazprom A.D.R.'s. 
 And Gazprom's star has risen as Yukos's has fallen. For better or worse, Gazprom is one of the only big Russian energy investments available besides Lukoil, Russia's second-largest producer. 
 Gazprom -- not Yukos -- is now the proxy for Russia's promise as an energy superpower, said Ian Hague, co-manager of Firebird Fund in New York. He estimates Gazprom, with a market capitalization of just over $52 billion, could grow to a $150 billion company in three to four years, or about 11 to 13 times earnings. 
 ''Gazprom is Yukos circa 2001, in terms of liquidity, investor interest and performance,'' he added.
 But there are clear differences, investors note.
 ''Think of Yukos as a hungry riverboat gambler, and Gazprom as a staid apparatchik,'' said John Kleinheinz, founder of Kleinheinz Capital, an American hedge fund and a Gazprom shareholder. 
 The role of apparatchik worries some, who cite little financial transparency and opportunity for poor corporate governance at Gazprom. 
 ''The company is government controlled, and that is a huge factor, with inefficiencies that investors have not discounted into the share price,'' Mr. Rytoft at Metzler/Payden European Emerging Markets Fund said.
 Even the minister of economic development and trade, German Gref, has criticized Gazprom for buying assets and blocking shares in other companies. 
 ''We are making a hypermonopoly out of Gazprom,'' Mr. Gref said on Wednesday according to the Interfax news agency. ''We are increasing gas prices, while Gazprom is investing in all imaginable and unimaginable types of business.''
 After the Soviet Union collapsed, Gazprom managers treated the company as their private fief; many cut private gas supply deals to line their own pockets. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, replaced the previous management in 2001 and installed Aleksei Miller, an old political ally from St. Petersburg, as the new chief executive. 
 ''The wind is at Gazprom's back right now financially,'' said William Browder, founder of Hermitage Capital hedge fund and a shareholder in Gazprom. ''The key question is, will graft and corruption erode that growth and its benefits to shareholders?''
 Asset theft stopped after Gazprom's former chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, left in 2001. Side deals, meanwhile, have come under scrutiny, like an arrangement with an unknown shell company, EuralTransGas, which was reaping hundreds of millions in unauthorized profits from natural gas sales to Ukraine.
 After shareholders threatened to sue, EuralTransGas was cut out of Gazprom entirely. And profits at Gazprom soared. Gazprom reported net profit of $5.1 billion on sales of $26.7 billion in 2003, compared with $861 million on sales of $19.2 billion in 2002. 
 But new side deals have cropped up. Most recently, Gazprom's chief executive, Mr. Miller, surprised investors by revealing last month that the company had spent nearly $2 billion buying 10 percent of Unified Energy Systems, the country's national electricity monopoly, as well as a Moscow utility, Mosenergo.
 E. Vadim Kleiner, a Hermitage partner who unsuccessfully sought a seat on Gazprom's board, said directors never even had a chance to give their say about the U.E.S. deal. ''It wasn't on the agenda at any of their meetings,'' he said. ''So who decided? No one on the board, that is for sure.''
 Concerns about corporate governance at Gazprom have not deterred investors like Gunter Faschang, portfolio manager of Vontobel Eastern European equity funds. Gazprom is now his biggest position, he said in a phone interview from Vienna. He does hold the more expensive Gazprom A.D.R.'s, but he also holds Gazprom through different structured products, like listed funds that hold cheaper local shares. 
 The biggest risk for Gazprom investors is more delays to the abolishment of the two-share structure. While Mr. Faschang expects the ring-fence to come down in the second half of next year, the Russian government could drag its feet.
 ''If plans to abolish it were canceled, it would be a huge problem, but that is highly unlikely,'' Mr. Faschang said. With the Rosneft deal, the Russian government will get what it wants, a 51 percent majority in Gazprom. So ''there's no reason to hold the share price down,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Interest Appears to Flag As Dollar Falls

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Investors and market analysts are increasingly worried that the last big source of support for the American dollar -- heavy buying by foreign central banks -- is fading. 
 The anxiety was on full display Friday, when the dollar abruptly slid to a record low against the euro after a report suggesting that the Chinese central bank might start to reduce its holdings in the American currency.
 Though Chinese officials later denied the report, and the dollar recovered, analysts say the broader trend is that foreign governments are becoming less willing to finance the growing debt of the United States government.
 On Tuesday, a top official with the Russian central bank said his government had become worried about the sinking value of the dollar and might switch some foreign reserves to euros. 
 A day later, India's central bank hinted that it was worried about the same issue and might shift some reserves into other currencies.
 Japan and China, which together have amassed nearly $900 billion in United States Treasury securities, have both slowed their buying sharply from the frenetic pace in February and March.
 ''There is an emerging consensus that banks around the world are moving to expand their reserves of euros at the expense of dollars,'' said Laidi Ashraf, chief currency analyst at MG Financial Group in New York.
 The Bush administration has essentially condoned the dollar's decline. At meetings with foreign ministers last week, the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, repeated the American mantra of support for a ''strong dollar'' but also for letting ''market forces'' determine exchange rates.
 A continued decline of the dollar would be good for American manufacturers, because it would make exports cheaper in foreign markets and push up the cost of imports.
 But a diminished foreign appetite for dollars could push up interest rates. The Federal Reserve has already raised short-term rates four times this year, but the shift in the sentiment of foreign investors may soon seriously affect long-term rates that influence the cost of home mortgages.
 ''Sell U.S., buy Europe,'' summed up Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, in a report last week. Mr. Berner noted that investors have begun demanding higher yields for 10-year Treasury securities than for comparable European bonds, and he predicted that the spread would widen.
 Recent data from the Treasury Department indicated that foreign governments had sharply slowed their purchases of Treasury securities. The question is whether those purchases will continue to slow or start to increase again as countries try to shore up the American currency to help maintain their own industries' competitiveness.
 Japanese purchases of Treasury securities, which ballooned by about $100 billion from October 2003 to March of this year, have slowed sharply and actually declined slightly in September.
 Largely as a result, the dollar has sunk to its lowest level against the Japanese yen, about 102.5 yen to the dollar on Friday, in four and a half years.
 Chinese purchases of Treasury securities slowed to a crawl, increasing just $2 billion in September, to $174 billion.
 On Friday, a top Chinese central bank official denied reports in a Chinese newspaper that the government planned to reduce its holdings of Treasury bonds.
 But Chinese officials, under prodding from the Bush administration, have repeatedly said they want to gradually relax their 10-year-old policy of locking its currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar. Any move to a more flexible exchange rate for China would probably cause the dollar to drop in value and allow the Chinese central bank to stop buying United States debt securities.
 America's current account deficit, the broadest measure of its indebtedness to other countries, is on track to exceed $600 billion next year, about 6 percent of its gross domestic product. The United States needs to attract about $2 billion a day to keep its spending at current levels.
 The nation attracted enormous sums of foreign money in the late 1990's as well, but the character of that money has changed. Back then, a big part of the inflow was through foreign direct investment and purchases of American stocks.
 This year, by contrast, foreigners have been net sellers of stocks. The big growth has been in foreign purchases of Treasury securities, and the big buyers have been foreign central banks that wanted to prevent their own currencies from rising too much against the dollar.
 Tony Norfield, currency strategist for ABN Amro in London, said he was convinced that central banks were trying to scale back their purchase of dollar assets, a move that could push the euro, already up about 30 percent in the last years, even higher.
 ''You do not need the central banks to sell Treasuries for the dollar to go down,'' Mr. Norfield said. ''All they have to do is buy less and the dollar is going to be in trouble.''
 The euro hit a new high of $1.3329 on Friday in light trading, before settling back about a half-penny.
 European leaders are alarmed about the potential damage of a sinking dollar to their exports.
 ''Recent moves on exchange markets of the dollar versus the euro are unwelcome,'' said Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, at a banking seminar on Friday in Rio de Janeiro.
 ''I want to underline the importance of recent statements by the Treasury secretary of the United States on his determination to pursue a strong dollar policy,'' Mr. Trichet added.
 But Mr. Snow and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered no hint that they would intervene in currency markets to prop up the dollar.
 ''The market for U.S. Treasury securities is deep and liquid and continues to be attractive to a broad and diverse pool of investors,'' a spokesman for Mr. Snow, Robert Nichols, said.
 That remains to be seen. According to the most recent Treasury data, the biggest source of growth in securities came not from China, Japan or Europe but from Caribbean banking centers.

HEADLINE: Strings Attached: Givers and Colleges Clash on Spending

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER and JONATHAN CHENG

 BODY:
Ever since he sued the University of Southern California for fraud four years ago, accusing it of misusing his $1.6 million gift for biological research on aging and then lying about it, Paul F. Glenn has put his beneficiaries on a short leash. 
 He still gives, but he tries not to call it that. Instead, he likes to say that he strikes deals with universities for the betterment of humanity, then polices them with all the ardor of a businessman who has been burned, badly. 
 ''We were assuming the honesty and integrity of everyone involved,'' said Mr. Glenn, who settled his case against U.S.C. this year. ''We now know that there's got to be a quid pro quo here. This is not a donation. It's a contract, and both parties have to live up to it.'' 
 In the genial world of university fund-raising, clashes between donors and beneficiaries are rare, and such public animosity is rarer still. But in recent years a few noisy disputes at major universities like Yale and Princeton -- where $600 million is at stake --have had a powerful effect on the fund-raising game, prodding donors to become more vigilant and universities to become unusually careful about accepting gifts at a time when institutions are particularly hungry for them.
 ''Universities have rightly paid close attention to these cases,'' said John Lippincott, president of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, which represents college fund-raisers. ''Even though they may be few and far between, they are not situations that any university would want to face.''
 To avoid them, colleges and donors are drawing up painstaking agreements to prevent future disputes over how the money should be spent. Instead of turning over the entire gift at once, donors like Mr. Glenn sometimes parcel it out over time, with regular checkups along the way. Universities are often equally exacting, in hope of keeping down unrealistic expectations of how much power a benefactor might have. 
 In its most recent $2.6 billion fund-raising campaign, for example, Duke tried to make it clear that no matter how generous donors were, they would not be able to orchestrate how the university was run -- a central point of contention in donor clashes at Yale in the mid-1990's and at Case Western Reserve two years ago.
 ''We all watch, and we learn from these things,'' said John Burness, a spokesman for Duke. 
 The universities recognize that they are dealing with a new breed of philanthropists who are demanding a more active role in shaping the outcomes of their gifts, a result both of their entrepreneurial wealth and an emerging belief that institutions need to be scrutinized more closely. 
 In the dispute with the University of Southern California, for instance, Mr. Glenn accused the university of surreptitiously withholding his money from a researcher he wanted to support while spending it on another one whom he considered ineligible. 
 ''Too often, it was that the universities wanted alums or donors to put up and shut up,'' said Anne Neal, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which was formed in 1995 after Yale agreed to return a $20 million gift from Lee M. Bass, a billionaire alumnus. ''There's a feeling that that was inappropriate, that in fact there was absolutely nothing wrong for a donor to insist that their intent was followed.'' 
 At the same time, universities are under growing pressure to raise money for as general a purpose as they can manage. Donations to educational institutions dropped last year for the second year in a row, though universities say the economy, not any bad blood, is to blame. 
 Beyond that, university endowments have shrunk in recent years, while expenses have grown. Having money set aside that colleges can use in any way they please not only eases that pressure, but it also improves their creditworthiness at a time when university debts are soaring. 
 ''We're reaching more of a crossroads than we've been at in the past,'' said Richard A. Raffetto, a managing director at the Bank of New York. ''Universities want to be more and more vague about how they use money, but donors want their agreements to be less and less vague.'' Some battles have a way of outlasting the original combatants. In the four decades since Charles and Marie D. Robertson gave Princeton $35 million to prepare graduate students for government service, the gift has romped through a series of investments and blossomed into a $600 million fund that dwarfs the entire endowments of most other universities.
 The Robertsons have since died, but their children want the money back. All of the $600 million -- and then some. 
 This month, the Robertson family added fraud to the list of accusations it has leveled against Princeton, introducing the prospect of punitive damages to a lawsuit that is already the colossus of its kind, one in which the scale of the money involved is rivaled only by the bitterness it has inspired. 
 ''Our parents have been betrayed,'' said Bill Robertson, the 55-year-old son of Charles and Marie. ''Really, the university has almost swindled these wonderful people who did something wonderful for this country. It's almost a matter of good and evil.'' 
 The Robertsons' central grievance is not simply that Princeton has failed to inspire more than a slim minority of students to take jobs in the federal government, as the family specified, but that the university has shown little interest in doing so. 
 Instead of spending the money exclusively on the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, the graduate school the Robertsons stipulated in their gift, the plaintiffs contend that Princeton has funneled large parts of it to unrelated programs. None of this was cleared with the foundation that oversees the Robertson gift, the plaintiffs contend. ''They either concealed or actively misrepresented what they did with the money,'' said Frank Cialone, a lawyer for the Robertsons.
 Should they win, the Robertsons say the money will not go to them, personally. Rather, it will be redirected through the foundation to any number of universities that, in their view, do a better job of placing graduates in the federal government -- perhaps Georgetown or Harvard. 
 Princeton denies any wrongdoing, saying it has been dedicated to producing public servants for decades. What the Robertsons fail to recognize, the university says, is that the world has changed substantially in the four decades since the gift was made. A decline in federal hiring in the Nixon years and a subsequent growth in the role of nonprofits in addressing public needs has led Princeton to interpret public service more broadly than simply careers in foreign service, lawyers for the university argue.
 ''I don't think I could tell you I'm optimistic about a conclusion,'' said Douglas Eakeley, a Princeton lawyer. Harvey P. Dale, a professor of philanthropy and the law at New York University, says the lawsuit could have major implications for organizations that receive charitable donations. ''If it sets a precedent,'' Professor Dale said, ''then any child or descendant of a donor could challenge a charity's use of donated funds, and that would be disastrous.''
 But for others, the issue is not so clear-cut. While many support the notion that institutions should be able to adapt over time, adhering to the spirit if not the strictest interpretation of a gift, they also wonder if too much flexibility can end up distorting the donor's intent. 
 ''That's the real question behind all of this,'' said Timothy L. Seiler, director of the Fund Raising School at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. ''Compelling arguments could be made on both sides of the debate.''

INTERNATIONAL A3-9

Delay of Elections in Iraq Proposed Over Security
Some of Iraq's most powerful political groups called for a six-month delay in elections, citing primarily concerns over security. The Iraqi government itself did not join in the petition and the party of the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, gave oral assent rather than its signature to the document. President Bush said he hoped the elections would proceed on schedule. A1

Insurgents in Iraq have settled on a gruesome tactic intended to destabilize and terrorize, focusing their efforts against the one thing that Americans have counted on as the linchpin of an exit strategy from the country: the new Iraqi security forces. American troops have discovered 32 bodies in the northern city of Mosul during the past two days. A1

Nuclear Talks With Iran in Peril
Iran and its European partners struggled to salvage their agreement committing Tehran to freeze an important part of its nuclear program. The two sides were so far apart that their talks were put off until Monday. Hossein Mousavian, the chief Iranian negotiator, predicted a compromise would be reached and expressed optimism that the deal would hold. A3

Help for Palestinian Candidate
Marwan Barghouti, left, a popular politician currently in an Israeli jail, agreed not to run for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority. Instead, Mr. Barghouti called on Palestinians to support Fatah's candidate, Mahmoud Abbas, who has already succeeded Yasir Arafat as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. A8

Ukraine Candidates Negotiate
The two candidates claiming to be the president-elect of Ukraine met in the presence of international mediators and agreed to begin immediate negotiations to try to end their bitter stalemate, but no specific agenda or timetable for a solution was set. It is the first sign of an easing of the political tensions that the outgoing president has warned risked leading to civil war. A9

Upsurge of Violence in Darfur
Sudanese authorities and their guerrilla enemies signed a preliminary peace agreement just two weeks ago, and a fresh upsurge of violence is already engulfing Darfur, with rebels sharply ratcheting up attacks, the government responding with heavy-handed retaliation and large patches of land turning into no-go areas for humanitarian relief. A1

Devious Colombian Traffickers
Major drug traffickers in Colombia have been presenting themselves as leaders of the paramilitary movement, in an effort to qualify for the same lenient treatment they suspect the government may soon offer to longstanding paramilitary commanders to persuade them to disarm, including protection against extradition to the United States. A3

NATIONAL A10-12

New Stem Cell Initiative Already Raising Concerns
As California moves to begin a lushly financed program of embryonic stem cell research, medical ethicists and other critics are concerned that the $3 billion ballot measure that state voters approved for the endeavor contains inadequate safeguards to ensure public oversight of the financial allocations and to guarantee public benefit from any medical breakthroughs. A10

Illegal Immigration in Arizona
More illegal immigrants were apprehended in Arizona during the last fiscal year than were caught in California, New Mexico and Texas combined, prompting some who worked for a more secure border to ask why strategies that are successful elsewhere have not worked along Arizona's border. A10

Report on Airplane Safety
The Federal Aviation Administration's campaign to keep hazardous materials off airplanes has generated thousands of enforcement cases and tens of millions of dollars in civil penalties. But the punishment is sometimes too little, too late, the inspector general of the Transportation Department concluded in a report. A10

Rehnquist to Miss More Cases
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who missed the Supreme Court's November argument session while being treated for thyroid cancer, will be absent for the December session as well, the court announced. A11

Disparity in Prison Sentences
The number of minority inmates in federal penitentiaries, as a percentage of all federal prisoners, has increased sharply since sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987, a 15-year study has concluded. A11

University Fund-Raising Game
Clashes between donors and beneficiaries are rare in the genial world of university fund-raising, but in recent years a few noisy disputes at major universities like Yale and Princeton have had a powerful impact on the fund-raising game. A1

Bob Barker, the 81 year-old host of the ''Price Is Right,'' who always ends his show with a call for spaying and neutering of dogs and cats, has established endowments of $1 million each at several law schools for the study of animal-rights law. B7

HEADLINE: Celso Furtado, 84, Dies; Influential Brazilian Economist

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
Celso Furtado, Brazil's most influential economist during the 20th century and an important theorist of methods of spurring economic growth in developing countries, died Saturday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 84. 
 His death was announced by Aloizio Mercadante, a senator of the governing Workers Party. 
 Mr. Furtado gained prominence in Brazil in the 1950's after returning from several years of study in Paris, where he received a doctorate in economics from the Sorbonne. Inspired in part by the Argentine economist Raul Prebisch, Mr. Furtado helped pioneer Latin American structuralism, which offered a distinct interpretation of poor economies. 
 Brazil, according to Mr. Furtado, was hindered by its elite's adoption of foreign cultural standards, and its economic strength was anemic because of skewed distribution of income. His classic book, ''Economic Formation of Brazil,'' was published in 1959, ushering in an era of state-guided development programs. Mr. Furtado had the opportunity to try to put some of his ideas, then considered unconventional, to work in Brazil, becoming a member of the highest echelons of the country's gargantuan federal bureaucracy. 
 A proponent of using federal resources to push through development, he was the superintendent in the late 1950's and early 1960's of Sudene, a federal institution created to encourage economic development in Brazil's drought-stricken, impoverished northeast. 
 Mr. Furtado later became Brazil's planning minister, though he was removed from that post in 1964 when a military coup toppled the administration of Joao Goulart. It was one of the lowest points of his career. 
 A Francophile like many postwar Brazilian intellectuals, Mr. Furtado sought exile in Paris, accepting a chair in economics at the Sorbonne after a short period teaching in the United States. A political thaw allowed him to return to Brazil more than a decade later. 
 Celso Monteiro Furtado, born in 1920 in the interior town of Pombal in the state of Paraiba, often identified with the sertao, the vast stretch of arid backlands in the Brazilian northeast known for hardening its inhabitants. ''Dry like a cactus,'' was how Mr. Furtado described himself, even though he attended law school in playful Rio de Janeiro and made that city his home in Brazil. 
 Mr. Furtado returned to high-ranking government jobs in the 1980's, serving as culture minister during the hyperinflationary tenure of President Jose Sarney. But he grew increasingly disenchanted with economic policy in Brazil as a new generation of economists sought to encourage growth by giving the private sector a greater role in the economy, particularly during the privatization wave of the 1990's. He spent much of that decade at his apartment in Paris.
 Even as his ideas fell out of favor in recent years, with the left-leaning government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva embracing free-market policies, Mr. Furtado sought to influence policy. For the post to lead Brazil's national development bank, he supported a controversial nominee whose ideas recalled the days when protectionism was fashionable. 
 His survivors include his wife, Rosa.

HEADLINE: Fluctuating Oil Prices Force Consumers to Place Bets

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
All around the country, people like Jennie McCann are making bets on where global oil prices might be headed this winter. But Mrs. McCann is no commodities trader or market analyst. She sits in a quiet office in Maine, where she oversees finances for York, a scenic resort town of 13,000. When she is not busy with municipal matters, she is looking for the best price to heat her home. 
 This winter, Americans are going to have to pay a lot more to keep warm, thanks to a 52 percent jump since the beginning of the year in the price of crude oil. 
 More than 8.1 million households in the United States, mainly in the Northeast, use oil -- similar to diesel fuel -- to heat their homes in the winter. 
 The government forecasts they will spend a third more on their heating bill than they did last year, with bills increasing to $1,309, an average jump of 37 percent, or $356, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. 
 Mrs. McCann and her husband began looking in early October at how much it would cost to fill up the 550-gallon fuel tank in their basement. They found they would need to pay $1.45 a gallon -- a third more than they spent last year -- so they held off. 
 Then prices rose by another 8 cents the following week, and the couple decided to wait as long as they could, figuring prices would fall eventually. Each winter, they need about 1,275 gallons of fuel, filling their tank twice to last them until the weather warms up. 
 ''We could be right or we could be wrong, but we felt prices were artificially high and we felt they would drop,'' Mrs. McCann said in a telephone interview. ''I am not a stock market person and I don't gamble, but it's too much for a lay person to make an educated guess.''
 Many Americans are facing the same questions today. Should they lock in their purchase for the whole year or wait and see if prices will drop and fill up their tanks then? 
 The answer to that question depends on where oil prices are headed. Crude oil reached a record high of $55.67 a barrel in October, the highest price since futures started trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange more than two decades ago. Americans who locked in their heating oil contracts in October could possibly end up paying more than those who sign up later.
 Crude oil prices have since dropped, and currently trade at $49.44 a barrel. 
 For those who need it, there will be plenty of heating oil to go around. But rising energy costs have rippled through the economy, forcing Americans to dig deeper into their pockets to pay their bills. 
 While some economists warn that high oil prices will eventually slow growth --the sharp rise in gasoline prices clearly contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending earlier this year -- Americans seem to have adapted as energy costs fell from their peaks. There has not been much visible impact on buying habits lately.
 In the Northeast, fuel distributors are helping soften that impact a bit. As early as the summer, many started offering their customers various winter heating options, like caps and early lock-ins. The distributors then held down their costs by buying heating oil in advance for later deliveries through the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The advantage of a lock-in option is that it protects homeowners if prices go up, said David Schildwachter, who helps run Fred M. Schildwachter & Sons, a heating oil distributor in New York. The family-owned business, which started 100 years ago as an ice maker, introduced a capped-price option in 2000, after heating oil prices rose above $2 a gallon for the first time.
 Mr. Schildwachter said he also tried to educate his customers by sending them a newsletter explaining the basics of the global oil markets. Customers who agreed to the price cap by Oct. 1 will be paying $1.79 a gallon for their fuel this winter. 
 That is higher than last year's prices, but it is still a good deal, according to Mr. Schildwachter. Heating oil hit a peak price of $2.35 a gallon on Oct. 23 and now sells for $2.20 a gallon, 37 percent more than last year at the same time. 
 ''It's like wildfire, it's out of control,'' he said. ''Anyone in the industry, except for the people who actually draw oil out of the ground, is feeling a squeeze right now.'' 
 Outside his office, two of the company's 28 green delivery trucks, emblazoned with gold lettering, were being loaded with heating fuel. Each year, they supply more than 8,000 customers and deliver 50 million gallons of oil.
 Back in Maine, where Mrs. McCann is still weighing her options, Steve Giroux, the general manager of Giroux Oil in Portland, was offering his customers heating oil for $1.50 a gallon in June. ''Today that price looks like gold,'' he said.
 Mr. Giroux said about half his regular customers have long-term contracts at locked-in prices for the winter. This protects them against sudden price rises. For others, Mr. Giroux now sells heating oil for $1.94 a gallon. 
 The Northeast is not the only region paying more to keep warm this winter. The annual winter outlook published by the Energy Information Administration recently found that even in the Midwest, for example, expenditures on propane are expected to jump to $1,440, up 26 percent from last year. Natural gas for household heating, by far the largest source, is also expected to rise for a typical American home to $1,000, up 15 percent. 
 There are several factors driving the price surge this year. Demand for oil in China rose to unexpected levels; instability in several oil-producing countries, including Iraq and Nigeria, threatened supplies; and closer to home, hurricanes shut down production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Amid all this, the McCanns still have to make up their minds -- and probably very soon, as winter weather finally appears to be arriving and the heating oil left over from last year is dwindling in their tank.
 ''We may be foolish,'' Mrs. McCann said this week. ''But we're still waiting.''

HEADLINE: Unable to Hear or Speak, but Communicating Just the Same

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
His hands speak for him, sometimes gesturing feverishly, other times gently stirring the air, conducting a symphony without sound.
 When Daniel Hawkins is not expressing himself in American Sign Language, he is doing so through his charcoal drawings, his radiant images of sunlight and hearts, and his clay vases.
 ''He's always been an artist,'' said his youngest sister, Pat Hawkins. ''Not being able to hear and speak, he put his natural talents into his artwork.'' 
 Mr. Hawkins, 65, has difficulty reading lips and, according to Ms. Hawkins, his three siblings are not adept at signing, so communicating is a challenge for him. 
 All his life, his art has been his voice, and he has learned to speak in many mediums, including needlepoint, rug-hooking and knitting. 
 For the last 15 years he has been attending the Manhattan Continuing Day Treatment program at FEGS, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 The day treatment program provides group activities for adults with mental and emotional problems as well as for those who are deaf, hard of hearing or visually impaired. Mr. Hawkins attends art therapy classes there, and his portfolio shows sketches of faces, ranging from those he has seen in magazines to that of Abraham Lincoln. There are also still lifes and holiday symbols, like jack-o'-lanterns and mistletoe. 
 ''That's me,'' Mr. Hawkins said through an interpreter, Christiana Kuczma, a deafness rehabilitation practitioner at the day treatment program, as he pointed to a drawing of a boy in a baseball cap, smiling wide enough to expose a missing tooth. The face of the boy is still recognizable in the face of the man: the mischievous grin, the missing tooth. 
 The Hawkins children grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in a single-parent household. Ms. Hawkins, the youngest of the four siblings, said her mother spoiled her and Mr. Hawkins. 
 ''I was the baby, and Danny needed special care,'' she said. ''We were very tight with Mom.'' 
 Mr. Hawkins and his sister were still living with their mother in 1974 when she died of a stomach tumor at 66. 
 Her death stunned them both. 
 When asked about his mother, Mr. Hawkins put his index fingers underneath his eyes and brought them down over his cheeks, the sign language symbol for ''cry.''
 It is perhaps the most succinct way of conveying the hurt. 
 Even with words, Ms. Hawkins had a hard time expressing herself after her mother's death, and her level of distress intensified her concern for Mr. Hawkins. ''If I'm like this,'' she wondered, ''how is he?'' 
 It turned out that Mr. Hawkins was not well at all. He stopped going to a community center where he liked to draw, lift weights and socialize. Instead, he found solace in drinking wine and eventually became an alcoholic. His siblings helped him get back on track by taking him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that included other deaf people. 
 Mr. Hawkins has been sober for several years now. ''I'm finished with that,'' he said of alcohol. ''Even though I might have a desire for it, I push it aside.''
 Helping him to do that is the day treatment program, where he attends substance abuse programs in addition to art therapy. 
 Still, each day is a challenge. Mr. Hawkins is unemployed and getting by on his Supplemental Security Income, which is little more than $500 a month. He lives with his sister, who is his legal guardian. 
 To help Mr. Hawkins maintain his stability and his sobriety, and to continue his art, FEGS tapped the Neediest Cases Fund. The fund provided $300 for art supplies. He is now able to be creative at home, on evenings and on weekends, when he is not at the day treatment program. His art is also a way for him to stay engaged and pass the hours when his sister, who works nights, is not around to keep him company. 
 Saturday is their day together. Although Ms. Hawkins does not know much American Sign Language, she says that she and her brother communicate just fine. Having grown up together, they often understand each other implicitly. Naturally, it is a bond made tighter by shared loss. 
 ''She's been gone 30 years,'' Ms. Hawkins said of her mother. ''And we're just now coming around.'' 
 They have gotten through it together, with and without words. Mr. Hawkins said he dreams about his mother sometimes. But his sister is the one he leans on now. 
 Each Mother's Day, he brings her flowers.

HEADLINE: In Annual Rite, Shoppers Mob Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON; Reporting for this article was contributed by Anne Berryman in Athens, Ga.; Maria Herrera in Miami; Carolyn Marshall in San Francisco; Gretchen Ruethling in Chicago; and Katie Zezima in Boston.

 BODY:
Surrounded by hundreds of shoppers grabbing bargain-priced flat-screen television sets and portable music players early yesterday morning, Jill Mulhere was trying to figure out what happened to her shopping cart, heaped with presents, at the Best Buy store in Paramus, N.J. She had paused to look at just one more deal -- an Allegro DVD-VCR combination for $59.99 -- before joining the long checkout line.
 ''Somebody actually stole my shopping cart!'' Ms. Mulhere said. ''I said, 'That's it; this place is a zoo.'''
 Instead of returning home, though, she drove to Circuit City, about a mile away along Route 17, a slow-moving highway lined with strip malls. Circuit City was only slightly less chaotic, but she ended up buying the DVD-VCR player, a Sony, for $134. 
 ''You know,'' she said, ''my brother asked me at Thanksgiving, 'Was there really all this Black Friday pandemonium when we were growing up?'''
 Across the country yesterday, millions of Americans -- most of them taking the entire day off from work -- rushed into suburban malls, filled downtown shopping streets and department stores and mobbed discount stores everywhere. 
 Often, they were waving colorful circulars and shopping lists, hungry for the hundreds of bargains promised to those who got there first.
 Merchants, eager to lure crowds of buyers wielding credit cards, opened even earlier than last year -- in some places well before dawn.
 Any specific figures on how much people bought yesterday will not be available until the end of the weekend at the earliest -- and maybe not even then. Nonetheless, based on anecdotal evidence and some initial soundings, retailers generally were optimistic about the coming holiday shopping season.
 ''We've never had so many early birds come out for the specials, not in numbers like this,'' said Karen MacDonald, a spokesman for Taubman Centers, which owns or manages 22 shopping centers across the country, including the high-end Short Hills mall in New Jersey.
 And with just about every store promising an unbeatable deal, the day after Thanksgiving -- which had lost its status as the highest spending day of the year a decade ago to the Saturday before Christmas and regained it just last year -- looks likely to hang on to the distinction another year. 
 Not far from Union Square in San Francisco, Pam Donohue, 49, an aide at a senior citizens' food delivery service, said she was buying the brand items coveted by her two teenagers: Ugg boots, an Ugg black purse and BCBG black shoes. But she was also comparison shopping to get the really big present for this Christmas: a Hewlett-Packard Pavilion desktop computer the girls need for school.
 In Chicago, Tammy Jowers, 40, and her family braved a snowstorm Wednesday night, going from their home in Dyersburg, Tenn., to line up in front of Marshall Field's at 5:30 a.m. ''Everybody wants an iPod,'' Ms. Jowers said. ''Instead of a cruise, we're getting iPods.'' 
 For this year's Black Friday -- called that because it is the day retailers traditionally expected to break into the black, or profitable territory, for the year -- the emphasis was on electronics, according to retailers, analysts and a host of shoppers interviewed yesterday.
 Part of the reason, according to pollsters like Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research, a survey firm in Charleston, S.C., was that toy manufacturers had failed to come up with any must-have new toys to compete with the MP3 players, high-definition television sets and heavily promoted new computer games that seemed to be on millions of lists. And no particular articles of clothing were creating much buzz either, retail experts said.
 At the Sears stores in the New York region, John Ford, the district manager, said consumer electronics was definitely the top-selling category yesterday. Larry Costello, a national spokesman for Sears, Roebuck, said foot traffic was significantly higher than last year in every major market, probably because Sears tripled its number of sales promotions over last year. The chain gave out $10 gift cards to the first 200 people in line at each store, along with offering early shoppers digital cameras for $49.99 and DVD players for $19.99.
 Wal-Mart, by far the nation's largest retailer, has decided not to release one-day figures for the day after Thanksgiving, as the company did in the past. 
 ''Although we expect to have one of the best days of the year, it's not fair to use it as a barometer for the whole season,'' Karen Burk, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said last night. She added that the company was ''cautiously optimistic'' for the holidays.
 Scott Krugman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, repeated his trade group's projections for the holiday season: a rise of 4.5 percent over last year, slightly down from the 5.1 percent increase over 2002. This year, pollsters and consultants, in e-mailed predictions, are using words like ''respectable'' and ''decent'' to describe expected sales for the 2004 holidays. Ever since 1999, when sales increases reached double-digit levels at most retailers, the industry has been forced to live with much more modest gains.
 Indeed, while the economy has improved in recent months and surveys of consumer confidence have suggested that more Americans are feeling better about their personal finances, plenty of shoppers in malls on Friday said they intended to keep their spending under better control this year.
 Many also said they had less money to spend. ''Things cost more this year: gas, electricity, everything,'' said Aaron Mistretta, a 27-year-old salesman from Brighton, Mass., shopping at a discount electronics store in Watertown, Mass.
 At the costume jewelry counter in Macy's in San Francisco, Socorra Lane, 49, an insurance account manager from Folsom, Calif., said she had sharply reduced her Christmas gift budget to $600. With that money, she intends to buy about 20 gifts, 15 of them for children.
 And for many shoppers yesterday, Friday looked like a good day not to kick off their gift shopping but to finish most of it.
 For Geri Perez, a school principal from Union City , N.J., and her friend Diane Capizzi, a school supervisor at the same school, the shopping season is about over. About 9 a.m. yesterday, clutching red shopping bags from Lord & Taylor in Paramus, they said they had bought jewelry, sweaters and other gifts. As a charge-card customer, Ms. Capizzi had been mailed coupons -- and spent them all.
 In Massachusetts, Mr. Mistretta also said he had planned to knock out most of his shopping yesterday morning. The prices were right, he said, and the items he looked for were available.
 Then there were those who vowed never to shop again on Black Friday. ''Shopping is boring,'' said Enrique Yanez, 26, who works in the human resources department at New York University. ''The sales are not that great and they're crowded and you have to get up at 5:30.''
 Nevertheless, he and his friend, Margaret Calvitti, 22, got the flat-screen monitor they wanted for $466, with enough of a rebate to bring it down to $349.
 Shoppers had often researched their purchases in different ways. Many of them had used the Web -- for shopping and for investigating -- but others did their research in a more traditional way.
 ''We bought the paper the day before, but there were so many ads in the paper and on TV, it was hard to make up our minds,'' said Maddy Santiago, a hairdresser who arrived at the Aventura Mall near Miami at 5 a.m. with her 16-year-old daughter, Yvonne. 
 Outside Boston, Mr. Mistretta got in line at 3:30 a.m. to snag a deal on an eMachine desktop, an inexpensive personal computer. He was No.6 of the 15 people handed tickets to buy one for less than $200.
 At a Best Buy in suburban New Jersey, John Guerra, the manager, said 2,000 people lined up for similar tickets to buy Toshiba laptops for $499 and 17-inch flat-screen televisions for $199 (the two prices take rebates in account). He only gave out 20 or 25 tickets to the first in line; the rest received coffee or hot chocolate and encouragement to stay.
 But some people were trying to beat the system, the manager said. They waited in line, grabbed one of the limited-stock coupons -- and then went elsewhere, figuring they could come back later to redeem them. 
 Foiled again! In Best Buy, the loudspeakers were announcing: ''Only five minutes to redeem coupons for digital cameras! Only five minutes, shoppers!''
 To clear space in their S.U.V.'s for more purchases, buyers jettisoned giant cardboard boxes from 27-inch televisions. ''I can't believe they'd do that,'' grumbled one clerk, stacking up the empty boxes. ''I think they need these if they want to return them.''
 Others headed to shops where they could buy a broader range of things. In Athens, Ga., Ruth Vollrath was headed to a Target.
 Ms. Vollrath, who has three children and is married to a pastor, said she planned to spend less because the family had had ''some financial setbacks'' during the year. So she checked out the discount stores' circulars. ''I'm excited about the digital cameras there, the Norelco electric shaver for my husband and a luggage set for my 12-year-old son Reuben.''
 Despite the carefully researched lists that so many shoppers carried with them yesterday, there were always surprises -- even for those who say they are on a much tighter budget than last Christmas.
 Inside one of Ms. Vollrath's many shopping bags was a small lime-green lamp, made to look like a frilly silk purse, complete with a furry black boa top and a clear beaded handle. The lamp, she said, seemed perfect for her 19-year-old niece. It was only $9.99.
 ''This is a must-have,'' she said.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Germany: Mercedes Earnings May Fall

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest carmaker, said the dollar's decline against the euro would reduce the earnings of the Mercedes-Benz division, adding to the woes of the luxury-car unit. ''We weren't prepared for the dollar to be at this level,'' Thomas Weber, the management board member responsible for research, said in Frankfurt on Thursday. ''It will influence the results at Mercedes and 2005 won't be an easy year.'' Earnings at Mercedes Car Group plunged by half in the third quarter as American sales fell. The carmaker spent money to improve quality, which suffered with the debut of new electronics in cars, said J.D. Power and Associates. Mercedes's market share in the United States dropped to 1.2 percent in the first nine months from 1.3 percent amid competition from Bayerische Motoren Werke.

HEADLINE: This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. 
 The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data. 
 The shift would be a further sign of the decay of Michigan's economy as the domestic auto industry has struggled to maintain its market share. The state is projected to finish the year having made about 2.6 million cars and trucks, down from 3.4 million a decade earlier, according to Ward's. Ontario is expected to make about 2.7 million vehicles, up from 2.1 million in 1994. In all, about 89,000 vehicles will separate the two regions this year, according to current production plans. 
 ''For the history of the auto industry, it's been the top producer,'' said Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's, referring to Michigan. 
 Ontario, however, has benefited from a more diverse auto industry beyond the traditional Big Three domestic producers -- General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler.
 ''They have Honda and Toyota,'' Mr. Stoddard said. Toyota has a plant in Cambridge, Ontario, that makes the Toyota Corolla, Matrix and the Lexus RX330 and is capable of making a quarter-million vehicles a year. The Honda plant in Alliston, Ontario, is able to make nearly 400,000 vehicles a year, including the Civic, the Odyssey minivan and the Honda Pilot sport utility vehicle. All of the Big Three also have plants in Ontario. 
 Toyota in particular has been gaining new customers at a fast clip, while the traditional domestic industry's market share has dipped below 60 percent this year in the United States; in the 1950's, G.M. alone made up more than half the market. 
 Few states have suffered job losses as steep as Michigan's, because of the exodus of manufacturing work. Auto suppliers have been hard hit by the industry's advancing globalization, which has driven small tool and die shops out of business and shifted work at big supply companies to Mexico and China, where labor costs are a fraction of those in the United States. Shrinking Big Three sales have led to plant closings, layoffs and shift reductions. And while most foreign automakers operate assembly plants in the United States, they favor the South, where labor is cheaper and sentiment runs against the Detroit-based United Automobile Workers union. 
 ''Most of the transplants got as far away as they could possibly get in the United States from Michigan and the U.A.W. and still be somewhere near an interstate,'' said David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. 
 Canada is attractive, in part, because of its nationalized health care system, which negates perhaps the largest competitive burden faced by domestic manufacturers. G.M. spends roughly $1,400 a vehicle produced in the United States on health care, more than it spends on steel. 
 Both regions have been working hard to attract new investment. Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, recently pressed the state to entice Toyota to build a large research facility near Ann Arbor, despite receiving much higher bids for the 690 acres of land. 
 ''Toyota has a partner in the State of Michigan, and we will do whatever we can to extend open arms,'' she said in a statement earlier this year. 
 Ontario officials have also been offering substantial incentives, including a $100 million package to Ford earlier this year to rebuild a plant in Oakville, Ontario. 
 ''Ontario is quite happy to discuss any proposal with any assembler who is interested in coming,'' said Lisa Roberts, a spokeswoman for the ministry of economic development and trade. 
 Ontario might not be on top for long. Michigan's capacity exceeds that of Ontario by about half a million vehicles, so if sales of some critical new vehicles are strong, the outcome could be different next year. This year, several popular models were made in Ontario, including Chrysler's 300 series sedan. 
 ''The Chrysler plant builds the minivans there, which are a high-volume vehicle,'' Mr. Stoddard said of Ontario. ''G.M. builds its Impala, which is one of the biggest car sellers, and it also builds its full-size pickups.'' 
 At the same time, some Michigan plants were idled while they were prepared for new models. Next year, Ford's redesigned River Rouge plant in Dearborn will have a full year of production of the Ford F-Series pickup, the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the United States, and a joint venture with Ford's Mazda affiliate in Flat Rock, just south of Detroit, will make the redesigned Mustang. 
 Chrysler is producing a new version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee in the state, and G.M. will make its new G6 sedan, but weak sales of some older models, like the Pontiac Grand Am and an old version of the Chevrolet Malibu, could offset that. 
 ''You can slice and dice it a lot of different ways,'' Mr. Stoddard said of Michigan's prospects for 2005. ''But I'd say it will be neck and neck.''

HEADLINE: Stadium Plan Generates Heat in the Mayor's Race

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Even in the most incipient of mayoral races, and even around the most unlikely issues, racial and ethnic politics are never far from the surface in New York City.
 That was abundantly clear yesterday when Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. took a shot at Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for the mayor's criticisms of Cablevision, the central foe in the mayor's plan to build a $1.4 billion stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan, and the company's recent hiring of an ally of Fernando Ferrer, who is expected to run for mayor next year.
 Cablevision, the parent company of Madison Square Garden, hotly opposes Mr. Bloomberg's plan to build a stadium for the Jets using $600 million from taxpayers as part of his plan to develop the far West Side. 
 Cablevision has made contracts with numerous lobbyists who are close to various public officials to aid it in its opposition, and it recently hired Lorraine Cortes-Vasquez -- a contributor to Mr. Ferrer's campaigns and formerly chief of staff to the Bronx County Democratic Party chairman, Roberto Ramirez -- as the company's vice president for government relations. (The Jets have hired their own coterie of well-connected lobbyists.)
 This week, Mr. Bloomberg was asked about the hiring of Ms. Cortes-Vasquez and said of Cablevision: ''Their strategy seems to be hire somebody who represents each politician that could possibly affect the decision,'' referring to Ms. Cortes-Vasquez as well as to Kenneth Bruno, son of Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the State Senate, and Patricia Lynch, formerly a top aide to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
 Mr. Bloomberg added, ''The campaign finance board is going to have to decide when it's real lobbying or when it's part of somebody's campaign.'' 
 Yesterday, Mr. Diaz, who represents part of the Bronx, released a statement chastising Mr. Bloomberg, calling his remarks ''shameful,'' and demanding that the mayor apologize.
 In a follow-up interview over the phone Mr. Diaz said: ''I don't think that the mayor should attack this reputable Latina woman who has made us all proud. The stadium, which I support, should not be a referendum on his candidacy. He should talk about it on the merits.''
 On Wednesday, his voice infused with rage, Mr. Ferrer called a reporter to complain about the mayor's remarks. 
 Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, never mentioned race or ethnicity. But it is likely that Mr. Ferrer and his supporters are extremely sensitive to anything he perceives as an ethnically tinged attack, however subtle.
 The 2001 Democratic mayoral primary exploded in a fireball of racial tension when supporters of Mr. Ferrer's opponent, Mark Green, distributed literature in white neighborhoods linking Mr. Ferrer to the Rev. Al Sharpton.
 Mr. Green disavowed that effort, but the ensuing resentment was widely believed to have kept many Hispanic voters from pulling the lever for Mr. Green in the general election, contributing to Mr. Bloomberg's win.
 In recent months, the Jets football team has tried hard to drum up support for the stadium among Hispanic leaders around the state.
 The team has hired Alfredo Vidal, president of the Vidal Group, to lobby Hispanic leaders, and has won the support of Mr. Diaz, Peter M. Rivera, another Bronx assemblyman, and Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America.
 Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, denied in the strongest terms yesterday that Mr. Bloomberg was attacking Ms. Cortes-Vasquez, saying instead the mayor's attacks have been directed toward the head of Cablevision.
 ''The mayor has criticized one person and one person only,'' Mr. Skyler said, ''James Dolan, who is disgracefully trying to stop New York City from creating jobs and developing its economy so he can protect his monopoly. It isn't about anyone else, and whoever says otherwise either isn't aware of the mayor's comments or is distorting them.''
 Mr. Diaz yesterday was unbowed, insisting that Mr. Bloomberg's statements were tinged with racial overtones. 
 ''People get angry and get frustrated when it's a woman and a Latina,'' he said. ''It turns people off. And remember this is coming from me, who supports the stadium.''
 The spokesman for Cablevision, Charles Schueler, declined to comment last night. Over the winter, as the candidates and their agendas fall into relief, voters will be able to see whether race will once again be injected into the various economic and social debates of the campaign.
 ''I hope it won't,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''But certainly his statements are headed in the wrong direction.''

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Authorizes Trade Sanctions Against the United States

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization authorized the European Union, Canada and five other countries on Friday to impose about $150 million in trade sanctions on the United States in retaliation for an import duties law that has been ruled illegal.
 ''It's been approved,'' said Amina Mohamed, the Kenyan ambassador to the trade group and chairwoman of the organization's dispute settlement body, according to The Associated Press.
 The sanctions would be aimed at a wide range of American exports, possibly including steel ball bearings, cod, shoes and apples. Most would be imposed by Japan and the European Union, which have been the hardest hit by the United States law. 
 Known as the Byrd amendment, after Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who proposed it in 2000, the law gives American companies the proceeds from duties levied on foreign rivals deemed to be dumping products in the United States at below-market prices.
 Seven trading partners of the Unites States complained that this punished the importers twice: once with the levy and again by giving a financial lift to their American competitors. The other countries seeking sanctions are Mexico, Japan, India, South Korea and Brazil.
 The W.T.O. ruled early last year that the Byrd amendment was illegal. The United States has since tried to avert sanctions by appealing the decision, but to no avail.
 The office of the United States trade representative said on Friday that it was working to revamp the law. ''We already notified the W.T.O. that we intend to comply with our international commitments,'' said a spokesman, Richard Mills. ''We are working with Congress on these efforts.''
 But he added that the United States would take whatever action was necessary to defend the country against unfair competition from abroad. ''These issues don't affect the United States' right to implement our trade laws to make sure Americans are treated fairly,'' Mr. Mills said.
 Although the amounts involved in this trade dispute are modest compared with other recent cases, the W.T.O.'s decision about the Byrd amendment is unusual in that it involved several countries taking action against one.
 It could set a trend in future disputes, said Lourdes Catrain, a trade lawyer and partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Hogan & Hartson. 
 ''This is very significant; it sends a very important message to the United States,'' she said. ''Its trading partners are getting tired of the way the United States behaves.'' 
 The European Union is expected to apply punitive duties worth about $80 million on American produce to compensate for the losses incurred by European companies punished under the Byrd amendment.
 It has drawn up a list of 80 products that could be sanctioned. The list was adapted from one drawn up in a recent dispute about illegal American import tariffs on steel, and will be winnowed down. 
 The short list will not be drawn up until the European Union officially decides to impose the sanctions. That decision is expected to be made in early 2005, according to the new trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, who took office at the beginning of this week.

HEADLINE: Simmering Trade Disputes Will Greet Bush in Canada

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Canadians remember two things about Ronald Reagan's trip to Quebec City in 1985: his rendition of ''When Irish Eyes Are Smiling'' with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and the announcement that the two countries would work to foster free trade and end lingering disputes. 
 Canadians, however, feel they are still waiting. While trade with the United States has soared 135 percent since 1988 to $391 billion, several disputes will be on the table when President Bush comes to Ottawa on Tuesday to meet with Prime Minister Paul Martin. Chief among them will be a dispute over the United States' 27 percent duty on Canadian softwood lumber, which has been going on since 1982. 
 Despite the free trade pact negotiated by the Reagan and Mulroney governments, the birth of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the formation of the World Trade Organization, Canadian industries still abide by trade penalty laws drawn up by the United States instead of by a multilateral body. Richard Mills, a spokesman for Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, strongly rejected suggestions that United States antidumping laws were unfair.
 ''Our process is fair and transparent and in large measure has been upheld by the W.T.O.,'' he said. ''Over all, our trade relationship with Canada is very good. We have disputes with one another. We handle them, and trade goes on.'' The United States had a $49.3 billion trade deficit with Canada for the first nine months of this year. 
 While softwood lumber remains the most visible case, it is not the only one. American wheat growers are challenging the system Canada uses to sell its grain. Hog producers say Canadian swine are being shipped to the United States at unfairly low prices. And the border has been closed to Canadian cattle ever since a calf in Alberta was found in 2003 to have mad cow disease.
 Earlier this week, the United States filed an extraordinary challenge of a Nafta decision in August that found Canadian lumber exports are not harming American mills. The challenge follows Canadian victories before six different forums in recent years, including the W.T.O. and regional bodies. Canada's international trade minister, Jim Peterson, suggested this week that the time had come for the United States to give up. ''Panel after panel has made it clear that Canadian softwood lumber is not harming the American industry,'' he said. ''We expect to see duties refunded.''
 Canada is among the countries that has been seeking relief from a part of United States trade law known as the Byrd amendment, which transfers duties collected from foreign imports to American companies. Under the amendment, the United States is proposing to give American lumber companies the $2.5 billion it has collected under the softwood lumber duty.
 Canada threatened retaliation this week, and proposed hitting a variety of American products, from peanut butter to yachts, with 100 percent tariffs. On Friday the W.T.O. approved a measure to let the European Union, Canada and five other countries impose trade sanctions on the United States to compensate for the effects of the Byrd amendment.
 Despite years of what it views as trade harassment, however, things have rarely been better in the Canadian lumber industry. John Allan, president of the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, said that the tariffs had forced the Canadian industry to improve operations. Canada's share of the American market has remained fairly constant for the last several years, at around 34 percent.
 ''When the tariffs were first levied, I was the first guy to say, 'This is the end,''' Mr. Allan recalled. ''But the American lumber litigation drove a new cost paradigm in Canada.''
 An industry consolidation in Canada helped reduce costs by allowing Canadian producers to build larger mills. Investments in new machinery, including computerized cutting equipment, have, by Mr. Allan's calculations, increased the amount of lumber extracted from each log by 16 percent since about 1991. And to raise efficiency further, most mills in British Columbia now operate around the clock.
 In addition, lumber demand this past summer was exceptionally high in the United States, offsetting both the tariff and rise in the Canadian dollar. ''The duties didn't make much difference,'' Mr. Allan said. ''It was a seller's market.''
 At the heart of the lumber dispute is land ownership. Softwood in the United States is generally harvested from private land. In Canada, lumber companies generally pay fees to chop down trees on land owned by the provinces.
 Those stumpage fees, as they are known, have been raised over the years in an attempt to placate American producers and also in part to conform with a W.T.O. ruling. Over the years, Canada has also proposed a special lumber export tax, generally of about 15 percent, to end the dispute. William A. Dymond, a former Canadian trade negotiator who is now a senior executive fellow at the Centre for Trade Policy and Law at Carleton University in Ottawa, noted, however, that there had been an overall lessening in trade tensions. Antidumping disputes involving manufactured goods have almost disappeared, largely because they find their own political balance. For instance, while restricting Canadian steel imports might please the American steel industry, it would upset United States auto and automotive parts makers.
 The continuing trade disputes sometimes lead to the impression in Canada that the relationship with its neighbor to the South is in poor health, despite the overwhelming growth in trade. Bruce Campbell, executive director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and a longtime critic of many Canadian trade policies, sees no end in sight.
 ''These disputes are like the Canadian winter,'' he said. ''They're going to be with us all the time.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Women Strive to Mix New Liberties and Old Beliefs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
By all appearances, Ashrat Khwajazadah and Naheed Mawjzada are thoroughly modern American women.
 Long-haired and dark-eyed, they spurn the headscarves and modest outfits customarily worn by Afghan women, preferring hip-hugging slacks. Both of them are in their early 20's and both of them have taken a route still somewhat controversial among Afghans in Flushing, Queens -- going to college to pursue professions. Ms. Khwajazadah studied speech pathology at Queens College and Ms. Mawjzada majors in political science at Adelphi University. Both also defy the ideal of a reticent Afghan womanhood, with Ms. Mawjzada speaking up forcefully when men talk politics at the dinner table.
 But there are incongruities. Both of them, by design, have never dated. Like most young women in their Afghan enclave in Flushing, they are waiting for their parents to pick their spouses. 
 ''It's been drilled into your head since you were a little girl: 'Don't talk with guys, don't ruin your reputation, everyone will gossip about you,''' said Ms. Khwajazadah, a high-spirited woman who came here as a 2-year-old with her refugee parents. Nevertheless, she added, ''I'm happy with my decision.''
 ''I'm very close with my family and that helps me because they want to do what's best for me,'' she said. 
 In testing how far they can go in forsaking tradition, these women illustrate the delicate balance younger Afghans, particularly women, have had to strike as they grow up in a comparatively freewheeling society with parents -- often uneducated and unable to speak English -- who have held tight to their Afghan conventions.
 To be sure, the Afghans' transition is an old immigrant story -- one that could be told about the Irish, Italians and Jews of the 19th century or the newer groups that have seasoned New York City's stew. Those newcomers too looked on with anger or resignation as their children gradually (and their grandchildren more cavalierly) adopted the prevailing culture.
 But the Afghan version has its own endemic twists, community advocates say. Older Afghans, particularly women, often have had no schooling whatsoever. Even today, some families insist that girls, whose non-Afghan friends roam freely, return home immediately after school. It is not uncommon for girls to be engaged as young as 13 and be married by 16. 
 The Afghan story in New York has garnered more than the usual curiosity because Afghanistan has drawn so much attention on the world stage, first in the military response to Sept. 11 and now as the fragile government of President Hamid Karzai tries to establish democracy, including expansion of women's rights.
 There are 5,446 Afghans in New York City and over 9,100 in the metropolitan area, according to the 2000 census. A large proportion came here with grants of asylum after treacherous odysseys to escape either the Soviet occupation of 1979 or Taliban rule that began in 1996. 
 Manizha Naderi, the 28-year-old director of Women for Afghan Women, which offers counseling and instructional programs, remembers how at 4 years old she crossed the desert into Pakistan on a single motorcycle that also carried her parents, her 2-year-old brother, 9-month-old sister and the driver.
 The two largest enclaves of Afghans are in Flushing -- north of Queens College and in the largely Chinese and Korean area north of Northern Boulevard. Flushing has four Afghan mosques, a half-dozen kabob houses and the Kouchi Market, which besides native spices and breads carries Afghan mandolins (rababs) and billiards-like board games (karams). 
 New Yorkers commonly encounter Afghan men in the fried chicken restaurants they own and in the ubiquitous sidewalk coffee carts of Midtown. But women are more out of sight. A quarter of Afghan women have never been to school and only half have completed high school, according to a study by Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College, and Kaisa Hagen, a student there. Only one quarter work outside the home, compared with 60 percent for other New York women.
 Ms. Naderi said that ''Afghanistan has a very patriarchal culture and women don't have rights,'' and those views migrate here.
 ''Men have corrupted views of Islam and actually believe women are second-class citizens and are there to take care of them,'' she said. ''They don't let them go to school or to work.''
 Afghans from the capital, Kabul, are less bound by tradition than those from the villages and those who fled the Soviets are more conservative than those who fled the Taliban. Some Afghan Muslims who have been here for decades are so acculturated they put up Christmas trees, but in general Afghans here are trying to sustain crucial remnants of their culture.
 For more than a few families even the notion of educating their daughters beyond high school is regarded as daring, Ms. Naderi said. But more leaders are encouraging it. Mohammed Sherzad, the imam of Masjid Hazrat-I-Abubakr Sadiq, on Union Street in north Flushing (there is a similarly named mosque nearby from which Imam Sherzad was ousted) looks favorably upon women who postpone having children until they finish college.
 ''A good woman is one who is educated, both for her children and her society,'' he said. 
 Dr. Tahira Homayun, a gynecologist whose husband is an economic adviser to President Karzai, said some Afghan girls have more successful school careers than their brothers because struggling families often press boys to work.
 Ms. Naderi said that as a result of the community's lingering patriarchal structures, violence toward wives is much more common than the community admits.
 ''There's a saying that the food your husband feeds you doesn't come for free,'' she said. ''And men actually think they have a right under the Koran to beat their wives.''
 But no characteristic seems more ironclad than the convention of having parents arrange their children's marriages.
 ''Afghan people can't meet each other prior to getting engaged,'' said a 65-year-old mother of six who was taking English classes given by Women for Afghan Women. She asked that her name not be used because seeing her name in print made her uncomfortable. ''It's an embarrassment for the family.''
 Much of that stigma derives from the treasured principle of family honor. If a daughter chooses to find her own spouse, her father's stature will be diminished, the family name tainted by gossip, and her sisters may find it harder to marry. 
 ''The girl is a trophy piece,'' said Ms. Mawjzada, the daughter of a coffee vendor who in addition to studying at Adelphi works in customer service at Geico insurance. ''If the girl has a good reputation, the family has a good reputation.''
 Parents are more willing to close their eyes to a teenage Don Juan, and marriage customs for a man are also more lenient. Bashir Rahim, a 29-year-old computer technician, says if he meets a girl that interests him at a family gathering he might ask her for her address, then send his parents to her home to start a conversation about marriage.
 Girls learn by trial and error how far they can stretch tradition, but defying the code outright exacts a steep price. Ms. Naderi was married at 16 to a man she chose on her own. Her mother and grandmother did not speak to her for 10 years. 
 ''My mother still tells me she can't look at people because they know her daughter married in this way,'' she said.
 Masuda Sultan, a 26-year-old Flushing woman who is doing graduate work in public administration at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, was not even 16 when her father, the owner of a fried chicken restaurant in Harlem, contrived with an acquaintance to have her married to a doctor twice her age. She got to see her future husband three times before the wedding.
 ''I actually thought it could work,'' she recalled. ''When your actions are limited and you're from a certain world and you're young and you respect your family, you go along with their wishes even if you have extreme doubts.'' 
 Key issues like how far she could go in school were left murky. But when it became clear after the wedding that Ms. Sultan wanted to put off having children until she finished college, the tensions became irreconcilable. Ms. Sultan lapsed into what she called a deep depression, and after three years she and her husband agreed to divorce, a rare and humiliating event in the Afghan community and one that often attaches blame to the woman. Ms. Sultan, who moved back with her parents into the same room she had shared with her sister, recalled that female friends found it so difficult to believe that she could leave her husband for the reasons she did that they asked if he beat or betrayed her.
 ''The core issue was really a different philosophy of what it means to be Afghan and what it means to be American,'' she said. ''Ultimately I was being treated as a child and my role was set and I was told what I could and couldn't do.''

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Chief Financial Officers Gone?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
IT took Thomas B. Sager 17 years and five employers to attain his dream of becoming a chief financial officer; it took him five years and two chief finance posts to realize that he did not like the job. ''I got tired of spending years defending strategies I knew were flawed, of working with values that weren't my own, of being responsible to chief executives and boards that were under huge pressure to perform,'' he said. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Sager, 45, quit as the chief financial officer of Zoots, a national chain of dry cleaners, and bought Tri-Valley Sports, a small sporting goods business in Medway, Mass., eight miles from his home. 
 Kenneth S. Goldman loved being a chief financial officer, a role he played at six companies over 20 years. But his next-to-last employer, Student Advantage, fell apart during the dot-com implosion. He had a ''difference of philosophies'' with the chief executive of Lodestar, his last employer. And he watched with dismay as a growing number of chief financial officers ''fell on their swords'' in the post-Enron glare of regulatory scrutiny. 
 In July 2002, Mr. Goldman became an investment banker at Mirus Capital Advisors. He has several clients, so he does not feel the pressure to be loyal to one boss at all costs. He can eat dinner with his children more often. And he is not in a harsh public spotlight.
 ''Every C.F.O. has been pushed at times to take something that is clearly black and white and color it a shade of gray,'' Mr. Goldman, 46, said. ''But when the chief executive is shot at, he uses the chief financial officer as a human shield. Being a C.F.O. has become one of the riskiest jobs in America.''
 The push for better ethics and transparent accounting in corporate America, including the drive to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley law in 2002, has had an unexpected side effect: more finance chiefs are calling it quits. 
 ''Coping with the pressures of Sarbanes-Oxley even as they try to guide companies through a recession has put an enormous strain on C.F.O.'s and their staffs,'' said Julia Homer, editor in chief of CFO magazine. 
 It has also taken the fun out of the job. ''Sarbanes-Oxley has turned C.F.O.'s into scorekeepers rather than players, and they just can't be strategic anymore,'' said Eleanor Bloxham, co-president of the Corporate Governance Alliance, a consulting firm in Westerville, Ohio.
 E.Peter McLean, a vice chairman at Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, said that this year through mid-November, 62 chief financial officers at Fortune 500 companies had left their jobs; by year-end, he expects that total to reach nearly 70, a number that would mirror last year's. Over the last three years, more than 225 C.F.O.'s of the Fortune 500 companies have left. 
 Departures at smaller or privately held companies are harder to chronicle, Mr. McLean said, but he expects that the pace is just as heady in those sectors. Indeed, there has been a steady drip-drip-drip of corporate announcements of C.F.O. departures, often explained with phrases like ''to pursue other career interests'' that do not suggest another job is waiting. 
 Nor will the pace slow down, said Gordon Grand, a managing director at Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm. ''When the economy was bad and Sarbanes-Oxley was new, many companies and C.F.O.'s didn't want to risk change,'' he said. ''Now, there's a greater willingness to make change on both sides of the equation.'' 
 Some finance chiefs, of course, are just changing companies. But many are leaving the field entirely. Debby Hopkins, a career chief financial officer, recently switched to chief technology officer at Citigroup, while Thomas A. Madden, the chief financial officer of Ingram Micro, has announced that he will leave in April to teach at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California at Irvine.
 Of course, a finance chief's departure is not always bad for the company. Mr. McLean said that it could give companies a chance to bring in people with fresher thoughts and better technical skills. 
 Others said it also offered a chance to promote diversity in upper ranks. ''Women are a lot more prevalent in the financial pipeline than in other routes to the top, and this may open many doors for them,'' said Sheila W. Wellington, a professor of management at New York University's Stern School of Business. 
 Bu they may not like what they find when they enter. CFO magazine recently asked 227 finance executives how their work lives had changed in the last two years. The results portray a severely disgruntled group: 68 percent said the pressures on them had increased; 53 percent said they were working more; 61 percent groused that they had more work than their colleagues; 63 percent thought that work-related stress had had a deleterious effect on their health. 
 About 40 percent blamed regulatory rules and staff cuts for their newly dismal work lives. But more than half said they were more upset by their superiors' reactions to new rules than by the rules themselves. They said chief executives were demanding ever more information for planning and budgeting and were asking them to review their strategic decisions at ever-earlier stages.
 Few chief financial officers are comfortable discussing their discomfiture in public. Calls to more than a dozen people who quit the top finance job in the last two years, and e-mail messages to several others, drew no responses. Of the few who replied, only a handful would speak on the record. 
 One newly unemployed chief financial officer, who lost her job when a new chief executive installed his own team, put it this way in an e-mail message: ''The truth is: I don't know when and where I want to resurface and don't think there's much good for me to elaborate.'' 
 A man who recently resigned as chief financial officer of a publicly traded paper company to become finance chief at a private consumer products company said tersely that ''a private company just seems to be a better place for me these days'' -- but would not let his name to be used, even with that seemingly innocuous statement. 
 Chief financial officers in the private world are feeling their share of angst, too. 
 Damodar M. Persaud, the vice president for finance -- and functional C.F.O. -- of the YMCA of Newark, should by rights not be experiencing any fresh pressures: Mr. Persaud, 47, works for a nonprofit organization. Even so, he instituted stringent financial controls as soon as he joined the YMCA, almost four years ago. And, he personally reviews and signs all reports. ''Sarbanes-Oxley pretty much described my style of management,'' he said. 
 Yet Mr. Persaud's autonomy has been constrained. For the first time this year, the Newark YMCA board is insisting that its finance committee approve all capital expenditures. ''They are reacting to the scrutiny other organizations are getting, and they don't want to find their names in the news,'' Mr. Persaud said.
 Of course, many finance chiefs take the new realities of their business in stride. This month, Timothy B. Page resigned as chief financial officer of Perry Ellis International to assume the same title at Quality Distribution Inc., the largest tank-truck operator in North America. He readily acknowledges that he spends less time on parts of his job he finds ''fun'' -- assessing possible acquisitions, for example -- because he must spend more time preparing, reviewing and releasing financial statements. Still, ''it hasn't risen to the level of ruining my day,'' he said.
 ''The way I see it, if you're going to use the public's money to finance your business, you don't get to make the rules,'' he added. 
 ELLEN B. RICHSTONE is even capitalizing on C.F.O. woes. Almost two years ago, she left her post as chief financial officer of Brooks Automation to become president of the Entrepreneurial Resources Group, a Boston firm that provides experts to help beleaguered companies install financial controls. 
 ''We're getting lots of calls from companies whose C.F.O.'s have left,'' she said. ''But we're getting even more from C.F.O.'s who recognize that they just need help.''

HEADLINE: The U.S. Has a Powerful Team, With a Little Help From Russia

BYLINE: By Robert Byrne

 BODY:
Members of the all-grandmaster fourth-place team in the 36th Olympiad were all born in Russia before their families migrated to the United States. In that respect, the one culture carried over to the other. Ever since Lenin's day, chess has had a high standing in Russia. Although grandmasters there economically outclassed other professions, they were grudgingly considered privileged personages. Lenin's motivation was not to create a new class but to teach the populace to read; if you are to educate yourself in the Ruy Lopez, the Queen's Gambit, and the Sicilian Defense, you have to learn to read what they are all about. 
 In any case, a number of Russia's best players have made a home here. Alexander Shabalov, a United States champion, and a member of this year's team, nicely defeated Francisco Vallejo Pons in the match with Spain. Shabalov usually favors shoot'em-ups, but this time it was all positional maneuvering.
 It's a tribute to the Classical Caro-Kann Defense that 3 Nd2 or Nc3 have diminished in popularity in recent years in favor of the Advance Variation with 3 e5. The former moves create real battles of nerves, because White's advantage is so tiny that it becomes difficult to create paths to play for a win. At the same time, White has gotten used to dealing with his necessary strategy of maintaining his extended center pawns after 3 e5, so he need not spend all his time on pawn defense and can get aggressive space superiority out of them.
 After 4 Be3, in an Anand/Henkin game in the Bundesliga 2002-3, 4 Qb6 5 Qc1 Nh6 6 Nf3 e6 7 c4 dc 8 Nbd2 Bd3 9 Bd3 cd 10 O-O Nd7 yielded White some superiority.
 As can be seen after 4 e6, Black has a pawn formation somewhat analogous to that of a French Defense with the luxury of a queen bishop developed outside his pawn chain. The downside is that further mobilization is slow and a bit clumsy.
 The move 10 Ng6 blocks the h7 bishop, but 10 Nf5 would, too.
 Shabalov's 11 c4 dc 12 Bc4 begins to open the black formation, but it is still too early to go for a dramatic breakthrough.
 With 15 c5, Vallejo evidently believed it was time to break out of his cramped position. But after 16 Rc1 Rc7 17 dc Nc5 18 Nbd4, Shabalov's pieces still enjoyed the best squares.
 Even after the exchanges culminating in 26 Red1, Vallejo had not finished his piece development. After 26 f6 27 Ne7 Re7 28 Rd7 Rd7 29 Bd7 Bf5 30 Bd4 fe 31 Be5 Nf6, Shabalov gave back his second bishop with 32 Bf6 Rf6 because he wanted to prevent Vallejo from getting bishops of opposite color and he saw at this stage that the rook-and-bishop endgame would win for him.
 Shabalov was heading for the setup after 42 b6 when the queening of the b pawn could not be stopped.
 After 46 Ra7, Vallejo had nothing to do and gave up.

HEADLINE: CUNY Is Set to Name Dean For New Journalism School

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The chancellor of the City University of New York will recommend Stephen B. Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week, as dean of CUNY's new graduate journalism school, according to a journalist involved in the search process who has talked to Mr. Shepard about the appointment. The journalist discussed the appointment on the condition that he not be named. 
 The chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, is expected to make the recommendation to CUNY's trustees at their monthly board meeting late tomorrow afternoon. Mr. Shepard, Dr. Goldstein and other top CUNY officials all declined to comment last week on the appointment. 
 The nomination comes at the same time as the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia, long considered a leader in the field, is reshaping itself, adding a second-year master's program for students wanting to develop more expertise in topics like arts or politics than they can in the one-year program. The changes are being followed closely by journalists and journalism educators.
 Mr. Shepard, 65, who has been editor in chief of Business Week for 20 years, has long been active in journalism education. 
 He taught a seminar on economics and business at Columbia's graduate journalism school from 1970 to 1975 and helped found Columbia's Knight-Bagehot Fellowship Program in business and economics journalism in 1975, serving as its first director.
 He was also one of the journalists on an advisory committee assembled by Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia's president, to discuss the school's future two years ago.
 Mr. Bollinger said that Mr. Shepard ''played an important role in articulating what I would call a very pragmatic conception of journalist training'' during the task force deliberations.
 ''I think he falls nicely between those who want training on the day-to-day aspects of being a journalist and the communications theory types,'' Mr. Bollinger said.
 When CUNY officials announced the creation of the new school earlier this year, they said they expected that it would draw a group of students different from Columbia's, partly because tuition at CUNY is much lower. Although CUNY has not said what the tuition for the journalism program will be, its annual undergraduate tuition for instate students is about $4,000. Tuition for graduate programs tends to be higher. Tuition and fees at Columbia's 10-month graduate journalism master's degree program this year total nearly $37,000.
 CUNY officials said they expected the school to offer strong grounding in skills like writing and reporting. But they also said it would be up to the dean to translate that broad vision into reality, and to shape the school's mission, curriculum, faculty and student body.
 The school is scheduled to open in 2006 in the former headquarters of The New York Herald Tribune, on West 41st Street, next to the future headquarters of The New York Times.
 Nicholas Lemann, dean of Columbia's graduate journalism school, said it was too early to tell how much competition CUNY's new school might offer. ''They have a lot of basic decisions to make,'' he said.
 He said that although CUNY's tuition would be lower, the Columbia journalism school had a long history and therefore ''much greater brand value.'' He said he expected CUNY to have more students from the local area than Columbia.
 Despite his extensive ties to Columbia, Mr. Shepard has also had a long relationship with the City University, starting with his years as an undergraduate at the City College of New York, where he majored in engineering.
 More recently, he has been a member of Dr. Goldstein's advisory panel, the CUNY Business Leadership Council. And in the late 1980's, Dr. Goldstein, a mathematical statistician, helped Business Week develop its business school rankings. Dr. Goldstein was president of CUNY's research foundation at the time.
 After serving as the director of Columbia's Knight-Bagehot program for a year, Mr. Shepard returned to journalism as a senior editor at Newsweek. He left Newsweek to become editor of Saturday Review, and then returned to Business Week, where he had been a writer from 1966 to 1975, as executive editor and then editor in chief.

HEADLINE: Broadway's Fondest, Furthest Fan Comes Home

BYLINE: By JESSE GREEN

 BODY:
IN outline, the story is familiar: a high-strung boy who cries at anything (yet is so shy he cannot talk to schoolmates) harbors peculiar, passionate interests he feels sure no one can understand. Alienated from his rageful father, who thinks he is a freak, he is alone in his imaginings -- alone except for his mother. Ah, the devoted mother: ambitious and creative and frustrated and unwell, a former showgirl who gave up performing when she married a man whose family did not approve. She understands. Instead of glowering incredulously (as the father does) when the boy, in his underwear, works out dance routines to the accompaniment of his love-worn ''Gypsy,'' ''Seesaw'' and ''A Chorus Line'' LP's, she teaches him how to make the dances better. ''Every single note of rhythm is important,'' she says. ''And you must do it over until you get it right.'' Through this discipline the boy will one day become powerful; in the meantime, absorbing the messages encoded in the lyrics, he will come to feel that there are people like him somewhere, that he might eventually be happy, just as in ''West Side Story'' if you ignore the part where everyone dies. 
 We have a name for this kind of boy in America; several, really, for he's a common type. But the story is more unusual than it seems, and not only because the boy in question actually made it big in show business, whereas most teenage theater queens just become adult theater queens. It's also unusual because it took place in a cramped Tokyo apartment. The boy's routines were devised on tatami mats. His mother's showbiz experience was as a dancer for American G.I.'s stationed in Japan after World War II. And his father did not merely threaten to cut off his allowance when the boy committed toko kyohi -- that is, refused to go to school -- for a full year, spending it locked in his bedroom, listening to ''The Fantasticks'' and ''A Little Night Music,'' translating the songs word by word from his English dictionary. No, the father came at him through a gap in the door with his family's heirloom samurai sword, slashing blindly and, in the end, unsuccessfully: he was no match for a boy armed with the cast album of ''Pippin.''
 Whatever he might be called in Shaker Heights or in Fresno, there is no name for this kind of creature in Japan except the one he was given, Amon Miyamoto, because even now, at 46, he is pretty much unique: a famous stage director, a major figure in promoting Broadway-style musical theater to an Asian audience, a public enthusiast in a button-down culture. Indeed, as a host of cultural talk shows and a celebrity pitchman in beer commercials, he feels he must be careful to maintain -- at least for a Japanese audience -- an appropriate and discreet image of Japaneseness. Though he does not, for example, speak about his personal life, he nevertheless projects the kind of flamboyance that made him famous and that makes him a comfortable figure in Broadway circles. In rehearsal recently for the Roundabout Theater's revival of ''Pacific Overtures,'' explaining to the cast how a certain movement should look, he tried words (his English is good) but quickly resorted to the universal language of Fosse. ''Like in 'Chicago,''' he said, demonstrating. ''With the feathers!''
 It's only fitting that with ''Pacific Overtures,'' which opens Thursday at Studio 54, Mr. Miyamoto becomes the first Japanese citizen ever to direct a Broadway production. Like him, the show is an unusual and rather startling crosscultural experiment. When it first opened in 1976 it was already ambitious enough: an American musical purporting to tell the story of Commodore Perry's so-called opening of Japan in 1853 from the perspective of the Japanese, employing various forms of traditional dramaturgy (Kabuki masks, onstage musicians, a lion dance) as well as the considerable Broadway savvy of its director, Hal Prince, and its authors, Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman. In a series of suggestive scenes that are nothing like a normal musical plot, Mr. Weidman's book swiftly traced (through the linked stories of a fisherman and a minor samurai) the metastasizing response to the ''barbarian'' invaders, from horror to accommodation to imitation to fury and finally, in a fast-forward coda, to an alarming modern amalgam of them all. Mr. Sondheim's score, weaving together Japanese and Western elements (open harmonies, operetta rhymes), evoked the increasing interconnectedness -- and unresolved tensions -- of the two cultures.
 Of course ''Pacific Overtures'' was a failure: too unfamiliar for Broadway audiences, too formal, too complicated. And now Mr. Miyamoto comes along to complicate it further. His Roundabout production is an adaptation of a version he first directed at Japan's New National Theater in 2000, and brought to the United States for brief, acclaimed runs at Lincoln Center and in Washington in 2002. But while that version was performed in Japanese by a Japanese cast (pity the translator of such lyrics as ''It's an herb that's superb for disturbances at sea''), the cast at the Roundabout is Asian-American, and the language is once again English. The resulting hall-of-mirror perspectives -- Japanese history written by American artists using Japanese techniques as revisited by an American cast overseen by a Japanese director who is a devotee of American theater -- make it hard to pin down exactly whose story ''Pacific Overtures'' now tells. ''It's so twisty!'' Mr. Miyamoto said in an interview, gleefully. Which may be the point. 
 IF Mr. Miyamoto could have been born in a trunk in the Princess Theater in Pocatello, Idaho, he would have been. Alas, he was born in a coffee shop across the street from the Embujo Theater in the Shimbashi, or Geishatown, neighborhood of Tokyo. Well, not literally, he admits. But the coffee shop, run by his parents, was where the actors and dancers from the Embujo hung out, and so where his life began. Making deliveries backstage, he watched performances from the wings -- one month a samurai play, the next month Shakespeare -- or observed from underneath, while the trapdoors and turntables performed their elaborate choreography. 
 At first, he was drawn to the ritualized pleasures of traditional Japanese forms, but soon his dream of becoming a tea ceremony master -- the equivalent of an American kid in the 1960's wanting to be a priest or a harpist -- was overtaken by something even weirder. When he emerged from his year of toko kyohi, ''a spring that had been pressured down in me was sprung,'' he said. Upon returning to high school, though his schoolmates had never seen an American stage musical, he directed ''Godspell'' and played the role of Jesus. 
 That musical is a guilty pleasure for sophisticated Americans, but it struck Mr. Miyamoto as profound. Talking about it even now, he seemed ready to cry. ''Sorry, this is my way!'' he exclaimed. ''I love Broadway musicals and I respect this culture; it is very deep, not just entertainment. It taught me a lot, about how to have a life.''
 There is something uncanny about seeing a dated American stereotype superimposed on a contemporary Japanese person. Mr. Miyamoto's favorite place to meet in New York is Cafe Edison: the so-called Polish Tea Room, where older theater types nosh and trade war stories. He wears mostly black clothes, brightly accented, on one occasion with a polka-dot cravat. For a Japanese man, he is uncommonly physical, touching friends and new acquaintances constantly, hooting and clapping with pleasure in conversation, misting over at a snatch of melody. His enthusiasm seems boyish, even apart from his youthful looks; he says he resembles Curious George. When asked what current musicals he likes, he looked down as if hunting for something nice to say. ''I love 'Avenue Q'!'' he finally exclaimed, with relief. ''And 'A New Brain'!'' -- the William Finn musical from 1998.
 Mr. Miyamoto's taste in theater may be catholic but it's also refined; he loves Pina Bausch and Peter Brook, too. As an outsider he takes Western culture more seriously than we do, and in his 20's made a meticulous study of it on many trips to New York to see musicals and learn American-style show dancing. ''It wasn't that I wanted to be a dancer,'' he said, ''but I knew I was bad at communicating with people, so I thought it was good to learn to do it through dance.'' He also noted the lack of successors to director-choreographers like Bob Fosse and Michael Bennett, and saw an opportunity. 
 And so, having left college early to make his professional debut in a Japanese production of ''Seesaw,'' he quickly proceeded along the path from chorus boy to dance captain to choreographer. American musicals were just beginning to be popular in Japan, and he was a success, but with no personal life to speak of and no art of his own to make, he was not happy. He still felt the existential aloneness of his youth, and on the day before he opened in ''Hair,'' his mother died. (He found her on the bathroom floor of his Tokyo apartment, where she had collapsed while washing his underwear.) Crushed, and feeling he could grow no further in Japan, he escaped to London, where in two years he saw 750 plays and operas while taking dance lessons and working as a maid in people's homes. He presented himself there as a would-be director, but when someone at a party asked him what he wanted to express, he was flummoxed. No one in Japan had ever posed that question. 
 Still, living in a foreign country ''let me see myself from outside,'' he said. When he returned to Tokyo in 1987, he knew what he wanted. He rented a tiny theater and invested all his money in a cubist biographical musical he devised called ''I Got Merman.'' 
 The huge success of the show -- in which three Japanese actresses embodied Ethel Merman, who was all but unknown in that country -- changed Mr. Miyamoto's life. ''A fish finally got his water,'' he said. That such a strange and personal work, as much about his own conflicts as about the merging of Japanese and American entertainment, should make him successful was profoundly satisfying: one of those moments in which an artist is confirmed in his path and a culture ratifies a formerly unacknowledged trend. Since then he has directed and choreographed as many as five shows a year, including major commercial versions of ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Anything Goes,'' ''Candide'' and ''On the Twentieth Century.'' He did not merely recreate the original Broadway stagings, as had previously been the custom, but reimagined their emotional topography, which now frequently took on a melancholic undertow. At the same time he brought to these Western works an elemental visual vocabulary based on the traditional Japanese depiction of nature in art. He set ''The Sound of Music'' on a giant mound of grassy earth covering the stage, a hill that was revealed in the final number to be part of the much larger and seemingly endless mountain chain that the protagonists must climb to safety. 
 MR. Miyamoto arrived each day at rehearsal for ''Pacific Overtures'' very well organized, with binders, Post-it notes and color-coded memos. Having directed the show before, he knew precisely what he wanted. ''He would say, 'On the fourth count of the second measure, please say this word,''' recalled B.D. Wong, the Chinese-American actor who plays the Reciter. ''And then he'd do it with you.'' To stage complicated numbers like ''Four Black Dragons,'' in which seemingly endless lines of terrified townsfolk hurry away from the approaching American ships, he handed out an elaborate chart showing the actors exactly what they should be doing, word by word. ''In 20 minutes we knew the blocking,'' Mr. Wong said. ''Which with anyone else would have taken at least a day.''
 It's a good thing Mr. Miyamoto was so well prepared; the deceptively spare production is among the most complicated and expensive the Roundabout has mounted, and it is filled with effects that must be perfectly executed to have their intended impact. In rehearsal, even as those effects kept failing, Mr. Miyamoto remained calm and enthusiastic: no diva moments, according to Mr. Wong. Mr. Miyamoto's passion for musicals is unadulterated by the quasi-sadistic rage that fuels so many directors. 
 The surprising result is a ''Pacific Overtures'' that feels more American than the exaggerated Kabuki style of the original. The Reciter -- played by Mako in 1976 as a terrifying Voice of Japan -- is in Mr. Wong's portrayal a genial host. There are no traditional masks. Yet Mr. Miyamoto did not attempt to untangle the material's various perspectival knots. Indeed, he has added several. He includes as much beefcake as a production of ''Pacific Overtures'' is ever likely to accommodate, and has given the Shogun an unscripted but historically plausible male companion. He has retained the cross-dressing of the original where it suits the humor of the piece: the awkward young prostitutes and their instructive madam are still played by men. But having cast a woman in the role of the fisherman's wife, he altered the impact of the couple's scenes: ''instead of looking at the idea of that relationship,'' Mr. Weidman said, ''the audience experiences the relationship itself.'' 
 To the few reviewers who were critical of the 2002 production, this piecemeal approach seemed to denature something they saw as pure; one called it a Starbucks version of musical theater. Mr. Miyamoto doesn't mind that criticism; indeed, globalization is his goal. ''There is more than one kind of people in the world,'' he said. ''When I first worked on this show it was about Japan, after the economic bubble burst and confidence was low. It was about the pain of materialism. But when a world is changing we are all torn people -- you can hear that in Sondheim's lyrics. This is about America too. We are all in each other's lives.'' 
 This could not have been the point of ''Pacific Overtures'' in 1976, when, as Mr. Weidman pointed out, ''the idea of eating raw fish in New York was an exotic adventure.'' But what may be harder to accept than the Americanization of sushi is the outsourcing of the musical. If Mr. Miyamoto loves and respects a form that strikes many Americans as hopelessly glitz-krieged, it's in part because he is taken more seriously in his country than any musical theater artist, except perhaps Mr. Sondheim, could ever be here. Todd Haimes, the Roundabout's artistic director, said that 150 print and television reporters turned out for the announcement in Japan that this production was coming to New York. (''We do a press conference like that here,'' Mr. Haimes said, ''and we're lucky if we get four writers and someone with an Instamatic.'') Mr. Miyamoto may find New York freer, more accommodating of eccentricity and ambition; the boy who at 14, sporting an Afro and bell-bottoms, would travel by himself on the night train to Kyoto to gaze at the Buddhas may be less alone in the world thanks to his sublet on the Upper West Side. Nevertheless, when he's finished being the first Japanese director of a Broadway show (a show that is, after all, about his own country), his next project is a major revival of ''The Fantasticks'' -- ''I adore it!'' -- in Tokyo.


CORRECTION-DATE: December 12, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 28 about the Roundabout Theater's revival of ''Pacific Overtures,'' by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, referred incorrectly to several casting decisions made by the director, Amon Miyamoto. Two prostitutes are played by men, not all four as in the original production; the character whose wife is now played by a woman is a samurai, not a fisherman; and the character of the Shogun's male companion was in the original script, and was not added by Mr. Miyamoto.

HEADLINE: A Tree Worthy of Rockefeller Center

BYLINE: By Betsy Cummings. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DAVID MURBACH may have New York City's toughest job. It is one that requires a nearly yearlong obsession, endless inspections that can turn his vision into a haze and a nagging anxiety that he may never find just the right one.
 That is because, as the Rockefeller Center gardens manager, Mr. Murbach is responsible for finding the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree each year. That involves helicopter missions to scan hundreds of miles of the countryside, global-positioning devices to pinpoint possible specimens and a persuasive pitch to the owners of the tree selected, who must be convinced that the behemoth on their property would be better suited as a gift to New York City and the millions of tourists who visit each holiday season. 
 ''I usually cover half of a state looking for these trees, and literally see hundreds of thousands,'' said Mr. Murbach, who each year scans land from Connecticut to Pennsylvania for a perfect Norway spruce. 
 This year's tree stands 71 feet tall and 40 feet wide, weighs 9 tons and is 50 years old. It arrived in the city on Nov. 11 after being bundled up on specially designed trucks, then taken for a barge ride down the Hudson River and, finally, hauled to Rockefeller Center.
 Before it is lighted at 8:50 p.m. on Tuesday, the tree will be adorned with 30,000 lights. The lighting culminates an NBC special that begins at 7 p.m. and includes Christmas carols by singers like Clay Aiken and Jessica Simpson.
 The tree is one of the biggest draws for tourists in New York's holiday season. A quarter of the year's visitors to New York come from the beginning of November through New Year's, with an economic impact on the city of $3.7 billion, said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president and chief executive of NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing organization.
 The city's tourism dropped off about the time of the dot-com bust in 1999, and was set back again by the Sept. 11 attack. But Ms. Nicholas said that the number of domestic visitors rose to 33 million in 2003, up 9.4 percent from the year before. This year, Ms. Nicholas said, she expects the number of visitors to rise an additional 6 percent.
 How much of that is due to traditions like the Rockefeller Center tree is hard to say, but New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut accounted for 54 percent of the city's visitors in 2003, and many of those drive in for events like the Christmas tree lighting.
 MR. MURBACH'S father, a lawyer, worked for 41 years on the 16th floor of the International Building at Rockefeller Center. As a DuPont fellow studying for his master's degree at the University of Delaware, Mr. Murbach interviewed for the gardening job at Rockefeller Center, noting how appropriate the opportunity seemed given his family's history on the property. He had a familiarity with the site that impressed the man who would become his boss. That was 22 years ago.
 Since then, he has achieved a fame that is perhaps not of Santa Claus proportions, although there are some similarities. He said a handful of letters addressed to ''the Christmas tree man,'' without a street address or ZIP code, still make it to his homes in Florida and on Long Island. 
 Sometimes, Mr. Murbach is approached and asked if he would accept a donation of a tree to Rockefeller Center, but he has accepted only one such offer, partly because the nominated trees often do not live up their owners' descriptions. 
 ''It's like what people think of their children,'' he said. ''They think this tree towering over their house is 80 feet tall. But if it towers over your house, it's probably only about 40 feet.''
 But that much interest also means it is relatively easy to persuade owners of the giant trees to donate their spruce for the city's holiday season. And why shouldn't they? 
 ''The tree is the signature event for New York City,'' Ms. Nicholas said. ''There's nothing comparable.''

HEADLINE: Everything Must Go, Down to the Hotel Sinks

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Riechler's Law of Shopping states that necessity moves inversely to cost. As the price of an item drops, the need to own it increases.
 Dick Riechler, inventor of the law, offered a practical application yesterday while sifting through the remnants of a liquidation sale at the Mayflower Hotel. 
 ''Do I really need a portable fridge?'' he asked, in the Socratic style. ''It's cheap. Why not?'' 
 Mr. Riechler, a retiree and amateur economist, was among the dozens of bargain hunters who spent their Saturday scouring the depleted game preserve of the Mayflower on the second-to-last day of the sale. The big-ticket items had already left the building, as they say in the business. What was left was what was left.
 ''I wouldn't want to use the word 'dregs,''' said Tim Gilligan, a piano restorer who was looking for some office furniture. ''But a day like this is good for vacuum cleaners and beat-up pots and pans. Stuff where quality doesn't have much bearing.''
 The sale, which began four weeks ago, was intended to clear out the inventory of the Mayflower, an 18-story, 365-room hotel that closed its aging doors on Central Park West and 61st Street last month. The classy stuff went fast. And once the mahogany and marble sold, most of what remained looked like particleboard and Formica.
 ''Right now, we're down to the lobby and the second floor,'' said John Feldhaus, who has spent the last 20 years liquidating hotels for an Ohio business, National Content Liquidators Inc.
 ''We've got some nice night stands left for $15,'' he said.
 And some old mattresses and shabby chairs and a tray of tarnished knives. And some shot glasses. And a large supply of $5 towel racks.
 ''Unfortunately, not too many things said 'Mayflower' on them except for the trash cans,'' Mr. Feldhaus acknowledged. ''But they sold pretty well.''
 There is a fine line between a bargain hunter and a cheapskate, and the end of a liquidation sale is good ground on which to test the difference.
 ''I guess for the bargain hunter, it's the hunt that's important -- the finding of something, even if they don't really need it,'' said Chuck Bergdorf, who, considering where he was, was clearly not related to the famous retail family. And the cheapskate?
 ''The cheapskate says, I really need something, but I'm not going to pay full price.''
 It was agreed that these were good working definitions, which left the question of which one Mr. Bergdorf was. A blues musician, he had picked up a boom stand at a discount.
 ''Oh, I'm a bargain hunter,'' he assured his questioner. ''For me, it's more of a hobby than a lifestyle.'' 
 National Content Liquidators runs a smooth operation. There were both credit and cash-only lines for buyers, and a moving service on hand to help with deliveries. 
 ''It's mostly been your general Joe Soaps,'' Gregory McIntyre, owner of Oak Leaf Moving Inc., said of the buyers. ''We've had people from Fifth Avenue and from Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.''
 As for the merchandise, Mr. McIntyre confessed that he found it ''a different class of furniture'' -- that class being, ''way down the list.''
 Mr. Feldhaus said that whatever did not sell by this evening would be hauled back to the home office in Springboro, Ohio. He was somewhat cagier on the question of discounts for the final day. 
 Yesterday, for instance, sinks were selling at $50 apiece. Mr. Feldhaus worried that publicizing such a number would upset the early birds who bought at twice that price.
 Dick Riechler, meanwhile, had trained his discerning eye on a framed print of the financial district. 
 ''Look, honey, it's the stock exchange,'' he said to his wife. ''Now that's a picture I might buy. And it's priced for people like me.''

HEADLINE: A Hunt Turns Tragic, and Two Cultures Collide

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER and MONICA DAVEY; Stephen Kinzer reported from Dobie for this article, and Monica Davey from St. Paul.

DATELINE: DOBIE, Wis., Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The two gatherings, less than 200 miles apart, seemed to be separated by whole worlds.
 In this isolated village deep in the pine and cedar woods of the Upper Midwest, mourners trudged through falling snow on Friday to Our Lady of Lourdes Church to remember one of six hunters, all locals, killed near here a week ago.
 To the southwest, across the state line in Minnesota, thousands of Hmong immigrants streamed into a downtown St. Paul auditorium for three days of New Year's festivities with papaya salad, traditional courtship games and young women in dresses covered in gently clinking coins that echoed through the halls. 
 The only link between the somber Wisconsin gathering, which followed the most violent rampage in anyone's memory here, and the mostly festive Minnesota gathering, one of the most important annual meetings for Hmong people, was a shared concern: the depth of the scars left behind by the shootings last Sunday that left six white hunters from the North Woods dead and a Hmong immigrant from St. Paul in jail, accused in the deaths. 
 In three decades, St. Paul has drawn at least 25,000 Hmong immigrants, transforming it into what they call the Hmong capital of America. Even there, it has not always been an easy fit, with so many Hmong refugees arriving so rapidly, often with no English and little education or urban job skills. The Hmong are from large farming families in Laos, where the Central Intelligence Agency recruited many of them to be part of an anti-Communist secret army in the Vietnam War.
 The northernmost edges of Wisconsin, meanwhile, are made up mostly of people of European descent. Many come from Scandinavian, German, Czech and French Canadian backgrounds. 
 For all their differences, the native Wisconsin residents and the Asian immigrants from St. Paul share a love of hunting. 
 For generations of Wisconsin families, the deer season has come to mean a time to bond with friends, to wander the woods and to pass along life's secrets to the next generation. And for generations, those families had the woods mostly to themselves. Then, about 30 years ago, came the Hmong, for whom hunting is one of the rare realms in which America's fast-paced culture meshes neatly with their old ways.
 Hmong elders have come to use hunting as a chance to share at least one rural cultural tradition with the youngest among them, some of whom never saw the hills of Laos.
 In the November deer season, the two groups have often met in the woods and sometimes clashed, but mostly quietly until last Sunday. Some said they feared those tensions would now grow amid raw feelings of intrusion on one side and exclusion on the other.
 In Wisconsin, mourners said they were still dazed by what occurred after a group of local hunters confronted Chai Soua Vang, 36, of St. Paul, who, the police say, was using their tree stand to hunt on their property. 
 The police say Mr. Vang, a naturalized citizen and former Army national guardsman who immigrated 24 years ago, opened fire on the hunting party after he was told to leave.
 Waiting for the start of Friday's funeral service for Mark Roidt, 28, one man turned to another and said, ''This is going to be a horrible week.''
 His friend replied, ''The worst week ever.'' 
 Mike Katterhagen, another mourner, said he and many of his neighbors felt anger about what happened, but added, ''I don't know if you can place it at who.'' 
 Asked if people here had a negative attitude toward Asians or people of other races, Mr. Katterhagen replied, ''Personally, I don't.'' Then he added, ''Some people, I think, may have it.''
 In St. Paul, many at the Hmong New Year events said they feared retribution for the killings. Some said they would not hunt for a while. Many said they were embarrassed by the acts another Hmong-American was accused of, but the case also made them recall experiences with ethnic misunderstanding.
 Some said they wondered whether there was more to the case -- and thought they might have gained some understanding when they learned Mr. Vang had told the police that the local hunters used ethnic slurs against him and fired at him before he started shooting. A police statement by a hunter wounded in the incident makes no mention of ethnic slurs. 
 ''I mostly ignore what people call me, but it does hurt,'' said Va Pao Xiong, a college student in Wisconsin who was celebrating the New Year in St. Paul on Friday. ''They have called me 'chink' and things like that. And it makes you wonder whether they even understand who the Hmong people are, where we come from, or what we've been through.'' 
 Like many others here, Mr. Xiong, who is 24, has distinct and painful memories of his family's flight from Laos. After Communists won power there, the Hmong people, who had rescued downed American pilots and fought North Vietnamese soldiers, said they found themselves under attack and began fleeing through the jungles, escaping across the Mekong River and ending up as refugees in Thailand and elsewhere. 
 In part as a show of gratitude for their sacrifice in the Vietnam War, the United States has allowed tens of thousands of Hmong people to come here. 
 This year, as many as 15,000 Hmong refugees still waiting at a bleak camp in Thailand called Wat Tham Krabok were granted permission to come to this country. In the past few months, some of them have moved to St. Paul, a city of 300,000.
 The new arrivals brought new questions to City Hall from some residents: how could the city, in tough budget times, afford to help more Hmong refugees, especially those who lacked adequate medical, educational and psychological help for years at the camp in Thailand? 
 A city analysis in January found that 34 percent of Hmong families in St. Paul had incomes below the poverty level in the year 2000, compared with 31 percent in the black community and 20 percent among Hispanics. In September, a poll conducted by The Pioneer Press and Minnesota Public Radio found that Minnesotans, by 42 percent to 37 percent, believed that the cost of helping immigrants start their new lives outweighed their economic, social and other contributions. 
 Then came the events of last Sunday.
 ''It's difficult to be Hmong-American right now,'' said Mee Moua, a Hmong in the Minnesota State Senate. ''There's an expectation that the Hmong-American community ought to be answerable, or ought to be responsible for this one man's action.''
 Ms. Moua said that was absurd: ''Don't hold our community to blame for something one individual has done.''
 That sentiment was echoed in Wisconsin, where some mourners, like John Zoellick, said they had not heard any negative comments or slurs against Asians or Hmong people in the days since the killings. 
 ''Any negative feeling is directed toward the one individual, since he did something that is just totally inexcusable,'' Mr. Zoellick said. ''It's not aimed against any group.''
 Nearly everyone interviewed at the New Year celebrations in St. Paul said they had experienced name-calling at some point. Elee Vang, a 19-year-old who is Miss Deaf Minnesota, said she was once spit at by a white boy on a bus. Workers at Tswvtxos Yang's old manufacturing job used to call him Bruce Lee, he said.
 Many said they had been called by the very names Mr. Vang told police the white hunters hollered at him. 
 In Laos, hunting was a crucial part of the culture and important for survival, said Cha Vang, the son of Gen. Vang Pao, who worked closely with the C.I.A. in the war and who remains a revered leader of Hmong people in America. (Thousands rose and cheered him in St. Paul when he arrived in the auditorium for New Year festivities.)
 ''It was different in Laos though,'' said Mr. Vang, who is no relation to Chai Soua Vang. ''You could hunt all year round and there was all public lands.''
 The restrictions in this country have led to conflicts, with some white people complaining that Hmong people ignore or are unable to read fishing limits, clothing rules and permit requirements.
 On the other side, Hmong hunters have complained about mistreatment and harassment by white hunters. Since last Sunday, Ms. Moua said she had received so many reports of such incidents that she was considering calling for public hearings on the issue.
 Tou Ger Xiong, a Hmong comedian, rapper and motivational speaker from St. Paul, said his father, who speaks little English, was once approached by a white hunter who simply demanded his gun. He said another white hunter ordered his brother to leave a tree stand he had built on public land, and threatened to use a chainsaw to tear it down.
 But people in Wisconsin said that complaints by some Asian hunters of insults or harassment from white hunters were exaggerated.
 ''I haven't heard any anger against the Hmong,'' said Patty Behrndt, manager of a bookstore in Rice Lake, the main town in this part of the North Woods. ''Not anger, just disbelief and confusion. People aren't able to make out why or how. You hear talk now about racism, but I don't see it.''
 Laurel Steffes, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said she was unaware of tensions between Hmong and white hunters. 
 ''We've had our ear to the ground since this happened,'' she said, ''and we're not picking up on that at all.''
 The mourning continued on Saturday, as a funeral for two more of the victims, Robert Crotteau, 42, and his 20-year-old son, Joey, was held in Rice Lake. The Crotteau family is large and well established here, with the local telephone directory showing 30 listings for that name.
 Some arriving mourners said they were still too much in shock to analyze what had happened. 
 ''It's just all so stunning,'' said one mourner, who gave his name as Aaron. ''There's hardly anything else you can feel, not at this point.''
 In addition to the six people killed, two men were wounded in the shooting. Both attended Mr. Roidt's service on Friday. One of them, Lauren Hesebeck, who wore a blue sling to support his wounded left arm, has told the police that Mr. Vang fired the first shots, according to a police document.
 All of the victims lived in or near Rice Lake, a town of 8,300 where many people have known each other since school days, and most of the rest came to escape crowds and enjoy rural life.
 In Rice Lake, Greg Swanson and his daughter were hanging lights on their outdoor Christmas tree. Mr. Swanson said he and other people here were ''waiting for someone to take us from this unreal situation to some kind of explanation of why a guy would just open up like that.''
 Along Main Street this weekend, ribbons of bright orange, the color of hunters' jackets, hung above Christmas wreaths. 
 With more funerals running through the weekend and into Monday, Larry Jarvela, the mayor of Rice Lake, was still groping for an explanation. 
 ''It's so senseless,'' he said. ''Why did it have to happen?''
 ''We don't have any population of Asians,'' Mr. Jarvela said, and Census statistics largely bear him out. Here in Barron County, the 2000 census counted just 145 people of Asian descent, less than 1 percent of the population. 
 Mr. Jarvela said he had never heard about clashes between white and nonwhite hunters, but he added that because northern Wisconsin was very large, ''if you happen to have an incident, nobody knows about it.''
 At last count, a week ago, nearly 645,000 hunting licenses had been issued in this state for the nine-day regular gun season that ends on Sunday. In just the first two days, hunters reported bagging 140,000 deer, Ms. Steffes said.
 The Rice Lake City Council here may soon consider a proposal to rename a city park in honor of the six people killed, Mr. Jarvela said. The likely choice for a new name is Hunters' Park.

HEADLINE: Time for a Hybrid Harvest

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
IF 2004 was the year when hybrid vehicles graduated from environmental oddities to realistic alternatives to the conventional car, the coming year may be the time when hybrids truly go mainstream.
 Within a year, 10 gas-electric hybrid vehicles will be on the market, and automakers have announced plans for several more. 
 More significant, hybrids are quickly evolving from small, strange-looking machines with questionable handling and performance -- like the Honda Insight and the first-generation Toyota Prius -- into the types of vehicles that many Americans love: full-size pickups, big S.U.V.'s, luxury sport wagons and midsize family cars. Here is a look at the hybrids currently on sale or announced for production:

HEADLINE: Hydrogen Production Method Could Bolster Fuel Supplies

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Researchers at a government nuclear laboratory and a ceramics company in Salt Lake City say they have found a way to produce pure hydrogen with far less energy than other methods, raising the possibility of using nuclear power to indirectly wean the transportation system from its dependence on oil.
 The development would move the country closer to the Energy Department's goal of a ''hydrogen economy,'' in which hydrogen would be created through a variety of means, and would be consumed by devices called fuel cells, to make electricity to run cars and for other purposes. Experts cite three big roadblocks to a hydrogen economy: manufacturing hydrogen cleanly and at low cost, finding a way to ship it and store it on the vehicles that use it, and reducing the astronomical price of fuel cells. 
 ''This is a breakthrough in the first part,'' said J. Stephen Herring, a consulting engineer at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, which plans to announce the development on Monday with Cerametec Inc. of Salt Lake City. 
 The developers also said the hydrogen could be used by oil companies to stretch oil supplies even without solving the fuel cell and transportation problems. 
 Mr. Herring said the experimental work showed the ''highest-known production rate of hydrogen by high-temperature electrolysis.'' 
 But the plan requires the building of a new kind of nuclear reactor, at a time when the United States is not even building conventional reactors. And the cost estimates are uncertain. 
 The heart of the plan is an improvement on the most convenient way to make hydrogen, which is to run electric current through water, splitting the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. This process, called electrolysis, now has a drawback: if the electricity comes from coal, which is the biggest source of power in this country, then the energy value of the ingredients -- the amount of energy given off when the fuel is burned -- is three and a half to four times larger than the energy value of the product. Also, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions increase when the additional coal is burned.
 Hydrogen can also be made by mixing steam with natural gas and breaking apart both molecules, but the price of natural gas is rising rapidly. 
 The new method involves running electricity through water that has a very high temperature. As the water molecule breaks up, a ceramic sieve separates the oxygen from the hydrogen. The resulting hydrogen has about half the energy value of the energy put into the process, the developers say. Such losses may be acceptable, or even desirable, because hydrogen for a nuclear reactor can be substituted for oil, which is imported and expensive, and because the basic fuel, uranium, is plentiful.
 The idea is to build a reactor that would heat the cooling medium in the nuclear core, in this case helium gas, to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The existing generation of reactors, used exclusively for electric generation, use water for cooling and heat it to only about 300 degrees Celsius.
 The hot gas would be used two ways. It would spin a turbine to make electricity, which could be run through the water being separated. And it would heat that water, to 800 degrees Celsius. But if electricity demand on the power grid ran extremely high, the hydrogen production could easily be shut down for a few hours, and all of the energy could be converted to electricity, designers say.
 The goal is to create a reactor that could produce about 300 megawatts of electricity for the grid, enough to run about 300,000 window air-conditioners, or produce about 2.5 kilos of hydrogen per second. When burned, a kilo of hydrogen has about the same energy value as a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline. But fuel cells, which work without burning, get about twice as much work out of each unit of fuel. So if used in automotive fuel cells, the reactor might replace more than 400,000 gallons of gasoline per day. 
 The part of the plan that the laboratory and the ceramics company have tested is high-temperature electrolysis. There is only limited experience building high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, though, and no one in this country has ordered any kind of big reactor, even those of more conventional design, in 30 years, except for those whose construction was canceled before completion. 
 Another problem is that the United States has no infrastructure for shipping large volumes of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen is produced at the point where it is used, mostly in oil refineries. Hydrogen is used to draw the sulfur out of crude oil, and to break up hydrocarbon molecules that are too big for use in liquid fuel, and change the carbon-hydrogen ratio to one more favorable for vehicle fuel.
 Mr. Herring suggested another use, however: recovering usable fuel from the Athabasca Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada. The reserves there may hold the largest oil deposits in the world, but extracting them and converting them into a gasoline substitute requires copious amounts of steam and hydrogen, both products of the reactor.

HEADLINE: Iran Reasserts Its Right to Enrich Uranium as Standoff Persists

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Iran's foreign minister said Saturday that Iran had every right to keep, for research purposes, some centrifuges that could be used to enrich uranium, an indication that a standoff on the country's nuclear program may not be easily resolved. 
 ''Iran's demand to keep 20 centrifuges is not against its commitments,'' said the minister, Kamal Kharrazi, the IRNA news agency reported. 
 In talks in Paris with Britain, Germany and France, Iran agreed on Nov. 15 to freeze all its nuclear activities. But this week, Iran said it wanted to retain 20 centrifuges for research purposes, stunning negotiators. The Paris accord was meant to pave the way for a resolution to be passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring body, in Vienna, to say that Iran was in compliance. 
 On Friday, it appeared that negotiators in Vienna had worked out a compromise, under which Iran would turn off the 20 centrifuges but put them under camera surveillance rather than under seal by the I.A.E.A. Mr. Kharrazi's comments seemed to indicate otherwise. 
 ''There is no ban on research activities in the agreement,'' IRNA quoted him as saying.
 Mr. Kharrazi pointed to the resolution drafted in Vienna by the three countries and said there were positions that were ''not acceptable by Iran and were contrary to the Paris agreement.'' He did not specify which ones.
 The talks will resume on Monday. 
 Iran has been walking a tight line in the negotiations, under great international pressure to make concessions on its nuclear program, while hard-liners at home lash out against moves they interpret as weakness on Tehran's part. 
 An article in the daily Jomhouri Islami on Saturday said that the nuclear agency's opposition to allowing Iran to keep centrifuges for research was aimed at preventing Iran to master the cycle of nuclear fuel production.
 ''We must not trust the Europeans who have dishonored their pledges with Iran in the past and we should develop our fuel cycle with full capacity,'' it said.
 Last week, President Mohammad Khatami called the Paris agreement a ''success,'' and Hossein Mousavian, a member of the negotiating team, said Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had approved the agreement.
 Kaveh Afrasiabi, a political scientist and adviser to the negotiating team said that Iran considered the deal a victory, ''because unlike the United States that wants to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, Europe has recognized it and even promised to help Iran become one of the 18 fuel producers.'' 
 The United States has accused Iran of trying to make a nuclear bomb and urged Europe to press the issue at the I.A.E.A. to send Iran's case to the Security Council, where it could face economic sanctions. 
 There have been reports that the nuclear agency was anticipating that Iran would withdraw its request on the 20 centrifuges formally, in writing. But Mr. Kharrazi rejected that idea on Saturday. ''We are not talking about a written guarantee,'' he said, adding that none had been requested.
 At least one Western diplomat suggested that Iran might agree to abandon use of the remaining centrifuges verbally but would not do so in writing. 
 As foreign minister, Mr. Kharrazi outranks some of the negotiators in Vienna, but some of the negotiators report to the National Security Council, which is controlled by the supreme leader.
 Opponents of the deal have put pressure on the foreign ministry and the negotiating team, arguing that they have sacrificed the country's right to develop nuclear technology. 
 Alireza Akbari, a former deputy defense minister, said Saturday that he believed Mr. Kharrazi's comments had been aimed at satisfying opponents of the deal in the country. 
 ''I think the Iranian team will eventually choose its wording and say that it will suspend the 20 centrifuges voluntarily but it will be for a limited time,'' he said.

PERSON: Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna

HEADLINE: Frederica de Laguna, 98, Studied Arctic Civilizations

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Frederica de Laguna, an anthropologist whose work on the history and culture of little-known Arctic civilizations was groundbreaking in the most literal sense of the word, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 98.
 Her death was announced by Bryn Mawr College, where Dr. de Laguna was the William R. Kenan Jr. professor emeritus of anthropology. She founded the college's anthropology department and taught there from 1938 until her retirement in 1975. 
 An authority on Alaskan prehistory, Dr. de Laguna was part of the first generation of women to succeed in the rough-and-ready, ultramasculine world of early 20th century field archaeology. She traveled thousands of miles by steamship and skiff, leading expeditions to villages so remote they appeared on no map. There, she contended with -- and generally got the better of -- bitter cold, frozen ground, ravenous mosquitoes and the rare male colleague foolhardy enough to question her ability.
 ''I love the actual digging, the rhythmical swing of the arms and the bending and pushing with the whole body,'' Dr. de Laguna wrote in ''Voyage to Greenland'' (1977), a memoir of her first field trip, made when she was 22. ''The sun shines warmly over my back, the rich, sweet smell of rotted blubber rises from the saturated earth.''
 In 1975, Dr. de Laguna and Margaret Mead were the first female anthropologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Among her best-known books are ''The Archaeology of Cook Inlet'' (1934), ''The Prehistory of Northern North America as Seen From the Yukon'' (1947), ''Chugach Prehistory: The Archeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska'' (1956) and her three-volume masterwork, ''Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit'' (1972). She was the subject of a 1997 documentary film, ''Reunion Under Mount Saint Elias.''
 When Dr. de Laguna made her first trip to Alaska, in 1930, Arctic culture was virtually unknown. Victorian explorers had brought back trunkfuls of artifacts, but no scholar before her had studied an Arctic community in depth. 
 ''She was really trying to find any possible kind of evidence that could converge to give us the overall history of these peoples,'' said Regna Darnell, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario and a former student of Dr. de Laguna's. ''Those early papers are a database that people have worked with ever since.''
 Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna, almost always called Freddy, was born on Oct. 3, 1906, in Ann Arbor, Mich. She grew up in Bryn Mawr, where her parents taught philosophy. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr in 1927 and, in 1933, a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia, where she was one of the last students of the anthropologist Franz Boas.
 In 1929, while still a graduate student, she joined a Danish expedition to a tiny island on Greenland's west coast. She planned to stay six weeks. She stayed nearly six months.
 ''How could I realize the hold which this experience -- the free life, the happy, fascinating natives, the absorbing work and the loyal comradeship -- has obtained over me,'' she wrote in a letter home at the end of the trip. ''I feel as if I could never be content with ordinary living again, unless it were to be broken by a return to the Arctic. It makes me very sad to know that I have found my ideal vocation in such an inaccessible place.''
 She was so sure of her vocation, and its incompatibility with married life, that she broke her engagement to a young mining engineer. She never married, and left no immediate survivors. 
 A Wave in World War II, Dr. de Laguna also studied the Pima Indians of Arizona. She wrote two mystery novels with anthropological settings, ''The Arrow Points to Murder'' (1937) and ''Fog on the Mountain'' (1938).
 While Dr. de Laguna's work drew praise from many of the Alaskan Natives whose traditions she explored, she had limited patience with the sensitivities of the multicultural era. In recent years, she was called upon to defend her practice -- routine among anthropologists of her generation -- of opening the graves of indigenous people and removing their contents for study.
 With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, many of these remains, which had been in museums for decades, were returned for reburial. Dr. de Laguna regretted the loss to scholarship in no uncertain terms.
 ''Some of our ancestors went to the stake for the right to do science,'' she told The Baltimore Sun in 1997. ''Now we have to kowtow to the superstition of these Indians.''

HEADLINE: Too User-Friendly? Bank Robberies Rise

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
SPURRED by heightened competition for the banking dollar on Long Island, banks are using a range of tactics these days to lure customers into their branches and keep them there. They are extending their hours, giving away lollipops and pens and, in a few cases, providing amenities like public bathrooms and children's play areas.
 But some are going further to be customer-friendly. They are placing security cameras in less-obtrusive spots and cutting back on barriers between customers and bank personnel. These practices, the police say, are already contributing to robberies and threaten to become a more serious problem.
 Bankers disagree, saying the wide-open lobbies seen at more and more bank branches are no less secure than the traditional setup where most of the money and conversation is exchanged under, around and through inch-thick bulletproof plexiglass. 
 But no one disputes that unlike most types of crime, bank robberies are increasing on Long Island. Though the county executives in Nassau and Suffolk held news conferences this month to announce that overall violent crime rates were down again this year, bank robberies are heading in the other direction.
 Between 2000 and 2003, the number of such robberies rose 70 percent, to 68, according to the police. So far this year, according to the latest figures available -- through Oct. 13 in Nassau and Oct. 31 in Suffolk -- the pace is running ahead of last year, with 56 robberies compared with 50 during the same period in 2003. More than a month ago, the number in Nassau surpassed 32, the figure for all of last year. And, if history is any guide, the pace will pick up further as Christmas nears.
 ''The way we've been going this year, I don't know if Christmas is going to make any difference as far as a spike,'' said Sgt. Gary Schriffen, commander of the Nassau police robbery squad. ''People say, 'Robberies are going to be going up around Christmastime.' We're already addressing a spike.''
 There is no single reason for the rise in bank robberies. The explanations include a tough economy, police staff reductions and post-9/11 redeployments, the rise in the number of branches and banks' growing tendency to focus on computer crime at the expense of simple robberies. But among the top concerns of the police is a lack of bulletproof glass partitions, or bandit barriers, to separate tellers from customers.
 ''Bandit barriers are the No. 1 deterrent to bank robbery,'' said Sgt. Robert P. Doyle, commander of the Suffolk police major case investigations unit. ''We have had bank robbers tell us that they have looked at banks with bandit barriers and passed on those banks, only to go to the bank that was more customer-friendly. That was the bank they chose to rob.''
 Sergeant Schriffen said the anecdotal evidence was clear. ''When you talk to defendants, sometimes they'll say, 'Well, I didn't go into that bank because it had a bandit barrier,''' he said. ''Sometimes you'll see in an area that the bank that has a bandit barrier doesn't get hit; the others do.''
 But the elimination of barriers is a key element of nearly all variations on the customer-friendly theme. In discussing the thinking behind their new approach, executives from a variety of banks emphasized eliminating physical and other barriers to foster closer relationships between employees and customers. 
 Michael P. Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association, said there was no correlation between a lack of barriers and more robberies. He cited a recent survey finding that 90 percent of association members that had been robbed had bandit barriers at the locations that were hit. He estimated that ''well over half'' of banks still had the barriers.
 No one knows how many banks on Long Island have the barriers, although most have at least partial barriers if not the floor-to-ceiling variety the police recommend. But everyone agrees that the number of branches without barriers is growing as big banks from outside the metropolitan region, attracted by the Island's affluence and enabled by the relaxation of interstate banking rules, bring their customer-friendly philosophy to the Island and local banks respond in kind.
 According to the state bankers' association, in the two years ending July 31 the number of bank branches on the Island rose by 46, increasing to 840 despite the loss of branches due to the substantial number of bank mergers in the region. Mr. Smith said the increase reflected a ''fierce competition'' between new and long-established players on the Island.
 Seattle-based Washington Mutual joined the fray in 2002 after acquiring Dime Bank. Nearly two dozen of Washington Mutual's 61 branches on the Island are the customer-friendly model. In the full-bore version, patented in June under the Occasio name, a ''concierge'' greets customers, then directs them to the appropriate part of the bank. Tellers stand not behind counters but beside towers into which they insert customers' deposits. Once inserted, the cash is no longer accessible by the tellers. Customers get cash from machines.
 John Benevento, a senior vice president who oversees Washington Mutual's consumer banking operations on Long Island and in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester, acknowledged that potential robbers had to be aware of how his bank's system worked before it might deter them. Because tellers only handle cash briefly, he said, ''in some ways, they're less vulnerable than tellers at traditional banks.''
 Since 2002, at least six Washington Mutual branches on Long Island have been targeted by robbers. None has been of the specific Occasio model, although some have lacked elements, like floor-to-ceiling bandit barriers, that the police say are needed to deter robbers. 
 But Sergeant Schriffen asserted that the Occasio model made employees more vulnerable because it obviously put them in closer contact with potential bandits. 
 Among the long-established community banks adopting the new customer-friendly approach is Bank of Smithtown. It has 11 branches in Suffolk County, 4 of which are in the new customer-friendly model, and plans to open its first branch in Nassau County, in Port Washington. It will be the new model, in which a ''bank pro'' greets customers and leads them past a series of curved walls to business areas. There are no doors, open cash caches or tellers; the bank pro takes deposits. 
 All of which is likely to confuse if not dissuade a potential robber, said Bradley E. Rock, Bank of Smithtown's chairman and chief executive officer. He said his branches were ''more secure than the traditional offices and less susceptible to robbery. One of the reasons is that there's no place where someone could jump over a counter and get into a drawer that has money.''
 The most recent robbery at a Bank of Smithtown branch occurred last year, in Centereach. But it was not one of the new retail models.
 Bank of America, which began operating on Long Island only last month after acquiring 82 Fleet Bank branches in Nassau and Suffolk, has a different take on customer-friendliness. Tellers remain behind bandit barriers, but managers and personal bankers, working from a ''retail sales playbook,'' are encouraged to ''engage'' customers, said Alison M. Rourke, marketing program manager. 
 Harvey W. Kushner, chairman of the department of criminal justice and security administration at the C.W. Post campus in Brookville, said that banks had a responsibility to contribute more to their own security. ''Over a period of time, the fact that a lot of these statistics have increased has something to do with the 9/11 effect and the reallocation of resources,'' he said of the bank robbery figures. ''But that doesn't mean that banks themselves during that same period have said, 'My God, these guys are not here to protect us, we're going to have to do more.' They haven't.'' 
 He said some banks were more concerned with computer crime and more willing to absorb the losses from robberies than change elements of the customer-friendly approach because they felt such changes could cost them customers. ''It's a cost of doing business,'' he said. 
 Mr. Smith of the bankers' association denied the charge. ''We would disagree with that strongly,'' he said. ''The issue here is what is effective against the type of robbery that we are seeing, what is effective in terms of safety for the customer and employee, and cost is not a factor.''
 Factors beyond cost are in play. The growth in the number of branches and the lengthening of hours is worrisome, Professor Kushner said. Compared with bank robberies in earlier eras, which were often highly organized affairs, today's bank robberies are often ''crimes of opportunity,'' he said.
 While today's note-passing robbers may lack the bravado of Bonnie and Clyde, the police said, they can be savvy enough to exploit cameras that are outdated, out of order or positioned so inconspicuously that they fail to get a good picture of the robber's face. Officials said some banks feel that visible cameras discourage business by detracting from the customer-friendly atmosphere. ''There are some banks that don't even want cameras on display, lest their customers feel that they're under observation,'' Sergeant Doyle said. 
 Bankers denied that a desire to foster customer-friendliness was influencing their placement of cameras, and Sergeant Schriffen noted that proper positioning of a camera helped the police identify and capture a suspect in an Oct. 5 robbery of a Washington Mutual branch in East Meadow. 
 But the quality of some banks' equipment was a problem, he said. Although banks were making some progress upgrading their cameras, he said, some still lacked the kind of digital camera equipment needed to cut glare or otherwise provide a clear photo in less-than-optimal conditions. Mr. Smith acknowledged that fact, but said banks in the state should finish a full upgrade within a year, he said.
 The camera upgrades were sparked in early 2003, when under pressure from the New York City police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, banks in the city began to tighten security, including improving communication between banks and the police, employing greeters or security guards and stepping up their use of dye packs designed to blow up harmlessly but incriminatingly when a robber checks his haul. Robberies in the city declined sharply later in the year. But no such decline took place on Long Island. 
 Now, with robberies on the Island still surging, the bankers' association intends to work more closely with Long Island authorities in much the way it did with the city last year, Mr. Smith said. ''We certainly will do it out on the Island,'' he said.
