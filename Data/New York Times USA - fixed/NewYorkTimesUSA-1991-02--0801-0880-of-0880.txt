HEADLINE: The Garbage Problem: It May Be Politics, Not Nature

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
GARBAGE, garbage, everywhere: images of overflowing landfills, homeless garbage scows and polluted wells have been widely interpreted as nature's way of telling us to slow down. "The devastation wrought by economic production is closely related to the amount of materials consumed," warns John E. Young, an environmental researcher at the Worldwatch Institute.
But to many solid waste specialists, the garbage crisis says more about the limits of public management and traditional regulation than the limits of nature or the decadence of the throwaway society. In their view, piecemeal approaches like banning styrofoam cups may be easy options for legislators but, in fact, divert attention from the underlying political issues, besides being of questionable benefit to the environment. 
 William Rathje, the head of the University of Arizona's research project on garbage, notes that technology has in some ways actually eased the municipal disposal problem since the turn of the century. Home furnaces no longer generate an average of 1,200 pounds of coal ash each winter; cities need no longer clean up after the hundreds of thousands of horses that died each year on the job.
Given proper financial incentives, experts argue, households would voluntarily reduce the tonnage of nonhazardous waste left by the curb; the rest could be recycled, buried or burned with reasonable safety and at bearable cost. But they say it makes no more sense for the White House (or the statehouse) to micromanage these choices than, say, to decide how many minivans should be offered for sale in Dallas next month or how many of them should be painted red. The key to a rational garbage policy is to insure that the prices people are charged for disposal services reflect the true social costs of getting rid of the stuff.
Until the late 1970's, notes Peter Menell, an economist and legal scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, most solid waste was carted to the wrong side of the tracks and dumped in pits. The biggest garbage worry most householders faced was preventing four-footed scavengers from tipping over the can.
But public alarm over air and water quality has changed all that. Some neglected landfills were found to be leaking hazardous chemicals into groundwater and shut down. More significant, communities have blocked efforts to replace landfills as space was depleted; in 1989 the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that one-third of the remaining capacity would be gone by 1994.
In New Jersey, the state with the most pressing garbage disposal problem, the environmentally driven landfill shortage has been exacerbated by economic regulation. To stop what was described as price-gouging by organized crime, the state decided to regulate waste hauling and disposal as a public utility. And according to Paul Kleindorfer, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, zealous opposition to passing costs through to consumers effectively ended investment in landfills.
In 1972 there were 331 landfills operating statewide. By March 1988 the number had fallen to 13, with just 2 more waiting permission to open. Half of New Jersey's municipal solid waste must now be exported to Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Pressed to find alternatives to landfills, which absorbed 83 percent of all municipal solid waste in 1989, many states have looked hard at incinerators. Burning is attractive because it reduces by as much as 90 percent the volume of waste that must eventually be buried. And the heat can be used to make electricity; plastics, the symbol of packaging overkill, actually generate as much energy as fuel oil.
Like landfill, however, burning raises issues of environmental safety and industrial nuisance; according to a 1990 survey by the National Solid Waste Management Association, 37 percent of Americans would object to a waste-to-energy plant in their community. What is more, incineration is hardly cheap: Mr. Menell concludes that it is competitive in cost only in the landfill-scarce Northeast.
 
The Sources
 
The Pros and Cons Of Products
"Source reduction is to garbage what preventive medicine is to health," William Rathje wrote in The Atlantic Monthly in December 1989. And technology, driven by purely economic considerations, sometimes delivers just what the doctor ordered.
According to Harry E. Teasley Jr., the president of Coca-Cola Foods, a Coke can weighed 2.5 ounces in 1961. Thirty years later, thanks to competition from aluminum and new ways of forming steel, it weighs half an ounce.
But prohibiting bulky products or types of packaging is invariably problematic. People rarely appreciate, and can rarely measure, the overall impact of such products on the environment.
An analysis in the Feb. 1 issue of Science magazine by Martin B. Hocking, a chemist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, compared paper hot-drink cups with cups made from polystyrene foam. Foam takes up more space in landfills. On the other hand, the manufacture of the paper cup consumes 36 times as much electricity and generates 580 times as much waste water.
Once buried, the plastic is there to stay -- by conventional wisdom, a serious drawback. But as paper degrades underground it releases methane, a potent "greenhouse gas" that is warming the atmosphere.
 
Space vs. Water
 Or consider the diaper dilemma. The National Association of Diaper Services concluded that paper diapers make up a full 2 percent of the nation's garbage stream and were loading landfills with potentially dangerous organic waste.
Threatened with local bans and boycotts of its paper diapers, the Procter & Gamble Company struck back. The manufacturer's consulting firm, Arthur D. Little Inc., concluded that disposables do indeed generate 90 times as much post-use solid waste. But reuseable cloth diapers consume 3 times as much nonrenewable energy and generate 10 times as much water pollutants.
Lynn Scarlett, vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., suggests more complications. The pulp used to make disposable diapers, she notes, comes from trees grown for the purpose. The fewer disposable diapers consumed, the smaller the desired commercial inventory of immature trees, and the smaller the acreage of forests supported by private enterprise.
Then there is the question of water: where groundwater is easily contaminated, landfill leakage can be a big problem. But in the desert of southern California, Ms. Scarlett notes, room to bury disposable diapers is not as scarce as the water needed to wash the reuseable kind.
 
Recycling
 
Potential Gains But No Panacea
Recycling offers an equally popular, and far more promising, way of coping with household garbage. About 13 percent of municipal waste was recycled in 1988 and, in theory, the sky's the limit: techniques for recycling aluminum, glass, steel, paper, rubber, dead leaves, grass clippings and most plastics, which collectively make up more than 80 percent of the municipal garbage stream, are ready to go. But few analysts believe that anything close to this fraction of solid waste will (or should be) recycled in the foreseeable future.
One potentially important form of recycling, large-scale commercial composting of the yard waste that makes up a fifth of all household solid waste, faces the same problem of finding politically acceptable sites as incinerators or landfills. Many other materials, including glass, steel and paper, are now successfully recycled in modest quantities. But there would be serious problems in finding buyers for a lot more.
If supplies grew rapidly, the prices of recycled materials would likely collapse, and with them the existing network of commercial recyclers. Mr. Rathje notes that New Jersey's mandatory recycling law drove the price of newsprint from $40 a ton to the point where communities were forced to pay to have it hauled away.
 
Pressure on Newspapers
 According to the National Solid Wastes Management Association, 38 states are now trying to jump start recycling with government procurement preferences for products containing recyled material; 17 offer private tax incentives to the same end. And many states (including New York and Connecticut) are leaning on newspaper publishers to use recycled newsprint. Wisconsin requires that plastic containers consist of at least 10 percent recycled plastic.
But hardly anyone is counting on the overnight development of the markets or collection mechanisms to support extensive recycling. The Environmental Protection Agency has set a short-term goal of 25 percent recycling. Allen Moore, president of the waste management group, a trade association, thinks even this target will prove extraordinarily difficult to hit.
 
New Facilities
 
Streamlining Approval Process
How then, can America cope with the garbage mountain? One key is making it easier to build facilities for burying, burning and recycling.
Streamlining the process apparently would not put the public health at greater risk. While buried waste must be monitored indefinitely for leakage, "environmental scientists believe they now know enough to design and locate safe landfills," writes Mr. Rathje. A 1990 technical report commissioned by the United States Conference of Mayors draws a similar (if stuffier) conclusion for burning: "The technology exists to control the incineration of municipal solid waste in such a way as to confidently insure that potentially harmful constituents are not expected to pose risks to humans and/or the environment."
 
4-H Club Benefits
 But disposal facilities certainly are nuisances that nobody is eager to live near. Howard Kunreuther, the director of the Wharton School's Center for Risk and Decision Processes, offers some practical suggestions for making locally undesirable land uses more palatable.
One is to nail down the safety question: issuance of the Environmental Protection Agency's long-promised guidelines for landfill construction would make a difference. State officials might then be required to monitor private facilities and shut them down if they did not meet the Federal standard.
Another is to soften opposition by compensating communities and property owners. The Wes-Con Inc. sweetened a proposed landfill in Idaho with free garbage disposal and support for the 4-H Club. Champion International protects the resale value of homes within two miles of its industrial landfills.
 
The Marketplace
 
Government Rules, Buyer Incentives
Breaking the not-in-my-backyard syndrome will pay bigger dividends if disposal companies retain the flexibility to build for customers from other states. John Turner, general council of the National Solid Wastes Management Association, notes that the Supreme Court has turned back every state effort to limit interstate shipments of nonhazardous waste as an interference with interstate commerce. But Congress clearly does have the authority to impede commerce in garbage.
Last year the Senate passed a bill granting each state the right to limit garbage imports if it was prepared to show that it would not need to export garbage. That would be a hard test to meet: most states both import and export solid waste, relying on regional facilities to meet local needs. Only New York and New Jersey regularly solve their disposal problems by shipping waste out of state.
Yet another threat to the construction of new disposal facilities, Mr. Kleindorfer of the Wharton School argues, is price regulation. New Jersey's decision to treat waste disposal as a regulated public utility is particularly sobering when contrasted with the experience of neighboring Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania does not regulate the deals communities make with private landfill and incinerator operators. But the market apparently does: Mr. Kleindorfer believes that Pennsylvania's "tipping fees," which are below the national average, are very effectively limited by competition between disposal facilities.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kleindorfer notes, incentives to invest the $65 million to $100 million needed to open a modern 100-acre landfill remain adequate: In 1988 there were 31 pending applications to open landfills, compared with just two in New Jersey, where average disposal rates are the highest in the country.
 
The Problem With Taxes
 The other side of the garbage equation is demand. Like any other service, economists argue, the amount of waste disposal consumers choose to buy varies with the price. And since most consumers' total outlays are unaffected by the amount of garbage they create, they have no incentive to limit the amount left by the curb. Indeed, as the University of California's Mr. Menell points out, "because disposal is free, consumers favor products with more packaging so as to reduce the risk of breakage or increase convenience."
One way to right the imbalance would be to tax products according to the post-consumption cleanup cost. That might add, say, a nickle to the cost of laundry detergent in a plastic bottle and a penny to detergent packed in a cardboard box. Consumers would have an incentive to use less wasteful packaging, and manufacturers would have an incentive to adapt waste-efficient designs.
The catch is that disposal costs are very hard to pin down; those who toss their beer cans by the road generate far greater cleanup costs than those who bring them to the neighborhood recycling center. Moreover, disposal costs vary greatly from community to community according to the local price of landfill, incineration and recycling.
 
Reductions
 
Two Towns Limit Flow to Landfills
Perhaps the more practical alternative, suggests Diana Gale, the head of Seattle's waste utility, is to charge householders according to the amount they put out. Seattle charges $13.50 a month for a one-can weekly pickup, plus $9 per additional can. Yard waste separated for composting costs $2 a month, while paper, glass and metal separated for recycling are hauled away free.
In the first year that per-can charges were imposed, the total tonnage buried fell by 22 percent. Voluntary recycling rose from an impressive 24 percent of waste -- Seattle was already environmentally conscious -- to an astounding 36 percent.
Perkasie, Pa., a distant suburb of Philadelphia with a population of 6,000, has had even greater success by mixing volume charges ($1.50 for a 40-pound bag) with free, mandatory recycling. In 1988, the first year of operation, the flow to landfill fell by half and the town's garbage bill fell by a third.
Gale notes that in the handful of cities where most people live in apartment complexes, it would be difficult to hold individuals responsible for their actions. But nationwide, designing the financial punishment to fit the waste disposal crime could make a big difference.
 
Taking Out The Trash
Political and economic considerations create complex transport webs for household and commercial waste. Small map shows waste flow from most states; New York and New Jersey routes are on page C6.
 
TRANSPORTING GARBAGE. Critics say the pattern of waste disposal is haphazard at best and hurts the environment by concentrating wastes.
 
RECYCLING. In theory, more than 80 percent of municipal waste could be recycled, but only about 13 percent was recyled in 1988; so far, there are too few recycling sites and not enough buyers.
 
INCINERATING. Burning reduces the volume of waste that must be buried and can produce energy, but critics raise questions of cost and pollution.

HEADLINE: Romance Is In Again at the Box Office

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
"Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" led the way, showing that love could be very lucrative indeed at the box office. Now a flock of romantic comedies is poised to capitalize on what Hollywood sees as the moviegoing audience's continuing yearning for kinder, gentler fare.
Already, movies like "L.A. Story," starring Steve Martin and Victoria Tennant, "Green Card," with Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell, and "Once Around," with Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter, have pushed their way into the top 10 box office listings published weekly by trade publications. None have come anywhere near the surprise performances of "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" -- last year's two most popular films -- but they have reinforced Hollywood's impression that a romantic comedy revival is on. 
 "This is going to be the year of the women," predicted John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which monitors film releases for theater chains. "Back in the old days, people in the business always used to ask where's the feminine appeal in a picture. It's odd how these cycles go, but I know that we're swinging back."
 
Following Up on Success
 Encouraged by the success of "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman," the studios responsible for them are leading the charge. Disney already has both "Green Card" and the darker "Scenes From a Mall," with Woody Allen and Bette Midler, on the market and is looking ahead to a spring release for "The Marrying Man," which pairs Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Paramount last week weighed in with "He Said, She Said," which offers contrasting views of the romance between two Baltimore television reporters. It opened to generally negative reviews. Scheduled for later this year are "The Butcher's Wife," with Demi Moore of "Ghost" in the title role, and "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer and directed by Garry Marshall, whose last movie was none other than "Pretty Woman."
"The emphasis is on the romance, with the comedy as a backdrop," Barry London, head of distribution at Paramount, said when asked if there was a unifying thread in his studio's efforts to follow up on the success of "Ghost," which has earned $214 million at the box office.
Every major studio, in fact, has at least one romantic comedy in the works, and executives say that a growing number of such scripts are landing on their desks, including some that were rejected two or three years ago and that have been dusted off and rewritten.
 
'Pitching the Same Ideas'
 "These things seem to happen by osmosis, as if there is a sort of collective consciousness, and that's what's happening now," said David Hoberman, president of Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures. "All of a sudden people are in your office pitching the same ideas and everything becomes like 'Pretty Woman,' just as everything seemed to be like 'Batman' a couple of years ago. It's in the air."
The situation of 20th Century Fox is typical. At the moment the hottest of Hollywood's major studios, thanks to a six-month string of hits that include "Home Alone," "Edward Scissorhands" and now "Sleeping With the Enemy," Fox this spring will release both "Love Potion No. 9," a tale of two shy scientists who invent a magic formula that makes them irresistible to the opposite sex, and "Dutch," about a working-class man's romance with a wealthy divorcee who has a snobbish son.
The studio has especially high hopes, however, for "Only the Lonely," from Chris Columbus and John Hughes, the same director-producer team responsible for "Home Alone," which last weekend passed the $235 million mark to become the most successful comedy of all time. Their new effort is a two-generation romantic comedy starring John Candy as a Chicago policeman who falls in love with a mortician's assistant played by Ally Sheedy, with Maureen O'Hara as his mother and Anthony Quinn as her suitor.
The renewed interest in romantic comedies does not mean, however, that Hollywood has suddenly abandoned its fondness for formula film making. Escapism is still the strongest selling point, but emphasis has shifted from shootouts and expensive plane crashes to fantasy, often deliberate attempts to evoke the mood of the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy classic comedies of the 1930's and 40's.
 
'Chemistry Between Two Actors'
 "Overt sex is not romantic," Marisa Silver, who directed "He Said, She Said" with Ken Kwapis, commented. "Talk is sexy, and we wanted a really sexy banter." Mr. Kwapis said both he and Ms. Silver were fond of films like "The Shop Around the Corner" and "Woman of the Year," and "sought to evoke the older style of romantic comedies, which document the chemistry between the two actors."
At a time of recession in which Hollywood is talking about cutting costs, the shift also makes economic sense. One of the basic maxims of film making is that movies driven by story or character, which are likely to rely on ensemble casts, are cheaper to make than action pictures, which require expensive special effects and are built around big-name stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.
Aside from the high-wattage pairing of Mr. Pacino and Ms. Pfeiffer, the upcoming slate of romantic comedies adheres to that tendency. More typical are such pairings as Ms. Moore and Jeff Daniels in "The Butcher's Wife," Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Perkins in "He Said, She Said," Tate Donovan and Sandra Bullock in "Love Potion No. 9," and Ed O'Neill and JoBeth Williams in "Dutch."
In romantic comedies, success depends less on the prominence of the names than on making the right casting choices, Mr. Hoberman said. "Going into it, nobody would have thought Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze or Richard Gere and Julia Roberts were the greatest teams around," he said, referring to "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" respectively. "They were not Robert Redford and somebody else, but they felt right, and the audience knew it."
 
More Aggressive Marketing
 Also contributing to the revival is Hollywood's increased awareness of the importance of the female audience. Even studio executives who do not think that more romantic comedies are being made than in the past acknowledge that such movies are being marketed more aggressively and are being looked to for more revenues.
"Studios have always known that young adult men can open a film," Mr. Kwapis said. "What they found with 'Ghost' and 'Pretty Woman' is that women can give a picture legs like nobody's business."
Indeed, several studio and independent production executives said their recent market research indicated that when young dating couples decide to see a movie, more often than not it is now the woman who determines what they will see.
Inevitably, studio executives acknowledge, there will be romantic comedies that fail, and Hollywood's fascination will eventually shift again. But in the meantime, movie makers are embracing the phenomenon and avoiding asking questions that have no obvious answer.
"I could get very sociological and talk about the economy, wish fulfillment and how everyone is looking for love," Mr. Hoberman said. "All of those answers are probably true, but the real answer is that I don't know and neither does anyone else."

HEADLINE: Robert Johnson: Once Largely Myth, Now a Hit

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
Few facts about the blues singer and guitarist Robert Johnson ever surfaced; his life was heavily masked in myth.
His only recorded music was made with an unaccompanied acoustic guitar in a dusty San Antonio hotel room and in a back room of a Dallas office building. A year later, at the age of 27, he died of pneumonia, said to be brought on by poisoning. Until recently, only a single photograph of him was known to exist. For years the story of "The King of the Delta Blues," as Johnson came to be called, was a holy grail for blues historians. 
 Now, 52 years after his death, Robert Johnson has gone gold. Since last August, when Columbia Records put out a two-CD reissue set entitled "Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings," more than 325,000 copies have been sold. This month, the album peaked on the pop charts at No. 80, beating out records by Carly Simon, Iggy Pop, Run-D.M.C. and Sinead O'Connor. Last week it won a Grammy for the best historical recording.
 
Hints of Hoodoo
 Johnson's music heavily influenced the early days of English and American rock-and-roll, when musicians tried to tap into both the musical and mythical power that Johnson exerted. His lyrics hinted at hoodoo (the rural southern religion originally from Nigeria and analogous to the voodoo found in New Orleans and Haiti), and their intensity and the slippery allusiveness helped create an aura, especially for those not familiar with the language of the Mississippi Delta's black culture.
The success of the Robert Johnson boxed set, along with other blues reissues, as well as the newly found success of jazz and international pop, signal a widespread reaction to the perceived falseness and inauthenticity of much of contemporary pop music: the Milli Vanilli Effect, if you will. There is still an audience interested in music that is more about music than video-generated imagery. Johnson was a virtuoso guitarist, singer and composer, and the recordings show it.
"All kinds of blues are selling more," said Frank Scott, a blues-record collector and the owner of Down Home Music in El Cerrito, Calif., the country's premier blues and rhythm-and-blues store. "Rural, pre-war blues especially, which is what Johnson played. Five years ago, a new reissue of a pre-war blues man might sell 4 or 5 copies, but now it might sell 50 or 60. We've increased sales every year, with December of 1990 being the best December ever, and this is the middle of a recession. I would imagine we've sold 500 of the Johnson sets, which easily makes it our biggest seller."
 
The Importance of CD
 The reintroduction of the music on CD -- Columbia has kept Johnson's two albums in print continuously since the mid-60's -- has also allowed a younger, CD-oriented market access to them. Pop music is no longer disposable, and teen-agers are just as likely to be listening to Cream, which recorded several of Johnson's songs in the 1960's, as they are to any other type of music. In case the connection was unclear, the record company had Cream's guitarist, Eric Clapton, now 45 years old, contribute to the liner notes of the set, along with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.
"You have three distinct groups buying the set," said Lawrence Cohn, the producer of the album. "The collectors who want everything. Then you have people who grew up on 50's and 60's music and came to blues through the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin, and are out there looking for original source material 20 years later. But there's a new audience of young kids who are still listening to rock-and-roll from the 1960's and early 1970's. We're getting lots of young buyers."
The success of the album was unexpected at Columbia, and at some levels of the company the project was greeted with skepticism that at times became antagonism. Nor was the idea of a heavily annotated set new: it had been in the works since 1970, and there had even been a test pressing of a new set available. But turf wars between competing producers, which could potentially have deteriorated into lawsuits, scared the company, and Columbia shelved the entire project.
 
Mining Some Buried Gold
 In 1988, Mr. Cohn, a serious blues collector who had previously run Epic Records, suggested that the company take on a blues and roots reissue project, as Columbia has perhaps the richest catalogue of pre-war music of any of the major labels; it includes Bessie Smith, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Big Bill Broonzy, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and hundreds of blues, jazz and country figures. By then the Jazz Masterworks project, a reissue series, had become immensely popular (it has since sold more than 3 million items). But Mr. Cohn was greeted with a blank stare, surprising since the company had long ago bought all the rights to the music and would rarely have had to pay royalty rates.
"Truthfully, the Grammy is a real vindication for me because nobody here had any interest at all in the idea," said Mr. Cohn. "When I proposed the Roots and Blues series in 1988 -- and was told there was no interest because blues music is distinctly uncommercial -- I declared that Robert Johnson would be a focal point, which made sense from both a commercial and esthetic point of view. It's worked; we sold 20,000 in Japan in January alone."
"We thought we could sell maybe 100,000 over a year," said Gary Pacheco, the series' marketing director. "That was our wildest dream. Quite honestly, initial sales were only 20,000, which was embarrassing."
The label began running promotions on college radio stations and at alternative record stores, and sent the set out to all the critics. Though mainstream radio would not play Johnson's music, a word-of-mouth buzz among musicians, critics and fans started, and the demand forced the bigger chain record stores, which had at first largely ignored the set, to take it on.
 
Keeping the Price Right
 As demand increased, Columbia decided to keep the price down. "We took real care to price the two-CD package cheaply," said Mr. Pacheco. "It was on sale for $13.98 at Tower for a while, which allowed normal people to buy it, people who might have been turned off by a higher price."
After about eight weeks, the initial sales figures had doubled, and by early this month, it was among the five top-selling items in several large stores, including Tower. "It became a bit weird, almost magical," said Mr. Pacheco. "Suddenly it was appearing in music magazines next to hot rock bands like Jane's Addiction. So who knows where we can go with it? The thing sure isn't slowing down."

HEADLINE: New Look in Suits Is Loose and Light

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
Some men's wear designers are calling it the most fundamental change in suits in 20 years. In the men's business, of course, a quarter inch here or there can be a big deal.
"No, what we're talking about here is at least an inch and a half," said Nick Hilton, the president of 
 Norman Hilton , in all seriousness.
What is actually happening is a series of subtle changes that could affect the way men dress for years to come. Driven by the worst retail season in decades, American designers are taking the hallowed shape of the traditional man's suit and pumping it up.
Shoulders are broader, lapels wider and chests fuller, with a drape that permits freedom of movement. Inner construction has been minimized, taking advantage of new lightweight canvases.
Fabrics are lighter, too, reflecting a desire for comfort and a perception, if not the reality, that the weather is warmer in major cities. The new jackets weigh as little as 32 ounces, in some cases a pound less than stodgier antecedents.
Among the traditional American companies that have recently introduced higher-priced suit lines of this type are Polo/ Ralph Lauren , Norman Hilton and Alan Flusser .
Hartmarx , one of America's oldest and largest manufacturers, announced a licensing agreement last week with Karl Lagerfeld to design two new suit lines. They are expected to compete with Giorgio Armani and Hugo Boss , two labels that have sold well while traditional brands languished.
While not entirely new, the bigger, lighter, more comfortable suit has in the past been marketed to the "fashion customer," a younger man more interested in style than absolute appropriateness. Now the target is the traditional man, who by all accounts has been a reluctant shopper.
 
'A Basic Change'
 "I've been in the business more than 20 years, and I've never seen such a basic change," said Mr. Hilton, whose company has made staunchly traditional men's clothing for a century. "It took a recession to do it."
Mr. Hilton recently introduced a new collection, under his own name, incorporating the roomiersilhouette. "Every 20 years there's a major revolution in fit and style," he added. "What Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent did for the fitted suit of the 1960's and 70's, Armani and Hugo Boss have done for the 90's."
Ralph Lauren, who has long championed a traditional look in men's clothing, is more guarded about his new suit model, with its fuller, sloped shoulders, wider lapels and lightweight construction. It looks like his other suits but with a bit of air pumped into the upper part.
"Is this a new model?" Mr. Lauren asked last week. "Yes. Is it important? Yes. But it couldn't be more Wall Street, more chairman of the board." Mr. Lauren said he was not influenced by others. "A broader shoulder is not necessarily Italian or English," he said. "It's just what's happening."
 
Source: Old Hollywood
 Tracing the causes of the new silouette leads to a labyrinth of conjecture. Certainly Italian men's wear companies, like Giorgio Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna , have been influential.
But Mr. Hilton said his stylistic inspiration, and perhaps the original source for the Italian designers, was old Hollywood: Joel McCrea in "The Palm Beach Story," or Cary Grant in "Notorious."
But designers who have always stood firmly for traditional Anglo-American principles, including the natural shoulder, now see relaxed fit and fuller silhouette as an inexorable force in the market.
"It's a change in thinking for me, no question," said Alan Flusser, the designer who made the suits for Michael Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko in the movie "Wall Street." In his new ready-made clothing collection, Mr. Flusser made a decision to broaden the shoulders -- from 19 to 20 1/2 inches, point to point -- and soften the look.
"In the mid-80's there was a fashion for the Old World look," Mr. Flusser said. "The killer suit arose at a time when you didn't mind standing out and projecting a power image. Today you surround yourself with the same kind of quality, but it's softer, less intimidating.
"These garments are much sexier. Clothes for men used to be directed toward other men. This clothing is really directed toward women."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Ralph Lauren's new suit silhouette is still traditional but has fuller shoulders and lapels. The three-piece herringbone will cost about $990 this fall.; Nick Hilton, the president of Norman Hilton, a traditional clothing manufacturer, in a lightweight, amply cut double-breasted suit from his new Nick Hilton collection, sold at Saks Fifth Avenue. Traditional suits will still be sold under the Norman Hilton label.; Alan Flusser, who has always favored a drapey, relaxed attitude in his clothing, measures the shoulders of one of his traditional custom-made suits (left), about 19 inches point to point. His new ready-made suits are about an inch and a half wider, reflecting tastes of younger customers who, he says, want a more relaxed fit. (Fred R. Conrad and Najlah Feanny for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Thailand Marches in Reverse

 BODY:
Saturday's military coup in Bangkok is a calamity for Thailand and a setback for U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Washington is right to condemn the interruption of a promising democratic experiment and to suspend most U.S. aid. The new rulers have already backed off from their promise to hold elections within six months. A return to military-dominated regimes would cloud the bright future Thailand seemed to have in store.
Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong accuses Chatichai Choonhavan, the elected Prime Minister whom he seized at gunpoint, of corruption and sheltering enemies of Thailand's constitutional monarchy. 
 The first charge is probably true. Yet the military cannot credibly pose as the champion of cleaner government. It directly controls the Burmese, Laotian and Cambodian border regions, where enormous profits are made running drugs, guns, refugees and contraband gems. Many army officers run border trading companies themselves, and the armed forces maintain vital lifelines to loathsome neighbors like the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, in Myanmar and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
As for the charge that the Prime Minister encouraged foes of the monarchy, King Bhumipol Adulyadej himself has intervened to defend the Chatichai Government against military pressure. Personal ambition and military contempt for democracy are the real forces behind this coup.
The Thai military has attempted 17 coups since it put an end to absolute monarchy in 1932. But the last successful coup occurred almost 15 years ago. Since then, democracy has begun to take root, especially since Mr. Chatichai, himself a retired general, took office in 1988.
The Chatichai Government's progressive deregulation of the economy spurred double-digit growth rates. The boom worsened already severe social and environmental problems, but Mr. Chatichai responded with initiatives like a ban on logging exports from vulnerable rain forests. Mr. Chatichai also worked hard for a Cambodian peace.
Washington has not suspended anti-narcotics aid. Thailand is the main base for U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency operations in the opium-growing Golden Triangle region, spanning Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Slowing the flow of drugs sometimes requires cooperation with undemocratic regimes.
But, as Americans learned in Panama, it makes no sense to cooperate with military men who protect drug dealers. Unless Bangkok's new rulers show speedy progress against corruption and quickly restore democratic rule, Washington may have to cut anti-narcotics aid, too.

HEADLINE: The Price of Not Raising Tolls

 BODY:
It may not be a pleasant or popular thing to do. But that hardly justifies the reluctance of Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey to approve higher tolls on bridges and tunnels run by the Port Authority.
In November, the agency's director, Stanley Brezenoff, submitted a plan to increase round-trip tolls from $3 to $4 and the $1 fare on PATH trains to $1.25. His predecessor made a similar proposal in 1989, but withdrew it after getting negative signals from the Governors, who share veto power over any increases. The Port Authority has now canceled five board meetings on the new plan because the Governors continue to procrastinate. 
 Mr. Florio argues that higher PATH fares would hurt poorer commuters. Perhaps, but the need for higher tolls is clear. To meet competition from other regions for passengers and cargo, New York's Kennedy Airport urgently requires major renovations. So does New Jersey's Newark Airport and the World Trade Center, another aging Port Authority property. At present, revenues from these facilities are diverted to help subsidize the interstate transportation network.
Drivers may balk at higher tolls to cover losses on the PATH system and bus terminals. But they're the ones who benefit when commuters are diverted to mass transit from congested roadways. And the proposed $4 toll is still less than the $5 round trip the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority charges on its crossings.
Without quick approval of the higher tolls, Mr. Brezenoff will be forced to cut about $300 million in essential capital projects. On top of similar cuts made last year, the impact on the region's long-term economic health could be devastating.

HEADLINE: For Everyone's Sake, Give the Poor More Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The endless attack on "entitlements" in the Federal budget is a veiled attack on spending tax money for human needs, which are what entitlements are all about.
There is nothing new in this. In "The Plundering Generation," a book by Mark W. Summers about the period 1849-61, there is a story about New York's Mayor Fernando Wood, who in 1858 was attacked for setting the poor against the rich because he favored government aid for people left hungry by the financial panic of 1857. 
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt was called a traitor to his class when he backed legislation to redistribute wealth downward to the working class. In our day, it is reported that Felix Rohatyn has been snubbed by some of his wealthy acquaintances because he said publicly that he is troubled by the gross income discrepancy he sees in New York.
Even our Federal Government's statistics, which are suspect, confirm that the sharing of our national wealth has become more lopsided, with the wealth and income of the affluent rising while the average standard of living has been falling. The graduated income tax, intended to reverse this process, has been effectively nullified under political pressure of Republicans, and with a desertion of old New Deal philosophy by a fair number of Democrats.
While the total value of entitlements is said to have increased in Government spending, loss of tax revenues has prevented increasing many essential social programs. The aid to the elderly has risen because they are a larger percentage of our population and, regrettably, because the medical establishment, partly because of uncontrolled insurance costs for its members, has exploited Medicare and Medicaid.
At the same time, our country has fallen far short of less wealthy countries in providing medical care for its poorer citizens. We also do less for our hungry, our homeless, our children and our unemployed, all of whom are building an ever larger underclass, which theatens our internal stability.
Unless we begin to restore and then to improve on the distribution of wealth and income through more entitlements, our underclass will destroy the safety of our cities, a process well under way. Valid steps can certainly be taken to reduce waste and corruption in the entitlement structure, but basically we need to expand its size and scope if we want a socially stable and vigorous society. This is not a liberal idea. It is one that genuine conservatives will endorse out of a concern for our country's future.

 BODY:
If the name Sergei Korolev means nothing to you, it's not your fault. The Kremlin took pains to keep him out of the public eye during the years when he was sending Soviet rockets, satellites, animals and humans into space, beating the United States every time. He is given his due in the first hour of "Russian Right Stuff," a three-hour documentary that is remarkable for the amount of once supersecret material its producers have managed to extract from Moscow. This rewarding exploration by "Nova," narrated by Stacy Keach, begins tonight at 8 on Channels 13 and 49 and continues tomorrow and Thursday at the same hour.
The Soviet space program, Mr. Keach observes, remains "one of the last symbols of success in a country beset by technological stagnation and economic collapse." And much of that success is credited here to "the invisible spaceman," Korolev, whose fascination with aircraft and rockets began in the 1920's, when he was in his teens. By 1933, with the support of the Soviet military, he was working on rockets of a sort that the Germans were busying themselves with, too. 
 Although the focus tonight is on the man, Soviet history casts its shadow in the form of Stalin's purges of the country's officer cadre before World War II. Korolev's first wife recalls the midnight knock on the door; her husband, accused of involvement in a Trotskyist conspiracy, was sentenced to 10 years in a prison camp. Reprieved as the war approached, he was allowed to resume his work on rockets. But by then, German scientists like Wernher von Braun had lifted off to a big lead.
After the war, however, Korolev came through. One of his deputies explains that the Soviet rulers, threatened by American rockets that could reach Soviet territory, gave their chief designer the resources to build a delivery system that could carry nuclear weapons to America. He did it.
But his enduring obsession, as several of the scientists and astronauts who worked with him emphasize, remained space. And his accomplishments, recorded here with pictures from inside Soviet training operations, were spectacular: the first space satellite (Sputnik); the first dog in space (Leika, chosen for an amiable disposition), and in April 1961 the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin, one of the fighter pilots known as Korolev's little eagles). The first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, picked for her working-class credentials, is reported to have fallen asleep instead of completing her assigned experiments. Not discussed is the cost to down-to-earth Soviet life of the huge investment in the heavens.
Sergei Korolev died in 1966. During his time, the United States was playing catch-up, and its rockets kept blowing up. American space scientists finally came through in 1969, when they won the man-to-the-moon race. The Russian side of that competition, "The Dark Side of the Moon," is told tomorrow. It is a story of a promising start followed by failures that went unpublicized. The final hour, "The Mission," is given to the Soviet space station Mir, which since 1986 has been the largest object orbiting the earth. The focus is on the training of two crew members who spent six months of 1990 in space. Coming up, maybe, two-year visits to Mars.

HEADLINE: For Everyone's Sake, Give the Poor More Help;
Federal Responsibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Poverty Tilt, Magnified" (editorial, Feb. 13), on President Bush's failure to address the plight of America's poor and the fiscal problems of America's cities in his State of the Union Message or his budget proposal was right on target.
The President failed to address the nation's other gulf crises -- the widening gulf between the rich and poor, the growing gulf in competitiveness between the United States and other major nations. The Federal Government needs to take responsibility for investing in jobs and people, catalyzing economic recovery and promoting economic justice. 
 America's cities and their low-income residents are suffering from the double whammy of a decade of severe Federal cuts and the recession. We are fighting a war against drugs, crime and violence because the White House and Congress abandoned the war on poverty.
Before we talk about bailing out the banking industry and giving capital-gains tax breaks to the rich, let's get Washington committed to fighting poverty and promoting economic recovery. Our nation cannot solve urban problems by denying them. The proposed budget further slashes key -- and successful -- urban programs. It walks away from America's cities, shortchanges our children and does little to stimulate economic growth and jobs for needy and working people. Meanwhile, cities are preparing to lay off police and fire personnel, teachers and health care workers.
Further Federal cuts are a recipe for disaster. Our cities are waiting to explode. The Federal Government must help defuse this time bomb by investing in our cities, promoting economic recovery and providing Americans with the opportunities and resources to climb the economic ladder.
In the last decade, America's cities have developed successful programs and partnerships with business and community organizations to deal with affordable housing, job training, infant mortality, crime prevention and other issues. But cities, on their own, simply lack the resources to solve these national problems.
Washington should increase its share of welfare and Medicaid costs. We also need Washington to learn the lessons from our local success stories and become a partner with cities and entrepreneurial nonprofit community groups to rebuild our neighborhoods, improve the skills of our work force and promote family stability.
I hope the President will come back to the American people in the near future and outline a domestic agenda that is as bold and aggressive as those we had when our troops came home from World War II and from Korea.

HEADLINE: Paul Harvey Aron, 69, Economist And Japanese Investments Expert

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Paul Harvey Aron, an economist who was an authority on Japanese investments, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of heart, liver and kidney failure, said his daughter, Laurie Joan Aron of Manhattan. 
 Mr. Aron was perhaps best known for starting a new era of American investments in Japan and for bridging the divergent United States and Japanese financial systems.
In 1969, as a portfolio adviser to the Dreyfus Corporation, he persuaded the mutual fund company to invest $140 million in Japanese stocks through Daiwa Securities Ltd. Since any revelation of major interest in a Japanese stock would push up the price, the purchases were made in secret and then announced after the deals were made.
At the time it was the largest amount ever invested at one time by an American mutual fund and became known as the "Aron shock" in Tokyo markets.
In 1976 Mr. Aron joined the United States unit of Daiwa Securities as an executive vice president. He was one of the first American executives to hold a responsible position in a Japanese investment company.
"My job," he said, "was to be Mr. America, to explain what this meant, what that meant."
He took the message of investing in Japan to executives across the country and in 1983 was appointed vice chairman of American operations for Daiwa.
He helped the company expand in the United States from merely selling Japanese stock to American investors to offering a wide range of international investment services. He also helped Daiwa America become one of the first foreign-owned primary dealers in United States Government securities and a major underwriter of American corporate securities.
He bridged the differing business cultures of the two countries and saw to it that American rules, rather than looser Japanese commercial customs, governed the business activities of the employees. And he helped lay the groundwork for Daiwa's lead in listing American securities on the Tokyo Exchange and trading them for Japanese clients.
After his retirement, Mr. Aron remained with Daiwa as a senior adviser.
Mr. Aron was born in Brooklyn in 1921 and graduated from City College and from Columbia University. He served with the United States Army and was a Russian-English interpreter for the American, British and Russian members of the Allied Control Commission for Austria. After the war he returned to Columbia to study at its Russian Institute.
Until 1953 he taught history at several colleges in the metropolitan area, including Sarah Lawrence in Bronxville, N.Y. He then became a management consultant to American corporations and Government agencies until 1968, when he became involved with Wall Street.
In 1972 he moved from the Dreyfus Fund, where he was vice president for research, to the College Retirement Equities Fund, a teachers' pension fund. As a vice president and investment officer here, he was part of a four-member team that managed a $4 billion portfolio.
From 1981 to 1990, he published 37 reports on international investment, economic growth, accounting, technology, management and labor, with an emphasis on Japan. Since 1976 he had also taught international business and finance at the New York University Graduate School of Business.
In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Feinstein; two sons, Carl, of Manhattan, and David, of Shaker Heights, Ohio; a brother, William, of Seattle, and three grandchildren.

'Too Late; Fall Back, Baby'

BYLINE: By William C. Rhoden

 BODY:
John McLendon's voice immediately brightened when he was asked about one of his former players at Tennessee State University -- the one whose signature was his left-handed fall-away jump shot, the one they called Skull.
 Dick Barnett played for McLendon between 1955 and 1959 and was the catalyst on a team that won National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championships in 1957, '58 and '59.
 
 McLendon recalled Barnett's unorthodox shot. "It was like a lay-back -- he would go up and back at a 40-degree angle," McLendon recalled. "It was an undefendable shot. When he'd hit the floor, he was often off balance; sometimes, he'd exaggerate it. One time, he fell clear up in the second row after the shot."
 Barnett had another mannerism that would become his calling card. Whenever he'd launch one of his patented jump shots, he would look at the hapless defender and say with a sneer, "Too late; fall back, baby."
 "Too late; fall back, baby" became memorialized in a 14-year professional career that began with the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball Association, continued with the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League, then returned to the N.B.A. in 1962 with the Los Angeles Lakers. Barnett came to the Knicks in 1965 and retired in 1973.
 The origins of the expression "Fall back, baby" and the nickname Skull are disputed. McLendon said that "Fall back" came about during Barnett's Tennessee State days. "He would go to the gym and practice by himself, and he'd talk to an imaginary opponent out on the court," the coach recalled. "He'd be making all these moves and talking, and that's what he'd say when he'd shoot the ball: 'Fall back.' "
 Barnett said he had been telling opponents they were "too late" since his days at Gary Roosevelt High School in Gary, Ind. He said that his Tennessee State teammates gave him the name Skull when he showed up freshman year with a bald head. McLendon remembered differently. "I think he gave himself the name Skull," the coach said. "He became so deadly on the court that it was a fitting logo for his activity."
Although they were close, Barnett and McLendon frequently disagreed, usually over the disciplinary tactics McLendon used to keep his star in line. After one particularly egregious trespass during Barnett's freshman year, McLendon considered kicking him off the team, but the university's president interceded.
 In view of all this, it was easy to understand McLendon's joy to learn that, as of today, his protege has a new title: Dr. Dick Barnett. Three years ago, Barnett became a doctoral candidate in Fordham University's School of Education. Yesterday, at the age of 54, he completed the process by defending his dissertation.
"It's gratifying that he did it," McLendon said. "I knew he could make it."
Barnett was the first member of his family to attend college, but he never graduated from Tennessee State. After completing his athletic eligibility in 1959, he had earned only enough credits to be classified as an "upper" sophomore.
 "It wasn't that I wasn't capable; I just didn't have the commitment, I didn't have a focus." he said. "I knew I wanted to play basketball, but beyond that, I had a blunted vision. I had no idea of what the college atmosphere was all about. It was just something to do at age 18 to stay occupied and be interested in basketball and having fun."
 After his rookie season with the Nationals, Barnett returned to Tennessee State and began working toward completing his undergraduate degree, but it wasn't until he was traded to Los Angeles that he made headway. He enrolled at California Polytechnic College in Pomona and made the 150-mile round trip to class. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1968 after being traded to the Knicks. He later enrolled at New York University and earned a master's degree in administration in 1974.
Barnett, who is the founder and director of Athletics Role Models Educational Institute, said he would now like to spearhead a movement in which professional black athletes pool their resources. His idea, which he has entertained in some form for many years, would help eradicate problems in blighted areas of cities in which the athletes work.
 Barnett is not a Pharisee. He has gone from the economic deprivation of the inner city to life as a marginal student athlete, to a career as a professional athlete, to achieving a Ph.D.
 "One of the things that has helped my doctoral studies is that I've been grounded in the streets," he said. "Even though I didn't get involved in drugs, that's my environment. That's where I lived. I think I'm a better person for knowing how to survive in the street and also put this academic piece together."
 When Barnett left Gary he had nothing to fall back on except his ability to shoot a basketball. Thirty-six years later, Dr. Barnett has something he never thought he'd possess: a weapon more powerful than his left-handed jump shot.
 Fall back, baby.

HEADLINE: Soviet Liberals Get Smart

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Soviet and East European studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Soviet liberals are far from crushed. This was evident on Sunday, when Mikhail Gorbachev allowed Boris Yeltsin's supporters to rally in Moscow and demand Mr. Gorbachev's resignation. A few days earlier, Mr. Yeltsin had gone on national television to denounce him and make the same demand.
Last month, after the Soviet leader allowed military units to go on a murderous rampage in Lithuania and Latvia, he pulled back from his threat to close down Baltic parliaments. 
 What kind of crackdown is this, then? Clearly, one that is different from its predecessors in the Communist world. Mr. Gorbachev's campaign of repression has been carried out in the same slow motion he used as a reformer. His pace is not merely a style but a strategy: He tries never to give opponents a clear target, and if he meets unexpected resistance, he retreats to fight another day.
The result is that liberals have a breathing space to regroup and many opportunities to challenge Mr. Gorbachev in the political season ahead. They are mobilizing supporters and trying to turn upcoming events such as the referendum March 17 on the future of the Union to their advantage.
That Mr. Gorbachev has not arrested opponents does not mean he is not trying to weaken them. He has vigorously, but not wholly successfully, assaulted liberal strongholds in the media. When Izvestia's deputy editor was to be removed for criticizing him, the staff rallied and threatened to strike. And when the Russian republic's radio network was deprived of some frequencies, Yeltsin supporters accelerated plans to create an independent republic TV network.
Yet salvaging the freedom to criticize, organize and agitate may be the easy half of the liberals' problem. The tougher half is to devise a strategy that enables them to shape the Soviet Union's future. Without it, they may end up cherishing their democratic ideals in isolation.
The opposition is making progress in three crucial areas. The first concerns the structure of political institutions. The local, republic and national soviets or legislative councils (which gave the system its name) have never had any real power. When opposition candidates were elected to them last year, they acquired little control over anything. Now liberals are insisting that the soviets be junked. In their place, Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Moscow soviet, is pushing for a full overhaul of municipal government along Western lines.
Similarly, Mr. Yeltsin proposes to create a popularly elected presidency of the Russian republic to replace his position as chairman of the republic's soviet. This is not just a gimmick to highlight Mr. Gorbachev's fear of facing the voters. Mr. Yeltsin wants to strengthen elected officials in dealing with the unelected party functionaries still trying to run the country.
Second, liberals are moving to develop a distinctive approach to the ethnic crisis. They say no formula imposed from the top down will prove workable. To hold the country together means negotiating new political relations from the bottom up. At Mr. Yeltsin's initiative, the presidents of Russia, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine and Byelorussia have signed an economic agreement and are expanding it into a plan for political federation. It is likely to become a potent alternative to Mr. Gorbachev's Union treaty, which Mr. Yeltsin has derided as having no takers.
Third, the opposition is rethinking its view of Mr. Gorbachev. They see that remaining undecided about the father of perestroika is to play his game of political ambiguity. Liberals risk irrelevance if they wait for him to define himself more clearly.
The real significance of Mr. Yeltsin's TV attack on Mr. Gorbachev was that it cast him as the defender of the old order. Other important liberals agree that this is the only way they can influence events. Anatoly Sobchak, Leningrad's leader, argues that the vote on March 17 on preserving the Union must be turned into a vote against the Soviet President.
A single thread runs through the opposition's developing strategy. Liberals who thought the politics of consensus would carry them forward are now learning the politics of polarization.
The goal of this strategy is no longer to change Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Even those still drawn to the idea of a center-left coalition realize it can be revived only by pressure, not persuasion. In trying to build such pressure, the opposition has its best chance ever to win over reformers who have remained members of the party in the hope that they would be permitted to create within it a minority faction that espouses European-style social democracy. Stanislav Shatalin, author of the now-defunct "500 days" economic reform plan and still a Central Committee member, recently called this hope futile. Anyone trying to organize such a faction, he said, "will be immediately strangled."
Another disillusioned Gorbachev supporter, Fyodor Burlatsky, chairman of the Soviet Parliament's human rights commission, says that "the revolution of the dilettantes is over." He has not yet decided which side he is on, and may never do so, but he acknowledges that the revolution will not be won by trying to be all things to all people. The emerging line of division in Soviet politics is between those who understand this and those who do not.

Greening California

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
GOV. PETE WILSON'S first priority in California's water crisis is to keep the troops marching to the same drummer: "North and South, coast and valley, urban and rural, we are in this together, and we are going to have to pull together to overcome this drought."
But Thomas Graff, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, thinks Mr. Wilson has more in mind than collective sacrifice. A little-noticed part of the Governor's drought action plan, he points out, contains the seeds of a broad reform of the water allocation system -- one that would make it possible for California's thirsty cities to meet their long-term needs without ruining the state's water-dependent farmers. The idea is to create a market for water, encouraging farmers to profit by selling it to non-agricultural customers who value it more. 
 California's water system might have been invented by a Soviet bureaucrat on an LSD trip. Water is gathered by a multibillion-dollar network of dams, then transported hundreds of miles by aqueduct to the state's arid central valleys and the great desert cities beyond. While this infrastructure was built with state and Federal money, the benefits are by tradition (and, hazily, by law) reserved for the private interests who lobbied for its construction.
Water consumers pay, at most, the historic cost of a system largely completed in the days when $1 an hour was a living wage. And in some cases they pay far less: Farmers receiving water from the Central Valley Project are charged only enough to amortize construction costs over 50 years, at zero percent interest. These lucky folks pay about one-third of a cent for a thousand gallons, roughly one-fiftieth the cost of water from new sources. It should hardly be surprising, then, that much of California's water is used to irrigate rice and cotton -- what The Economist magazine calls "monsoon crops." And much of the rest is used to raise fodder for cows, whose tireless production of milk and cheese is an economic embarrassment to Washington and a political headache for the dairy lobby. The alfalfa crop alone consumes more water than the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined.
Nor should it be surprising that the battles over California water have been fought on the ground of fairness: Why, after all, should farmers in the Imperial Valley be able to flood their fields at the touch of a button when homeowners in Riverside must think twice before flushing the toilet?
No reason at all, perhaps. While the farm lobbies have managed to hang on to their rights, the growing urban interests arrayed against them will eventually prevail. But to many water analysts, the fight over equity misses the point.
The current system is so wasteful, Mr. Graff argues, that the gains from switching to an efficient market-based mechanism for allocatingwater would more than offset the costs of bribing farmers to cooperate. Mr. Graff wants to reaffirm the farmers' legal rights to government water, but encourage them to sell the rights for the highest prices the market would bear.
That is where Governor Wilson's plan fits in. He is creating a "water bank" that would buy water this year from rice farmers, then store it in the state's underused reservoirs or sell it to other, needier users. The most likely beneficiaries: orchard owners, who could lose a 20-year investment in a single parched growing season.
But once the bank is a going concern, Mr. Graff believes that it could also serve as a broker for the water needed to keep urban lawns green and pools filled. And with brokered water available at rates below the cost of new dams and aqueducts, the long-term threat to the state's already stressed environment would be reduced.
The water bank proposal, Mr. Graff concedes, is a crude first step toward a competitive market for water in which prices would equate value and cost. Governor Wilson has yet to explain how the state, as the single buyer, will set the price it pays. Ominously, he has directed the Water Resources Department to "monitor prices and report any signs of price-gouging."
Equally troubling, argues Mr. Graff, the state has yet to address the reality that urban water buyers are large public utilities, whose charges to their customers reflect the average cost of the water they buy rather than the much higher cost of tapping new sources. Thus the Metropolitan Water District, which serves millions of Southern California residents, might be expected to outbid even almond growers, whose trees could die this summer for lack of irrigation.
But most economists agree that any step toward matching willing sellers with buyers is a step in the right direction. At the very least, the water bank implicitly acknowledges that bad markets are better than no markets at all.

HEADLINE: Edmond P. Garvey, 86, Ex-College President

 BODY:
Edmond P. Garvey, the founder and first president of Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts, died Sunday at the Holyoke Soldiers Home, a hospital in Holyoke, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Springfield.
He died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said. 
 Perceiving a need for education programs leading to employment, Mr. Garvey persuaded state and Federal officials when the Springfield Armory closed in 1964 that the former weapons-manufacturing complex should be turned into the state's first technical community college. The two-year coeducational college opened in 1967 with Mr. Garvey as its president, a post he held until retiring in 1974.
Earlier he had developed a training program for the unemployed in the Springfield area.
Mr. Garvey, a native of Wilbraham, Mass., served in the Navy in World War II. He was assigned to the graduate school at Harvard University in 1941 and was appointed assistant professor of naval communications at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1943. He left the Navy in 1950 with the rank of captain, after serving as information officer at the United States Naval Academy.
Mr. Garvey is survived by his wife, the former Mary Gibbons, and a sister, Katherine Garvey of Springfield.

HEADLINE: CZECHS TO RETURN SEIZED PROPERTY

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Under a new law, Czechoslovakia will return, to the original owners or their heirs, hundreds of thousands of businesses and other properties confiscated by the former Communist Government.
Czechoslovakia thus becomes the first country in Eastern Europe to embark on such a sweeping program aimed at making up for the wrongs done under four decades of Communist rule. 
 Officials here say the reason is the deep disgust and moral indignation felt by many about the ruthlessness with which confiscations were carried out by Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist Government in the first years after it seized power in 1948.
"Persecutions and confiscations were more intensive here than in neighboring countries, with the exception of the Soviet Union," the Deputy Prime Minister, Pavel Rychetsky, said in an interview. Consequently, "there is greater moral awareness here" about the appropriateness of returning property.
Officials say the seizures were often carried out illegally, even under the laws passed by the Communists. Owners of factories or farms were expelled from their houses on short notice, and sometimes sentenced at summary trials to hard labor, apparently for the sole crime of belonging to the "enemy class."
 
No Complications
 Under the legislation adopted this month, former owners or their heirs have until the end of September to claim old property. The law requires the current owners, usually a state business or agency, to simply hand over the deed.
In a compromise step, emigres who settled in other countries can only make claims if they return and take up residence and citizenship. But under a 1982 agreement with Czechoslovakia, the United States compensated many of the Czechoslovaks who moved to America for property lost in their former homeland.
Officials say records of former ownership are well preserved, and they expect restitution to work on a voluntary bases in many cases. Where a dispute arises that cannot be resolved by an official of the Ministry of Privatization, the case would go to court.
Officials say they expect that as much as 10 percent of all the property owned by the state will be returned to former owners or their heirs in this manner.
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, speaking in support of the bill, said in Parliament that the returned property, plus Government bonds or vouchers given in cases where property return was impossible, would be worth about $10 billion.
 
Earlier Confiscations
 The new law covers only confiscations from when the Communists seized power in February 1948. This excludes any compensation for seizures carried out between 1945 and 1948, when the democratic Government nationalized big businesses in a move that put 60 percent of the economy in state hands. Among the companies nationalized then, and therefore not eligible for compensation, are the giant Skoda auto works and the Bata shoe company.
Problems arise when the property is not in the same condition it was at the time of confiscation. This is the case if, for example, a factory has been enlarged or a house has become dilapidated. In such cases, the former owners can pay for the value of the improvements and receive the whole property, or take compensation instead.
Cash compensation would be limited to slightly more than $1,000. The rest would be paid through bonds or vouchers that could be exchanged for shares in newly privatized state-owned businesses.
An earlier law, adopted last fall, provides for the return to former owners of small shops and houses seized after 1955 in a last wave of confiscations known then as the "final liquidation of the capitalist class."
Officials say almost half of the estimated 80,000 people eligible under the law have applied for the return of their property. Separate laws are expected later this year on the return or compensation of confiscated farms and church property.

HEADLINE: Despite Their Own Problems, Donors Help Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
New Yorkers have a reputation for being callous and hard. They are said to look past beggars on the streets more often than not, ignoring their jingling cups and calls for spare change.
Despite this image, thousands of people have responded to the plight of the sick and the poor and sent money to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With two days left in the 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases, more than 15,000 people and organizations have given to the fund, and donations are still arriving. 
 These gifts come from people whose lives have been devastated by personal tragedies -- death, illness and unemployment. And they come from people who have homes, families and jobs but cannot ignore the homeless people they pass every day.
Elizabeth Miney wrote that she passed dozens of panhandlers every day on her way from work in Manhattan to her home in Woodside, Queens. She said that she did not give handouts, as she was too overwhelmed by the "countless numbers of homeless, sick and hungry people" she saw.
 
'Into the Right Hands'
 Nonetheless, Ms. Miney was moved, and wanted to help. Last month, she sent $50 to the fund -- her first donation. "I know that this contribution will get into the right hands and be put to good use," she wrote.
A $50 donation from Julie Houston, a 47-year-old Brooklyn freelance writer, resulted from her recent financial troubles. She said yesterday that her income had dropped in the last few months and that she had written off any chance of donating to the Neediest Cases. Then she received an unexpected present of $350 from her father. Rather than keep it all, she gave to the fund and described her gift as "spreading a little bit of butter on bread."
Valerie Bogacki gave $25 to the Neediest Cases. Mrs. Bogacki, of Port Jefferson, L.I., said yesterday that it had been a "miserable year" -- her husband and father-in-law had died. But she said that caring for her mother, who suffers from a severe mental illness, made her aware of the precarious situations that others faced.
"My mother could easily lose her apartment and everything else for lack of ability to function," she wrote. "It is frightening to know how thin the line is between surviving and not."
 
Despite War, More Donors
 Proceeds from the Neediest Cases are distributed to seven charities to help the sick and the destitute. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead, and money from the fund has been used to help homeless people find shelter, to send disabled children to summer camp and to provide counseling to people with AIDS.
Over the last few months, fund-raising experts have speculated that the city's economic difficulties and the war in the Persian Gulf would discourage many people from contributing to the fund. But participation has increased this year, and today's total is only $42,295.07 short of the amount raised in last year's drive -- the largest total in the fund's 79-year history.
The 1990-91 drive closes tomorrow, and gifts that arrive after March 1 will be held for the next drive, which opens after Thanksgiving.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Making Steel Faster and Cheaper

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind.

 BODY:
In the midst of this wide stretch of quiet farmland just west of Indianapolis, a new steelmaking process championed by Nucor Inc. is now gaining worldwide attention from steel industry executives because of its potential to make steel more cheaply and quickly.
In the new technology, called thin-slab casting, molds initially cast the steel into sheets just two inches thick, a quarter of the eight-inch thickness of the ingots typically cast by other major steel companies. The main advantage of the process is that it takes less energy to make final slabs of steel only one-tenth of an inch thick. And it takes only three hours to do so, instead of as long as a week with normal procedures, because the steel sheet at the beginning of the operation is much thinner. 
 The first commercial use of thin-slab casting is being done at Nucor's imposing plant here. The technology was developed by SMS Schloemann Siemag A.G. of Germany. Franz J. Kueper, a project manager with SMS, said the company expected that several larger steel companies would buy equipment capable of thin-slab casting within five years for making automobile and appliance frames. "The more success Nucor has with the process, the more competitive the process will become," he said.
Steel industry analysts generally agree, saying that the success of the Nucor project will ultimately change the production methods of larger steel companies.
 
Many Scoffed
 That did not seem the case when the project started two years ago. It was fraught with problems and Nucor was losing as much as $1 million a week in start-up costs. Indeed, many in the industry -- notably the larger steel producers -- scoffed at the process, saying it had too many imperfections to make it attractive. But things have straightened out considerably at Nucor and company officials now say they are turning out a high-quality product
Officials at Nucor, the nation's 10th-largest steel company, deny that they intend to compete head on with the likes of the USX Corporation, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the others in the Big Steel pack. The plant here, in the midst of what was until a few years ago farmland in northwestern Indiana, is equipped to produce only 800,000 to a million tons of steel a year. It would take far more than that to meet any auto maker's demand.
"We don't like to tie up too much production on any one customer," said F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman. "So we are more interested in smaller customers whose orders are for smaller quantities of steel." Some of Nucor's best customers now are tube makers and manufacturers of auto parts and construction and agricultural equipment.
So Nucor's steel goes into several products, including car ashtrays, folding chairs and frames for televisions. "I'm not sure that the flat-rolled market for exterior parts for automobiles and appliances is attractive to us," Mr. Iverson said. Nucor's goal is to compete with the big companies in the lower end of the market and not have to rely on any one big customer.
Still, Mr. Iverson added, "I am completely convinced that the process will be able to produce the best quality flat-rolled product, quality as good as anyone else's in the industry within a couple of years."
 
A New Interest
 In fact those officials of major steel companies, who initially shrugged off the notion that Nucor's innovation was any threat to them, are now watching the project closely and are contemplating buying the new steelmaking equipment.
When Nucor introduced its project, most industry competitors predicted that the quality of the steel produced here would be more appropriate for lower-grade uses like steel drums, joists and siding for buildings. But now Nucor officials and analysts contend that the process will one day produce steel that will go into the exterior parts of automobiles, washing machines and the like.
Still, analysts predict that the potential energy and labor savings from the thin-slab casting technology, especially in larger-scale operations, means larger steelmakers will probably adopt the process.
 
How It Works
 In the first step of the Nucor process, steel scrap is melted in furnaces heated by electricity. Then two ladles of molten steel flow into a mold in which the steel is cast into strips as much as 53 inches wide and 2 inches thick. These slabs, 145 feet long, are placed in a furnace that heats the steel slab evenly to 2,000 degrees, enabling it to be rolled more thinly.
The metal passes through a descaling unit to remove a thin layer of iron oxide that forms on the steel. The steel is pressed through four mills that roll and flatten the sheet to a thickness of one-tenth of an inch.
The entire steelmaking process is done in a huge structure, the length of four football fields, and takes less than three hours, from scrap to finished product. "The key is that it moves continuously," said Keith E. Bussey, Nucor's vice president and general manager of the plant here.
Big steel companies cast molten scrap into a slab 8 to 10 inches thick. It is taken to a reheating furnace and then to a series of mills to be rolled -- sometimes going through dozens of rollings -- to be flattened. This process takes several days, and sometimes weeks, to produce thin steel sheets.
In the conventional process, steel is cast and cut in 20-to-30-foot lengths and then is removed to a storage yard, where it takes on the ambient temperature. To reheat that to 2,000 degrees takes a substantial amount of energy.
 
More Steel, Fewer Workers
 The Nucor plant employs about 400 people, including managers, administrators, security guards and marketing staff. There are steel companies that produce about the same amount of steel -- a million tons a year -- but have more than 2,000 workers. One of the nation's largest plants, the Burns Harbor Bethlehem Steel plant along Indiana's Lake Michigan coastline, produced 4.4 million tons of steel last year with 6,000 employees.
Nucor's initial start-up problems centered on mechanical and technical difficulties that sent planners back to the drawing board more than once. And many in the industry pointed to the plant's initial problems as evidence that the mill would probably have little effect in the steel industry.
While Mr. Iverson's bold gamble is now seen as paying off, not all the problems are behind him. "We continue to have a couple problems with surface inperfections," Mr. Iverson said. He explained that a powder that enabled the molten steel to pour smoothly into the mold sometimes affixed itself to the metal's surface. "In the beginning we had 26 to 30 imperfections per 20-ton coil," he said. "Now we have 3 or 4 at the most and most coils are free of any problems."
Other steel companies have not yet rushed to adopt this technology. The downturn in the steel industry in the last year came just as the Nucor plant started seeing sustainable successes. Profits for steelmakers have tumbled and that has left them reluctant to spend on technological changes that have been used commercially for such a short time.
"But we will see that it's going to play a major role in the industry," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants, an economic consulting firm based in Philadelphia.
"The technology has proved that it can work, but steel companies are not in a period where they are likely to spend huge sums of money on new technology. As soon as the recession ends, I think we will see that steel companies will dive in."

1. Ladles pour molten steel into a mold. The mold, only two inches thick, is a key innovation at the Nucor plant. Previous molds cast the steel into 8-inch slabs requiring much more rolling and reheating to make them a uniform 0.1-inch thickness at the end of the process.
 
2. The steel slab is reheated in a furnace to bring it to a uniform temperature, then run through a descaling unit, which removes impurities.
 
3. The warmed slab is then passed through a series of rollers that crush it to a 0.1-inch thickness. After cooling, the slab is coiled and ready for shipment.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler Ends Grand Wagoneer

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 26

 BODY:
With pressure rising to focus its limited financial resources on mainstream products, the Chrysler Corporation said today that it would stop producing its slow-selling Jeep Grand Wagoneer this fall.
The hulking four-wheel-drive vehicle, which for years was the flagship of the Jeep line, fell victim to new competitors like the Ford Explorer and the Range Rover. Fewer buyers were willing to pay $30,000 for the leather seats and power windows that had once made Grand Wagoneer a favorite among well-heeled weekenders.
 
Extensive Work Needed
 Analysts say the Grand Wagoneer, one of the last true gas guzzlers, would have required extensive engineering work to comply with Federal safety standards that are expected to apply to all such vehicles sold in the United States by 1993. 
 But hard times are hitting the Jeep brand over all. Chrysler said it planned to cut production by 11 percent at its Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, and lay off 1,000 hourly workers indefinitely beginning in May.
Chrysler says it has a replacement for the Grand Wagoneer, a luxury Jeep code-named ZJ, which is to be built at a plant under construction in Detroit, and is scheduled to go on sale next spring.
With its decision to discontinue the Grand Wagoneer, however, Chrysler is laying to rest the grandfather of the large, plushly outfitted vehicles with four-wheel drive, a segment that has mushroomed in recent years.
 
First Appeared in 1962
 The original Grand Wagoneer was introduced in 1962 by Willys Motors Inc. in Toledo. The model was the first and, for years, the only luxury full-sized station wagon on the market with four-wheel drive and enough ground clearance to handle dirt roads.
As such, the vehicle appealed to a generation of American hunters and outdoorsmen, who coveted it for its well-appointed interiors, six-passenger seating, World War II Jeep pedigree and fake wood veneers.
The Grand Wagoneer sells for $29,241, gets about 12 miles to the gallon, and has had only minor styling changes in its 28 years. Analysts say the vehicles often served as second or even third cars for their owners.
"I expect the last of this production run will go to those people who are still towing the horse trailers and boats," said Larry Baker, the general manager of Chrysler's Jeep/Eagle division.
 
Wealthy Owners
 Indeed, the average annual income of Grand Wagoneer owners is more than $100,000, making them the most affluent of Chrysler's customers. But Chrysler sold a scant 6,164 Wagoneers last year, a decline of 64 percent from 1986.
"If Chrysler could have kept sales up at about 1,000 a month, the company might have saved the Grand Wagoneer," said Christopher Cedergren, a market analyst for J. D. Power & Associates in Westlake Village, Calif. But the decline in sales accelerated over the years, to where the Grand Wagoneer was running out of buyers.
"There are too many other sophisticated four-wheel-drive vehicles for buyers to choose from," he added.
The Toledo plant where the Grand Wagoneer is built is as antiquated as the vehicle itself. Chrysler said today that 360 hourly workers would be laid off indefinitely because of the discontinuation. Another 630 hourly workers at the plant will be furloughed indefinitely beginning as early as May 3, the company said.

Dollar Shows Mixed Results As Some Profits Are Taken

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in hectic trading yesterday as profit taking and technical factors replaced early euphoria over battlefield gains by the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf.
Gold prices were slightly lower. The contract for February delivery in New York settled at $359 an ounce, off 50 cents from late Monday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.95, down $1.05. 
 The dollar's mixed performance against major foreign currencies came despite further signs that the campaign by the United States-led military forces would soon bring an end to the war against Iraq.
Reports that Iraqi resistance was weak had buoyed the dollar on Monday, raising hopes the United States economy was poised for a postwar rebound. But yesterday, the fourth day of the ground attack, traders said the market had already built in the assumption that the conflict's days were numbered.
"A lot of people set themselves up to be long dollars based on the war going well," said Al Shealy, foreign exchange manager for Union Bank of Switzerland. "It was kind of 'buy the rumor and sell the news.' "
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York, said the dollar staged a small advance on a morning report that North Korea ordered its armed forces to remain on full combat alert during joint United States-South Korean military exercises.
North Korea has issued similar alerts in past years during such exercises, but the episode was still viewed as a sign of instability overseas, and it temporarily lifted the dollar. The rise, though, was short-lived as profit taking overtook political developments.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.94 yen to close at 133.07 yen. Later, in London, it fell to 132.95 yen, and in New York it closed at 132.94 yen, down from 133.55 late Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9215, from $1.9235 late Monday. The dollar also rose against the pound in New York, where sterling settled at $1.9194, down from $1.9265 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the prices late Monday, included: 1.5234 German marks, up from 1.5200; 1.3070 Swiss francs, up from 1.3020; 5.1775 French francs, up from 5.1665; 1,138.25 Italian lire, up from 1,136.00, and 1.1521 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1526.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $358.50 an ounce, from $358.75 late Monday. In Zurich, gold's closing bid was $359, up from $357.85. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to close at a bid of $360.58.
Silver fell in New York, settling at $3.563 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down 1.3 cents from late Monday. In London, the late bid price was $3.26, down from $3.57.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Index Rose Slightly at Midmonth

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Consumer confidence, which has become the most widely watched indicator of when the recession might end, rose slightly in February -- the first improvement since September -- but the rise was not enough to foster optimism that the economy might begin to recover soon, the Conference Board reported yesterday.
The board's overall confidence index, based on a survey in mid-February of 4,000 households, rose to 57.1, from 55.1 in January. The index was still a half-dozen points below its lowest level in the 1981-82 recession. And a major component, confidence that jobs are plentiful today, deteriorated. 
 "When we get the March reading, we will undoubtedly get another improvement, reflecting the country's military successes in the gulf ground war," said Fabian Linden, director of the survey. "But it won't be enough to get us out of the recession, because Americans see the job situation as still very bad, and that hits close to home."
The survey by the Conference Board, a business organization, is one of two leading consumer confidence surveys. The University of Michigan, which conducts the other, will release its February results later this week, and they are also likely to show a slight upturn in confidence, said Richard Curtin, the survey's director.
The Conference Board said falling interest rates and a decline in the inflation rate contributed to the February upturn in its index, mostly by making people more optimistic about the future, if not the present.
A subindex measuring how consumers feel about current business conditions and job prospects fell to 52.6, from 54.7 in January. But another subindex, reflecting job and income prospects and the condition of the economy over the next six months, rose to 61.1, from 55.3 in January.
"We can't read these figures as showing a bottoming out of the recession," Mr. Linden said. "They are only fractionally better."
During periods of economic growth, optimists about jobs outnumber the pessimists by a ratio of 4 to 1. In recent months, the ratio has been decidedly reversed, with three or four pessimistic replies for each optimistic one.
 
Focus of Attention
 The Administration has focused attention on the confidence indexes by arguing that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 brought on the recession. The war made consumers' confidence fall sharply in August, the Administration contends, and so did their desire to spend. Once the war ends, confidence will rebound and so will the economy, in the Administration's view.
But many private economists challenge this scenario. They note that the confidence indexes had fallen gradually for months before the sharp decline in August. The indexes plunged just as sharply in October, they say, when the battle over a Federal budget agreement and the possibility that Government services would be suspended for lack of funds were as much in the news as the gulf crisis.
 
Still-Worrisome Areas
 Furthermore, consumer confidence responds mostly to things like job prospects, consumer loan rates and taxes, which remain worries for most consumers, said Richard Rahn, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
What is more, the Gallup Organization says that the gulf war is too much of a distraction for consumers to accurately measure their attitudes about jobs and the economy.
Gallup's last consumer confidence poll, conducted in mid-January, before the war started, found a rise in confidence from October's very low levels, mostly because fewer people said their personal finances were deteriorating. "I don't think consumer confidence is a useful thing to measure, because so much attention is concentrated on the war and not the economy," said Jay Schmiedeskamp, director of Gallup's economic and financial surveys.

HEADLINE: COLOMBIAN LEADER IS HAILED BY BUSH

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
President Bush strongly endorsed the drug policies of Colombia's President today despite the Colombian leader's new offer to negotiate the surrender of cocaine traffickers in exchange for immunity from extradition and shorter prison terms.
Administration officials noted that Mr. Bush took two hours off from monitoring the Persian Gulf war to meet today with the President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, as a sign of his commitment to combat drug abuse and to back the Colombian leader as he confronts a surge in drug-related kidnappings. 
 "You're a man of courage," Mr. Bush told Mr. Gaviria at a White House ceremony characterized by warm handshakes and pats on the back. "You're a man devoted to law and to liberty, and for that you have our admiration and respect." He characterized Mr. Gaviria's antidrug efforts as "heroic."
Mr. Gaviria's drug policy combines the region's most aggressive police action against narcotics activities with an offer of leniency for all traffickers who turn themselves in and confess to at least one criminal count involving terrorism or dealing in illegal drugs. Eight major traffickers have given themselves up since December, including the three Ochoa brothers, who are allegedly among the top leaders of the Medellin drug cartel.
 
Trade Concessions Sought
 Administration officials, however, expressed some skepticism about the plan in recent weeks after a Colombian judge released one trafficker after he served only six weeks in jail.
Mr. Gaviria is being attacked relentlessly by the political opposition, which has accused him of making his offer of extradition immunity hastily to placate the drug cartels.
Mr. Bush's endorsement should strengthen Mr. Gaviria's pleas to Congressional leaders Wednesday that they ease trade restrictions on legal Colombian exports like coffee and cut flowers as another way to relieve the country's economic reliance on cocaine.
The trade benefits, which are part of the Andean Trade Preference Act, have been proposed by the Administration to authorize duty-free treatment of many Peruvian, Ecuadorean nd Colombian exports for 10 years.
"We wanted to give President Gaviria recognition and a boost at a difficult time," said Melvyn Levitsky, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters.
He noted with approval that Colombia had made 4,100 drug arrests and seized 53 tons of cocaine in 1990 compared with 3,600 arrests and 37 tons of cocaine seized in 1989. Colombia is believed to have the capacity to produce 477 tons of cocaine annually.
 
Four Agreements Signed
 Eighty percent of the cocaine imported into the United States is processed in Colombian plants. Roughly 300,000 Colombians are employed by the drug trade, most of whom directly or indirectly work for the Medellin and Cali cartels.
After the White House meeting today, Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said the Administration could accept that drug traffickers were not extradited to the United States as long as they served appropriately long jail sentences in Colombia.
Mr. Gaviria began his four-day visit on Monday with the signing of four agreements intended to improve trade and cooperation in law enforcement. The agreements will provide $20 million in new United States economic aid and fortify joint efforts to monitor American companies that export precursor chemicals, the substances used in cocaine processing, to Colombia.
The most important agreement, officials said, will enable the United States to share American judicial evidence with Colombian authorities seeking to prosecute drug traffickers in Colombian courts.
Mr. Gaviria told Mr. Bush that such evidence should ease any Administration concerns that the expected halt to most extraditions will ease the legal pressures on the cartels. "He said if full cooperation is achieved we can expect harsh sentences and strong prosecution efforts against drug traffickers," said Gabriel Silva, the presidential counselor for foreign affairs.
Mr. Gaviria complimented Mr. Bush for making progress in cutting American consumption of cocaine. But he noted that drug use appeared to be growing in Europe and Asia, a fact that will require more international cooperation in law-enforcement efforts.
"I am sure we are going to dismantle the cartels," he said at his White House departure ceremony. "We are really committed to that."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates on Treasuries Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market participants, apparently sensing that victory in the Persian Gulf will lead to a pickup in the economy and push up interest rates, sold Treasury notes and bonds yesterday. The drop in prices pushed rates higher.
The selloff, during which the price of some securities fell by nearly a point, took place on thin volume, dealers said. 
 "That's a big part of the problem," one Government bond trader said, referring to the slow pace of trading. "Retail business just isn't there. That means the Street has to sell securities to push yields to the point where those accounts will step up and buy."
 
No Stimulus From Reports
 Selling commenced shortly after two economic reports -- one on durable goods orders for January, the other a measure of consumer attitudes during February -- were released.
Neither report came close to suggesting that the economy had experienced a sharp turnaround. But neither was as weak as many market participants had expected.
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items to last more than three years, fell by seven-tenths of a percentage point in January. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index in February rose to 57.1 from 55.1 the previous month. The index had risen for the first time since September.
"Markets are so sensitive now that any faint hint that the decline may be moderating is enough to make people bearish on bonds," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. "But we are still in recession."
 
Confidence and Spending
 In their daily market commentary, analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company in Belmont, Calif., said the "report of a modest rebound in consumer confidence was hardly impressive. But many expect it to pick up significantly now that an end to the war is in sight."
Mr. Robertson and other analysts noted that a pickup in confidence would not necessarily lead to an increase in consumer spending.
Indeed, rising unemployment and declining disposable incomes, two current facts of economic life, are not generally seen as symptoms of a healthy consumer.
"The fundamentals of consumer spending are very weak, and likely to remain so," Mr. Robertson said.
That sort of thinking was not prevalent in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
 
30-Year Bonds at 8.12%
 By late in the session, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 6/32, down by 29/32, to yield 8.12 percent, compared with 8.04 percent late on Monday.
Among note issues, the prices of all three of the new securities that the Treasury sold earlier this month posted declines, and the securities are trading at levels well under where they were auctioned.
In late trading, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 5/8, down by 15/32, to yield 7.95 percent. The 7 1/2 percent five-year notes were offerd at 99 18/32, down by a quarter-point, to yield 7.60 percent. The 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 18/ 32, down by 2/32, to yield 6.98 percent.
"Compared to the way it was at the start of the month, market sentiment is dramatically different as February comes to a close," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Interest rates also moved higher in the short-term Treasury bill market.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 6 percent, up by 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 5.99 percent.
 
New York State Notes
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, New York State offered $905 million in short-term tax and revenue anticipation notes at competitive bid.
The largest single piece of the issue, $350 million, was won by a bid from a group led by Merrill Lynch & Company. The securities have a 5 percent coupon and mature on Dec. 30, 1991.
Participants in the municipal market said the issue, rated MIG-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and SP-1 by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, was not greeted with strong investor demand.
Prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds continued to erode.
Traders said prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about three-eighths of a point.
 
7-Year Notes Are Priced
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the more relaxed attitude among investors to buy new securities issued by commercial banks allowed First Interstate Bancorp to price $125 million in seven-year notes through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 11 percent notes, which mature on March 5, 1998, were priced at $99.765 to yield 11.049 percent, or 3.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent seven-year notes at pricing.
The notes, which are not callable for life, are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard & Poor's. Because of good investor demand, the size of the issue was increased from $100 million.

HEADLINE: Dow Stocks Off by 23.27, To 2,864.60

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks gave ground yesterday for the fifth straight session, with weakness in I.B.M. contributing heavily to the decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 23.27, to 2,864.60, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell the equivalent of almost 35 Dow points. 
 Trading sank to a relatively slow 164.2 million shares, from 193.8 million on Monday. Birinyi Associates said successive waves of program selling lopped 17 points off the blue-chip average.
I.B.M., which fell 3 7/8, to 129 3/4, and Philip Morris, which slid 1 7/8, to 66 3/4, accounted for about half the decline.
The slide in Philip Morris appeared to be profit taking, while I.B.M. fell after Stephen Smith, computer analyst for Paine Webber, trimmed his earnings estimate for the company and downgraded the stock from "buy" to "attractive." The company also announced price cuts as deep as 20 percent on some personal computers.
 
A Market Leader
 Analysts argued that if I.B.M., one of the most closely watched market barometers, could lead the market to higher ground, as it has, it could also lead it lower.
Traders blamed the sharp drop in bond prices for the weakness in stocks. Bonds fell, they said, because of expectations that the end of the war would revive consumer confidence and strengthen the economy. While a stronger economy would seem good for stocks, stronger-than-expected figures on the economy released yesterday gave traders the feeling that the Fed would not cut interest rates further to stimulate the economy.
Two of Wall Street's most prominent market forecasters took a look at the Dow yesterday and came up with entirely different predictions.
Dan Sullivan, editor of The Chartist, a newsletter of Seal Beach, Calif., which the Hulbert Financial Digest ranks as No. 4 in the country in terms of total investment return over the last 10 years, forecast that the Dow would be above 3,000 in two and a half months and above 3,200 in six months.
Charles Allmon, editor of Growth Stock Outlook of Chevy Chase, Md., No. 3 in the Hulbert 10-year rankings, said, "We could see a high of 3,100 by midyear and a low of 2,000 before the end of the year."
Asked when, Mr. Allmon replied, "October historically is a vicious month for the stock market."
Mr. Sullivan, on the other hand, argued: "I don't think we'll have much of a correction. And if we do, it'll be another 80 points at the most and then pop right back up again."
 
A Favorite Indicator
 As a technician, Mr. Sullivan said that one of his favorite indicators was the advance-decline ratio. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, for example, more than 2.5 stocks declined for every one that advanced.
Mr. Sullivan noted that since 1970, there have been only eight times when declines exceeded advances by at least 2 to 1 for 10 days in a row, and that Feb. 5 marked the end of the ninth such 10-day period. This suggested, he said, that this was a good sign of future buying.
"If the past is any indication," he said, "there's enough thrust generated to take the market considerably higher over the next three months, six months and even a year."
But when asked where the market might be in a year, he said, "I don't know."
Mr. Allmon, on the other hand, argued that the Dow Jones industrial average had sold at or below book value in the last three recessions and that it was currently selling at only about 2.2 times book value.
Moreover, he said, the yield on the Dow as of a few days ago was 3.4 percent -- "where most bear markets begin."
"This data," he said, "tells me the Dow is no bargain."
"Sooner or later in major bull or bear markets," he said, "all the market averages move together. And if anybody thinks this is a bull market, they've swallowed a lot of bull."
"The market always comes around to true value," he went on, "and it's blatantly overpriced."
 
New High for NCR
 Among yesterday's movers, NCR rose 1 3/4, to 95 1/2, a new high. A.T.& T., which has offered $90 a share for NCR, said it would fight the computer maker's plans to give employees 8 percent of the voting stock.
Pennzoil rose 1 5/8, to 67 7/8; ARCO 1 1/4, to 127 1/2; Texaco 1 3/8, to 61 1/4, and Chevron 1, to 72 1/4, although analysts seemed divided on the future prospects for the oil group.
In the technology stocks, Digital Equipment fell 2, to 72 1/4; Compaq Computer 2 1/4, to 71 1/4, and Motorola 2 1/8, to 60 3/4.

HEADLINE: Town Hopes for Peace but Is Reassured It Won't Last

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WATERVLIET, N.Y., Feb. 26

 BODY:
No one in Watervliet likes war. Everyone hopes that the conflict in the Persian Gulf ends soon and that peace is restored. Just not too much peace.
"You're always going to have these conflicts springing up somewhere," Dave Blazejeski, an electrician at the Watervliet Arsenal, said today in a tone more reassuring than regretful. 
 To the extent that Watervliet, five miles north of Albany, still has an economy, it consists of the Government arsenal that sprawls across the center of town here. The arsenal has produced virtually all of the large-caliber cannons that Americans have een recently on television bristling from the brows of battleships and tanks.
Last spring, when the Berlin wall was carted away to souvenir shops and there was genuine talk of converting swords into plowshares, all the global euphoria made Watervliet openly nervous. With peace breaking out all over, the demand for heavy guns plummeted. The arsenal prepared for a "Reduction in Force," or "R.I.F.," of 290 workers.
 
'Want the End of War'
 Then in August Iraq invaded Kuwait. Heavy artillery made a comeback; the layoffs were canceled. Now, the Watervliet Arsenal is looking to fill 45 new positions.
"We all want the end of war," Van C. Dyson, an assembler at the arsenal, said today, pausing on his way back to work after lunch. "But we also know that as long as there's war, we're going to have work."
The men and women who work at the Watervliet Arsenal bristle at the suggestion that they are warmongers. Many of them are veterans themselves, and they say they would not wish the horror of battle on anyone. What they are, they say, is realists.
"There's always going to be some madman around," said John Swantek, the arsenal's public affairs officer. "People around here really tend to believe in the idea of peace through strength."
Around the arsenal, "strength" is not some fuzzy concept to be debated by politicians. It refers to the giant guns carried by battleships, which are 50 feet long and weigh up to 100 tons and which, not surprisingly, were manufactured here. And it refers to sleeker, more modern weapons like the 120-millimeter guns that are mounted on M-1A1 tanks and were, naturally, also made in Watervliet.
The well-being of the village of Watervliet, population 11,000, has been intimately tied to the arsenal ever since it was established to manufacture powder horns and bullet pouches for the War of 1812. It is probably because of this connection that the town is so fervidly patriotic; yellow ribbons are so prevalent these days that it looks as if all of Watervliet were being offered up as an enormous birthday present.
The war has improved morale not only in the arsenal but also up and down Watervliet's main street.
"Of course, we're not thrilled about what's going on," said Eleanor Banbuskirk, who works at the flower shop across from the gate. "But it's a shot in the arm. It's just about the only thing that has helped our business. The demand for flags and yellow ribbons has been just incredible."
Even if the war in the gulf ends shortly, as news reports today suggested, employment is expected to remain strong at the arsenal for some time. Already machinists and electricians are working overtime to replace weapons that were lost or damaged during the conflict. Just filling back orders is likely to take at least a year.
But after that, arsenal employees say, the future looks precarious. History has shown them just how quickly the country likes to pretend that the danger of war has passed.
 
$11.95 an Hour
 After World War I, for example, local newspapers debated whether the arsenal should be closed and its grounds used for a new post office or veterans' hospital. Then World War II came along and the arsenal experienced a renaissance. Employment reached a high of almost 8,000 in 1943. But even before the Japanese had surrendered, thousands of workers were told to stay home at the first report of armistice.
Currently, the Watervliet Arsenal employs about 2,200 people. Its machinist's jobs, with starting salaries of $11.95 an hour, are considered good ones in area where manufacturing is on the wane and the region's major employer -- New York State -- has been issuing a stream of pink slips. Even though new workers are being hired only on a temporary basis, more than 100 people have applied for the new jobs at the arsenal, which were advertised on Sunday.
Although past practice suggests that the arsenal staff will be cut back again once the current war has faded into history, William Bradford, the curator of the arsenal museum, said he hoped the country's leaders had learned enough not to believe in a lasting peace.
"We're just keeping our fingers crossed," he said.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Decline 0.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The value of orders to manufacturers for "big ticket" durable goods slipped seven-tenths of 1 percent in January from the month before, the Government said today. It was the second drop in three months, but the rate of decline appeared to be slowing.
The Commerce Department said January orders for durable goods -- items ranging from trucks to turbines that are expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $118.5 billion. 
 Many analysts had expected a decline approaching 1.5 percent. And while the decline was the second in three months, it was still far improved from the 10.1 percent plunge posted in November. Orders rose 2.7 percent in December.
 
Evidence of an Upturn?
 Laurence H. Meyer, head of a St. Louis economic forecasting firm, said the latest report was "an indication that maybe the downward momentum is slowing a little bit." He added, "It certainly confirms my expectation that the worst is behind us."
"Maybe we'll still see negative numbers, but we'll see smaller and smaller negative numbers," agreed Thomas Runiewicz, an economist at the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Nevertheless, a decrease in orders often results in a decline in production and subsequent layoffs. Indeed, the Labor Department said 69,000 factory jobs were lost in January, meaning 900,000 workers were cut from manufacturing payrolls since January 1990.
And January orders in the key category of nonmilitary capital goods, often an indication of business plans to expand and modernize, plunged 8.4 percent, to $38.2 billion. A 16.6 percent gain in December had erased a 14.1 percent fall the previous month.
January transportation orders were off 3.7 percent, to $30.7 billion, following a 13.1 percent gain in December. The Commerce Department said the decrease resulted from a large decline in aircraft orders that more than offset a large increase in motor vehicles.
"Aircraft had been booming for so long, we were bound to see some negative numbers," Mr. Runiewicz said, noting that when the transportation category was excluded, orders actually rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Military orders, which had jumped 52.7 percent in December as the allied deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait neared, fell back 9.8 percent during January, when the offensive began.
Excluding the $7.3 billion military outlay, orders edged down just one-tenth of 1 percent.
Electrical machinery orders fell 9 percent, to $18.9 billion, nearly eroding a 12.6 percent advance in December.
 
Non-Electric Machinery Gains
 But orders for non-electrical machinery jumped 10.7 percent, to $22.6 billion, rebounding from a decline of 7.9 percent the previous month. The department said construction, mining and material handling equipment and office and computing equipment accounted for most of the gain.
Orders for primary metals inched up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $9.8 billion, after falling 9 percent in December.
Shipments in January rose 1.9 percent, to $118.9 billion, after two consecutive monthly declines. Virtually all of the January increase was in transportation equipment.
Unfilled orders, an indication of how busy factories will be in coming months, slipped slightly, down one-tenth of 1 percent, to $500.1 billion, after an advance of five-tenths of 1 percent in December.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Bush's War Success Confers An Aura of Invincibility in '92

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
While the war in the Persian Gulf is not over, it has produced extraordinary levels of support for President Bush and presented the Democrats with a daunting task in finding a candidate who can effectively oppose him in 1992, political professionals say.
Defeating an incumbent President is never easy, but many Democrats now view 1992 as a challenge that seems more than merely difficult. "My sense is George Bush is getting close to unbeatable, if the aims are accomplished as they seem to be," said Jim Ruvolo, the former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and still president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs. 
 Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and an influential party strategist, was predicting not only a Presidential victory in 1992 but sweeping Republican gains in Congress as well. "I think it could be bigger than 1984; I think it could be 1980 all over again," he said today, referring to the 1980 election in which the Republicans won both the White House and control of the Senate.
A year is a lifetime in politics, as Mr. Ruvolo and other politicians stress. And even the most bullish Republicans cast a nervous eye on the economy. Mr. Bush has repeatedly stumbled on domestic issues, notably in last fall's negotiations on the Federal budget, and the Democrats are eager to return the debate to matters close to home.
"I continue to believe that the fact that the war appears to be ending quickly and decisively helps us get back to a domestic agenda," said Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "And getting back to a domestic agenda is helpful to Democrats."
Still, this war has transformed Mr. Bush. The man who spent much of the 1988 campaign fighting what his critics gleefully called the "wimp factor," the man assailed by conservatives just a few months ago for his handling of the budget negotiations, now finds himself lionized for his strength -- in many of the same quarters.
 
Democrats Long Shut Out
 His approval ratings in the high 80's match those of President Harry S. Truman in June 1945, just after the unconditional surrender of Germany. No one really expects these poll ratings to last. But when it comes to the threshold question of Presidential campaigns, "Is this candidate a credible Commander in Chief?" analysts in both parties believe that voters are certain to remember the Persian Gulf.
And the Democrats, whose Presidential candidates are likely to be members of Congress or governors and who have been shut out of the White House for 10 years, will have a far greater challenge in answering that question.
The war could also leave its imprint on the images of both parties. Some Republicans suggest, and some Democrats fear, that Mr. Bush has set the stage for a re-election campaign that draws a stark and brutal contrast between a party willing to use American force to counter aggression and a party that flinched.
"Saddam Hussein is really becoming his Willie Horton for 1992," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker, referring to the convicted murderer given a weekend furlough in the Dukakis administration; the case was used by Mr. Bush to depict Michael S. Dukakis as soft on crime. "It can become a way to shape the whole campaign."
 
A Pattern, G.O.P. Asserts
 Republican strategists assert, and clearly plan to argue in the next campaign, that the overwhelming vote by Congressional Democrats against the use of force in the gulf is only part of a devastating pattern. "People see this in the context of Jimmy Carter in Iran, of Dukakis indecisive and in the tank," said Senator Gramm, referring to an advertisement that the Bush campaign ran in 1988 showing the Democratic nominee campaigning with a tank. "They see this in the context of Democrats' inability to lead internationally."
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip and another party strategist, casts the gulf war as the decisive moment of a decadelong debate. "What you've had is Republicans saying for 10 years that force matters, strength matters, technology works and Democrats saying, 'No, you're wrong,' " Mr. Gingrich said.
Democrats, however, quickly rallied around the President after the Congressional debate ended and the war began. They are already armed with research that casts their party as critical to the development of many of the weapons that have proven so successful in the Persian Gulf. And some Democrats are trying to paint the Republicans as downright unseemly for using the war as a political issue.
"Obviously, the Republicans are going to try to make hay with it and turn it into a political circus immediately," Mr. Brown said. "I don't think the American people look at it that way."
 
Democrats' Vulnerabilities
 In terms of potential Democratic Presidential contenders, some analysts say the gulf war simply underscores the vulnerability any governor, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, on foreign policy. Since the war began, Mr. Cuomo, like other Democrats, has expressed his support for the troops and his hope that the nation can soon turn its attention to a war on domestic problems.
The potential Presidential contenders in Congress, most of whom voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf, have a different problem. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has a more complicated message now. He has long been seen as the party's "strong" Democrat on national security issues, but he also led the opposition to the resolution on the use of force, urging that economic sanctions against Iraq be given more time to work.
"Nunn's caution and hesitancy look like admirable qualities in a legislative leader but not necessarily admirable for a President," said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington. Still, Mr. Mann and others assert that Democratic primary voters are unlikely to hold such a vote against a candidate.
Senator Al Gore of Tennesse, whose 1988 campaign for the Democratic nomination emphasized his toughness on national security issues, was among the Democrats who voted for the use of force in the Persian Gulf. He has been one of the few Democrats who has tried to present himself as anything other than hunkered down since the war began.
Today, Mr. Gore was on the Cable News Network arguing that the United States and its allies should continue to prosecute the war until Mr. Hussein complies with all the United Nations resolutions.
Some Republicans suggest that all this handicapping is beside the point, that the Democratic nomination may simply be a prize not worth having in 1992. But Democrats note that economic anxiety runs deep among the voters. Gary Corbin, the Democratic chairman in Michigan, predicts that "a refocusing of attention back on economic issues will come very swiftly, particularly here in the Midwest."
Moreover, Mr. Bush has taken some wild rides in the polls before; his approval rating plummeted last fall. Still, the President emerging from the gulf war looks formidable.

HEADLINE: Foreign Banks Filling the Loan Gap

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Because so many of their American competitors have been reluctant to lend, foreign bankers have been expanding their portfolios of business loans in the United States.
"Foreign banks are providing a shock absorber for the U.S. banking system, " said Herbert L. Baer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
 Last year, while American banks held back on new loans, foreign banks in the United States expanded their portfolios of commercial and industrial loans by a robust 18 percent, according to the Federal Reserve.
In fact, lending by foreign banks is up for this year. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expanded its loan volume by a third in 1990. Allyn Keiser, Canadian Imperial's executive vice president, said that this year the bank has been seeing "significant growth in loans and loan commitments."
Most foreign banks will not be expanding in the United States at the pell-mell pace of the last few years. German banks are more anxious to open branches in Leipzig than in Los Angeles. As 1992 approaches, British banks are emphasizing the European Community, not America's East Coast. Liberalization of Tokyo's financial markets is making the home market more alluring for Japanese banks.
On top of these shifts, tougher capital requirements are forcing banks of all nations to focus more on fattening margins and less on growth for growth's sake.
And, of coure, foreign banks are responding to the recession in the United States by raising their lending standards.
Still, foreign banks, which have most of the better credit ratings, have enough capital to avoid a big retrenchment. Japanese banks are more richly capitalized than some American money center banks, said Masaru Kakutani, an analyst for Moody's Investors Service Inc. The cheaper dollar -- down 15 percent against other major currencies since last summer -- helps stretch capital allocations in foreign currencies.
Besides, most of the foreigners are in the American market for the long haul. Detlev Staecker, general manager of the Deutsche Bank in New York, said, "This is still the strongest, safest, freest market in the world."
 
Blue-Chip Customers
 That allows foreign banks to woo and win blue-chip American customers. They include some top real estate developers who a year or two ago would not return telephone calls from foreign lenders. "We're getting better credits, a customer population that we didn't have before," said Yukio Yoshida, general manager at the Bank of Tokyo in New York.
Some American companies, anxious about shaky domestic banks, are seeking safer foreign ties. "There is, of course, a flight to quality that benefits us," said Hermann Buerger, executive vice president at Commerzbank A.G.
 
Smaller Successes
 Not all the new customers are members of the Fortune 500 club. One Barclays P.L.C. subsidiary that finances receivables of midsized textile, garment and furniture makers grew by more than 15 percent last year, said Peter G. Bland, chief executive officer for the Barclays middle-market operations. Its closest American competitor, by contrast, cut lending by almost 7 percent.
Faced with greater demand, many foreign bankers are doing what sensible executives everywhere do: charging more.
"We will probably be rather tough when it comes to pricing." said Willi Wittwer, head of the American operations of the Swiss Bank Corporation. "We feel very strongly that we should be compensated better than banks of lower quality."

HEADLINE: Brady Says Banks Need Regulatory Relief Soon

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady warned today that a large taxpayer bailout would be required if Congress and the Bush Administration failed to reach agreement on an overhaul of the banking system.
Turning up the political heat in his first appearance to present the Administration's plan to resolve the banking crisis, Mr. Brady told a Congressional committee that the weakened industry and the increasing rate of failures presented "a bleak picture that demands action, prompt action." 
 Three weeks ago, Mr. Brady disclosed the Administration's ambitious plan to invigorate the banking industry. He said the plan was intended to attract fresh investments to the industry and allow it to enter new businesses by repealing banking laws written during the Depression.
 
Far-Reaching Changes
 The most important elements would allow commercial and investment banks to merge and would eliminate barriers to interstate banking. The plan would also permit industrial companies to own banks.
The plan speaks only in generalities about how to replenish the bank insurance fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and protects bank deposits up to $100,000. By some estimates, the $8.5 billion fund could be depleted by year-end as its pays out money to reimburse depositors of failed banks and to aid healthy banks in buying collapsed institutions.
"There is simply no bank insurance fund large enough to protect the taxpayer unless and until we address the underlying problems," Mr. Brady told the Senate Banking Committee. "If we leave the job half done -- if we tinker with the problem -- then we'll probably be back again, sooner or later, recapitalizing the bank insurance fund, perhaps the next time with taxpayer money."
 
Some Disagreements
 Most members of the Senate panel acknowledged the need to act this year to avert a financial disaster that could become comparable to the savings and loan debacle. Nonetheless, there was widespread disagreement over many parts of the Administration's package, although a consensus appeared to be emerging among committee members in support of the proposal to eliminate the restrictions on interstate banking.
There were strong suggestions that many other elements of the package would fall prey to the objections of large and small bankers, Wall Street, insurance companies and other sectors of the economy.
"A problem that we always face in trying to legislate in this area is that historically the Banking Committees in the House and the Senate have tended to debate a problem until the parts of the industry involved have cut their deal, and then we come in and ratify it," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.
Other elements of the plan, particularly those that would give banks more powers to expand into different lines of business or be owned by industrial enterprises, ran into persistent criticism.
 
One Senator's Objections
 "I find it difficult to believe that allowing banks to enter securities and insurance will make them more profitable," Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, told Mr. Brady. "Expanded powers and diversification for S.& L.'s in the 1980's were justified on the theory that they were needed to make them more competitive. You can surely understand why many of us feel uncomfortable when some of these same arguments are used now with respect to banks."
Criticism of the Administration's plan was somewhat muted because the Treasury Department has not sent up a bill to carry out the measures it has proposed. Mr. Brady said he was "embarrassed" that work on legislation had not yet been completed, and that it would be presented next month.
A number of lawmakers also expressed disappointment that the Treasury has decided not to propose any specific measures to replenish the faltering bank insurance fund.
Mr. Brady's approach has been to leave the fund's problems in the hands of L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman. The board of the F.D.I.C. is expected to take the first steps on Thursday toward carrying out a proposal to borrow $10 billion for the fund and pay the interest on the loan through an 18 percent increase in the premiums that banks pay the fund.

HEADLINE: The Fed Strategy to Ease Credit

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, is attempting to combat the leading threat to an economic recovery -- a shortage of credit -- with less stringent reserve requirements for banks, the prospect of relaxed accounting rules for shaky loans and lower interest rates.
"Washington is launching a frontal attack," said Richard Fredericks, a bank analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It's worked every time." 
 Mr. Fredericks echoes a consensus that is building among many economists who believe that the Fed's strategy will succeed and that banks and other lenders will supply enough credit to sustain a recovery.
The essence of Mr. Greenspan's strategy is to make lending more profitable so that banks will eventually do more of it.
 
Second-Half Rebound
 Most forecasters, while not predicting a decisive victory soon, expect enough progress to permit a modest economic rebound in the year's second half. Even the Administration's top economist, Michael J. Boskin, who has criticized the Federal Reserve for not easing money sooner, expects the economy to recover this summer.
To be sure, banks continued to tighten lending standards and fatten profit margins on loans they made this winter, a recent Federal Reserve survey showed.
Nonetheless, there is some evidence that the Federal Reserve's approach is working. Banks with stronger balance sheets are looking for borrowers, some borrowers are refinancing loans to take advantage of lower rates and the squeeze on bank profits is letting up because deposits and other funds are simply less expensive.
The money supply, which the Federal Reserve considers an indicator of bank lending trends, is rising modestly after a period of no growth, according a report last Thursday from the Fed. Indeed, money growth is back within the Federal Reserve's target range.
Small business, which has borne the brunt of the credit squeeze, is getting a little less gloomy, according to a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business. Just 6 percent of small-business owners see tight credit as the top problem facing their businesses.
Lower rates are luring customers. Although overall loan demand is weak because businesses and consumers are not spending, bankers said, borrowers are refinancing existing debt. According to a new survey by the Morgtgage Bankers' Association, for example, mortgage lenders, whose lower costs generally allow them to offer better terms than most banks, saw a surge of refinancing by homeowners in January.
More important, said James J. McDermott, president of the financial consulting firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, "strong banks are growing their loan portfolios." The assets, or loan portfolios, of some big United States banks have been shrinking, but those of many community, regional and foreign banks have been swelling.
"We're seeing a bounce up in what we've been asked to do on the credit side from existing customers," said Joe Prendergast, executive vice president of the First Wachovia Corporation, a bank based in Charlotte, N.C. "In many instances, we're interpreting that as picking up the slack from other lenders."
Stronger banks are even soliciting new business in New England, where the recession is hitting hardest. Alan Morse, chairman of the United States Trust Company, which operates two banks in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut, said, "When good credits have had trouble borrowing reasonable amounts of money, we've been interested in taking them on."
 
Three-Pronged Strategy
 The basic thinking behind Mr. Greenspan's three-pronged strategy is that as the amount required for bank reserves shrinks, the costs of financing those reserves also falls. More lenient accounting rules can bolster a bank's bottom line by reducing the amount of loan-loss reserves that banks have to charge against their income. If troubled loans are split into performing and nonperforming components -- as Federal regulators propose -- the mountain of bad loans at big banks in the Northeast will decline by as much as a fourth, according to experts.
"Funding costs have fallen relative to loan rates, and with higher profit potential, banks should be more inclined to extend credit," Mr. Greenspan testified on Capitol Hill last week.
But there are some economists who worry that the Federal Reserve has done too little, too late. David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said, "I expect the recession to last into 1992."
But Mr. Greenspan called fears that troubled banks would frustrate the Federal Reserve's efforts "exaggerated."
 
Decline in Interest Rates
 Lower interest rates will also ease pressures on bank capital. "Monetary easing will help banks in many ways. It will increase the value of securities that banks own, it will improve their capital positions, reduce the interest they pay and increase their profits," said Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Nixon Administration.
For starters, the drop of two percentage points in short-term interest rates since mid-1990 has increased the value of Treasury bills that banks hold, which account for almost a fifth of of bank assets.
Falling interest rates have also helped to lift the value of bank stocks some 50 percent since last fall. That rebound may make it possible for some banks to again tap fresh capital, said Mr. Fredericks of Montgomery Securities.
The biggest advantage from lower rates comes from fatter profit margins -- or in the industry jargon, wider "spreads." That is shorthand for the difference between the interest rates banks pay depositors for funds and the interest rates they charge borrowers. "The spreads in our business continue to widen, which helps earnings. We've seen that for the past 120 days." said John B. McCoy, chairman of the Banc One Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Lower rates will eventually offer some encouragement to borrowers. Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said, "because rates are falling at the same time that the spread is widening, banks are winners, but the economy is a winner, too."
 
More Income, Fewer Risks
 Indeed, lower rates raise borrowers' incomes. Consumers now devote nearly a fifth and corporations about a half of their incomes to servicing debt. Because the cost of servicing floating-rate debt, like business loans and adjustable-rate mortgages, is falling, "lower rates are going to start putting money into peoples' jeans," Mr. Fredericks said.
And the lower rates also reduce the risk that a given borrower will default. "Even if banks stick to most of the same quality standards, lower rates will help some weak borrowers," said James S. Duesenberry, an economist at Harvard University.
Finally, lower rates make expensive items like houses and cars better buys, helping to eventually revive the kind of spending that will play a big role in getting the economy moving again.

Theme Parks Offer Discounts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26

 BODY:
In an effort to increase attendance, MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios Hollywood said today that it would offer residents of California a $5 discount on its $22.50 admission price from March 15 to May 5.
The Walt Disney Company, which had been offering Southern California residents its own admission discount at Disneyland in Anaheim, said today that it would extend its discount one week, until March 10. The Disney discount offers $7.50 off the $27.50 admission price. 
 Attendance at many tourist attractions throughout the country has been falling since summer as recession took hold. To counteract the slump, theme park operators, airlines, hotels and other tourism industries have been offering incentives to increase business.
 Universal Studios' $5 discount on its $22.50 admission price is intended to stimulate interest in the theme park as it opens several new attractions. The new attractions, part of a $100 million expansion, include tributes to Lucille Ball and Alfred Hitchcock and a people-mover and studio center.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Denounces Radicals, Meaning Yeltsin

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 26

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused Soviet radicals today of seeking to achieve power by force and said the country could slide into civil war if their campaign was not stopped.
Mr. Gorbachev, in combative mood during a trip to the republic of Byelorussia, also called for a quick end to American military action in the Persian Gulf and said progress in superpower relations was still fragile. 
 During a grim, impassioned speech to intellectuals in the republic's capital, Minsk, the Soviet leader said the country was being torn apart by a power struggle as it entered a critical periodof introducing reforms.
In the speech, which was shown on national television, Mr. Gorbachev said the struggle "ignores the requirements of law and moral norms and destabilizes the situation in society."
"All this threatens to push us off the road of reforms onto the path of confrontation, right up to a civil war," he added.
Mr. Gorbachev's speech was aimed at a rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian federated republic, although Mr. Yeltsin's name was not mentioned. Last week, Mr. Yeltsin accused the President of deluding the Soviet people and demanded his resignation.
The Soviet leader said that failure to halt the infighting would inevitably lead to even more economic decline and the very authoritarian methods the radicals said they oppose.
"If we do not stop our economic and political failures, the fall in production could lead to very stern measures," he told the gathering. "And then from the chaos will emerge methods of dictatorship and such forms of administration."
In a separate address earlier to workers at a tractor factory in Minsk, Mr. Gorbachev accused Mr. Yeltsin of deserting perestroika, his program ofeconomic and social change.
The Soviet President referred in his speech to recent demonstrations against what is widely perceived as a sharp swing to the right in Kremlin policy.
He said the protests showed that the radicals were "pressing for power" and resorting to "neo-Bolshevik" measures.
"We therefore realize that they will fight against us from a position of psychological warfare -- calls to dissolve Parliament and force the resignation of the President," he said, frequently wagging his finger at his audience.
"We reject any seizure of power by force because this will lead to a civil war."
The Soviet leader also quoted Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the exile author whose works were banned for years inthe Soviet Union, as calling for balance in approaching critical issues.
Turning to the the United States-led military campaign against Iraq, Mr. Gorbachev said that disagreement between the two countries over arms control and violence in the Baltic republics had already strained relations.
"Stressing that Soviet-American dialogue lay at the center of normalization of the world situation," the official press agency Tass said, "Mikhail Gorbachev remarked that progress in relations between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. was still 'fragile.' "
"He called for 'responsible behavior' so that what has been achieved is not destroyed."
The Soviet President did not say what he meant by fragile. But he hinted that he would be disturbed if Washington continued the gulf war.

HEADLINE: Louisiana's New Environmental Tool: Using Taxes to Discourage Pollution

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After taking a hard look at the financial and ecological toll from industrial development, Louisiana has imposed a new rule that ties a company's environmental record to the amount of taxes on business property the company must pay.
The new policy was established in December after officials determined that some corporations were benefiting from tax exemptions while being liable for thousands of dollars in fines for pollution in a state with some of the worst chemical contamination in the country. 
 Gov. Buddy Roemer and two state agencies took the action to reduce pollution while trying to collect millions of dollars in industrial property taxes from which the same polluters had been exempted.
The new policy, which has already come under challenge in state court, is considered the most innovative step taken by any state to specifically link its tax policy with the dual goals of reducing pollution and gaining greater compliance with environmental law.
 
Pattern of Exemptions
 For 65 years, an important facet of Louisiana's policy for attracting industry was to grant them 10-year exemptions from local business-property taxes on new equipment and other capital expenditures.The exemptions came up for renewal halfway through the 10-year period.
Under the new policy, each company applying for an exemption or seeking renewal is rated on a scale according to the number of environmental violations it has been charged with, the amount of chemicals it releases into the environment and other factors. The worse a company's record, the lower the score and the smaller its tax exemption.
Industrial groups say the program is too aggressive and will drive businesses from the state. Environmental groups say that it is too weak, and that the state is in a much stronger position than it thinks to exact more taxes from some of the world's wealthiest corporations doing business in Louisiana.
It is difficult to say how much additional tax revenue the program will generate. But from 1980 through 1989, according to a study by the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice, a tax research group in Baton Rouge, corporations spent $25.8 billion on capital projects in Louisiana and were exempted from $2.6 billion in taxes. All of that money would have been spent for schools, police, and other services. In recent years, many parishes, the equivalent of counties, have been laying off teachers and cutting services because of deficits.
 
Looking for Economic Incentives
 "We weren't trying to be the first state to do this," said Vicki Arroyo, director of policy and planning at the state Department of Environmental Quality. "But in looking to other states for guidance about how to link a company's environmental record to economic incentives, we couldn't find any other program."
Ms. Arroyo added: "We found, on one hand, that we had companies with serious environmental problems liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, and on the other hand, they were getting millions of dollars of tax exemptions. That is not the message we wanted to send to industry."
In recent years, states have sought to use tax policy to achieve environmental goals. Minnesota exempts some land from property taxes to preserve marshy areas, and New York and New Hampshire reduce property taxes for wetlands that are protected from development. North Carolina charges a fee for personalized license plates to pay for acquiring undeveloped lands. Maryland has a similar program to finance environmental research on Chesapeake Bay.
Missouri designates a portion of its sales tax for environmental programs. Washington State applies part of its cigarette sales tax for curtailing pollution in Puget Sound. And many states exempt pollution control equipment from business property taxes.
But no other state has linked pollution control programs to tax penalties.
Still, the practice of granting exemptions to polluters also continues in many states. Neighboring Arkansas, which has considered trying to control pollution through tax policy, recently granted a steel company, the Nucor Corporation, an exemption from paying the 4 percent sales tax on utilities at its new plant in Hickman. Last year, another plant the company owns jointly with the Yamato Steel Company of Japan, in nearby Armorel, was fined $185,000 for numerous violations of state air quality rules.
 
Viewed as Privilege
 The Louisiana tax exemptions, overseen by the 19-member Board of Commerce and Industry, were routinely approved and companies viewed them as a right instead of a privilege, said aides to the Governor.
Under the new rule, companies will no longer be given blanket exemptions. Each company is rated on a 100-point scale of environmental factors, although each is automatically granted a minimum score of 50.
Since the rule was put into effect on Dec. 27, nine companies have been reviewed by the Department of Environmental Quality. Their scores have ranged from 67.5 to 98.
PPG Industries Inc., which received a 91.5 score, will pay roughly $3,400 more in taxes annually at its chemical plant in Lake Charles, said a company lawyer. Like the other companies, PPG was seeking the next five-year exemption on an investment of $3 million. The maximum the company could have been required to pay if an exemption was not granted was $39,000 a year.
"The feeling of the plant manager and the people in the tax department is that there really is no objection to applying environmental standards to the exemptions," said Charles C. Zatarin, a lawyer in New Orleans who represents the company. "Plants are spending lots of money for environmental improvements already. This does not look like it's going to be burdensome."
Five companies -- Conoco Inc. (score of 76), the Shell Oil Company (98), Shell Chemical (92.1), the Citgo Petroleum Corporation (67.5) and W. R. Grace & Company (80) -- are reviewing their options before they respond.
Three others -- Exxon Chemical Americas (94.7), Rubicon Inc. (78.2) and Vulcan Materials (94) -- have accepted their scores and will apply on Wednesday for tax exemptions.
If the scores stand, the nine companies may be required to spend more than $10 million in new taxes over the next five years.
A 10th company, Rollins Environmental Services Inc., which operates a commercial hazardous-waste incinerator near Baton Rouge, was denied an exemption altogether under the rule and has sued in state court. The company sought an exemption of $263,594 over the next five years, on an investment of $3.24 million.
Though reaction is mixed, business executives said the new policy could eventually discourage the building or modernizing of plants in Louisiana.
"We have strong environmental laws already," said Daniel L. Juneau, president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, the state's largest business trade group. "It's difficult, and unnecessary to take economic inducement and make it an environmental weapon."
Environmental groups argue that the rule is weak and unless it is strengthened will not significantly increase tax revenues or reduce pollution.
"You probably have the most generous public subsidies of any state, and the worst levels of human deprivation in the nation, all of which can be tied to tax policies for large corporations," said Zack Nauth, director of the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice. "The change that citizens are looking for is that some of the tremendous wealth generated in Louisiana stay in Louisiana and be invested in the overwhelming problems facing our state."
Like every state, Louisiana uses business tax breaks to encourage development. Louisiana was one of 17 states that allowed businesses to exempt certain property from taxes, but it was one of the few that excluded local communities from any say in the matter.
State officials then stood back as companies poured millions of tons of toxic chemical wastes into the air and water, leaving Louisiana's parishes with too many abandoned waste dumps to count and miles of irreparably polluted rivers and marshes.
In 1986, an article in The Tulane Law Review by Oliver A. Houck, an environmental lawyer at the university, questioned the wisdom of such a policy.
"The exemptions are, in effect, a windfall at a time when state and local revenues are down," wrote Mr. Houck. "The result is that state and local government is unable to provide, among other things, a basic level of public education. Futhermore, exemptions are handed out to the major recurring violators of the state's pollution control laws at a time when the state's cancer rate is threatening national records."
The campaign to repeal the exemption reached a peak last year when a study by the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice found that roughly $800 million in industrial tax exemptions, more than a third of the exemptions approved, did not generate any new permanent jobs.
Mr. Nauth, the tax coalition director, also reviewed state environmental records and discovered that the exempted projects produced millions of tons of toxic waste, and that companies receiving the tax breaks were routinely violating Louisiana's environmental laws. Mr. Nauth also found that one company misrepresented its environmental record on the application for an exemption. The company, Citgo, said it had not been cited for environmental violations, though it had.
Governor Roemer temporarily barred any new exemptions on Aug. 24. He was compelled, in part, by a newspaper report in Baton Rouge disclosing that the Board of Commerce and Industry was using an automatic signature machine to affix Mr. Roemer's name to exemption aprovals, a practice Mr. Roemer said was occurring without his knowledge.
Ms. Arroyo, of the Department of Environmental Quality, said the state published a proposed final rule on Feb. 20 and will hold a public hearing late next month before it issues a final rule later this year.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE IRAQI LEADER;
Saddam Hussein's Speech on the 'Withdrawal' of His Army From Kuwait

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Saddam Hussein's speech today over the Baghdad radio, as translated and distributed by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, a Federal agency, via the Federal News Service:
In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
 O great people; O stalwart men in the forces of holy war and faith, glorious men of the mother of battles; O zealous, faithful and sincere people in our glorious nations, and among all Muslims and all virtuous people in the world; O glorious Iraqi women:
In such circumstances and times, it is difficult to talk about all that which should be talked about, and it is difficult to recall all that which has to be recalled. Despite this, we have to remind of what has to be reminded of, and say part -- a principal part -- of what should be said.
We start by saying that on this day, our valiant armed forces will complete their withdrawal from Kuwait. And on this day our fight against aggression and the ranks of infidelity, joined in an ugly coalition comprising 30 countries, which officially entered war against us under the leadership of the United States of America -- our fight against them would have lasted from the first month of this year, starting with the night of 16-17 [January], until this moment in the current month, February of this year.
It was an epic duel which lasted for two months, which came to clearly confirm a lesson that God has wanted as a prelude of faith, impregnability and capability for the faithful, and a prelude of an [abyss], weakness and humiliation which God Almighty has wanted for the infidels, the criminals, the traitors, the corrupt and the deviators.
To be added to this time is the time of the military and nonmilitary duel, including the military and the economic blockade, which was imposed on Iraq and which lasted throughout 1990 until today, and until the time God Almighty wishes it to last.
Before that, the duel lasted, in other forms, for years before this period of time. It was an epic struggle between right and wrong; we have talked about this in detail on previous occasions.
 
The Age of the Showdown
 It gave depth to the age of the showdown for the year 1990, and the already elapsed part of the year 1991.
Hence, we do not forget, because we will not forget this great struggling spirit, by which men of great faith stormed the fortifications and the weapons of deception and the Croesus [Kuwaiti rulers] treachery on the honorable day of the call. They did what they did within the context of legitimate deterrence and great principled action.
All that we have gone through or decided within its circumstances, obeying God's will and choosing a position of faith and chivalry, is a record of honor, the significance of which will not be missed by the people and nation and the values of Islam and humanity.
Their days will continue to be glorious and their past and future will continue to relate the story of a faithful, jealous and patient people, who believed in the will of God and in the values and stands accepted by the Almighty for the Arab nation in its leading role and for the Islamic nation in the essentials of its true faith and how they should be.
These values -- which had their effect in all those situations, offered the sacrifices they had offered in the struggle, and symbolized the depth of the faithful character in Iraq -- will continue to leave their effects on the souls.
They will continue to reap their harvest, not only in terms of direct targets represented in the slogans of their age -- whether in the conflict between the oppressed poor and the unjust and opportunist rich, or between faith and blasphemy, or between injustice, deception and treachery on the one hand and fairness, justice, honesty and loyalty on the other -- but also the indirect targets as well.
 
Shake the Ranks of the Infidels
 This will shake the opposite ranks and cause them to collapse after everything has become clear. This will also add faith to the faithful now that the minds and eyes have been opened and the hearts are longing for what the principles, values and stances should long for and belong to.
The stage that preceded the great day of the call on 2 August 1990 had its own standards, including dealing with what is familiar and inherited during the bad times, whether on the level of relations between the ruler and the ruled, or between the leader and the people he leads.
The relations between the foreigners among the ranks of infidelity and oppression and among the region's states and the world had their own standards, effects and privileges that were created by the Arab homeland's circumstances, and which were facilitated by propaganda, which no one could expose more than it has now been exposed.
The conflict was exacerbated by the vacuum that was created by the weakness of one of the two poles that used to represent the two opposite lines in the world. However, after the second of August 1990, new concepts and standards were created.
This was preceded by a new outlook in all walks of life, in relations among peoples, relations among states, and the relations between the ruler and the ruled, and by standards of faith and positions; patriotism, pan-Arabism, and humanitarianism; holy war, faith, Islam, fear and non-fear; restlessness and tranquillity; manhood and its opposite; struggle, holy war and sacrifice, and readiness to do good things and their opposite.
When new measures spring forth and the familiar, failed, traitorous, subservient and corrupt [people], and tyrants are rejected, then the opportunity for the cultivation of the pure soil will increase in its scope, and the seeds of this plant will take root deep in the good land, primarily, the land of the Arabs, the land of the revelation and the messages, and the land of prophets.
 
Quotes From the Koran
 God says: "Like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord." [Koranic verses]
Then everything will become possible on the road of goodness and happiness that is not defiled by the feet of the invaders nor by their evil will or the corruption of the corrupt among those who have been corrupted, and who spread corruption in the land of the Arabs.
Moreover, the forces of plotting and treachery will be defeated for good. Good people and those who are distinguished by their faith and by their faithful, honorable stands of holy war will become the real leaders of the gathering of the faithful everywhere on earth, and the gathering of corruption, falsehood, hypocrisy and infidelity will be defeated and meet the vilest fate.
The earth will be inherited, at God's order, by His righteous slaves. "For the earth is God's, to give as a heritage to such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the end is best for the righteous." [Koranic verses]
When this happens, the near objectives will not only be within reach, available and possible, but also the doors will be open without any hindrance which might prevent the achievement of all the greater, remoter and more comprehensive objectives, to the Arabs, Muslims and humanity at large.
Then, also, it will be clear that the harvest does not precede the seeding, and that the threshing floor and the yield are the outcome of a successful seeding and a successful harvest.
 
Even Greater Harvest to Come
 The harvest in the mother of battles has succeeded. After we have harvested what we have harvested, the greater harvest and its yield will be in the time to come, and it will be much greater than what we have at present, in spite of what we have at present in terms of the victory, dignity and glory that was based on the sacrifices of a deep faith which is generous without any hesitation or fear.
It is by virtue of this faith that God has bestowed dignity upon the Iraqi mujahedeen, and upon all the depth of this course of holy war at the level of the Arab homeland and at the level of all those men whom God has chosen to be given the honor of allegiance, guidance and honorable position, until He declares that the conflict has stopped, or amends its directions and course and the positions in a manner which would please the faithful and increase their dignity.
O valiant Iraqi men, O glorious Iraqi women. Kuwait is part of your country and was carved from it in the past.
Circumstances today have willed that it remain in the state in which it will remain after the withdrawal of our struggling forces from it. It hurts you that this should happen.
We rejoiced on the day of the call when it was decided that Kuwait should be one of the main gates for deterring the plot and for defending all Iraq from the plotters. We say that we will remember Kuwait on the great day of the call, on the days that followed it, and in documents and events, some of which date back 70 years.
The Iraqis will remember and will not forget that on 8 August, 1990, Kuwait became part of Iraq legally, constitutionally and actually. They remember and will not forget that it remained throughout this period from 8 August 1990 and until last night, when withdrawal began, and today we will complete withdrawal of our forces, God willing.
 
Circumstances of Withdrawal
 Today certain circumstances made the Iraqi Army withdraw as a result of the ramifications which we mentioned, including the combined aggression by 30 countries. Their repugnant siege has been led in evil and aggression by the machine and the criminal entity of America and its major allies.
These malicious ranks took the depth and effectiveness of their aggressiveness not only from their aggressive premeditated intentions against Iraq, the Arab nation and Islam, but also from the position of those who were deceived by the claim of international legitimacy. Everyone will remember that the gates of Constantinople were not opened before the Muslims in the first struggling attempt, and that the international community [placed] dear Palestine's freedom and independence in oblivion.
Whatever the suspect parties try, by virtue of the sacrifices and struggle of the Palestinians and Iraqis, Palestine has returned anew to knock at the doors closed on evil.
Palestine returned to knock on those doors to force the tyrants and the traitors to a solution that would place it at the forefront of the issues that have to be resolved; a solution that would bring dignity to its people and provide better chances for better progress.
The issue of poverty and richness, fairness and unfairness, faith and infidelity, treachery and honesty and sincerity, have become titles corresponding to rare events and well-known people and trends that give priority to what is positive over what is negative, to what is sincere over what is treacherous and filthy, and to what is pure and honorable over what is corrupt, base and lowly. The confidence of the nationalists and the faithful mujahedeen and the Muslims has grown bigger than before, and great hope more and more.
Slogans have come out of their stores to strongly occupy the facades of the pan-Arab and human holy war and struggle. Therefore, victory is [great] now and in the future, God willing.
 
'Shout for Your Victory'
 Shout for victory, O brothers; shout for your victory and the victory of all honorable people, O Iraqis. You have fought 30 countries, and all the evil and the largest machine of war and destruction in the world that surrounds them. If only one of these countries threatens anyone, this threat will have a swift and direct effect on the dignity, freedom, life, or freedom of this or that country, people and nation.
The soldiers of faith have triumphed over the soldiers of wrong, O stalwart men. Your God is the one who granted your victory. You triumphed when you rejected, in the name of faith, the will of evil which the evildoers wanted to impose on you to kill the fire of faith in your hearts.
You have chosen the path which you have chosen, including the acceptance of the Soviet initiative, but those evildoers persisted in their path and methods, thinking that they can impose their will on their Iraq, as they imagined and hoped.
This hope of theirs may remain in their heads, even after we withdraw from Kuwait. Therefore, we must be cautious, and preparedness to fight must remain at the highest level.
O you valiant men; you have fought the armies of 30 states and the capabilities of an even greater number of states which supplied them with the means of aggression and support. Faith, belief, hope and determination continue to fill your chests, souls and hearts.
They have even become deeper, stronger, brighter and more deeply rooted. God is great; God is great; may the lowly be defeated.
Victory is sweet with the help of God.

HEADLINE: Concerns Are Raised Over the Long-Term Outlook for Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
For oil-importing nations like the United States, the immediate postwar outlook is highly favorable but the long-term picture is far more troubling, according to experts at a conference here on Middle East oil and security.
"Prospects are that the oil price will be relatively low, maybe quite low, in the short run," said Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now a professor of economic policy at Princeton University and chairman of James D. Wolfensohn Inc. But low prices bring rising imports, he said, and imports are growing to a worrisome level. 
 "It is one thing if our energy imports are going up, in a context of a feeling that eventually it is coming under some kind of control," Mr. Volcker said, speaking at a conference organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But it would be something else, he said, if imports rose "in what was interpreted as a rather uncontrolled kind of way, surrounded by other policies that are summed up as inflationary and ineffective," like continued high budget and trade deficits.
 
Even More Imports
 The United States imports nearly 50 percent of its oil, and that figure will probably rise to 60 percent or higher by the end of the decade, most industry experts say. By that time, according to some participants, the cost will be more than $200 billion a year.
The contrast with the short term is striking. Over all, the United States and other Western economies came through the occupation of Kuwait surprisingly well, according to many participants in the two-day conference, which began today.
"This ought to have been the mother of all crises," said Keith Hamm, managing director of the London-based Petroleum Economics Ltd., a consulting firm. But with a recession and warm weather in some consuming nations, and extra production from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the crisis was minimized, according to market watchers.
 
Hands-Off Policy
 James R. Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Energy and Defense who was chairman of the conference, said a key question for the end of the war was whether the United States, after having come to the defense of Saudi Arabia and other gulf states, would encourage its Arab allies to keep oil prices low. "The keepers of the White House economic gospel feel that any such intervention is improper," he said.
The war has so expanded world oil production that the market may ride out the next big event, the decline of the world's largest oil producer, the Soviet Union, said Arlon Tussing, an energy consultant and former economist with the Senate Energy Committee. The Soviet Union is on the verge of becoming an importer rather than an exporter because the economic problems of the country have cut its production, some experts said.
While oil wells, gathering points and shipping equipment have been damaged in Iraq and Kuwait, Mr. Hamm said, all the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing "flat out" and could continue to meet world demand for years. The other members are collectively planning expansion to 27 million barrels a day of capacity, he said, which would be about 5 million barrels a day above their current level, and that level would suffice until the end of the century.
Meanwhile, the postwar direction of American energy policy is highly uncertain, participants said. Mr. Volcker called for a stiff gasoline tax, but others called this unlikely. Richard F. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association and a retired Air Force general, recalled the condolence letters he had written to the mothers of dead servicemen, and said that there was a moral imperative to reduce the importance of imported oil.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Buzz Suspends Publication After Magazine's 3d Issue

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Buzz, a kind of West Coast Vanity Fair and one of the more ambitious magazines to start up in last year's tough economic climate, has suspended publication after three issues because it was unable to reach terms on new financing.
Eden Collinsworth, president and chief executive, said the situation was aggravated by the declining economy and the Persian Gulf war. 
 Ms. Collinsworth said advertisers had been notified that the April/May issue of the Los Angeles-based magazine would not be published. The February/March issue is now on newsstands. Ms. Collinsworth said she and the magazine's two other founders -- Susan Gates, the publisher, and Allan Mayer, the editor -- were looking for financing full time to allow them to resume publication as soon as possible.
 
News and Reviews
 Buzz featured a mix of news, gossip, fiction, restaurant reviews, reflections and commentary by journalists and writers about life in Los Angeles. The magazine, which started publication in October, had been well received by media directors and magazine critics.
Los Angeles presents a tough, competitive climate in which to publish a regional magazine. Existing magazines include Capital Cities/ABC's 30-year old Los Angeles; American Express's L. A. Style, as well as California magazine, Angeles and L. A. West.
 
Still Needs $4 Million
 Ms. Collinsworth said the magazine's business plan had called for an investment of $5 million to achieve profitability over a three-and-a-half-year period. Buzz began publication with an investment of $1 million, raised from private investors, and still needed to raise $4 million, she said.
Several major media companies had looked into the possibility of investing in or forming some kind of partnership with Buzz. Ms. Collinsworth declined to identify these companies.
"We were caught in the most awkward time to be closing financing, what with the economic climate and the gulf war," she said. "We feel as though we have been on the receiving end of cosmic forces."
The magazine, which was to have come out six times a year, had a circulation of 50,000, she said, with a target of 150,000 within five years. The most recent issue had 43 advertising pages, most of it from national advertisers. Advertisers in the last issue included Gucci, Perry Ellis and Giorgio Beverly Hills.

HEADLINE: Festival Of Arts Lowers Its Sights

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Three years after its first mammoth extravaganza drew almost as much criticism as applause, the New York International Festival of the Arts unveiled its plans yesterday for a second, more modest cultural celebration. This year's festival will run from June 8 to 23 and will feature more than 60 performing-arts events from 23 countries in 28 sites.
But the new festival will cost about $3 million less than its predecessor, it will last half as long, and it have only a third as many events as the first festival. 
 Martin E. Segal, chairman of the festival, said, "We realized it was wiser to concentrate over a shorter period of time and make a bigger impact."
He estimated that 150,000 to 175,000 tickets would be sold. "We think we'll get 300,000 in total attendance, including those who attend the many free events," he said at a press conference.
Despite concerns expressed in 1988 over the bewildering size and scattershot programming of the first festival, some of its events were critically acclaimed, including the Gate Theater Dublin's production of Sean O'Casey's "Juno and the Paycock," Leonard Bernstein's conducting of the Chicago Symphony, Barry McGovern's one-man performance of Samuel Beckett's "I'll Go On" and the revival of Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
 
Contenders for Memorability
 "We're counting on many of the new events to be just as memorable," Mr. Segal said. He says he hopes one will be on June 15 with the American premiere of "The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets," which is billed as a comedy-horror-musical. It is the latest collaboration by the director Robert Wilson, working this time with William S. Burroughs as the writer and Tom Waits as the composer.
First mounted at the Thalia Theater Company in Hamburg, Germany, the production will be sung and acted in German with simultaneous English translation, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The Brooklyn Academy will also stage the United States premieres of "A Doll's House," "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Mme. de Sade" as directed by Ingmar Bergman and presented by the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden. Performed in Swedish with simultaneous English translation, the productions will star Bibi Andersson, Erland Josephson, Peter Stormare and Pernilla Ostergren.
The festival will also present "Immigrant Voices," three nights of performances at Ellis Island. Each evening, some 800 festivalgoers will be ferried to the island for a homage to the immigrant experience in the Grand Registry Hall of the Ellis Island Museum.
The program of dramatic readings, created for the festival, will be assembled by Geoffrey C. Ward, one of the authors of the PBS television documentary and best-selling book, "The Civil War." The script, from the journals of immigrants and contemporary accounts of the Ellis Island experience, will be performed to an original musical score by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer. The actress Colleen Dewhurst will be the master of ceremonies on June 10.
 
Hailing Cole Porter
 On June 9, the 100th anniversary of Cole Porter's birth (in Peru, Ind.), Carnegie Hall will celebrate the event with a musical revue that is scheduled to include Patricia Morison, Michael Feinstein, Bobby Short, Marilyn Horne, Sammy Cahn, Alexis Smith, Lorna Luft, Leslie Uggams and Margaret Whiting.
On June 8, the festival's opening night, the dancer Gwen Verdon will be the host of the New York City debut of the Hubbard Street Dance Company from Chicago. The group, founded in 1977, was well received at the Jacob's Pillow festival in Becket, Mass., last summer.
At Town Hall, the rock musician and composer David Byrne will perform, for the first time, in the orchestral version of his score for "The Forest," directed by Mr. Wilson. Mr. Byrne will sing and yodel with an octet called New York Voices. The Orchestra of St. Luke's will accompany them.
Mr. Segal said the budget for the new festival is $5.69 million, "half of which is in direct cash subsidies to the artists to bring them to New York and promote their events when they arrive," he said. "All of the money will come from foundations and individuals. None will come from the Federal Government, the state or the city because we didn't want to compete with institutions around the city for funds. We're here to enhance local groups."
The founding sponsor of the festival, the American Express Company, has returned to help pay for the event this year, along with a group of prime sponsors, including Chase Manhatttan Bank, the Hearst Corporation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, the Shubert Foundation and the New York Times Company Foundation.
 
Learning From the First
 "The theme of the festival is tradition and innovation," Mr. Segal said. "We felt it important that the festival celebrate both traditional themes and innovative forms, and this contrast is the focus for many of the programs."
Mr. Segal said the 1988 event was "a mixed success" that generated, according to a festival financial report, $400 million for the economy of New York City. The total attendance, including free events, was 500,000, he said.
"We learned a lot from our first experience," he said. "Now we have a better idea of the kind of budgets to ask for and the kind of promotion that will be required."
The original plan was to have a festival every two years, "but we decided to take time to appraise the first festival," Mr. Segal said . The festival staff sent questionnaires to 2,300 of the 1988 ticket buyers and interviewed festival artists, board members and sponsors. "We plan to have a biennial festival in the future," he said.
Some critics took the 1988 effort to task for seeming to identify some performances as festival events even though they just happened to be occurring in the city anyway. "I dispute that we did this," Mr. Segal said , "but I can guarantee that every program this June will be specifically prepared for the festival, mounted by it or part of it in a significant way."
Festival tickets will go on sale in April. About half of the events will cost $15 or less. The top ticket price, Mr. Segal said, will be $100 for the Cole Porter evening, which will benefit the Mabel Mercer Foundation.
"However, even at this and other expensive events, there will be plenty of seats available for $35 and under," he said.
 
Some Other Highlights
 One free event, in Central Park, is to be the United States debut of Olodum, the 20-member Brazilian percussion orchestra that accompanied Paul Simon on his last album, "Rhythm of the Saints."
Other highlights of the festival include the New York debut of "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)" by the Reduced Shakespeare Company. This Los Angeles group consists of three agile, fast-talking actors who present all of Shakespeare's plays and his sonnets in a single frenetic evening. The performance includes a rap version of "Othello," and "Titus Andronicus" performed on the set of a gourmet cooking show.
More seriously, black actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theater will perform the world premiere of Stephen Rayne's production of "The Tragedy of Macbeth." The production sets "Macbeth" in Africa in the political climate of countries beset by famine and war.
 A comprehensive international program for children will feature the Mapapa Acrobats from Kenya, the Ilkom clowns from Russia and the Head a Tete company from Canada, as well as the world premieres of "Four Corners" and "Wichikapache Goes Walking," two works for children commissioned for the festival by performers from the United States.
"We're not trying to be like any other festival," Mr. Segal said. "We hope it will reflect New York's diversity and international quality." The festival's personality, he said, "isn't clearly defined, it's still emerging." He added: "It's a promising child, and we hope it can become a beautiful adult."

HEADLINE: Greek Diners, Where Anything Is Possible

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

 BODY:
IT stands like some child's sweet-tooth fantasy, a merry-go-round loaded with jumbo strawberry shortcakes, giant chocolate layer cakes, lemon meringue pies so tall they defy gravity, gooey banana cream pies, pools of coconut custard and cheesecakes as thick as bowling balls.
"This is advertising," said Jimmy Kaloidis, owner of the Georgia Diner in Elmhurst, Queens, pointing to the revolving dessert case that guards the entrance to his restaurant. 
 Indeed, when it comes to the Greek diners that have proliferated all over the East, these ubiquitous Show Off display cases, as they are called by the manufacturer, Traulsen & Company of Queens, say it all.
Both centerpiece and metaphor, the Show Off is a brash testament to the kind of a restaurant where menus are vast, everything is possible (Italian, Chinese, Jewish, you name it), everything is available and portions are grand.
"You have to satisfy everyone," said Charles Savva, who came to this country from Cyprus in 1973 and seven years later opened the Harvest Diner in Westbury, L.I., which like most diners serves everything from pancakes to lobster tails, omelettes to spaghetti, moussaka to matzoh ball soup, "famous" oversized muffins to duck a l'orange.
And, of course, what was immortalized on "Saturday Night Live."
"Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger," said Joseph Barakakos, whose family owns a company that supplies tens of thousands of pounds of ground beef and other meat to 200 diners in the New York area every year. "It was very realistic."
Estimates are that there are well over 1,000 coffee shops and diners operated by Greek immigrants in the New York metropolitan area alone, and countless others up and down the East Coast. On average they gross about $500,000 a year, say consultants in the field, although highly successful ones can gross significantly more.
Many diners look the same, with their formica tables, encyclopedia-size menus and gargantuan desserts, but behind the scenes most are independently owned; competition over menus, prices and displays is intense. "Everyone is always looking to see what the other guy is doing," said Jimmy Dontis, co-owner of the L. Dontis Produce Company in Brooklyn, which supplies produce to some 250 Greek diners and coffee shops in New York City. "When somebody puts something new on a menu it's like sending a telegram."
According to Richard J. S. Gutman, a diner consultant living in Boston and co-author of a diner history, "American Diner" (Harper/Colophon, 1981), Greeks became a visible presence in the diner and coffee shop business in the late 1950's after several waves of immigration.
They congregated largely on the East Coast, where the food service industry provided an easy economic foothold for many immigrants who were often unskilled and unable to speak English. As with immigrants from many nations, one relative would send word of opportunity back home, encouraging others to come to America.
"Why are Greeks in the diner business?" asked Peter Drakoulias, 30, whose grandfather started Empire Atlantis Supplies , one of New York's largest suppliers of paper goods and chinaware to diners. "Someone came over from Greece, worked as a counterman and then brought over his brother."
The Greek diner has become so ingrained in the daily fabric of dining, that the order "coffee to go" has become synonymous with a blue paper cup imprinted with a sketch of the Parthenon or some other Greek motif.
Still, as diners try to outdo each other, some have eliminated this "Greek" design and replaced them with cups personalized with their own names or mottos promising "fast and gorgeous service."
Signature cups are just one of the myriad ways these restaurants try in a friendly but competitive way to outdo each other.
"Some guys talk about girls," said Mr. Dontis, speaking of the single-minded competition. "These guys talk about chocolate tarts, the mousses."
He remembers the day in the 1960's, for example, when Mr. Kaloidis's brother, George, introduced a new dish, "stuffed shrimp" on his menu. No one in the diner business, he said, had ever heard of such a thing, shrimp stuffed with crabmeat.
"Now they all have it," Mr. Dontis said. "I'll never forget when croissants first came out. Sure enough, one guy told the other. Before you know it, every diner was making croissants and every one tastes the same."
The latest fad, he said, are fruit tarts topped with kiwi.
Despite appearances to the contrary, there is no one central bakery that supplies all Greek diners. But many bakers (most diners bake on their premises) use many of the same ingredients.
Many in New York, for example, buy fillings from the Mars Fudge and Fruit Company in Brooklyn, which supplies apple, cherry, strawberry and many other fillings to Greek bakers. The ubiquitous lemon meringue pie, for example, is often filled with Mars's Lemon Supreme.
"You cut the sponge thicker and put more whipped cream on it," said Charalambos Mavrides, known as "Bobby the Baker" at the Caraville Restaurant in Brooklyn, where he has baked cakes and pies for three years. "Then you put more filling. That gets it tall. You want to give more food to people so they come in again."
In this typical enactment of the American Dream, many diner workers got their start washing dishes, learning the trade until they acquired sufficient capital to open a restaurant of their own.
George Fallis, 79 years old, came to this country in 1930 at the age of 18. He got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by his father's brother. Two months later he started helping the chef, learning to prepare stews, roasts, soups and gravies. Later he became a short-order cook and after that, an apprentice to a baker, before finally opening his own business in 1940 and training others.
Mr. Savva from the Harvest Diner got his start in 1973. His mother's brothers gave him a job washing dishes at their diner, the Nautilus in Massapequa, L.I. Eventually they trained him to bake and cook and now he manages his own operation in Westbury. He is the chef, his father, Steve, greets customers and his brothers, Stavros and Savvas, work the grill.
Jimmy Kaloidis, from the Georgia, came to this country in 1955 from Sparta. He first worked as a busboy, eventually as a counterman and by 1958 had saved enough money to buy a luncheonette with several partners. In 1970 he bought his first diner and over the years has continued to buy and sell them.
When he opened the Georgia in 1979, Jimmy Carter was President. Situated on Queens Boulevard, it is one of the busiest diners in the city.
The other day at the Georgia was hectic during lunch. As customers placed orders, Timmy Bourlis, 44 years old, was busy at work in the kitchen mixing up a giant vat of tomato sauce. Mr. Bourlis, Mr. Kaloidis's head chef, typically comes in at 6 A.M. and prepares the split pea soup, the corned beef and cabbage, the barbecued chicken with mushrooms, the Irish lamb stew. Then he tackles the clam chowder and the various gravies before getting down to the business of reordering supplies.
Outside in the dining room, which with its wall-to-wall carpeting, track lighting, mirrored ceilings, skylights, brown personalized "to go" coffee cups and beige walls could be a prototype for the modern Greek diner, customers were wolfing down everything from Belgian waffles to eggplant Parmesan.
"I like eating here because you can have whatever you want," said Evan Stieglitz, a 28-year-old salesman who had just polished off a special of corned beef and cabbage, for $5.95. He said he eats at the Georgia almost every day for lunch. "When you tell them you want the toast light or dark, they make it that way."
And though stuffed grape leaves and feta remain on the menu at the Georgia, the diner has few other reminders of its Greek heritage. According to Betty and Harold Kullman, who own Kullman Industries , which manufactures prefabricated diners in Avenel, N.J., and helped build and design the Georgia, many Greeks today are trying to make their diners more "contemporary." (The Georgia does not have one Greek statue or painting of the Greek islands.)
As the American-born generation grows up, goes off to school and pursues other professions, will another group succeed the Greeks?
While no one knows for sure, perhaps the answer is no further than Oscar Urias, 21 years old, who is a recent immigrant from El Salvador. Mr. Urias started working as a baker's apprentice in Mr. Kaloidis's diner three years ago. He was there the other day, working away on a lemon meringue pie.
Perhaps, some day, he will own a diner too.

Zagat Suburban New York
The Zagat Suburban New York City Restaurant Survey has just been issued, covering 550 restaurants in New Jersey, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley in addition to Westchester and Long Island.
The survey rates restaurants based on questionnaires filled out by more than 3,000 people who dined out in the suburban regions on an average of 3.1 times a week. These diners rated four restaurants in these areas higher for food -- 28 on a scale of 30 -- than New York City diners rated any of their restaurants. The ratings were matched by only about a dozen restaurants in other parts of the country.
They are Xaviar's in Piedmont, N.Y.; Robert Henry's in New Haven; Da Pietro's in Westport, Conn., and L'Abbee in New Canaan, Conn. Sally's, a pizzeria in New Haven, was given a rating of 27 for food, making it the highest-rated pizzeria in any of the Zagat guides. The rating is comparable to those given by New Yorkers to Bouley, Lutece, Le Bernardin, Aureole, Peter Luger and Chanterelle in New York City.
According to the new guide, Mirabelle in St. James, L.I.; Fine Bouch in Centerbrook, Conn., and Harrald's in Stormville, N.Y., are also in this category. Keeping the possibility of ratings inflation in mind, this is a useful guide for those who dine in suburban areas. It provides plenty of pertinent information about the restaurants. The guide is $9.95 in bookstores.
 
Milk-Tasting
The American Institute of Wine and Food is holding a milk-tasting on March 4, 6:30 to 8:30 P.M. at the Regency Hotel, 540 Park Avenue (61st Street). Admission is $15 for members and $20 for nonmembers.
Participants will have an opportunity to sample various types of cow milk, plus goat, sheep and chocolate milks (a special herd of chocolates is being milked for the occasion). There will be a discussion of how milk is treated and recipes using milk will be available for tasting. For reservations: (212) 447-0456.
 
Ukrainian Easter Eggs
On Saturday an exhibit of decorated Ukrainian Easter eggs and holiday breads goes on display through May at the Ukranian Museum, 203 Second Avenue (13th Street). The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday, 1 to 5 P.M., except March 31 and April 7. Admission is $1 for adults, 50 cents for students and people over 65, and free for children under 6.
The museum is conducting a number of workshops and demonstrations. On March 2 and 30, from 1 to 5 P.M., there will be demonstrations of the technique of making pysanky, the Ukrainian Easter eggs in traditional patterns. Admission is $2.50 for adults, $2 for students and people over 65 and free for children under 12.
Workshops in decorating pysanky will be held on March 9, 10 and 17 from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 1:30 to 4:30 P.M. The fee is $15 for adults, $10 for students over 16 and people over 65 and free for children 12 to 16. And on March 16 and 23, from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M., there will be workshops in Ukrainian Easter traditions, including baking Easter breads. This workshop costs $10 for adults and $8.50 for students over 16 and people over 65. No one under 16 will be admitted.
Workshop reservations are necessary. Telephone: (212) 228-0110.
 
Hand-Harvested Potatoes
Variety has been the victim of the industrialized farming that has typified American agriculture over 40 years. But recently consumers have shown an increasing interest in old-fashioned produce that had all but disappeared. Farmers have responded by cultivating it.
Chris Holmes of New Penny Farm in Presque Isle, Me., grows eight kinds of potatoes, most of them impossible to find elsewhere. They are raised without chemical sprays and are harvested by hand, so they have none of the gashes that machine-harvested crops sometimes suffer. The dirt is lightly brushed from the potatoes before shipping, and since they are not washed clean, Mr. Holmes says they have a longer shelf life.
Among the varieties are yellow-fleshed Caroles and Bintjes for baking or roasting. Others are rich-tasting, starchy Irish Cobblers, moist Katahdins that make excellent mashed potatoes and low-starch red-skinned Sangres for salads.
A 10-pound sampler of four kinds is $25, including shipping east of the Mississippi. There is an extra charge for shipping to the West. Other assortments are available starting at $15. There is even a Potato of the Month Club. For information: New Penny Farm, 85 Williams Road, Presque Isle, Me. 04769; (207) 768-7551.
 
The Dutch Influence
How has traditional Dutch cooking influenced American cuisine from colonial times to the present? Peter G. Rose, a food historian, will lecture on the subject Sunday at the Queens County Farm Museum, 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, Floral Park, Queens. The lecture is free and begins at 2 P.M. For information: (718) 347-3276.
 
 
 
SEASON'S FIRST FRESH SHAD
 SHAD have been working their way up the East Coast, and as they enter river estuaries in the Carolinas to spawn, fishermen have been ready. The first fresh shad of the season is now available.
Prices are generally about $6 a pound for the fillets and $5 to $8 for a pair of roe, depending on size. Shad is usually purchased filleted; removing the tiny bones from this member of the herring family takes considerable expertise.
The roe is best lightly sauteed. The fillets are excellent baked or broiled, nicely complemented by a tangy garnish. Tart sorrel sauce is classic.

Unitas Thrown For a Loss

BYLINE: By George Vecsey

 BODY:
What with Dwight Gooden playing king-of-the-hill to challenge Roger Clemens as the highest-paid pitcher in history, for the moment, a lot of fans want to know why athletes should make so much money.
The answer is that it is better for the athletes to have the money than for the owners to keep it, and because they might as well make it while they can. 
 Besides, athletes are competitors and risk-takers: fast cars, fast skimobiles, fast planes, fast boats. The higher the salary, the higher the stakes, and the higher the chance of getting tapped out from taxes, investments, friends and family, the good life, charities, frauds, whatever.
The latest athlete to go under is Johnny Unitas, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, who filed for bankruptcy yesterday in Baltimore, citing debts of $3.5 million. Unitas apparently lost money on a business that printed circuit boards for computers, cars and telephones.
There is no indication whether Unitas thinks he was rooked by somebody, or whether he just went into the wrong business at the wrong time. Either way, it could happen to anybody. And often does.
Unitas had a wonderful arm and instincts for finding the open man. When he played for the Baltimore Colts from 1956 to 1972, finishing up in San Diego in 1973, raises were calibrated by the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousands.
Later, Unitas broadcast games on television, where he was less than scintillating. There are no guarantees that athletes, or any other performers, are prepared for the world when the spotlights go out.
I once met a guy who made a living playing the guitar as a counselor at church camps. He told the story of having had one hit record, when he was 21 years old, and losing a bunch of money before he knew what was happening. He wasn't bitter, but he was facing the rest of his life without the prospect of making much money. His advice to campers: Learn how to handle money.
The classic horror story is Joe Louis, who wound up owing money to the taxman, shaking hands in the lobby of a hotel in Las Vegas, Nev. A soccer official recently said of Diego Armando Maradona, now careening from scandal to scandal, "He's going to wind up like Joe Louis," a scary thought.
"You'd be amazed at the people we see," said Joe Garagiola, soon to be inducted into Baseball Hall of Fame for his broadcasting, not his fund-raising for indigent players.
"Not just old-timers or guys from the Negro leagues," Garagiola said. "I'm talking about guys who were making $1 million three years ago."
There are dozens, hundreds, of people like that in sports and show biz. They have a specific talent, get lucky, and the slot machine of life starts coughing up the big coin, temporarily.
When money comes in, the credit companies start sending little plastic cards, unsolicited. Well-meaning advisers say, "If you don't do something with the money, the government will take most of it." Banks are more than glad to use a dream house as collateral for the investment that will shelter the money that will protect the dream house.
It can happen fast, and not just from drugs or drink, either. It can happen with the best intentions, at the conference table of a financial planner.
 There have been stories recently that tennis stars like Gene Mayer, Ken Flach and Bob Seguso are suing old advisers. Steve Garvey recently said he was broke. And nobody will forget the crash of Tom Collins, one of the most reputable sports agents, with bright clients like Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Alex English and Terry Cummings.
Collins put his clients' money in a fund for investments in real estate, horses, oil and gold coins. At one point, Kareem demanded a million or so from the fund, and Collins tried to tell him it was a bad time, and the whole deck of cards came tumbling down. It got so bad that English had a summons served on Abdul Jabbar after their teams had played a game in Denver.
Willie Nelson recently said he had put money aside for taxes and investments, upon the advice of his financial adviser. Nevertheless, the taxman auctioned off Willie's home in Colorado and carted off his gold records and his belt buckles and his boots. He says he can't quite remember what he did with his favorite guitar.
One can only hope Johnny Unitas can't quite remember what he did with some of his trophies from the Colts. He could read defenses better than any other quarterback of his time. Nobody said it was the same skill as reading the economy.
And while fans resent the money going to the athletes, let them also think about the athletes who go bankrupt a few years later. Let the fans ask themselves if they could escape the taxman and the advice with some of their money intact. It's a different skill than hitting a receiver at 50 yards, just about as urgent, and no less difficult.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE MOOD - NEW YORK;
Not All Anger Is Toward Iraq

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
A street corner mural that once warned residents and visitors to New York's East Village to avoid drugs now implores passers-by to shun war.
Someone's response has been to splatter black paint on the red nose of the doleful clown that shares the space with the message, "Stop clowning around and bring our troops back." 
 Talk of the Persian Gulf war stirs angry feelings here.
Just where that anger is directed is as varied as the people in this neighborhood of blue-collar bars, trendy cafes, gentrified apartment buildings and a permanent colony of homeless people.
"It's all very imperialistic," said Craig Poindexter, a 29-year-old waiter at the Life Cafe. "The primitive nationalism and the rally-round-the-flag mentality disgusts me the most."
Jennifer Lewis, a patron at the Life Cafe, said she worries about the general response to the war.
"What troubles me about the mood of the country is that if you are opposed to the war, you are unpatriotic," said Ms. Lewis, an investment banker.
"People like to think they are winning," said David Bennett, an artist and Ms. Lewis's lunchtime companion. "After accepting the loss in Vietnam, it gives us the chance 20 years later to put a bright banner on our flag."
Two blocks away, Victor Alvarez spent his lunch hour in the Vazac Hall tavern, watching the Cable News Network and debating the merits of the war with anyone who would listen.
"That guy Saddam is not to be trusted," said Mr. Alvarez, a carpenter. "I say let's go into Iraq and finish them."
Tompkins Square Park, home to scores of homeless people living in makeshift tents, looms like an island in the neighborhood's sea of businesses and apartment buildings.
"It's a shame, the President ain't doing nothing," said a homeless man living in the park who would only identify himself as James.
 
Trying to Keep Warm
 An open fire provided some warmth against a light snowfall, and he fed the blaze with slats of wood salvaged from a pile of rubble outside a nearby apartment building undergoing renovation.
"He's getting our people killed for no reason," James said. "He can stop that war."
There are no flags flying, no yellow ribbons or red, white and blue bunting in this neighborhood. The mural of the sad-eyed clown is one of the few outward signs of the mood here, although the war dominates many conversations, residents said.
"The war is over oil, and it ain't worth it," said Robert Rodriguez as he and two friends, Gill Dilberc and Aileen Rodriguez, both 20, stood beneath a storefront awning to escape the snow.
"We can pay for everything else, but we can't pay for oil," said the 22-year-old Mr. Rodriguez, who is unrelated to Ms. Rodriguez.
Mr. Dilberc and Mr. Rodriguez both said they were unemployed but had given no thought to joining the military, even before the outbreak of war. But both said they would go into battle if necessary.
 
When Guns Are Quiet. . .
 There was also talk of what an end to the war will bring. "The best deal you can get is being defeated by the Americans," said Sam Hawkins, who designs recording studios.
Mr. Bennett said he feels the new mood of patriotism will be short-lived. "It's a compensation for the lack of economic and social progress," he said. "I think we're in trouble here, and the war's a distraction."
Mr. Alvarez said he is more concerned that the United States not be left "holding the bag."
"The world always passes the buck to the United States," he said. "Let's share the buck this time."

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
What Next in the Gulf?

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
With military victory seemingly days away, the U.S. and its partners have plenty of ideas for establishing long-term security in the Persian Gulf, but only now begin to advance a plausible plan. After Iraq's defeat in Kuwait, what next?
Administration officials believe no outcome is more important to peace than Saddam Hussein's removal from power, yet they flinch from paying the very high price to guarantee his departure. President Bush continues to skywrite his vision of a new world order, but even his closest aides find the scheme grandiose and remote.
 
 Other ideas like promoting democracy and playing the old balance of power game are now seeping into the public debate. They, too, seem sketchy and glib and require a closer look.
Essentially, there are four solutions for what to do once the fighting stops:
The Democracy Solution. The core idea here is that the only way to insure a peaceful Iraq is to create a democratic Iraq.
"Big democracy" thinkers toy with setting up an occupation administration along the lines of what the U.S. did in Germany and Japan after World War II. But there is no international support for such an undertaking.
"Little democracy" advocates are much more modest. Like Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post, they call upon the White House to back democracy in Iraq. But what does that mean? Is it to be a simple declaration? Fine. Do the winners bring back the Iraqi exiles, whoever they are, and what Iraqi democrats will be around to greet them?
Proponents seem purposefully vague on how to set the stage for their solution. They seem to assume that the Saddam problem will disappear and that the conquerors will fill the vacuum with beneficent influence.
 The Saddam Toppling Solution. The driving thought here is that the problem is not Iraq as such, but Saddam Hussein. Eliminate him and everything else will be easier.
 Right on, but as the Administration is now discovering, it is easier said than done. Allied forces have sent Iraqis in Kuwait into full retreat, and they have blocked the Republican Guard's path back to Baghdad.
But even if these forces surrender or are mostly disarmed, Saddam is still left with several hundred thousand armed men. The only way to defeat them is to march on Baghdad, a hornet's nest too lethal to contemplate.
 The New World Order Solution. Its essence is collective security, backed by schemes for arms control, economic development and Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
 This solution errs in trying to construct a future policy that fails to credit the uniqueness of the present situation. Washington and its allies poured their forces into the gulf this time because they were confronted with a regional power that threatened to become a global power, a country with a million men under arms bent on acquiring a nuclear capability and with the potential to dominate the world's supply of oil.
 It is almost unimaginable that the coalition would gather once again for anything less.
 The Balance of Power Solution. As Henry Kissinger writes, the key here is to strive for "an equilibrium between Iraq, Iran, Syria and other regional powers."
 The aim is attractive but the means elusive. The U.S. has little influence with these three critical countries, and little prospect of acquiring more. And for Washington to perform the necessary balancing acts with small powers like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or alone or in every instance is not realistic or desirable, as Mr. Kissinger himself ends up acknowledging.
 The U.S. does have it within its power, however, to pursue other aims -- more limited and focused, and possibly with more tangible payoffs, as the Administration reportedly seems to be realizing:
 * Don't give up on ousting Saddam. If his surrender and humiliation don't do the trick, use all influence to retain in full force the Iraqi economic sanctions. Neutralizing him is the single most important step toward stability.
 * Beat up more on the Republican Guards in Iraq, but get out of Iraq quickly. Otherwise, the Mideast could rapidly come to resemble Beirut.
 * Remove U.S. and European forces from the area fast, except for a small air and sea presence. With Saddam cut down to size, Arabs can now do their own bargaining.
 * Move immediately to start talks between Syria, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and Israel with the Palestinians. Along with strengthening Egypt and Egyptian-Israeli ties, there is no more crucial long-term goal.
 All else is gravy. Anything less could be disaster.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Yellow Fever

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
A busy ski slope in Vermont recently allowed discounts on lift tickets to anyone wearing a yellow ribbon in support of the troops. All over the country, the ribbons themselves are reported to be hot items in the shops. In one community I visited, each downtown telephone pole was looped with yellow. Across America, these days, yellow ribbons are everywhere -- not just round the old oak tree but on front porches, pickup trucks, store fronts, church doors.
This epidemic of yellow fever seems to me more than a display of the nation's undoubted patriotism, more even than a heartfelt wish for its young men and women to come home safely. It's more nearly a celebration -- not a celebration of war as war, but of the gulf war as what many Americans seem to consider a sort of national rejuvenation. 
 "After the ambiguity and humiliation of Vietnam," Prof. Gerald Linderman of the University of Michigan told Peter Applebome of The New York Times, "the gulf war seems a model of clarity and success, a war portrayed as being fought with the most efficient weapons and greatest resolve against the vilest of villains."
This is the more remarkable because before the war began on Jan. 16, much of the nation seemed unsure of its necessity; a close vote in the Senate dramatized the issue. Once combat started, however, the doubts of all but a small minority seemed to have been instantly resolved.
Instead of the long national agony over the "morality" of the war in Vietnam, Americans saw themselves this time in their chosen role -- waging a crusade for the right, against a devil figure who tortured captured U.S. pilots and blighted the Persian Gulf with oil. Instead of stalemate and defeat in the jungle, television brought them an American technological triumph of smart bombs, Patriot missiles and magnificent flying machines. Instead of ever-lengthening rows of body bags arriving from Indochina, casualties in the gulf were light and largely unseen.
Above all, this war, from its first day, was victorious; predictions of fanatic Iraqi resistance and hard fighting did not come true; and, as now appears, it was a war quickly finished, too quickly for battlefield attrition or home-front second thoughts -- "a splendid little war" indeed.
The gulf victory seems therefore to have restored Americans' pride in their military strength and their national righteousness -- missing since Vietnam -- and much of their inherent belief in their fitness and ability to lead the world. If this represents not just a renewal of damaged national confidence, but a resurgent sense that "We're Number One," and of right ought to be, it's not only misplaced; it courts new and greater disappointments.
For one thing, the gulf war will not lead to the vaunted new world order. Already fissures are showing, as they were bound to, in the needed U.S.-Soviet cooperation. Middle East politics -- for instance, the Israeli-Palestinian question -- probably are more, not less, complicated. A "pax Americana" in that or any region cannot long be asserted, even if the U.S. could pay for the forces to maintain it.
For another thing, the U.S. is not really Number One in anything but military might, which is not always usable or effective and absorbs funds vitally needed for better things. Japan and Western Europe are challenging economic powers. U.S. industrial capacity is sharply down; the U.S. competitive spirit needs hard work and sacrifice, not renewed arrogance or complacency.
For still a third thing, the gulf war has solved none of the domestic problems that existed before it began. It has not ended a recession that may or may not be brief, or improved an education system so deficient that it is providing the nation a second-rate work force that's sure to get worse. The war has not furnished medical care for the millions who don't have and can't afford it, or rebuilt an infrastructure of collapsing bridges and colliding air traffic.
Victory in the gulf has not reduced crime and drug problems so severe that the U.S. imprisons more of its citizens per capita than any other country. It has not rebuilt crumbling cities, or dealt with the nation's corrosive race problem, or paid for the multibillion savings-and-loan collapse, or insured the safety of the banking system.
And all of that will be with us still, when the yellow ribbons come down.

HEADLINE: Protectionism Is Like a Blockading Squadron;
Import Permits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Sky Above, the Slick Below" (Op-Ed, Feb. 9) describes a system of transferable permits to regulate worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. The plan, in a different form, is equally applicable to the problem of the United States trade deficit.
I believe that our chronic trade balances are the product of:
(1) A shrinking gap between world productivity and United States productivity that has made our high-wage production uncompetitive. The effect of this, welcomed apparently by the conservative-dominated administrations of the last decade, has been to reduce United States real wages by forcing our workers to compete in low-wage world markets.
(2) Trade practices by the Japanese that shelter the Japanese domestic market from internal and external competition to provide a secure break-even for Japanese companies. Most of these practices would be antitrust violations if practiced subject to our laws.
(3) Federal budget deficits that have financed the import boom and alleviated the need for foreign producers to take credit risks to finance their output to us.
The argument made by supply siders for permitting our chronic trade deficits is that any effort to restrain imports or force bilateral trade balances would inhibit competition and suppress productive forces worldwide. These arguments fail to recognize that the social costs inflicted on United States workers and our economy are not reflected in the price of the foreign goods we buy.
If we apply the example of carbon emission permits to international trade, the analogous system would take the form of a statutory declaration that a country will not, except as a conscious national policy, import more than it exports. The declaration would be enforced by issuing to all buyers of United States exports a dollar-denominated permit that would constitute a transferable license to export to the United States a like dollar amount of foreign goods and services. Countries such as Japan that maintain a highly favorable trade balance would have to buy more of our goods or purchase permits on the open market, thus increasing the price of their goods, reducing the net price of our goods in world markets and providing hard currency benefits to poorer countries that import from us.
The permits could be maintained in United States banks that could be drawn on by check or wire transfer to pay the import license over to the Government. Essentially this type of trade quota system has been functioning effectively for years to regulate apparel imports. The difference is that the quota is not based on imports from us.
The net effect of the permit system would be to establish the price that balances our excess demand for foreign goods, eliminating from our economy the social costs of chronic trade deficits. All this could be accomplished without having to concern ourselves one by one with particular offensive trade practices, without having to establish bilateral trade balances and without having to protect any industries specifically. The Administration has called for market-based approaches. How about this one?

Japanese Practices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trying to Sell Cars, by Jingo!" (editorial, Jan. 22) is a truly blind defense of free trade. Trade is rarely free in practice, and certainly not when it comes to Japan and cars.
We allow an unlimited number of autos and auto parts to be sold in the United States, while American auto and auto parts makers have been nearly locked out of the Japanese market by discriminatory business practices. The Japanese system of interlocking businesses, called "keiretsu," stifles competition and makes a mockery of free trade. And this same system of business practices appears to have been replicated in this country by Japanese auto "transplants" -- American plants making Japanese cars. 
 You state that the cars of the transplants are built largely with American parts. But the transplants claim to buy only half their parts in this country, and that may be an overestimate. Despite years of trying to obtain better data from the transplants, we have no way of knowing for sure.
From what we know, it appears that rather than buying from competitive United States parts makers, the transplants are importing parts and buying from Japanese companies now in this country. The parts the transplants buy from traditional American-owned parts makers tend to be of low value.
This situation is slowly improving, but not before hundreds of small-parts businesses have failed and thousands of Americans lost their jobs. The General Accounting Office estimates that the transplants are still costing, not creating, thousands of American jobs each year.
As you say, Japanese auto exports to the United States are well below the self-imposed ceiling of 2.3 million cars. Exports have been below this level for years. The limit is thus meaningless and only gives the false impression of a protected industry and precludes more effective action.
That this is the intended effect is confirmed by a Jan. 30, 1988, news article in which you quote Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry as saying that extension of the voluntary export restraints was a "political decision," because "there is a big difference between giving the impression that the restraints will continue and the impression that there are no restraints and auto sales might go wild."
My colleagues whom you criticize understand this fact and the challenges facing the United States auto industry. The solution to Detroit's problem is not just in Detroit, as you say. To suggest so reflects a lack of knowlege of discriminatory Japanese trade and business practices.
Only if we open our eyes to the disproportionate number of trade barriers against our products and the American jobs lost as a result can we adopt policies to preserve American jobs and strengthen our economy and the world's.

Grand Met Executive Gets New No. 2 Post

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Ian A. Martin, the Scotsman who led Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.'s 1989 acquisition of the Pillsbury Company, has been promoted to a new No. 2 job at Grand Met. He thus becomes the heir apparent to Grand Met's feisty chairman and chief executive, Allen J. G. Sheppard, who is 58 years old.
At its annual meeting in London yesterday, Grand Met announced the appointment of Mr. Martin, 56, as deputy group chief executive. Next January, Mr. Martin will return to Grand Met's home base in London, from Minneapolis, where Pillsbury has its headquarters, and assume the position of chief operating officer and group managing director of Grand Met. 
 Mr. Martin will keep his current job as chief executive of the Grand Met food sector, which includes Pillsbury, the Burger King Corporation, the Haagen-Dazs Company and Alpo Petfoods. Mr. Martin, who is trained as an accountant, has been living in the United States for five years.
A troubleshooter for Grand Met, Mr. Martin is credited with leading a turnaround at Pillsbury and Burger King. In the 1990 fiscal year, Pillbury's profits increased by more than 50 percent.
In a telephone interview from London yesterday, Mr. Martin would not say if a chief executive for Pillsbury would be named after he moved to London. "We are not prepared to speak to that right now," he said. "Obviously, somebody will have to run the show."
He did say that Grand Met was close to appointing a new executive to oversee Burger King's franchised restaurants. He said improving the relationship with franchisees was a priority this year.
When Grand Met acquired Burger King in the $5.7 billion Pillsbury acquistion, the fast-food chain was performing poorly. Franchisees were annoyed by changes in Burger King's advertising and a lack of new products.
Since the acquisition, Mr. Martin said, "we've sort of hacked our way through the jungle of problems," and have begun focusing on new products. The BK Broiler, a broiled chicken sandwich, sells more than a million sandwiches a day, analysts said, and the introduction of Paul Newman's line of salad dressings has helped double salad bar sales.
Mr. Martin said he thought that the current recession was a crisis of confidence and that the economy would bounce back quickly after the Persian Gulf war.
Next year, Mr. Martin will assume daily control of Grand Met, one of the world's largest food and drink companies. Grand Met's sales totaled more than $17 billion last year.
Grand Met also owns International Distillers and Vintners, a spirts company that owns 11 of the top 100 spirits brands, including Smirnoff vodka, J & B Scotch and Baileys Irish Cream.
The company also has said it plans a listing of its American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Former Fed Governor Named Visa President

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
How is the Visa credit-card system like the Federal Reserve? H. Robert Heller, who knows both institutions, says they have a lot in common.
Yesterday, Mr. Heller, 51, was named president of Visa U.S.A. Inc., one of five regional units of Visa International. Since 1989, he has been executive vice president of Visa International and before that was a Fed governor in Washington. 
 Mr. Heller takes a post that is being relinquished by Charles T. Russell, 61, who will continue as chief executive of Visa U.S.A. Mr. Russell is also president and chief executive of Visa International, the parent organization.
"In a way, there are a lot of similarities between Visa and the Fed," Mr. Heller said yesterday. "Both are headquarters of a large associaton of banks and financial institutions. Visa in the U.S. alone has 19,500 institutions, while the Fed has 6,000 or 7,000 banks that it supervises directly."
Another similarity, he said, is that the Fed and Visa run large-scale payment systems, Visa with credit payments from consumers and the Fed with its interbank payment system and its check-clearing operations.
"We're competitive with the Fed, also," Mr. Heller noted. "Our purpose it to try to replace the check with plastic."
Mr. Heller joined the Fed in 1986 and left in 1989 with six years to go on his term, indicating at the time that he needed a doubling or tripling of his $82,500 Fed salary. Mr. Heller said he had not regretted the decision.
The Persian Gulf war, he said, has had little effect on Visa business. "When the war broke out," he said, "there was a sharp drop in the growth rate, and it went down for the next four or five days. But then people got tired of sitting at home and went out to catch up. So it looked like a big valley at first and then sort of a mountain."
Before joining the Fed, Mr. Heller spent eight years at the Bank of America, where he was director of international economics. The bank, incidentally, once owned Visa, which is now owned by its member banks in proportion to the business they generate.
Mr. Heller was born in Cologne, Germany. He is a graduate of the University of Minnesota and holds a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley. He taught at several institutions, including the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Hawaii before joining the International Monetary Fund, where he worked from 1974 to 1978, moving on to the Bank of America.

HEADLINE: Daley Is Easy Victor in Mayoral Primary

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Mayor Richard M. Daley easily won the Democratic mayoral primary tonight with the kind of gaping margin reminiscent of the days when his father, Richard J. Daley, the longtime Mayor and Democratic boss, ruled Chicago politics.
With 93 percent of the 2,912 precincts reporting, Mr. Daley had 387,896 votes, or 64 percent. A Cook County Commissioner, Danny K. Davis, had 182,437, or 30 percent, and former Mayor Jane M. Byrne had 35,382, or 6 percent. 
 Characteristic of Chicago politics, the voting appeared to be along racial lines, according to a poll of 1,339 voters conducted for WLS-TV. Mr. Daley took 92 percent of the white vote and 11 percent of the black vote, while Mr. Davis, the black candidate, won the votes of 84 percent of blacks but only 3 percent of whites. Surveys by other news organizations showed Mr. Daley with a somewhat higher share of the black vote.
In a victory speech at a downtown hotel, Mayor Daley said, "We've proven we can have an election in Chicago without tearing our city apart."
 
Very Low Turnout
 Mr. Davis, in a concession speech late tonight, said that despite what appeared to be an especially low turnout among black voters, his campaign had unified the black electorate and that the movement begun by Mayor Harold Washington, who died in 1987, had been revived. "The movement is not dead," Mr. Davis said. "We will not fade away. We will not bite the dust. Where there is life there is hope."
The winner of the Democratic primary has won every general election since 1927, and Mr. Daley is expected to easily win his first full four-year term on April 2. Opposing him will be George S. Gottlieb, a police sergeant who took 50 percent of the 9,164 votes cast in the Republican primary, and almost certainly a candidate from the Harold Washington Party, the independent black political party established after the Mayor died.
Today's election, overshadowed by war in the Persian Gulf and voter apathy, marked one of the lowest voter turnouts in Chicago history, with the Board of Elections estimating that 700,000 people voted, or 48 percent of those registered. It was an anticlimactic end to an unusually quiet and lackluster primary season.
Mayor Daley was endorsed by both major daily newspapers and even by many black ministers and businessmen, despite many blacks' antipathy for him. The campaign's sense of "fait accompli" left his rivals grasping for ways to chip away at what has been considered a charmed administration.
 
Two Years of Unusual Calm
 Mr. Daley, 48 years old, was first elected two years ago to complete the term of Mayor Washington. The special election that followed became a grudge match between two black candidates, both claiming to be Mr. Washington's rightful heir.
The fight between Eugene Sawyer, the interim mayor, and Alderman Tim Evans fractured the black electorate, leaving fissures that still linger, and contributed to Mr. Daley's defeat of Mr. Sawyer in the 1989 primary and of Mr. Evans in the general election that year. It was one of the most racially polarized elections in the city's history, with Mr. Daley winning just 7 percent of the black vote.
Mr. Daley, a former Cook County State's Attorney, has presided over an uncharacteristic calm. He has benefited from a healthy economy and cooperative City Council, made the most of his "average-guy" demeanor, surrounded himself with shrewd advisors and generally avoided controversy.
He has formed a potent coalition of white ethnic voters, Hispanics and the pivotal lakefront liberals who had backed Mayor Washington. But at stake in today's election was the uncertain role and allegiances of the black electorate. With white and Hispanic voters solidly backing Mr. Daley, his most vociferous critics have been among blacks who view him as an exclusionary "Son of Boss." His father, who died in 1976, presided over the city as Mayor as well as the Cook County Democratic machine for two decades.
 
Eye on the Black Vote
 Blacks slightly outnumber whites in the city and are expected to be the majority of voters by the mid-1990's. So the direction black voters took today was considered a crucial indicator of the city's political future.
A Daley win of 20 percent or more of the black electorate in the election today would be seen as a signal of deep divisions in the black electorate and assurance of a long tenure for Mr. Daley. Had a high black voter turnout helped Mr. Davis attain at least 40 percent of the total vote, it would have been a clearer signal that wounds had healed since Mr. Washington's death and that a black candidate could pose a formidable threat to Mr. Daley in 1995.
Regardless of the degree of support from black voters, Daley critics are predicting the Mayor will discard his caution after the election in April and resurrect overt patronage politics.
"He has bided his time," said Lu Palmer, a black political organizer and radio talk show host. "He has been reasonably fair, thinking he would need some black votes to win. But the next four years, he's going to swing the ax. A lot of us have been talking jokingly about getting out of town."

Now It's Sandberg Playing Money Game

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MESA, Ariz., Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Chicago Cubs, whose uncharacteristic off-season expenditures have elevated them to the contending status of the Mets, have also, like the Mets, developed a contract-extension problem with one of their star players.
 Ryne Sandberg's agent, Jim Turner, returned home to St. Louis today after failing Monday to resolve their differences with the Cubs. 
 "It's not a good sign, not at this point," Sandberg said, waiting to take his turn in the batting cage at the Cubs' camp three days before he is scheduled to begin working out. "They're using Gwynn; we're using Canseco."
 
Reflection of Escalation

 Translation: The Cubs are offering the kind of extension the San Diego Padres recently gave Tony Gwynn, $12.25 million for three years, an average of $4,083,333 a year, but Sandberg thinks the numbers in the last three years of Jose Canseco's $23.5 million contract, an average of $5.23 million a year, would come closer to an appropriate package.
 The talks between the Cubs and their perennial All-Star second baseman epitomize one of the developments created by the winter escalation in player salaries. Star-level players with existing but suddenly economically outdated contracts and their clubs are debating extensions that would boost the players onto the plateau of baseball's nouveau riche.
 Some players, such as the Mets' Dwight Gooden, shoot for extensions with one year left on their contracts. Others, such as Sandberg and Gwynn, negotiate when they have two more years.
 
Distraction to Be Avoided
 "It all goes back to the fact that they came to us a few times during the season last year and wanted to do something," Sandberg said, explaining the derivation of the current talks. "We're just following up on that."
 In the case of both the Mets and the Cubs, the talks threaten to create more animosity and greater distraction than anyone really wants entering a season when the teams are expected to compete with each other for a division championship.

 
Long-Range Plans

 Sandberg himself has dabbled in deadline talk.
 "I'm being advised by my people that if it gets down to one year I'd be better off to take it all the way to free agency," he said today. He also said he did not want to negotiate past Friday because he didn't want the talks to distract him during the season.
 In other words, if the Cubs don't agree on an extension by Friday, Sandberg would proceed with long-range plans to become a free agent after the 1992 season because he wouldn't talk about a contract during the season and once they reach the end of the 1991 season, he would be "down to one year." So it goes when players or their agents set deadlines and threaten long-range free agency.
 
Frey Isn't Worried Now
 "I'm not going to worry about deadlines right now," Jim Frey, the Cubs' general manager, said. "We're working on it."
 Including the option for next year, which the Cubs will certainly exercise, Sandberg is in the middle year of a three-year, $6.3 million contract. He signed it in April 1989, when he was beginning the last year of a six-year package that made him grossly underpaid at a total of $3.97 million. Like Gwynn, he always has lagged behind the top money-makers.
 "That has nothing to do with anything," Sandberg said of the six-year contract he signed in February 1984. "I've been happy. I had security, which is what I wanted."
 
Extensions for Gwynn
 Gwynn, San Diego's star right fielder, fell behind as soon as he signed a six-year contract in November 1984, for $4.5 million. The Padres subsquently amended the contract in March 1987, adding award bonuses; ammended it again in February 1988, giving him an additional $500,000; gave him a two-year extension in December 1988, for $4,325,000, and then last Friday gave him another extension, this one for three years and $12.25 million.
 It is the most recent extension that Sandberg said the Cubs were using in their negotiations with him. But Sandberg, who last season batted .306, hit 40 home runs and drove in 100 runs, wants to be paid like Canseco.
 "I told them all along I don't want this to drag into spring training and the season," Sandberg said. "I don't want it to be a distraction. It's not going to be. But that's why we're trying to get it done by Friday. If it's not, I have two years left. I won't worry about it."

DATELINE: MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica, Feb. 25

 BODY:
As a glance down any of the nearly empty beaches here attests, these are difficult times for the islands of the Caribbean.
The region's all-important tourism industry has been left reeling by a dramatic decrease in travel by Americans from causes as diverse as the Persian Gulf war, a global recession and a relatively mild winter in the northeastern United States. 
 Workers in travel-related businesses have been laid off or placed on rotating shifts and airlines have slashed faresand concocted other incentives to generate business. Hotel operators, all but writing off the peak winter season, are pinning their hopes on a healthier spring and summer.
"The past couple of weeks we've been at around 60 percent occupancy, and I suspect the major factor is the war," said Kent Lawrence, a reception desk clerk at the 480-room Wyndham Rose Hall hotel in Montego Bay, Jamaica's largest tourism town. "Normally this time of year we have a lot of groups passing through and we're at 90 percent occupancy or more. It's usually hard to get a room."
The story is much the same throughout the region, with the number of hotel guests tumbling from levels that ranged from near-normal to full through early January to disturbingly low occupancy rates with the approach of war. Last week, in a sweeping cost-cutting measure, the 411-room Nassau Beach Resort Club in the Bahamas announced the dismissal of 122 employees.
"We were full from Dec. 24 through Jan. 4," said Lee Issa, owner of the 130-room Swept Away resort in Negril, Jamaica. "We didn't have a room available for that period, then away went our momentum."
The Caribbean Tourism Organization in Barbados, a regional travel industry group, said that preliminary estimates based on vacation bookings in North America suggested that this year's peak season, which runs through late March, would see an overall decline of 15 percent or more in the region's tourism trade compared with last year, when visitor records were broken in several islands.
"We've already had a ho-hum January and a slow February, and the lack of forward bookings suggests that March will be much worse than February," said Arley Sobers, the organization's director of research.
He said that major tourism markets like Jamaica and the Bahamas, while they are suffering serious declines, may have been spared the worst of the slump because of their proximity to the United States, by far the region's mostimportant market.
Trade experts say that more distant destinations in the Leeward and Windward chains, places like Barbados, Antigua and St. Lucia, would most likely be even harder hit.
Airlines that fly to the region, while declining to give passenger data for competitive reasons, also say they are suffering a serious slump. "The Caribbean and Europe are the two areas where we have been hit pretty hard," said Lise Olson, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, the region's largest carrier.
The slump has prompted many airlines, including American, to offer steep discounts and other travel incentives.
A spokeswoman for Pan Am, Elizabeth Hlinko, said that in some markets, particularly the United States VirginIslands, the reduced fares had led to a sizable increase in bookings for March.
Many Americans who went through with their vacation plans despite the war said that they wrestled with guilt about relaxing on the beach while United States soldiers fought in the desert more than concerns for their own security in deciding whether or not to leave home.
"We thought if it was going to be a terribly bloody war, then just from an ethical point of view we wouldn't feel right being on vacation," said George Adams, a 32-year-old Chicagoan who arrived here with his wife, Faye, on Sunday. Mr. Adams said the two made their decision to go ahead with their plans after following early reports of successes in the ground campaign.

HEADLINE: Woolworth Net Slips 15%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings fell 15 percent as consumers cut spending in response to the recession and the Persian Gulf crisis.
Woolworth said it earned $149 million, or $1.15 a share, in the quarter that ended on Jan. 26, down from $175 million, or $1.37 a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues rose 9.6 percent, to $3.06 billion from nearly $2.8 billion. 
 Woolworth's chairman, Harold E. Sells, attributed the slide in profits to recessions in the United States, Canada and Australia. The retailer earns a significant amount from overseas operations.
Mr. Sells said consumer concerns about the Persian Gulf crisis also hurt sales. Most retailers, whose business was already hurt by shoppers' worries about the weakening economy, suffered a further slump after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The problems took their toll on Woolworth's full-year results. The company earned $317 million, or $2.45 a share, down 3.6 percent from $329 million, or $2.56 a share, in the previous year. Revenues rose 11 percent, to $9.79 billion from $8.82 billion.
The company said profits were also hurt by accounting provisions.
Besides its Woolworth stores, the company owns specialty stores including Kinney shoe stores and Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker athletic wear stores.
The company's stock dropped $1.25 a share yesterday, to $33.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Leipzig, the City of Bach, Falls on Hard Times

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany

 BODY:
The churches here run several hospitals, but Johannes Richter, pastor of the renowned Thomaskirche, the workplace of Johann Sebastian Bach, says he has "no idea how to finance them in the future."
Leipzig's Lord Mayor, Hinrich Lehmann-Grube, has told his administration to draw up emergency plans to delay the payment of municipal salaries by two weeks, shorten hours in most city agencies and eliminate or curtail services in others, unless the Government in Bonn comes up withstopgap financing. 
 Mr. Lehmann-Grube, 58 years old, who was Mayor of Hanover, in western Germany, before coming to Leipzig, received a visitor in the imposing town hall whose badly worn roof was getting its first hasty repair in decades. Other urgent work must await rosier times, he said apologetically.
The financial crisis in eastern Germany's cities means that cuts in social services, education and recreation expenditures are being considered. Debt is projeced to run high and economic prospects are poor.
Last month, postal workers struck for more pay, and the phone system inSaxony, the state where Leipzig lies, is so bad that national Government officials can only maintain contact with superiors in Bonn by faxing messages.
The outlook is not entirely bleak. Some big investment projects are under way, and Bonn agreed this week to a major overhaul of its assistance program for formerly Communist eastern Germany.
But with unemployment lists swelling, and the collapsing economy cutting into the city's income, Mr. Lehmann-Grube expects a gap as large as $89 million between income and what the city wants to spend in 1991.
"With that, our collapse is programmed in advance," he said.
Such deficits are not unusual in cities where old assumptions about social benefits are colliding with lost markets and reduced competitiveness in basic industries.
 
Protest and Some Realizations
 But the mounting difficulties were brought home to many Germans early this month when more than 500 mayors and other city officials marched to Dresden, Saxony's capital. Some called for abolition of the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatizing eastern Germany's formerly Communist industries.
Western German television viewers, who have become inured to reports from the United States of insensitivity to unemployment and the homeless, have recently heard the same kind ofreports from Saxony. A 72-year-old woman who lives alone was asked what would happen if the subsidies that keep her rent to about $30 a month were cut. "That would be awful," she said. "Where would I go?"
Yet in cities like Leipzig, that kind of rent subsidy must indeed go if investment is to begin on rebuilding a dilapidated housing base.
Leipzig, a drab industrial city of 556,000, is in a particularly difficult situation because it is fighting to reverse a collapse of its industrial base, something that is stemming the flow of tax revenue. After deliveries of cheaper, better-quality goods from western Germany drove small consumer-goods manufacturers out of business, the disappearance of large Soviet contracts to the city's heavy industries has inflicted further pain.Already, 700 workers at a subsidiary that made tank treads have been let go, and about two-thirds of the remaining workers are on shortened hours.
Michael Kinze, the spokesman for Saxony's state government, says a drain on good city managers, who are deserting government for lucrative jobs in private business or the West, creates bureaucratic roadblocks to private investment.
The complex treaty that binds eastern and western Germany limits wages in public employment in the east to 38 percent of western scales. He said banks and insurance companies are now paying their eastern German employees only 60 to 70 percent of the wages for workers in western Germany, adding, "Why should I stay here for 1,500 marks a month, when I can get 5,000 to 6,000 in Hamburg or Cologne?"

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Postwar Politics;
Kuwait Says Borders Disputed By Hussein Are Not Negotiable

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Kuwait's foreign minister was quoted today as saying that his country would never negotiate border and oil-rights claims with Iraq, even if President Saddam Hussein were forced from power.
Such negotiations were called for in United Nations resolution 660, the same one that ordered Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait. Baghdad has been saying for the last 12 days it will honor the resolution. 
 But apparently the Iraqi acceptance is not good enough for the Kuwaiti leadership now that it is on the verge of regaining its territory and authority. It also, without giving a figure, has renewed its insistence on Iraqi reparations, a demand Iraq agreed to today.
In an interview that appeared today in an Egyptian political review, Al Musawar, Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait dismissed any thought that his country had a territorial issue to discuss with Iraq once the war ends.
 
'There Are No Border Problems'
 "Negotiate on what?" he said. "There are no border problems because there is no change in the border in the first place. We had agreements on that, and we want these agreements to be enforced. We do not ask for more than our right."
"I would like to stress," Sheik Sabah added, "that there will be no negotiations between us and the current regime or any Iraqi regime, either now or in the future."
Through weeks of prelude to its invasion of Kuwait last Aug. 2, Iraq had accused the emirate of undermining its economy by pumping too much oil, and at the same time Iraq renewed long standing claims to Kuwaiti territory, including an oil field that straddles their common border but lies largely in Iraq. Discussions between the countries to resolve the disputes broke up in Saudi Arabia less than 24 hours before Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait.
On the day of the invasion, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 660, the first of 12 resolutions on the Persian Gulf crisis, demanding an immediate and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal. But it also asked both countries "to begin immediately intensive negotiations for the resolution of their differences."
 In the interview today, Sheik Sabah said that "the border problems are claims by Iraq alone." He said it would be necessary for the Middle East to accept a continued "foreign presence," meaning American troops.

Business Summit Maps a New Era For L.I. Economy

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A Moscow summit planned for earlier this month was canceled, but one was convened in Woodbury, L.I., that represented a potential victory for collective security and a triumph over balkanization.
"Nobody kicked the tent pole over," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, a business coalition that coordinated the economic summit. 
 Mr. Larocca's tent metaphor was meant to conjure up visions of a revival meeting rather than a circus. That the tent remained intact is noteworthy because of the number of people under it and their agenda for a changing region.
At the summit, Long Islanders representing government and scores of business, civic, labor and education groups endorsed regional economic goals, including a proposal advanced last month by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo: creation of a public authority to promote regional economic growth.
The authority would be a subsidiary of the state's Urban Development Corporation. It would be modeled on a similar vehicle for economic development in western New York, but with a major difference: the upstate version was established to jump-start a local economy that had already conked out; Long Island's would be largely pre-emptive, to revive its sputtering economy.
 Population growth has also all but stalled. The 1990 census found that a minuscule increase in Suffolk County's population and a comparable loss in Nassau's had barely nudged Long Island's population upward since 1980. Four of every five Long Island workers hold jobs on the Island, rather than commute to New York City.
"We are still quite healthy," Mr. Larocca said of the Island's economy, "but we're concerned about the direction. This agreement is a real measure of both the concern that's out there and a recognition that pro-active economic development has to cross local jurisdictional lines."
On Long Island, the lines of two counties and more than 800 local governments and taxing districts form overlapping grids. The proposed regional development authority is supposed to bridge provincial priorities. Its goals would be to promote exports, attract investment and rebuild the image of a congested region whose economic engine no longer seems to be operating on all cylinders.
"Most of the country still thinks of the Long Island Expressway as the world's longest parking lot," Mr. Larocca said. "That distinction now belongs to I-95 in Florida's Dade and Broward Counties or to the Hollywood Freeway."
Besides congestion, another perceived liabilty has been Long Island's waste disposal, though Mr. Larocca maintained that "garbage is being addressed reasonably well, at least in parts of the Island."
Another byproduct of the Feb. 6 economic summit was the establishment of a permanent forum that will meet periodically to reconcile conflicts between economic development and environmental concerns.
Participants in the summit also recommended redressing an imbalance between tax payments sent to Albany by Long Islanders and state services received in return -- an imbalance that Mr. Larocca said had been widening while the Island's ability to sustain tax revenue to the state had been declining.
"Nobody had the belief it should be dollar for dollar -- and there are some things, like prisons, where we don't get our share and don't want it," Mr. Larocca said. "But there is concern that in some categories the gap has been growing."
(Earlier this year Mr. Larocca had pressed his counterparts on the Business Council of New York State to suggest timely alternatives to the Governor's tax proposals -- "we've been busy trying to wag the dog," he said.)
Summit participants endorsed other proposals: that school districts join in cooperative purchasing agreements; that schools more broadly define their mission and provide space for day care and other social services; that Calverton Airport's cargo capacity be expanded; and even that dormant proposals for a bridge across Long Island Sound be revived.
Once the summit's proposals have been chewed on, then what? Many have been offered before. Will they be any easier to swallow this time? Maybe. The sheer tenaciousness of Mr. Larocca, a former state official and for five years president of the Long Island Association, has become a force to reckon with. Also, summit participants shared a common goal of reinvigorating the sluggish economy.
And, perhaps more fundamentally, the fact that Mr. Larocca's metaphorical tent remained standing suggested a tentative truce among some competing groups and the emergence of a regional perspective.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Concern About the Recession Grows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar posted another uneven performance yesterday in a session that traders said was dominated by technical factors and fears that a Persian Gulf victory might not lift the United States out of its economic slump.
Gold was higher. In New York, the contract for March delivery settled at $361.70 an ounce, up $2.70 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank quoted a bid price of $360.80, up $2.85. 
 The winding down of the Persian Gulf war was leading to a flurry of selling in a number of currencies by traders trying to unload speculative positions taken before the ground fighting began last weekend.
This is yielding mixed results for the dollar. Traders said the United States currency was buoyed initially against the British pound after the Bank of England signaled the lowering of a key interest rate to 13 percent from 13.5 percent. It was that central bank's second easing in two weeks.
But Ronald Holzer, chief dealer for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said the dollar's rise against sterling was muted by the British currency's strength against the German mark and a flurry of other trading that helped the Japanese yen and hurt the Swiss franc.
 
Second Thoughts on Economy
 The dollar was undermined by traders having second thoughts about the potential benefit of the war's end on the sagging United States economy.
Thomas Palladino, a currency trader for Oesterreichische Landerbank in New York, said European traders were particularly concerned that Kuwait's foreign debt could balloon as it rebuilds.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9155, from $1.9215 late Tuesday. The dollar also strengthened against the pound in New York, with sterling fetching $1.9177, compared with $1.9194 late Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.27 yen, to 132.80 yen. Later in London it was quoted at 132.25 yen, and in New York at 132.25 yen, down from late Tuesday's 132.94 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, were: 1.5225 German marks, down from 1.5234; 1.3163 Swiss francs, up from 1.3070; 5.1780 French francs, up from 5.1775; 1,137.75 Italian lire, down from 1,138.25, and 1.1515 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1521.

HEADLINE: U.S. Management Program for East Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced today that it would sponsor American-style management training and instruction in market economics for East European countries over a three-year period.
The program envisages televised instructional programs, training seminars for managers and instruction for university students and teachers. 
 John E. Robson, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, introduced the program at the opening of a conference of 200 American business leaders and educators and top-level economic officials from six East European countries.
The Administration has budgeted $14 million for the programs and expects the private sector to contribute more, Mr. Robson said. The effort is being coordinated by the Treasury and State Departments and the Council of Economic Advisers with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia.
President Bush took a few minutes off this morning from the Persian Gulf war to open the two-day conference at the White House. "I have not lost interest; we have not lost interest in what's going on in Eastern Europe," he said. Mr. Bush said he had spoken with President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia on Tuesday by telephone and conveyed this message to him.
Mr. Robson outlined the four goals of the program:
*Provide television programs that explain the workings of a free market economy.
*Train or retrain 50,000 managers, workers and entrepreneurs.
*Educate 10,000 college students in the fundamentals of management and economics.
*Train 200 teachers in management and economics.
The visitors from Eastern Europe included Vice President Zivko Pregl of Yugoslavia; Deputy Prime Minister Georgi Pirinski of Bulgaria, and Eugen Dijmarescu, Minister for Economic Orientation of Romania. All are trained economists in their 40's.

Oil Prices Continue to Rise As Focus Turns to Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rose yesterday as traders began to look beyond the Persian Gulf war and envision a world without the petroleum glut that some experts have been predicting.
Crude oil for delivery in April settled at $18.86 a barrel, up 49 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the third straight session in which oil moved higher. The price is now 95 cents a barrel higher since the ground war with Iraq began over the weekend. 
 Traders were focusing on shrinking United States oil supplies and pending attempts by OPEC nations to reduce production, which is now outstripping demand.
"There's enough uncertainty on whether they'll cut production to cause some buying here," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is now pumping more oil than before the crisis, even though crude from Iraq and Kuwait has been boycotted by the United Nations and taken out of the global market. Many analysts have predicted the world will be awash in oil as the crisis ends and Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil once again becomes available.
But an OPEC meeting scheduled for next month could lead to new quotas for the organization's members, and oil traders were also thinking yesterday that it would be quite some time before the return of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
Oil prices opened higher from the outset yesterday on a report issued the night before by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed the nation's supplies of crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil had fallen during the previous week.
Demand for oil appears to be on the rise now that the war seems to be almost over, and many purchasers find themselves holding less oil and products than they had at this time last year.
"I think there's going to be a feeling that they're going to go ahead and rebuild stocks," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. "We've seen a watershed type of period where all the bearish fundamentals associated with the end of the war are gone, and now the market is moving into a new stage."
Refined petroleum products were also higher yesterday. Unleaded gasoline for delivery in March rose 3.25 cents a gallon, settling at 67.20 cents. Home heating oil for delivery in March settled at 64.41 cents a gallon, up 0.68 cent.
Natural gas for delivery in April closed at $1.356, up 0.1 cent for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The Royal Family;
Kuwait's Joy Tempered By Rift Over Absolutism

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, is poised to return to his homeland after almost seven months of Iraqi occupation. But how much power the Sabah family should have and how they should rule are already in fierce dispute.
The Kuwaiti leadership yesterday issued a decree from Taif, Saudi Arabia, the seat of their government in exile, formally declaring three months of martial law. 
 It also put the Crown Prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who serves as Prime Minister, in charge of the temporary government. And it gave him many other responsibilities, including coordinating Kuwaiti armed forces with the Saudi and American troops that ousted the Iraqis from Kuwait on Tuesday.
The Crown Prince has increasingly overshadowed the Emir, who is said by both admirers and detractors to be so deeply distressed at the seizure and occupation of his country that he has trouble functioning.
 
Disagreement Evident
 While virtually all Kuwaitis support the restitution of the former government and greet its prospective return with relief approaching euphoria, there is discontent among the 450,000 Kuwaitis in exile and the 250,000 who remain under occupation.
A wide range of critics, most of whom spoke at this delicate moment on the condition that they not be identified, expressed anger and dissatisfaction with how the Sabah family managed the country's domestic and foreign affairs before the Iraqi invasion. As the occupation dragged on, Kuwaiti opposition figures maintained, the Sabahs, rather than sharing power, monopolized major government posts in exile and further concentrated power in their own hands.
Kuwaiti officials vehemently deny these assertions.
On Tuesday and Wednesday in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, angry debate erupted at a meeting of government and opposition figures over demands by the opposition that martial law be declared not by the government in exile, but by a new emergency national-unity government. This new administration, they argued, would reflect divergent political perspectives.
Government officials countered that a national-unity government made no sense when much security work was required to weed out Iraqi infiltrators remaining in Kuwait, screen all foreigners there, re-establish order, and readmit Kuwaitis to their country after basic services were re-established.
 
'Does Not Bode Well'
 The first meeting broke up without resolution, a participant said, as Crown Prince Saad left the gathering to begin preparations for his return to Kuwait. Later that day, the Emir, the country's ruler, signed the martial-law decree.
"This beginning does not bode well for the future," said a leading opposition figure who asked not to be identified. "The Crown Prince actually sent a man who fled on the first day and left his troops without orders to raise the Kuwaiti flag once more in our city."
"We need a clean, strong government, not the old guards, and we need to pick a date for new elections," said Ahmed al-Rabai, a leading opposition figure, in a telephone interview from the United Arab Emirates.
Last October in Jidda, the Kuwaiti exile authorities, under pressure from opposition groups, agreed at a meeting of 1,200 people to demands for greater democratization. Crown Prince Saad pledged that Kuwait, once regained, would carry out the terms of the country's 1962 Constitution, which provided for elections and a parliament. But he refused then or in subsequent interviews to say when this would occur.
Faisal Jaffar, a Kuwaiti businessman in the United Arab Emirates, articulated the concerns shared by many of his compatriots:
"We think you need martial law for a period," he said, "and we don't call for the overthrow of the emir, so we're not really opposition. The old Government brought us to the state of occupation. We had no treaties to protect us. Some 75 percent of the soldiers were not at their post on Aug. 2."
 
Society Based More on Merit
 "Things can't go on as they did before," he continued. "A silent majority believes we need new professional government officials, reward by merit rather than family or religious or tribal connections, a reorientation of the relationship between the governors and the governed, and we need new elections."
Advocates of democracy said today that Kuwaitis in the capital had already taken over a building that was used as an Iraqi headquarters, saying they would not accept any order from the returning government. This report could not be independently confirmed.
Restoring the government of Kuwait will be no easy task, with Kuwaitis wracked by dissent. Some Kuwaiti women have been pressing for the right to vote and serve in Parliament, which will almost certainly be opposed by religious factions.
"Kuwaiti women played a key role in liberating our country, and because of that I'm sure we will get our voting rights," said Angie al-Salem, an engineer and chairwoman of the Washington-based Women for a Free Kuwait.
Even in the normally discreet corridors of high finance, there is dissension. For weeks, a power struggle has raged within the powerful Kuwait Investment Office, temporarily based in London, which handles about $30 billion of overseas assets, and the Kuwait Investment Authority, the umbrella organization that supervises Kuwaiti investment. Some accuse Sheik Ali Khalifa, the Finance Minister and another member of the ruling family, of trying to dominate Kuwait's investment decisions personally, assertions that his supporters deny.
 
Plea for Unity
 Fawzi H. al-Sultan, an executive director of the World Bank and adviser to the Kuwaiti authorities, argued that "the most important thing in this first phase of liberation is national unity."
"We're all in favor of implementing our Constitution," he said. "The issue is when."
He also said most Kuwaitis felt that those who had remained under occupation would be "entitled to set the agenda."
Mr. Sultan, who drew up economic recommendations for the next government, has called for streamlining private business and government services and getting the government out of some state-subsidized heavy industry built in the 1960's. His group also recommended reducing the population of Kuwait from 2.1 million before the war to about 1.5 million, a move that would mean fewer foreign workers.
Many Palestinians in Kuwait fear that they will be expelled because some in Kuwait and the majority outside sympathized with Saddam Hussein. But Mr. Sultan said, "Only those who collaborated are in any danger."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF;
Japan Is Wary Of Kuwait Role

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
With Kuwait's ruins still smoldering, officials and politicians have warned Japan's leading industrial giants not to be seen as economic invaders trying to grab major reconstruction contracts.
The Government officials and politicians are clearly concerned about further damage to Japan's world status after its seemingly aloof attitude toward the gulf crisis.
The Government has committed $13 billion in aid to the region and the coalition forces, though less than $4 billion has been paid out. That pledge came after a long national debate that Japan's "peace constitution" prohibited it from sending armed forces to join the allies fighting Iraq.
Though the Bush Administration has publicly supported Japan's contributions, there has been heavy criticism in Congress and elsewhere that Japan's donations were grudging and that the country was not willing to act on the broader international role that it so often says it sees for itself.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: G.I. Benefits;
Senate Panel Supports Proposals For More Tax Breaks for Troops

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Members of the Senate Finance Committee voiced support today for additional tax relief and other economic benefits for military personnel serving in the Persian Gulf war but ran into some skepticism from the Bush Administration.
A Treasury Department spokesman said the Administration opposed some proposals and would support some others only if Congress came up with additional revenues to offset losses stemming from tax breaks. 
 Testifying before the Finance Committee, Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, said he had introduced legislation that would increase to $2,000 a month, from $500, the amount of pay exempt from taxes for officers serving in the gulf.
Last month, President Bush put into effect a provision of the tax code that exempted from taxes all pay of enlisted personnel and $500 a month of officers' pay. Senator Glenn said inflation since that provision was adopted in 1965 required that the limit be raised to $2,000 a month.
 
Other Benefits Proposed
 Senator Glenn also urged support for another bill he has introduced that would increase unemployment compensation for a discharged service man or woman to 26 weeks, from 13. The proposed legislation would give members of the armed forces the same benefits that unemployed civilian workers get.
Several other benefits were proposed or men and women in the service. For example, people fighting in the gulf war would be given permission to withdraw money from individual retirement accounts without paying the 10 percent penalty normally imposed on premature withdrawals.
Also, returning service personnel would qualify for veterans' mortgage loans, which have a number of advantages over conventional mortgages but which are now only available in only a handful of states. In addition, the income of officers and civilian personnel listed as prisoners of war or missing in action would be excluded from taxes. Now, that exclusion is given only to enlisted members of the armed forces.
In another proposed benefit, the earned income tax credit now extended to low-income workers employed within the United States would be given to military personnel stationed overseas.
According to estimates made by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the increased tax writeoff for officers would cost the Treasury $252 million over five years; waiver of the tax penalty for I.R.A.'s would cost less than $10 million, and the exemption of pay of prisoners of war and missing in action would also be less than $10 million. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending unemployment compensation for discharged service men and women would cost $656 million over five years.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Postwar Kuwait;
U.S. Corporations Win Kuwait Rebuilding Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The rebuilding of Kuwait will not only be one of the biggest and most rapid construction programs in history, but the rehabilitation of the emirate might also be a period of overhauling the nation's economy, streamlining its bureaucracy and reshaping its work force.
Kuwaiti planners estimate that rebuilding costs will be $50 to $100 billion over the next five years, rivaling the expense of the Marshall Plan for Western Europe after World War II, which cost the equivalent of $70 billion at today's prices. 
 The scramble for the reconstruction work in Kuwait is already under way, with American companies winning most of the 200 early contracts for restoring basic services and repairing oil wells, as a result of the Kuwaiti policy of favoring the ally that has done the most fighting.
Some of the early corporate winners: Caterpillar Inc. is selling several sets of diesel engines linked to electric generators for emergency electrical power. Motorola Inc. will supply thousands of portable telephones. American Telephone and Telegraph is installing a satellite station in Kuwait City for emergency long-distance service. The Raytheon Company has been granted a $5.7 million contract to provide temporary air traffic control gear, runway lights and communications equipment to get Kuwait International Airport up and running.
 
'Phone Lines Burning Up'
 General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Corporation have each been asked to provide vehicles. O'Brien Goins Simpson Inc. has the contract from the Kuwait Petroleum Company to manage it and four other firms to extinguish fires in the more than 500 free-flowing oil wells that Iraqi forces ignited. And the Bechtel Group is lined up to organize the rebuilding and renewed production of the oil fields. Most companies will not disclose the size of their contracts.
A staff member for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which has a $45 million contract to help manage the recovery program in the first 90 days after the war, said the "phones are burning up" with companies eager to get in on the rebuilding business.
Yet Kuwaiti officials see the task ahead as far more than a matter of money and logistics. The Government-in-exile is weighing changes in industrial policy that could have significant social and political consequences. The policies under consideration call for a greater role for private enterprise, increased efficiency in industry and government, and thus a reduced need for foreign workers living in Kuwait.
 
'Opportunities in Catastrophe'
 "There are opportunities in this catastrophe," said Fawzi H. al-Sultan, an executive director of the World Bank and an adviser to the Kuwait Government, who headed the reconstruction planning program until recently, when the group relocated to Saudi Arabia.
Kuwait, a self-governing British protectorate until 1961, has long displayed a fondness for planning. The policies being weighed now had been considered for the past few years by Government officials and advisers as part of a long-range program, lasting perhaps two decades, to make Kuwait a more efficient, free-market economy that would require fewer manual and clerical workers. The war and its aftermath give the Kuwaitis the option of accelerating the program.
Population policy will be a critical decision. Before the war, the population of Kuwait was about 2.1 million people including hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, Jordanians and Sudanese guest workers -- all of whom may well be regarded as politically suspect now. Today, there are an estimated 800,000 people in Kuwait. A more efficient economy, with less heavy industry and less wasteful staffing of Government services, might well be supported by a population of 1.5 million people, according to one study.
 
Rebuilding Will Take Years
 In the rush for postwar business deals, American companies have won about 70 percent of the roughly 200 contracts signed so far, worth more than $800 million, according to Kuwait's Emergency Recovery Program in Dammam, Saudi Arabia.
Like most of the American firms that have been awarded contracts to date, O'Brien Goins Simpson of Midland, Texas, has longstanding contacts with Kuwait. Its president, T.B. O'Brien, is a former Gulf Oil engineer who served as an instructor for Kuwaiti engineers in the 1950's, before the country's oil industry was nationalized.
"That's the way you do business, especially in the Middle East; you hire the people you know," Mr. O'Brien explained.
Detailed damage assessments, of course, cannot be completed until the fighting is over. But the oilfield work alone, experts say, may well take years and cost up to $10 billion. And the major American construction contractors with experience in the gulf confirm that they are in discussions with Kuwaiti officials about oilfield work, often sending delegations to Saudi Arabia to pursue the jobs.
 
Other Allies Miffed
 All sorts of American companies are lining up for work, and seem well-placed to win contracts. For example, Waste Management Inc., the world's largest environmental services company, has done garbage collection and pest-control work in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade and has experience in disaster cleanup. And Perkins & Will International, a Chicago-based architectural and engineering company, manages hospital, office and university construction projects in the gulf and, before the Iraqi invasion last August, was a finalist to design and build a Ministry of Education building in Kuwait.
"That's the kind of work we'd hope to do in Kuwait after the war, but it's still an early stage yet," Robert Cooke, president of Perkins & Will International, said in a telephone interview on Monday, shortly before he caught a flight to Saudi Arabia in pursuit of business.
 
Advantage May Not Last
 The preference for American companies in the early contract awards and choosing the corps of engineers to manage the 90-day emergency effort has rankled the other allies. Britain complained earlier this month, and then Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd took a group of senior British business executives to Saudi Arabia in mid-February to meet with the exiled emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al-Sabah.
Britain, which had the second-largest military contingent among the allies and has longstanding ties to Kuwait, has won contracts already and is expected to get its share of the rebuilding business.
"The Americans and the British should do well," said Henry Schuler, a director of energy studies for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization in Washington. "And I suspect the Kuwaitis will tend to freeze out the Japanese and Germans."
But some analysts suspect that once the bills start piling up in Kuwait, the Government will be strongly tempted to make decisions mainly on the basis of price, quality and performance. They note, for example, that despite the success of some big American companies, the United States accounts for less than 10 percent of Kuwaiti imports while German and Japanese companies have been big suppliers.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Backs a Change in Bank Data

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday that the S.E.C. favored some recently proposed changes in the way banks account for troubled loans.
Mr. Breeden, speaking in New York at a conference sponsored by the Fordham University Law School, said that suggestions for "loan splitting" -- whereby a troubled loan still paying some interest could be divided into good and bad parts -- could be consistent with the S.E.C.'s desire to improve the quality of the financial information provided to bank shareholders and other investors. 
 "There is nothing inherently wrong," he said, with the idea that banks could write off as a loss part of a bad loan and count the remainder as a "good" loan.
 
90 Days Past Due
 Currently, a bank would include the entire amount of a troubled loan in a "nonperforming" category used for loans that are 90 days past due or so troubled that the bank does not expect full payment.
Mr. Breeden noted that banking regulators had not yet presented a formal proposal for the modifying treatment of some bank loans. He declined to comment on other suggested changes, including one to allow banks to report full value for loans that regulators decide are only "temporarily impaired."
In the past, banks have been required to count as nonperforming some loans that are backed by collateral whose value has fallen below the amount of the loan because of depressed real estate markets.
But according to suggestions made by regulators, the banks could remove the loans from the nonperforming category if there was good reason to expect that the loan would eventually be repaid in full.
Mr. Breeden urged that accounting standards not be used to conceal a company's condition for any reason. "If you have an economic problem, whatever else you do about it, don't cook the books," he said.
The debacle of the savings and loan industry, he said, was rife with examples where accounting practices were modified in ways that concealed the true financial condition of savings institions.
 
Criticism of Regulators
 In the case of banks, he criticized regulators for failing to require banks to measure the market value of investment securities in their profit reports.
But he added that bank loan values were too subjective to be measured by current market conditions. Low prices for bank stocks, he said, indicate that investors do not believe the financial reports issued by banks.
A spokesman for the Comptroller of the Currency said yesterday that banking regulators may issue some proposals for changed accounting treatment of troubled bank loans before the end of this week.

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure from suburban lawmakers, Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said today that they might keep fares on commuter rail lines unchanged this year even as they seek increases in New York City's subway fare of a dime or more.
For nearly a decade, increases in New York City subway fares have been matched by proportionate increases on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road. The authority, which oversees mass transportation in New York City and its suburbs, had been expected to push for increases on all the lines this year. 
 But the authority's executive director, Mortimer L. Downey, said he was "not wedded to the concept" of linking the fare increases. Mr. Downey said operating deficits at the commuter rail lines, which he estimated at $38 million in a $1.3 billion budget, were much less severe than at the Transit Authority, which runs the subways and has a projected deficit of $215 million in its $3 billion budget.
Mr. Downey's comments came after one influential lawmaker here, Norman J. Levy, a Nassau County Republican who is chairman of the State Senate's Transportation Committee, asserted that the commuter lines faced no deficits at all because the authority had access to funds that were created to deal with such shortfalls. "They've juggled the books to make it appear that there is a deficit on the commuter lines," Mr. Levy said. "There is absolutely no necessity for an increase in the commuter rail fares."
 
Legislative Review
 Last week Mr. Levy questioned whether the authority was exaggerating financial problems on all of its lines in order to justify a fare increase, and today he said "credibility problems" over the size of the deficits would lead him to sharply question officials at hearings about whether an increase in the subway fares was needed. The authority has said the subway increase is unavoidable this year.
Legally the 17-member board of the authority can raise fares without lawmakers' approval. But the Legislature, particularly Mr. Levy's committee, has a major say because it reviews and approves the authority's capital projects. While the fare increase and other possible measures to ease the authority's fiscal plight have yet to come before the Legislature, Mr. Levy's apparent pique today could presage a major skirmish over such issues.
Other lawmakers from the suburbs said decisions on commuter fares should not be linked to problems in the subway system. "The question would be, do you substitute a political justification for an economic justification for raising the commuter fares?" said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. "I think there would be strong opposition to that."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declined to answer a question today about whetherhe thought subway and commuter rail fares should be linked, saying he had not studied the issue yet. Last week Mr. Cuomo said the authority still had to prove its case that higher fares were needed anywhere in the system.
 
'Serious Concerns'
 The authority has planned a number of service reductions in the subway system in addition to the fare increases that it seeks. But today Mr. Cuomo's nominee as chairman of the authority, Peter E. Stangl, said he had "serious concerns" about one possible step, removing all token clerks from certain subway stations at night.
"We're trying to increase the sense of security on the subway," Mr. Stangl said in testimony before Mr. Levy's committee, which must approve his nomination. "Taking away token clerks, even for just a few hours, would make riders feel less secure."
Mr. Stangl, under questioning from the committee, also defended a plan by the Long Island Rail Road to use marble finishes in its renovations at Pennsylvania Station, which some critics have said would send the wrong message at a time of service cuts elsewhere in the system. He said the marble finish, which would cost about $2.3 million, or more than brick or stainless steel would cost, was an attempt to do "something decent" for commuters.
"They're not building a Taj Mahal at Penn Station," Mr. Stangl said. "You can't create the Taj Mahal out of Penn Station."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices in Retreat Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities retreated again yesterday and interest rates rose, as retail investors remained on the sidelines.
"There is no buying, even though we are at yield levels people would have killed for two weeks ago," a Government bond trader said. "The market has to get a fresh story, like more signs of economic weakness, or to a level where investment money comes back in, before it can do better." 
 For the moment, most pension funds and other large institutional investors seem convinced that victory in the Persian Gulf will give the economy a much-needed boost and prevent the Federal Reserve Board from lowering short-term interest rates any further.
Some analysts said that that view was accurate and that revisions in fourth-quarter output figures announced yesterday tended to reinforce that argument.
 
G.N.P. Revised Marginally
 The Commerce Department said that on an inflation-adjusted basis, the gross national product fell by 2 percentage points at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, a marginal change from the negative 2.1 percent rate that was originally reported.
The adjustment was slight and had no impact on prices in the credit markets. But some analysts said changes in the composition of the numbers were important, and some even suggested that first-quarter growth could be positive.
Of particular interest was a large downward revision in inventories, which were liquidated at an annual 22.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, much more quickly than the 16.3 percent rate initially reported.
"Inventories and production are so low that it is very easy to get them to rise in the first quarter," said Joseph Duncan, vice president and chief economist at the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. "These numbers reinforce my view that the first quarter is very likely to be positive. And, with victory in the gulf clearly at hand," he added, "it should be very easy to get enough of a boost from the war to make the second quarter positive as well."
President Bush announced last night that peace was at hand when he said in a speech that "Kuwait is liberated" and "Iraq's army is defeated." He said that at midnight "all United States and coalition forces will suspend offensive combat operations."
Despite the lift that Mr. Duncan expects a resolution of the conflict will give the economy, he said the economy was not about to come roaring back: For the entire year, he projects expansion at a 1 percent rate.
"That is not a great year. But it is not a recession either," he said.
That view is not universally held on Wall Street, where many insist that the economy remains mired in recession.
"I think the economy-is-going-to-bounce-back story is wrong," a bond trader said, "but it will take a couple of weeks and some new numbers, like a weak February employment report, to convince the market of that."
February employment data are not expected to be released by the Labor Department until March 8.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 3/32 late yesterday, down 3/32, to yield 8.13 percent, up from 8.12 percent late Tuesday.
Among notes, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 18/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.96 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 17/32, down 1/32, to yield 7 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.01 percent, up one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.01 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late rate of 5.96 percent.
Participants in the high-yield market for "junk bonds" took an announcement by the Westinghouse Financial Corporation that it intended to liquidate its $500 million portfolio in stride. Prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
 
Prices Propped Up
 Kingman Penniman, a senior vice president at the Duff & Phelps/MCM Investment Research Company, said that unlike other fixed-income markets, a severe shortage of new high-yield securities was helping to prop up prices of outstanding issues.
"There is just not much supply right now," Mr. Penniman said. "Now, every time a seller like Westinghouse or the Resolution Trust Corporation comes in with a bid list it is met with cheers, not groans."
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a $1.2 billion competitive offering of general-obligation bonds from the State of California was fairly well received by investors.
A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won the issue, which consists of serial bonds from 1992 to 2011.
The bonds maturing in 1992 were not reoffered. Yields on the bonds that were repriced range from 4.70 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 6.65 percent in 2011.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Investment bankers involved in the transaction said that as of late yesterday that $400 million worth of the issue remained unsold.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
A number of issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a $150 million three-year note offering for the Household Finance Corporation.
The 8 3/4 percent notes, which mature March 15, 1994, were priced at $99.80 to yield 8.825 percent, 1.60 percentage points over the yield on the Treasury's 7 5/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-3 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.

Money Pours Into Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Encouraged by the prospect of a quick end to both the recession and the Persian Gulf war, investors have been pouring money into stock mutual funds this month. Some fund managers say that sales are proceeding at a record pace.
"The money just flooded in," said Chrissy Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Janus Group of funds. "January was an excellent month, and February beat it." She said that on several days in February, more cash flowed into the group's funds than on any previous day. 
 Bond funds also had an excellent month. Some fund managers said it was even better than in January, which was the best month for such funds in nearly four years, according to figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
 
Investors' Expectations
 The bullishness on both stock and bond markets reflect the effects of falling interest rates, as well as investors' expectations that the economy will soon rebound. Fears of being left behind in a runaway bull market also brought in some money. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit record levels this month.
Stock funds at T. Rowe Price have had a net cash inflow that so far this month exceeds the inflow of any other month in the firm's history, Steve Norwitz, a spokesman, said. "You certainly would not know there is a recession going on, looking at our business," he said. "If this year continues the way the first two months have gone, it will easily be our best year ever."
Jane Jamieson, an executive vice president of Fidelity Investments, said a University of Michigan survey this month for the Fidelity funds showed that 47 percent of investors said they planned to buy stock funds, up from 31 percent in January. "A lot of people had been putting off committing dollars to the equity market," she said. "Now they have rushed in and done it, and I wouldn't expect to see these levels continue."
Fund managers also reported a surge of interest in "junk bond" funds, which invest in high-yield, high-risk securities and have been seeing cash flow out for more than a year. "There's a real turnaround," said John Reilly, a spokesman for Massachusetts Financial Services, where "junk bond" funds took in more cash in February than all but one other category of bond funds, those devoted to municipal bonds.
At the Oppenheimer Group of funds, a similar trend was reported. "There has been a shift away from the most conservative bond funds, like government bond funds, into our high-yield fund," said Jon Fossel, the chairman and chief executive of the group. He said that shift was partly a result of a desire for higher yields as interest rates fell, but it also showed that investors believed "that the recession is going to end and that not every issuer is going to default."
In January, according to the Investment Company Institute figures, cash flow into stock funds -- including new sales, redemptions and transfers among different types of funds -- was a net $666 million. That was up from $338 million in December, but well below the peak flows of last spring. Many fund groups said money was taken out of funds early in January as stock prices fell, but was returned late in the month, after stock prices zoomed following the beginning of the air war over Iraq and Kuwait.
Over all, the institute said, assets of all types of mutual funds rose a record $59 billion in January, to a high of $1.13 trillion. Most of that increase came from a $37 billion increase in money market funds, part of it seasonal, and most of the rest came from rising stock and bond prices.
The cash flow into bond funds came to $3.3 billion, the best showing for such funds since March 1987, just before plunging bond prices sent investors fleeing from such funds. Government bond funds drew in $697 million, making January the first month in nearly three years that such funds had a net cash inflow. Global bond funds and those devoted to municipal bonds also had strong cash flow, but "junk bond" funds reported an outflow of $304 million in January.
At Fidelity, Ms. Jamieson described February as "the best month for new flows into bonds that we have had in at least two years."
Several fund managers commented that not only were investors pouring money into long-term mutual funds, but also that a larger percentage of the money was going into the riskier types of funds, including those that invest in small-company growth stocks, as well as those that buy "junk bonds."
"I used to say the mutual fund investor was a chicken investor, but that is not as true anymore," Mr. Fossel of Oppenheimer said.
For much of 1990, the professionals who run mutual funds were less bullish than the investors, a fact that could be seen in the rising levels of cash in stock funds. But in January, the managers were more than willing to put the new cash to work, and the percentage of cash in stock funds fell to 11 percent of assets from 11.5 percent in December. In October the figure stood at 12.9 percent, a record for stock funds.
But while the stock fund managers were putting cash to work in January, the managers of "junk bond" funds were continuing to show caution. They sold more bonds than were needed to meet redemptions, and ended the month with 12.4 percent of fund assets in cash, up from 11.6 percent a month earlier and the highest since separate records for such funds began to be released in 1984. Some of that cash no doubt was invested this month, as "junk bond" prices rallied.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The Families;
Scud's Lethal Hit Takes First 3 Female Soldiers

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENSBURG, Pa., Feb. 27

 BODY:
Two women, among the first American female soldiers killed in the Persian Gulf war, died with eight other Reservists based here in a Scud missile attack in Saudi Arabia, the Army said today.
A third female soldier, a private from California who had not yet been assigned to a unit, was also killed in the attack on Tuesday. 
 Today Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania declared a week of mourning and ordered flags on state buildings to be lowered to half staff in honor of the two women and eight men attached to a unit in Greensburg and a ninth man attached to another unit in western Pennsylvania.
And in this small city of steep hills where the unit was based, hundreds of people attended a memorial service at a local high school.
"There's an extremely strong sense of loss among the kids," said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Greensburg, the Rev. Anthony Bosco. "There are so many heavy, overwhelming emotions right now that we had to do something."
Word of the deaths of the two women, one a college student from Rochester Mills north of here, the other a secretary from Armagh, came from relatives who said they had been notified by the military.
 
'Thought They'd Be Safe'
 A total of 28 reservists were killed and 90 others wounded in the attack that came as many were eating dinner or relaxing in their barracks miles from the front.
"We thought they'd be safe so far from the action," said Candee Mazuriki, the sister of a reservist wounded in the attack. "Nobody was really that anxious."
The two women based here were members of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, a water purification unit. The unit had been in the gulf for only five days before the attack. They had only used the barracks for two nights.
Late today the names of only 12 of the 28 dead had been made public by the military. The female soldiers have been identified as Specialist Christine Mayes, 23 years old, a part-time college student from Rochester Mills, and Specialist Beverly Clark, also 23, of Armagh (pronounced ar-MAH).
The third woman killed was identified as Pvt. Adrienne L. Mitchell, 20, of Moreno Valley, Calif.
Until Tuesday, only one American woman had been identified among the missing or dead. On Jan. 31, Melissa Rathbun-Nealy, 20, of Grand Rapids, Mich., was listed as missing in action.
 
A Knock on the Door

Shortly after 7 A.M. today, two Army officers knocked on the door of Franklin and Darlene Mayes's one-story frame house on a narrow lane, a lone birch in the front yard draped with yellow ribbons.
The officers told the couple that the oldest of their three daughters had been killed.
Hours later, the Mayeses released a statement, written in a trembling print.
"Her father and I feel that she died for what she believed in," the statement said. "She was proud to be an American."
Specialist Mayes joined the Army shortly after graduating from high school in 1986. After serving a three-year enlistment, she joined the Reserves last October.
She was a part-time student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Her sister Pamela, 19, is a full-time student at the college and her father, a 49-year-old unemployed construction worker, is also a part-time student there.
As Pamela Mayes left the family home, she paused for a moment and said: "This is just real hard. We were real close."
Specialist Mayes's unit was mobilized in January and was sent to the gulf on Feb. 17.
 
Recent Engagement
 Days before she left for the desert she became engaged to David Fairbanks.
A family friend, Linda Winebark, 25, said today that Specialist Mayes "kept letting us know that when she came home she wanted to get everyone together for a big party."
Ms. Winebark said she had spoken on the telephone with Specialist Mayes about a week ago.
"She was scared," Ms. Winebark said. "Who wouldn't be? But she said she wanted to go. She said she was in the service and that was her job."
Last Sunday Mrs. Mayes spoke with her daughter for what was to be the final time, the family's statement said.
She told her mother that her unit would soon move about 40 miles closer to the Kuwaiti boarder and that she "was living in a big warehouse in Saudi Arabia and that was all she could tell us," the statement said.
"This is just something you never expect," the Mayeses wrote. "But this time it hit home."
 
Former Secretary
 Specialist Clark's hometown, Armagh, is about 60 miles from Pittsburg. Her father, Robert, 44, is a coalminer, and she had three sisters and a brother.
She graduated from high school in 1986 and joined the Reserves shortly after. She worked as a secretary for a company that makes windows and doors, said her uncle, Randy Ludwig. He said his niece called her parents on Saturday.
"That's the last time they heard from her," Mr. Ludwig said. "I don't know what to say. We heard about the missile hitting the barracks. We were hoping she wasn't in there but we were worried that she was."
Mr. Ludwig said the family still supported President Bush's war policies.
"We had to be over there," he said. "It's just a shame the price you have to pay."
Tonight after President Bush ordered forces to suspend fighting in the gulf, one local resident, Marlin Liberty of New Spanton, said he remained skeptical.
Mr. Liberty, a member of the local volunteer fire department, said he had met a number of those from the 14th Detachment when his fire company helped escort the unit to the Pennsylvania Turnpike as it prepared to ship out for Saudi Arabia.
"It's far from over, Mr. Libery said after the President spoke. "His saying that it's over doesn't necessarily mean that it's over."
The 14th Quartermaster Detachment is part of the 99th United States Army Reserve Command based near Pittsburgh.
At a news conference today in Greensburg at the headquarters of the 14th Quartermaster, the commanding officer of the 99th, Major General James B. Baylor, said all but nine of the 28 dead had been identified.
He also said that during the Scud attack the Patroit missile installation assigned to protect the area "was down for upgrading." Later he said it was completely out of operation while the upgrading was being done.
He said that even if the installation had been in operation that it could have done little to prevent the Scud from hitting the barracks because the missile was falling apart and flipping end over end as it fell.
The unidentified soliders had been so badly burned in the blast that immediate identification was impossible. The remains of the dead were flown to the United States late Tuesday night.
General Baylor would only release 12 names, three of them known for at least a day.
 
Others Known Dead
 The Army officially identified, in addition to the three women, Specialist Richard Wolverton of Latrobe, Pa.; Specialist John A. Boliver Jr. of Monangahela, Pa; Specialist Joseph P. Bongiorni 3d of Morgantown, W. Va; Specialist Frank S. Keough of North Huntington, Pa.; Specialist Anthony Madison of Monessen, Pa. and Specialist Thomas G. Stone of Falconer, N.Y. all with the 14th Detachment.
Also identified were Specialist Glenn Jones of Grand Rapids, Mich., who was unassigned, and Specialist James Worthy of Albany, Ga., and Specialist Steven Farnen of Columbia, Mo., whose assignment status was unclear.
Specialist Boliver was a relative newcomer to Monongahela, a town of nearly 5,000.
The town's Mayor, John Moreschi, visited Specialist Boliver's widow, Linda, today to offer his condolences, which were formalized in a proclamation issued here today, "to pay humble tribute to the courage and devotion of Specialist John A. Boliver Jr."
Specialist Boliver had two children, Matthew, 2, and Melissa, 1.
Along Main Street here, a canopy of American flags snapped in the snow-laced air. And virtually every shop window had at least one yellow ribbon on display.
The students at Central Catholic High School here felt especially close to the men and women of the 14th. The unit armory sits across the road from the school.
When the unit shipped out, the students affixed a huge good luck banner across the front of the school and crowded at the school windows to wave goodbye.
As the sun danced off the tiny American flag stickpin in his lapel and the gold earring in his ear, John Lypson, 17, said he and his classmates have held several prayer services for the safe return of the troops.
"Everyone seems to be supporting the troops and the war," he said. "There are some who don't support the war. They're looked down upon. I know I look down on them."
The students held a memorial service in the high school gymnasium today. There were prayers for peace and hymns and two students blew taps.
Then four students slowly walked forward and lighted four candles as another student read the list of the confirmed dead.
"And those," the student said, "not yet named."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The President;
BUSH HALTS OFFENSIVE COMBAT; KUWAIT FREED, IRAQIS CRUSHED

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Declaring that "Kuwait is liberated" and Iraq's army defeated, President Bush ordered allied forces on Wednesday night to suspend offensive military operations against President Saddam Hussein's isolated and battered army.
Mr. Bush said the suspension, which began at midnight Eastern time, would continue as long as Iraq did not attack allied forces or launch missile attacks on any other country. In an address from the Oval Office that was televised around the world at 9 P.M. Eastern time, he called on Mr. Hussein to send his commanders to meet with allied officers in the war zone within 48 hours to settle the military terms of a permanent cease-fire. 
 For such a cease-fire to be approved, he said, Iraq must comply with all 12 United Nations resolutions concerning Kuwait, including measures calling for Iraq to void its annexation of the territory and agree in principle to pay reparations to Kuwait and other countries. Iraq must also free all prisoners of war and detained Kuwaiti citizens, and give the allies the location of all land and sea mines that Iraq had laid in the region, Mr. Bush said.
 
No Official Word From Iraq
 Administration officials said they had received no authoritative response from the Iraqi Government. At the United Nations, Soviet diplomats said Iraq had submitted a letter signaling its willingness to comply with all 12 resolutions adopted by the Security Council. But the letter did not say whether Baghdad was willing to comply with the rest of Mr. Bush's demands, including the freeing of Kuwaiti civilians seized in recent days. [Text of the letter, page A10.]
Pentagon officials said this morning there were no reports of renewed Iraqi attacks on allied positions.
Speaking in a solemn voice, President Bush said: "This war is now behind us. Ahead of us is the difficult task of securing a potentially historic peace." [Transcript of his remarks, page A12.]
He seemed to invite the citizens of Iraq to overthrow the man who had defied the assembled military and political power of the international alliance. "Coalition forces fought this war only as a last resort," Mr. Bush said, "and look foward to the day when Iraq is led by people prepared to live in peace with their neighbors."
 
Unusually Low Casualties
 Mr. Bush, who had staked his Presidency on being able to resolve a crisis that had shattered the post-cold war calm and led to the largest single American military offensive since World War II, declared an end to the war in his third nationally televised speech from the Oval Office since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
To arrive at the point where he was able to declare victory last night, Mr. Bush had to command what military experts said was one of the largest combat operations ever conducted with such low casualties, counter political opposition at home and navigate the shoals of diplomacy complicated by last-minute Soviet peace ventures that plainly irritated the President and his war council.
"At midnight tonight, Eastern standard time, exactly 100 hours since ground operations commenced and six weeks since the start of Operation Desert Storm, all United States and coalition forces will suspend offensive combat operations," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush did not say when he would start bringing American troops home. Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said late Wednesday night that there was no specific timetable, but added: "We'll measure it in days, not weeks. Clearly, the President wants to start the withdrawal as soon as possible."
Within hours after Mr. Bush spoke, the United States, Iraq and the Soviet Union each tried to gain control of the public relations of peace with messages directed at their domestic political audiences.
Baghdad Radio defiantly proclaimed Iraq's triumph over "the forces of evil" and Soviet diplomats at the United Nations said that it was Iraq's promises to heed the United Nations resolutions, delivered through Moscow's intercession, that had prompted Mr. Bush to give his speech.
Senior White House officials insisted that Mr. Bush knew nothing of the reported letter of agreement from Iraq when he went on television Wednesday night. Mr. Fitzwater said the speech was motivated in part by a desire to assure the families of military personnel that they would soon be coming home.
The President, who had brushed aside Iraq's last attempt to win a cease-fire on favorable terms earlier in the day, said: "Iraq's Army is defeated. Our military objectives are met. Kuwait is once more in the hands of Kuwaitis in control of their own destiny.
"The Kuwaiti flag once again flies above the capital of a free and sovereign nation, and the American flag flies above our embassy," Mr. Bush said.
 
Baker to Go to Mideast
 After seven months of holding together a disparate international coalition and rallying American public opinion with the promise that he would not allow the Persian Gulf crisis to become another Vietnam, Mr. Bush said he was sending Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to the Middle East to "look beyond victory and war" and to "meet the challenging of securing the peace."
Mr. Bush's speech capped a six-week allied military offensive against Iraq in which fewer than 100 Americans were killed, according to the latest report today from the Pentagon, and whose swiftness astonished even the President's war council.
He spoke only a few hours after his commander in the Persian Gulf, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, described the last major battle of the war, between allied armored divisions and Iraq's Republican Guard, the last remants of what had been Mr. Hussein's huge military machine, near the southern Iraqi city of Basra.
 
A Balancing Position
 Mr. Bush's speech, scheduled less than three hours before it was delivered, seemed to represent a balancing of the American position, that Iraq should not get off too easily, with mounting international pressures to stop the assaults on an obviously defeated army.
Reflecting those pressures, Mr. Bush said: "In the future, as before, we will consult with our coalition partners. We've already done a good deal of thinking and planning for the postwar period."
He said: "There can be and will be no solely American answer to all these challenges, but we can assist and support the countries of the region and be a catalyst for peace."
With Mr. Hussein still in power in Baghdad, the declaration of victory left major political and diplomatic issues ahead, including the question of a postwar role for Iraq in the region, the durability of Mr. Hussein himself and the inevitable pressure on the United States to take a leading role in resolving the so-far intractable Middle East problems to which the Administration is now turning its attention, including the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
 
Jubilation in Washington
 Mr. Bush's speech produced jubilation in Washington. Residents streamed to the gates of the White House, waving small American flags, and drivers honked their horns as they passed by along Pennsylvania Avenue.
Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, said, "All Americans rejoice at the news that our servicemen and women may soon be returning home." He added, "Our hearts go out to the families who have suffered the loss of loved ones in this effort."
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said: "The majority in Congress voted to give the President the authority, and he has taken that authority and I think conducted this operation brilliantly. And we can all be deeply grateful that the casualties have been so low and the victory has come so fast."
Mr. Bush's declaration of victory was the climactic moment in a crisis that began in the early hours of Aug. 2, when a huge Iraqi armored column swept into sparsely-defended Kuwait. It followed the breakdown of negotiations over Mr. Hussein's demands for territorial concessions and financial payments in return for his eight-year war against Iran.
 
Rallied Coalition, Choked Iraq
 Startling the world with the swiftness of his response, Mr. Bush began sending American soldiers to the Middle East six days later, a deployment that quickly surpassed even that of Vietnam. He rallied a coalition that revived the moribund Security Council, with the crucial help of the Soviet Union, and began choking Baghdad with a series of economic sanctions enforced by allied naval power.
As diplomacy faltered and sanctions failed to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, Mr. Bush doubled the American force in October, until there were more than a half-million allied forces in Saudi Arabia. In late November, the allies gave Mr. Hussein a final ultimatum: Get out of Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face war.
An offer for direct talks with Baghdad floundered in diplomatic brinksmanship and Mr. Bush sent allied warplanes into combat on Jan. 16. For six weeks, they poured an unequalled rain of explosives onto Iraqi communications networks and military positions until, judging that Iraq's forces were ripe for the kill, Mr. Bush unleashed the ground offensive last Saturday night.
Before Mr. Bush spoke, it had been a day for optimistic predictions of victory, tough talk against Iraq and the back-and-forth struggle of diplomacy and semantics between Washington and Baghdad. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, speaking to the American Legion yesterday afternoon, said, "It looks like what's happened is that the mother of all battles has turned into the mother of all retreats."
 
'He Was Pretty Serious'
 In his office Wednesday night, Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the President had not been strongly encouraged by a 2:30 P.M. briefing from his military advisers. "He was pretty serious and concerned," Mr. Fitzwater said. "He had just rejected the Iraqi offer complying with three of the resolutions. That didn't seem like such a good sign in spite of the fact of what was happening on the battlefield. But as it became more and more clear that the fighting was over and that the military objectives were met, the President's spirits improved considerably."
The President asked his military advisers when he could tell the American people that the shooting had stopped and that the troops were going to come home. "I'd like to do it tonight," Mr. Fitzwater quoted Mr. Bush as saying.
The President decided to speak on Wednesday night because he was assured by his advisors, Mr. Fitzwater said, "that the military backbone of Iraq was broken."
"As a fighting force, it was over for them," Mr. Fitzwater said. "The President wanted to tell the American people at the earliest possible moment and to tell the families that their children, husbands and wives were out of harm's way. His advisers talked about tommorrow, and he said, 'What about tonight?' "
 
Arranging 'a Solid Peace'
 Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replied, "I think we can do that," Mr. Fitzwater said.
"The message here was we've won the war and we've now got to go through the arrangements for a solid peace," he said.
As usual, Mr. Bush had consultations with his allies, speaking to President Francois Mitterrand of France in the morning and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who has emerged as perhaps his closest confidant among foreign leaders, in the evening. He also spoke with the British Prime Minister, John Major.
Mr. Baker and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, called other allies to tell them of the President's decision and Mr. Baker had an extensive discussion with Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd of Britain.
Mr. Fitzwater said the allies had been solidly behind the President for not accepting the Iraqis' last attempt at winning a cease-fire and had not been under pressure to call an end to the fighting.
 
No Calls to Gorbachev
 Notably absent from Mr. Bush's round of calls was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who had made a failed attempt at mediating peace before the ground war began.
Wednesday began with a message to the United Nations from Baghdad in which Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said his Government, which had promised to heed the United Nations resolution requiring its withdrawal from Kuwait, now "agrees to abide" by two other resolutions. One would nullify Iraq's annexation of the occupied sheikdom, and the other would require Baghdad to pay war reparations.
Mr. Aziz also said Iraq would release all prisoners of war "within a very short time." But he conditioned these promises on a cease-fire enforced by the United Nations and on the lifting of all economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad after the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The alliance held out for Iraq's unconditional acceptance of all 12 United Nations resolutions, the continuation of sanctions beyond the war, and the surrender of all Iraqi tanks and other weapons. Official statements had made it clear that the coalition had political and military aims beyond driving the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
Mr. Cheney said, "Even after we've achieved our military objectives, even after we've destroyed his offensive military capability and expelled his forces from Kuwait, liberated Kuwait, the world will still be vitally interested in the future course of events with respect to the kinds of activities and policies pursued by the Government in Baghdad."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: United Nations;
Allies Wary of Overture By Iraqis on Cease-Fire

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Thursday, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The United States and its coalition partners resisted demands today from the Soviet Union and Iraq for a Security Council resolution calling for a permanent cease-fire to bring a formal end to the Persian Gulf war.
Diplomats from the coalition countries said a formal cease-fire was not necessary at this point because the United States had already agreed to stop offensive combat at midnight Wednesday. 
 Before any formal cease-fire is declared, the allies say, Iraq must improve on its 11th-hour offer to accept all Security Council resolutions related to the gulf crisis. Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said that Iraq had agreed to comply fully with the 12 resolutions in a letter delivered to the United Nations Wednesday evening.
 
The Other Conditions
 But the coalition also wants Iraq to account for, and quickly return, all the prisoners of war it has captured as well as thousands of Kuwaiti and other civilians it has seized or taken hostage.
The allies also want Iraq to hand over plans of minefields it has laid in Kuwait. And they say that units of the elite Iraqi Republican Guard now surrounded by coalition forces near the border with Kuwait must agree to abandon their tanks and other heavy arms for destruction before they will be given safe passage home.
While Iraq's intentions on these points remain unclear, the allies' partners sa-id early today that they do not wish to give up the option to resume fighting. The Security Council agreed to meet later today to discuss the Iraqi letter and the Persian Gulf War.
Diplomats from countries in the allied coalition say the Soviet Union is pushing for an immediate and formal cease-fire decision because it wants to emphasize its role as a peacemaker in the conflict and strengthen its ties with Iraq and Arab countries supporting Baghdad.
Before President Bush's announcement of the suspension of fighting, the Security Council had rejected yet another Iraqi cease-fire offer that fell short of the terms the United States has set for ending the conflict. As a result, the Soviet Union said it would step up its efforts to persuade President Saddam Hussein to stop trying to bargain with the Council and agree to settle the conflict on America's terms.
After the Council met, the Soviet Union said it would strongly urge President ussein to stop trying to bargain and instead settle on the American-led coalition's terms for ending the conflict.
Before Mr. Bush's speech, many diplomats werearguing that, by repeatedly seeking concessions in the coalition's terms for a truce, President Hussein, encouraged by Soviet efforts to achieve a compromise, was merely giving the United States more time to accomplish what they assumed to be one its major undeclared war aims -- the crippling of the Iraqi military.
 
Soviet Role in Offer
 In the proposal that was defeated earlier Wednesday, Baghdad offered to renounce its claim to Kuwait and pay reparations for damage its forces have done there, as the allies insist. But Baghdad said it would do so only in exchange for a cease-fire agreement and the lifting of the trade and other economic sanctions the Security Council has imposed on it.
That was the third peace offer Baghdad had made and had seen rejected since the ground offensive against its occupation of Kuwait began last weekend.
At the private meeting of the Security Council's 15 members, only Cuba and Yemen were said to have shown any interest in Baghdad's new proposal.
The Soviet Union apparently played an important role in obtaining that offer from Iraq, Western diplomats said.
 
Moscow Is Hopeful
 The peace offer rejected Wednesday was transmitted to New York by the Soviet Embassy in Baghdad, since Iraq no longer has effective international communications. Some Western diplomats said they suspected that Soviet officials had a hand in drafting the text, even though they would have known the United States was likely to reject it.
Council members told Iraq at the time that they were ready to give urgent consideration to a cease-fire only after Baghdad had unambiguously accepted the 12 resolutions passed by the council calling for a withdrawal from Kuwait and imposing sanctions and conditions on Baghdad.
The Soviet Union's United Nations representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, had said earlier Wednesday that he was hopeful that Moscow would be able to persuade President Hussein to agree to the allies' terms.
"We're hopeful we might receive that word from him soon," he said after the meeting.
 
'Its Made No Deals'
 He said the Soviet Union was in constant contact with the Iraqi leadership, adding that it would "strongly recommend" that Baghdad give the assurances the allies are demanding.
Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said the Security Council was looking for "a simple, straightforward, uncluttered acceptance" of its terms for ending the war.
The American representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said: "The council isn't here bargaining with Iraq. Its made no deals. The council's been very clear. Tell us when you are ready to comply with the 12 resolutions, and we'll take our next steps from there."
The allies' refusal today to trade the lifting of sanctions for Baghdad's acceptance of some of their other demands was in line with their repeated refusal to accept any kind of a conditional cease-fire agreement, which they say amounts to bargaining with President Hussein.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq;
Iraq Issues a Call for Peace Hours Before Bush's Speech

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Thursday, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Hours before President Bush announced a conditional suspension of offensive fighting today, Baghdad moved closer to capitulation, offering to relinquish all claim to Kuwait, release allied prisoners and accept responsibility for war reparations in return for an immediate cease-fire and the lifting of international sanctions.
Shortly after the Iraqi offer was made known on Wednesday, three explosions rocked central Baghdad, and a Reuters correspondent there said the blasts, possibly from cruise missiles, were so great that the Rashid Hotel, where Western reporters in the city are staying, "heaved and shuddered." 
 The decisions announced by the Baghdad radio were said to have been made on Tuesday at a meeting of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council under President Saddam Hussein.
 
News of Allied Invasion
 Iraq's leaders told their people for the first time Wednesday that allied troops were fighting on their soil. The Baghdad radio reported an allied paratroop drop on the strategic Euphrates valley, 190 miles south of Baghdad, and urged soldiers to "tear the enemies everywhere in pieces."
"Their aim has clearly become to invade Iraq," the radio said.
The radio's reports and commentaries suggest increasingly that Iraqis are being asked to rally to Mr. Hussein personally in the defense of the homeland. "The soil of the cherished homeland is fortified thanks to the noble sons of Iraq and brave knight Saddam Hussein," a commentary said.
The radio reported Wednesday night that Mr. Hussein had presided over a further meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, top Baath party figures and state officials. The radio report indcated that he was looking to the Soviet Union to swing the United Nations Security Council in favor of his cease-fire offer.
"Leader President Saddam Hussein and the conferees," the report said, "expressed the hope that the Soviet Union and other friendly states at the U.N. Security Council will adopt practical measures to prevent America and its allies from continuing their abominable crime against the people of Iraq and their armed forces and property."
 
Heavy Bombing Reported
 Peter Arnett, reporting for CNN from Baghdad late Wednesday night, said there had been heavy bombing in Baghdad since shortly after the Baghdad radio reported the new Iraqi positions.
"The sky across the whole horizon outside the hotel was lit up with antiaircraft fire, including explosions in the sky and on the ground," Mr. Arnett said. "The explosions shook the Al Rashid Hotel, where we live, but we don't know yet what the targets were. It was the 42d night of bombing of Baghdad."
Early on Wednesday, the Baghdad radio announced that Iraq completed its withdrawal from Kuwait at first light. The United States and its allies dispute the assertion.
In Amman, protest marchers outside the Iraqi Embassy chanted, "Death to the United States and its allies!" The police sealed off streets leading to the American Embassy, half a mile away, and no violent incidents were reported.
 
'Hounding' of Hussein Assailed
 Jordanian officials, expressing indignation at what one termed "the hounding of Saddam Hussein," said it was becoming clear that the allies now wished to tighten the screws on the Iraqi leader so severely that, even if the fighting stops, a continued embargo would bring such deprivation to Iraqis as to lead to his ouster.
In a separate statement Wednesday night, Foreign Minister Taher el-Masri of Jordan said Iraq had complied "with what has been demanded of Iraq in the past." He added, "We believe it is high time for the Security Council to meet and endorse an immediate cease-fire."
After a meeting Tuesday night, moreover, Jordan's Cabinet "expressed its anxiety and dismay over the attempts by the countries of the alliance to go beyond international legitimacy and the Security Council resolutions to acheive their objectives," a Government statement said on Wednesday.
Possibly seeking to salvage some pride, Jordan's Prime Minister, Mudar Badran, said in Parliament on Wednesday night that Iraq had already withdrawn from Kuwait and maneuvered to disguise its actions before the allied ground offensive began.

Boondoggle

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
Calvin Trillin, the writer frequently called a humorist because there is no more precise term for a man who disembowels pomp with such a good-natured sword, has announced that he has sworn off Dan Quayle. Given the fact that children bring Dan Quayle stories home from school along with knock-knock jokes, and bartenders proffer them with bowls of beer nuts, Mr. Trillin has decided that the Vice President is just too obvious to be taken humorously.
I suppose legislators must feel like that about the Division for Servicemen's Voting. 
 The Division for Servicemen's Voting is in New York State, but you have something like it wherever you live. You know the guy who has the job that mainly seems to consist of changing his desk blotter, chewing out the person who parked a little over the line into his parking space and going out for long lunches? The one about whom all the secretaries say, "What does he do, anyway?"
He is the moral equivalent of the Division for Servicemen's Voting. The division has a secretary, two part-time directors who earn $25,000 a year, and an annual budget of $140,000. Its alleged purpose is to provide absentee ballots for soldiers, something that's already handled by the Defense Department. What it really does is give do-nothing jobs to people who are friends of politicians, and it's kind of a standing joke in Albany.
The interesting thing about the division, which Gov. Mario Cuomo calls a "boondoggle," is that its function has recently changed. In good times you call what it does patronage. But these are not good times.
Whenever I travel around the city, to shelters that are providing a little heat to people with borderline chilblains, to the homes of those who have taken in AIDS kids to love them until they die, to schools that don't have nurses or libraries or even crayons in some kindergarten classrooms, I hear the social workers and foster parents and teachers talk about what they could do if they only had a few more bucks.
In bad times like these, the proper name for what government backwaters like the Division of Servicemen's Voting do is theft.
This illustrates vividly the lie now at the heart of big government: that there is no money. Like one of those thin men with an improbable beer belly, there is money, but much of it is in the wrong place. Government has a gut, and it has spawned an enormous family made up of what the Rolling Stones once called "under-assistant West Coast promotion men."
New York State has a $6 billion budget deficit this year, which makes the budget for Boondoggle look very, very small. But it is worth remembering that budgets are built of small pieces, and cut the same way. The main branch of the Brooklyn public library is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and along with a proclamation came the news that it will be closed one day a week for the first time in its history. There used to be a term-paper clinic for the older students who do their homework in the library after school, but that's out because of the budget crunch, along with most of the story hours for smaller kids. The Coney Island branch is only open on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.
The Governor has cut Boondoggle from the budget, but I'm sure there are dozens more Boondoggles under his governance, and under that of Mayor David Dinkins, whose $11,000 headboard holds the Nero Fiddled award for most time wasted by a city employee doing something meaningless over many hours.
Whenever you're tempted to think that $11,000 is a drop in the budget bucket, just think how a first-grade teacher would look if you told her she could have it all to spend on her class, with maybe $2,000 left over for a bonus because she has a hard job and she does it diligently. Never has the theory of trickle-down economics been more compelling -- the new theory, that is, the one that says clots of bureaucrats and slo-mo workers must be weeded out so that meager resources can trickle down to people.
And if patronage and bureaucratic buildup seem as inevitable and unworthy of serious notice as Dan Quayle gags, it helps to think of it this way. If the Legislature restores Boondoggle to the budget, it is helping to steal story hour from a bunch of kids in Brooklyn. And it is saying that programs like providing latchkey kids with a place to work on term papers are far less important than seeing that two guys who do nothing much get $25,000 a year. In good times, you can talk about patronage or pork barrel and laugh it off. In bad times, those things are stealing, plain and simple.

HEADLINE: Private Cures for Public Ills

 BODY:
With very little public notice, a small miracle is taking place in America's toughest urban neighborhoods. Grass-roots entrepreneurs known as C.D.C.'s -- short for community development corporations -- are rehabilitating abandoned homes, creating commercial enterprise and organizing social services. Their aim is to succeed where government programs have often failed: reclaiming city streets from crime and economic rot.
Yesterday, C.D.C.'s got a huge and timely boost when the Prudential Insurance Company and seven foundations committed $62.5 million to the cause. The program -- known formally as the National Community Development Initiative -- is designed to build on the work of C.D.C.'s in places like the South Bronx in New York and the Watts section of Los Angeles, and to nurture many more. 
 C.D.C.'s have already left a remarkable imprint. They helped restore the Liberty City section of Miami after riots in the early 1980's; they've replaced rubble and graffiti from five square miles of the South Bronx with new homes and parks. In all, they've produced more than 35,000 units of housing and millions of square feet of commercial space. Indeed, C.D.C.'s are now the biggest developer of low-income housing, -- a sad commentary of Washington's puny efforts, but a ringing tribute to resourceful communities.
Yet despite their success, C.D.C.'s operate on a shoestring and survive by the sweat and guile of their local leaders. Yesterday's announcement by Prudential, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Lilly Endowment and five other major private foundations brings vital relief.
The initiative represents the largest commitment of private money ever made to neighborhood renewal. Working through C.D.C.'s, the program will pump money into 20 cities primarily for housing, but also for day care and other facilities. In an unprecedented decision, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation has pledged an additional $100 million. After local companies, governments and foundations chip in, the entire plan should exceed $500 million over five years.
A half-billion won't solve the problems of the urban poor. But there is more to this initiative than dollars spent or houses built. The participants want to prove that C.D.C.'s are beyond the experimental stage and can be replicated. The idea is to raise C.D.C.'s to a new scale of activity -- bring them to more cities and expand them where they already exist -- by providing secure financial support. At that point, C.D.C.'s will be able to emerge from obscurity and attract millions more in private and public loans and grants.
The initiative is no gamble. The program will be administered by two organizations that have a proven track record working with C.D.C.'s: the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which was created by the Ford Foundation and six corporations in 1979 to channel private-sector money into C.D.C.'s. Under its supervision, only a minuscule fraction of the loans it has arranged have gone sour.
C.D.C.'s have survived so far with resourceful, dynamic leadership. But as Mitchell Sviridoff, a former president and the original architect of the Ford program, argues, leadership is everywhere, but it needs to be nourished. He's exactly right, and that's what this promising new initiative will do.

HEADLINE: Diminishing Returns Ride Mass Transit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 16 article warning of another mass transit fare increase for New York City should make the Metropolitan Transportation Authority think twice about its practices. As we all know too well, the higher the fare goes, the more the ridership drops. Obviously, to anyone who isn't economically blind, this makes no sense at all. 
 Has the M.T.A. considered, just for one week, allowing ridership for 25 cents? What would happen? One week couldn't make that much more of a dent in its losses if ridership doesn't increase. On the other hand, it may be cheap enough to allow people to ride even for just 10 blocks, rather than walking, as so many of us now do. Today, it's often easier, more comfortable and certainly cheaper to walk 20 blocks (a mile) to work, and get some exercise, than to stand on the curb along with 15 others waiting for a bus that will be overcrowded and whose speed will average less than 4 miles an hour.
Raising the fare every time the M.T.A. has a loss is like the proverbial man who butts his head against a brick wall. Except that the M.T.A. doesn't stop doing it, and so it has no way of finding out what would feel good.

HEADLINE: Bids Urged For Channels

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
An agency of the Commerce Department today proposed selling most commercial broadcast channels to the highest bidder.
That recommendation and another to permit private companies to lease some channels reserved for the Government were included in a 227-page report released by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Both proposals would require Congressional approval. 
 The agency regulates the allocation of Government channels like the Federal Communications Commission oversees the distribution of commercial channels.
The agency's plan to auction off those segments of the broadcast spectrum regulated by the F.C.C. would affect frequencies assigned to radio, television, cellular telephones and two-way radio operations.
"The assignment of spectrum should be based on the same principle as the rest of our economy, and that is the free-market system," said Janice Obuchowski, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and head of agency.
In assigning channels now, the F.C.C. tries to chose groups it feels will best serve the public interest. This process is time-consuming and requires volumes of information to be submitted.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 1991, Monday

 CORRECTION:
A brief article by The Associated Press in some editions of Business Day on Thursday about the auctioning of broadcast channels referred incorrectly to a recommendation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce Department agency. The agency's plan would affect only new licenses for commercial radio frequencies assigned only to such enterprises as cellular telephones and two- way radios. The agency made no recommendation about frequencies assigned to AM and FM radio or to television.

A New Bank President For American Express

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The American Express Bank Ltd., an overseas instititution that caters to wealthy customers, yesterday named Steven D. Goldstein to be president and chief executive.
Mr. Goldstein, 39 years old, succeeds Robert A. Savage, 57, who will assume the title of chairman. Mr. Savage has run the bank, part of the American Express empire, since 1989 and developed its new marketing strategy -- seeking individuals of high net worth and their businesses. 
 Mr. Savage, who has been with the bank since 1965, will continue to sit on the board of CBI-TDB Union Bancaire Privee S.A., a Geneva bank in which American Express has an investment. He will also have direct responsibility for the International Capital Corporation, which administers the bank's portfolio of loans to less-developed countries.
Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Savage report to G. Richard Thoman, president and chief executive of American Express International.
Mr. Goldstein will continue to be responsible for the Consumer Financial Services Group of American Express International, which he has headed since its inception in 1989. The group's purpose was to focus the company's approach to the international market, and in doing so has worked closely with the American Express Bank.
Mr. Goldstein will be based in New York but said he would be spending most of his time on airplanes. The bank, barred by law from almost all United States operations, is strongest in Asia and Latin America and is working on its European market.
"As we continue to integrate the bank into the rest of the American Express business we have an opportunity to build something that's quite unbelievable," Mr. Goldstein said. "It's fair to say we are marketing-driven and consumer-driven. Add those two pieces together and as the marketplace becomes more global, we have a unique franchise around the world."
Mr. Goldstein said the bank's business had not been bad. "We made $110 million after taxes last year, and like a lot of businesses we've had our ups and downs, but on balance we turned in a very good year," he said.
Mr. Goldstein has been with American Express for nine years. Among his assignments, he has been president of Travel Related Services in Britain and Ireland. Before joining American Express, he spent eight years at Citicorp. He is a graduate of City College and holds an M.B.A. from New York University.

HEADLINE: New Beginning Pledged for Arizona

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Arizonans have elected a governor for the first time since the impeachment of Evan Mecham three years ago, but most attention here remains focused on allegations of bribery involving a number of state legislators.
 Fife Symington, a moderate Republican in his first political effort, won a narrow victory on Tuesday and described it as "a magnificent opportunity to turn things around." 
Afterward, Arizonans voiced relief that a bitter campaign that lasted nearly a year had ended, and they expressed hope that the new Governor would provide badly needed leadership and begin a healing process that will help put behind them a number of political traumas.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Symington, a Phoenix businessman, defeated Terry Goddard, a Democrat who is Mayor of Phoenix, by a vote of 52 percent to 48 percent in a runoff election that was required by law because neither candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote in last November's balloting.
 The two candidates differed more in style than in policy, and as the campaign lengthened, it grew steadily more bitter as each man tried to find and emphasize their differences. By Election Day, some Arizonans said they were voting simply to put an end to the backbiting.
 "The great mass of people out there are saying: 'The heck with you guys. You're all a bunch of crooks,' " said Joe Lane, the former Speaker of the House. "What we need is somebody who will stand up and take charge, somebody who will stand up and say, 'Follow me.' "
 
Enhanced Influence Is Seen
 Though the state's constitution describes a relatively weak role for the governor, Mr. Symington's influence is likely to be enhanced by the continuing problems in the Legislature.
 When Democrats took control of the State Senate last fall, the two branches became split politically for the first time in a decade. With the Legislature thus divided, Mr. Symington's election is expected to give the Republican Party the edge in the crucial redistricting that begins later this year.
 In addition, the Legislature, because of the ethics investigation, is expected to face a heavy turnover among its members even before the next election.
 Seven legislators and 11 other people were indicted three weeks ago on bribery and related charges after a 16-month police undercover operation. And political analysts here said they expected additional indictments.
 In the weeks that followed, videotapes were televised showing the legislators receiving packets of cash from a police agent who said he wanted to open gambling casinos.
Since then, one legislator has pleaded guilty and resigned, and there are reports that others are engaged in plea negotiations that could produce further guilty pleas. One lobbyist implicated in the operation has also pleaded guilty and has agreed to cooperate with the police.
 
Two Investigations
 The investigation, known here as "Azscam," coincided with an ethics inquiry in Washington involving both of Arizona's United States Senators.
 In that inquiry, the Senators, Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, were both criticized today by the Senate Ethics Committee for their involvement with Charles H. Keating Jr. and his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The committee's findings about Mr. DeConcini's dealings with Mr. Keating were considerably stronger than those about Mr. McCain's.
 Here in Arizona, the state legislative scandal brushed close to Mr. DeConcini as well on Tuesday when a top aide, Michael Crusa, resigned after admitting that he had accepted $10,000 from a state legislator, who he said wanted him to launder the money.
 Tuesday's runoff election was itself a symptom of the turmoil in Arizona politics.
 Mr. Mecham, a Republican and a political extremist, was elected in 1986 with less than 40 percent of the vote, and he was impeached and removed from office on charges of corruption in 1988. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, was named to complete Mr. Mecham's term, but she has not been an active figure in state politics and she announced her retirement before the election campaign.
 "We haven't really had a governor in Arizona in four or five years," Mr. Lane said.
 To prevent the future election of minority candidates like Mr. Mecham, the legislature required future candidates for governor to face a runoff election if none received more than 50 percent of the vote. Mr. Symington won the general election with 49.7 percent of the vote to Mr. Goddard's 49.2 percent. The margin was just 4,000 votes.
 
Political Shocks
 After the Mecham impeachment, Arizona suffered a series of political shocks, the latest and most stunning of which was the announcement of the legislative bribery allegations. The spectacle of police videotapes on nightly television showing elected legislators eagerly accepting bribes has been stunning and has cast a pall over state politics.
 As damaging, political analysts say, has been the cynicism about government displayed on the tapes in colorful and often earthy language by the legislators. The spectacle seems to have contributed to a measure of cynicism among the voters themselves.
 "It's real hysterical -- the sting and this crazy Governor's election and the whole bit," said Mary Ficklin, a secretary, after voting Tuesday. "You either have to laugh or cry. It's just sad that we have to pick either of the two bums."
 The corruption charges have also paralyzed the Legislature, which is now engrossed in ethics investigations and remains on tenterhooks over possible additional indictments.
 Many in the state are also embarrassed by the defeat of two referendums last November to create a paid state holiday to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 Both candidates in the gubernatorial campaign, for the most part, kept their distance from these difficult issues. Their campaigns focused on increased financing for education, economic development, water supply and the environment. The two men also aimed personal attacks at one another's finances and integrity.
