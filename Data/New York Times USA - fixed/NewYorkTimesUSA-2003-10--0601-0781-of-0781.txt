HEADLINE: Government Report Links Sports to Rising Cable Fees 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The soaring cost of sports programming has pushed up cable rates, according to a study released yesterday by the General Accounting Office. The study showed that sports costs had soared 59 percent, while overall costs of cable programming had jumped 34 percent.
 But the 94-page document did not determine whether the programmers or the cable system owners were solely to blame for the rising monthly bills that cable customers receive. 
 The study found that the average monthly bill for cable rose to $36.47 in 2002, from $26.06 in 1997, a 40 percent increase over five years. That increase, the report said, is far larger than the 12 percent rate of inflation for the period.
While the study agreed that the increase in programming costs was a major reason for the rise in cable costs, it also attributed some of that increase to the investment that cable operators were making in their infrastructures. 
The study, ordered by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona who is chairman of the Commerce Committee and a critic of cable rates, underscored how valuable competition among cable operators could be to consumers, but also showed how little competition exists.
It pointed out that in the 2 percent of the country where there is competition among cable operators, customers paid an average of 15 percent less for their service. It showed that prices declined, when the competition was between cable and satellite companies, but that it declined far less -- about 5 percent. 
"The report shows that consumers are still being ripped off by cable monopolies and competition has not arisen in a deregulated cable market," said Gene Kimmelman, director for public policy at Consumers Union. If all consumers lived in markets with two cable companies, they would save over $4 billion annually, he added.
One way to cut costs for customers has been to divide offerings, allowing consumers to select the services they want. 
But the General Accounting Office report found that was not necessarily a satisfactory strategy.
While that "approach would facilitate more subscriber choice, it would require additional technology and customer service," the report said. It added that such an approach could ultimately diminish the number of niche services.
Because fewer subscribers would see some services, the cable companies would be unable to sell their advertising for as much money. The study also noted that an a la carte structure might diminish bills for some customers, but increase those for others who took a broad number of services. 
The report confirms that cable operators are more likely to carry cable networks in which they have an interest than they are to carry unaffiliated networks. That analysis is likely to fuel opponents of media consolidation.
The study concluded, however, that cable networks owned by cable operators do not receive higher license fees. 
For all the observations and the data in the new study, media industry executives do not expect it to have much of an effect on business.
Richard Greenfield, who follows media for Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent media analysis firm, echoed the views of several others in saying, "I don't think there is anything new here that is startling new or surprising or will affect the economics of the business."

HEADLINE: The Russians Are Coming To Take Over Rouge Steel 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD and ERIN E. ARVEDLUND; Micheline Maynard reported for this article from Dearborn, Mich., and Erin E. Arvedlund from Moscow.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Rouge Steel, whose sprawling works became a symbol of raw 20th-century capitalism, may soon rest in the hands of even rawer owners: Russian investors.
 Rouge, the nation's fifth-largest steel producer, said late Thursday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and had agreed to be acquired by OAO Severstal, Russia's second-largest steel producer. 
 Financial terms were not disclosed and no timetable was set for Rouge's emergence from bankruptcy. But according to documents filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., Rouge, whose customers include the Detroit auto companies, has arranged for$120 million in debtor-in-possession financing. 
It also obtained $30 million in bridge financing from Severstal, at 15 percent interest, which finance experts deemed an unusually high lending rate, even for a bankrupt company.
A spokesman for Rouge Steel, William E. Hornberger, pointed out, however, that Rouge Steel's plight was well known. The company, founded here in 1923 as an arm of the Ford Motor Company, has not made money since 1999, and had been seeking a buyer for the last year. "Send us those banks that would give us 7.5 percent money," Mr. Hornberger said in an interview on Friday.
The transaction, which requires bankruptcy court approval, is believed to be the first instance of Russian steel company's buying an American rival and is the significant Russian investment this year in a United States company.
Earlier this year, Norilsk Nickel, Russia's largest metals mining and smelting company, paid $132 million for 55.5 percent of the Stillwater Mining Company, the only platinum and palladium producer based in the United States.
Over all, Russian investment in American companies has varied widely. It climbed from $97 million in 1999 to $118 million in 2000, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Department, then fell to $53 million in 2001 and $12 million last year. The figures reflect holdings of at least 10 percent in an American company.
Severstal, based in Cherepovets, north of Moscow and east of St. Petersburg, employs 176,000 workers at its mills, which are remnants of the state-owned steel industry. Last year, it earned $178 million on revenue of $1.9 billion.
Its executives first met with Rouge Steel officials last summer, while on a tour of American steel companies, Mr. Hornberger said. "We found them to be bright, knowledgeable and extremely technologically savvy," he said. "They are keenly interested in going global."
To finance its global push, Severstal in April obtained a two-year $50 million syndicated loan from a collection of western banks, led by Bayerisch Hypo-und Vereinsbank A.G. in Munich.
"We are excited about the opportunity to acquire Rouge, and join with its management and employees to continue to produce automotive-quality steel," Vadim A. Makov, deputy director of strategy for Severstal, said in a statement.
Severstal's purchase would allow the Russian company to sell steel in the United States and avoid tariffs that the Bush administration imposed on imported steel this year. Known as Section 201, the tariffs were intended to protect American companies from a flood of imports that have caused prices to fall to historic lows.
"This goes completely around the issue and under 201," said Rob Edwards, a metals and mining analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.
While some American steel companies have already benefited from Section 201, it has not helped Rouge Steel, which lost $31.3 million during the first half of this year, on top of $360 million in losses over the previous three years.
Nonetheless, Rouge Steel has long been a towering presence in Dearborn, where it was founded by Henry Ford 80 years ago, two decades after he began his automobile company.
When it was built, Rouge Steel was vital to Mr. Ford's determination to produce automobiles from start to finish. He shipped raw materials, including iron ore, to docks at Rouge, where it was made into steel.
The smokestacks of the steel works, captured by the photographer Charles Sheeler, still soar above the Rouge manufacturing complex on the Detroit-Dearborn border, and workers toil in some of the same buildings captured by the muralist Diego Rivera in the 1930's.
Generations of Detroiters took tours of the complex, where a feature was the giant blast furnaces, which bellowed smoke and fire.
But Rouge Steel faced stiff competition in the 1980's from foreign rivals, and Ford spun it off in 1989. Ford remains Rouge Steel's largest customer, though the mill also sells to General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation.
In recent months, the local news media has reported that Rouge executives had sought to merge with a domestic rival, including U.S. Steel, which is listed in bankruptcy documents as Rouge Steel's second-largest creditor behind Ford. But U.S. Steel did not make a bid, although Rouge Steel said it hoped to find a buyer by Sept. 30.
Joseph Phillippi, an automotive analyst with Auto Market Trends in Short Hills, N.J., said he doubted that Detroit auto companies would object to dealing with a Russian owner. "In the end, all they want is top-quality steel to their specifications -- cheap," Mr. Phillippi said.
In announcing the deal, Rouge Steel said officials of the United Automobile Workers union had agreed to discuss renegotiating their contract, which covers 1,900 of Rouge Steel's 2,600 employees. U.A.W. leaders did not return calls seeking comment.
But companies have the right under the bankruptcy code to ask a judge to throw out their labor agreements and replace them with more favorable terms, if an agreement cannot be reached with unions.
Mr. Hornberger at Rouge Steel said the company did not plan to close operations or eliminate jobs.

HEADLINE: Congress Is Close To Eliminating A Privacy Law 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Congress is poised to pass a law that would strike down groundbreaking rules in California intended to give people the power to stop banks, insurers and brokerage firms owned by the same company from swapping their financial secrets.
 The effort, spurred by banking lobbyists, is part of a broader push by the financial services industry for legislation that would permanently abolish state and local laws that could give consumers greater control over their private financial information. Federal law already includes broad provisions pre-empting state and local financial-privacy regulations, but the existing law is set to expire at the end of this year unless Congress passes new legislation. 
 The California law was passed with wide bipartisan support in Sacramento two months ago after corporate lobbyists who had derailed similar legislation before were cowed by strong public support for a proposed referendum that would have established a tougher state law. Privacy advocates, concerned about the growth of financial institutions that operate many lines of business under one roof, had hoped other states would follow California's lead by limiting how these companies can use personal financial information. 
But legislation is expected to make it to the Senate floor as soon as next week that would pre-empt much of the California law and prevent other states from taking similar steps. The bill was approved unanimously in the Senate Banking Committee last month, but Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both California Democrats, have proposed an amendment that would adopt the California rules nationally. They also propose extending the current federal law by only one year, to give Congress more time to review the issue.
In the House last month, lawmakers voted 392 to 30 for a bill that would also pre-empt the state law.
Bankers and others who object to the California law, which takes effect next July, say it would lead to an unworkable patchwork of confusing state and local rules that would make it harder and more costly for people to obtain credit.
According to its proponents, the California law is intended to protect against one of the biggest fears of privacy advocates voiced after passage in 1999 of a federal law ending the Depression-era rules that barred banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms from entering one another's businesses.
The concern was that big financial services conglomerates, newly freed to grow much larger and expand into new businesses, would establish giant databases of customer credit and financial information, like bank balances and incomes, that could be used for such things as setting mortgage rates and deciding whether to offer insurance coverage. The problem, privacy advocates say, is that all of this is happening out of the view of consumers -- who would be powerless to correct or challenge inaccurate data -- and out of reach of laws that regulate credit-reporting agencies.
In an interview, Senator Feinstein said that the banking industry was trying to make an end run to quash the new California rule and that despite strong support in California for the law it would be an "uphill fight" to win approval for her proposal in the Senate.
Her amendment, modeled on the state law, would allow people to bar financial institutions from sharing their private information with affiliates of the same company. For example, the banking subsidiary of one company could not tell its sister insurance company or brokerage firm about how much a customer had on deposit, or details of their credit card debts or mortgage payments. A narrow exemption would be allowed for companies that are in the same line of business, have the same regulator, are wholly owned subsidiaries and operate under the same brand name.
Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said that without the California law, "the door will be open to a lot of abuses when banks can share their information with thousands of corporate affiliates, even after consumers say no."
But the Senate bill's sponsor, Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said his bill had strong consumer protections. "Will it satisfy everybody? No. Nothing does," Mr. Shelby said. "But it's a pretty good piece of legislation that will withstand scrutiny" and is a "big improvement" over the House version. 
Mr. Shelby's bill seeks to tighten credit-reporting standards, give consumers easier access to their credit reports, and make identity theft more difficult.
Edward Yingling, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association, added that allowing states to enforce their own conflicting financial-privacy rules would create a mess of regulations that would impair consumers' ability to obtain loans. "With the way our economy works and with the mobility of our society these days, it's an area where you need to have a national rule," he said.
Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group, said he was "very disappointed" the Senate bill did not protect the California law. But he said Mr. Shelby, whom he described as generally strong on privacy rights, might have been "boxed in" politically and may have thought it impossible to pass a bill with protections similar to the California law. 
Over all, Mr. Mierzwinski said, the Senate bill is stronger than the House bill.

HEADLINE: Les Miserables 

BYLINE:  By Linda Koike; Linda Koike is Paris editor for the newsletter Paris Notes.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The nearest freestanding pay toilet, or sanisette, to my house is in the Place Monge, cunningly disguised as a kiosk covered with film posters. Having never ventured into a sanisette, much preferring to use the pay toilets that abound in cafes and department stores, I approached it reluctantly. I had the required coins (two 20-cent pieces) ready to put into the slot when I saw that the red occupied sign was showing, so I waited. Finally, the door opened and a homeless man, a clochard, stumbled out, fell to his knees and passed out. This was not at all encouraging. 
 Still, I inserted my coins. The door slid open and I stepped inside a tiny circular room made entirely of molded plastic. The automatic door closed behind me and I was at once overwhelmed by a heady mix of disinfectant and rancid clochard. The toilet seat appeared clean if wet. The little sink, however, was filled with something nasty that I did not linger to examine. I almost wept with relief when the door actually opened and let me out: a sanisette is my Room 101. 
 The New York City Council last week cleared the way for the installation of similar toilets in New York, a city where the ability to find a restroom (by say, knowing where they are hidden away in hotel lobbies and department stores or by slipping unobtrusively into restaurants) has long been a survival skill. But if this city's experience is any guide, New Yorkers may want to concentrate less on sanisettes and more on the other ways Parisians find relief. 
Paris has experimented with several varieties of pay toilets. Various primitive forms have been available to Parisians since 1568, and in the 1830's the city formally took up the question as part of a huge urban renewal program. By 1843, there were 468 "vespasiennes" -- open-air toilet stalls with running water to cleanse them -- named after the Emperor Vespasian, who imposed a tax on the public latrines of first-century Rome. At the beginning of the 20th century there were 1,600 such toilets for men and 112 for women in Paris. The city also installed many underground toilets where a cleaner-guardian, a "Dame Pipi," welcomed visitors for a small fee, including a splendidly decorated one in the Luxembourg gardens.
The first sanisettes appeared on Paris streets in 1980 to general public approval -- essentially because they were less smelly and unpleasant than the open-air variety (only two vespasiennes remain in existence). To the 420 pay sanisettes already in place, the city of Paris has just decided to add 120 free sanisettes for the homeless. Since JCDecaux, the French company that invented these fully automatic, self-cleaning toilets, receives 6.2 million euros a year from the city, plus an average 150,000 euros monthly from entry fees, one must assume that lots of people are using them.
But who are all these users? Not one of my friends admitted to having ever personally used one, or knew who else might have done so. Claustrophobia and an awful dread of being trapped in the toilet should the automatic door refuse to open were given as reasons for their reluctance. Some mentioned Benoit Duteurtre's frightening story in "Drole de Temps" about a young man imprisoned in a sanisette and waiting in terror to be ground to a pulp by the automatic cleaning mechanism. There was also the fear that there might be a repeat performance of an incident in 1995 in which a bomb was placed in a sanisette. Another timorous friend said that after reading a Stephen King horror story in which the protagonist entered a sanisette and was sucked into some other dimension, she had no desire to discuss toilets of any kind. Some friends had observed that women in general do not use sanisettes unless they have a trustworthy friend standing guard outside. 
Doubtless, the irrational fears of a few overimaginative Parisians are not what worry pragmatic New Yorkers about sanisettes: they simply do not want them taking up sidewalk space near their homes or the undesirable clientele they may attract -- as they do in Paris, where the sanisettes seem to be frequently vandalized. However, since decent, reasonably priced public toilets are obviously essential in every city, one wonders why New Yorkers do not refurbish the toilets in their numerous well-patrolled subway stations, with their own American version of the dauntless French Dames Pipi to guard them. 
Perhaps the New York City Council could send a delegation to Paris to witness the ferocity of these intrepid toilet-tenders, who brook no nonsense from prostitutes, drug addicts or any other riffraff -- and guard and clean their territory with evident pride. This would allay any doubts that the council members might have about maintaining safe public toilets with attendants, and thereby not only answer a real public need, but also calm the fear and trembling of visitors suffering from claustrophobia. As the toilet-tenders are paid from the fees and tips they receive from users, this endeavor would not necessarily be that costly to the city of New York. 
New Yorkers may turn out to love their plastic pay toilets. But as for me, my first visit to the sanisette was my last.

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Leaping Forward Online, With Amazon as Her Guide

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
PEGGY YU requires all employees at her online book business here to read "E-Commerce Empire: The Legend of Amazon." She sifts for fresh ideas by analyzing Amazon's latest database and customer-service innovations. She still recalls her husband's reaction when she first showed him the Amazon Web site.
 "His eyes just sparkled," she said of her husband and business partner, Li Guoqing. "He told me, 'That's the future of bookselling in China.' " 
 "Eventually, we want to be bigger than Amazon," Mr. Li added. "We want to be bigger than eBay."
"Oh, please," Ms. Yu interrupted, almost blushing. "He is a visionary and full of ambition, while I'm better at execution."
Officially, Ms. Yu is the co-founder and co-president of Dangdang.com, China's biggest online bookseller. But she and her husband are so obsessed with the successes and failures of Amazon.com that she may as well be dubbed China's Amazon lady.
While Ms. Yu's business has grown quickly, analysts and publishing executives are still skeptical that her company will thrive soon in a country where the Internet and the exchange of free information remain subject to the whims of China's authorities, and where people are still reluctant to order online.
Even so, Ms. Yu has already made her mark as a savvy student of consumer behavior, by tracking people's evolving preferences for books, movies and music. She is one link in a new bridge between two cultures, built of aspiring entrepreneurs educated in the United States who have returned to China to pursue their ambitions in the world's fastest growing economy. 
For Ms. Yu, 38, it has been a long journey from her turbulent childhood shuttling between Wuxi, Shanghai and Sichuan, against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution. Her parents, both engineers, were sent to re-education camps. But she scratched her way to college in Beijing, then made her way to America, earning an M.B.A. from New York University.
She became an investment banker in Manhattan, and lived on West 77th Street, near Central Park West. Her son, Alexander, known as Xander, was born in New York in 1997. 
"I'm a die-hard Upper West Sider," she said, reminiscing about her frequent trips to Zabar's, Fairway and Barnes & Noble.
In 1996, she met Mr. Li at an East Village bistro, while he was attending the graduation of a friend from Columbia University. Love bloomed. Marriage beckoned. Because Mr. Li -- who does not speak much English -- had a number of businesses in China, including a successful book business, she decided to return home.
When the couple contemplated selling books online, they studied Amazon, and quickly recognized that one of Amazon's advantages was its immense database of book and music titles. China had no equivalent database. So, over the next three years, they constructed their own, accumulating more than 200,000 titles.
In late 1999, Ms. Yu unveiled Dangdang.com. (pronounced DONG-DONG) The name comes from three main sources: a Chinese expression, xiang dangdang, which means excellent; an onomatopoeic coinage based on the sound of a cash register opening and closing; and an echo of a popular Japanese animated character, a cat named Doraemon, who is known as xiao dingdang in Chinese.
In a country where only 8 million out of 68 million Internet users have ever shopped online, Ms. Yu says that the learning curve has been steep.
"It's really a great leap forward from visiting a physical store to shopping online," she said. "Half the calls we get are 'How do you order online? What does it mean by shopping cart?' "
It has been equally daunting to convince consumers to use plastic over cash, especially given the complicated rules for credit cards drawn up by banks in some areas. So Dangdang uses 30 bicycle courier companies in 12 cities to deliver the products and collect the cash, which is then wired to Dangdang.
"To support e-commerce, Dangdang has to run a show like Amazon, just without the plastic and U.P.S. or FedEx equivalent," said Ms. Yu, who once interned at U.P.S. 
After starting out in a space smaller than Ms. Yu's living room, the company now barely fits into its fourth warehouse, a 25,000-square-foot building in southwest Beijing. It handles up to 4,000 orders a day -- about half books and the rest videos, CD's, computer games and software.
Ms. Yu runs her company, and her 149 employees, with a meticulous hand. The company organizes study groups to read and discuss books like "One to One Marketing" and articles from The Harvard Business Review.
She visits the warehouse regularly, and carries tiny notebooks to jot down observations in Chinese and English. On a recent visit, for instance, she noticed that a video for the Chinese classic novel "The Dream of the Red Chamber," was not in its proper place.
"I have to get the name of the person in charge," she said.
Ms. Yu is a numbers person, and pores over reports on shipping orders, data input accuracy and delivery times. As a result, she has determined that the typical Dangdang customer is a man between 25 and 35, who shops during lunch at work or just before the end of the workday, but rarely over the weekend. How-to books on business and parenting are hot. Thrillers and diet books are not.
DANGDANG has its own best-seller list, and solicits readers' reviews, similar to Amazon. Readers' preferences vary from region to region. Shanghai is into lifestyle and "petit-bourgeois books," Ms. Yu said, on how to make iced tea and floral arrangements. Shenzhen wants get-rich guides. Beijing prefers books on business management, novels and foreign language lessons.
China being China, Ms. Yu is often asked by foreign reporters about censorship. In general, she steers clear of offering books on politics, so as not to attract the scrutiny of China's authorities. Otherwise, she says, the contents of her books are usually the responsibility of the publisher. 
While Ms. Yu has succeeded tiptoeing along such self-imposed limits, these kinds of inhibitions, China scholars say, are likely to limit the viability of Internet businesses -- particularly those that traffic in information or anything politically sensitive.
Dangdang posted its first profit in December. But it remains difficult for any e-commerce business to make money in China.
Ms. Yu said she had no plans to make a public stock offering, but she would not rule out selling Dangdang to a bigger company -- like, say, Amazon. The company plans to diversify by selling gifts, office supplies and possibly even concert and airplane tickets.
Diversify, she adds, just as Amazon did.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: RECONSTRUCTION; 
OVER $13 BILLION IN AID IS PLEDGED TO REBUILD IRAQ

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Dale Fuchs contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
The United States, completing an extraordinary campaign for economic aid to Iraq, won commitments on Friday of at least $13 billion over five years for reconstruction of water, power, health care and other systems devastated by the American invasion six months ago.
 The total surpassed what many had expected, although roughly two-thirds of the aid appeared to be in the form of loans rather than grants, which might complicate efforts by the Bush administration to beat back a drive in Congress to make more American aid in the form of loans. 
 Administration officials have said repeatedly that Iraq needs grants and cannot afford to add to its debt.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell hailed the $13 billion sum as larger than the Bush administration expected only a few weeks ago, when he said some colleagues were considering whether to call off the meeting of donors here. 
"But here we are, and we've had a very successful conference," Mr. Powell said, adding that the estimated total was at the "low end." A senior American official said afterward that the number might grow by as much as $4 billion.
Exactly how much of the figure mentioned Friday was in the form of grants was not immediately clear. But it appeared that total grants between now and the end of 2004 would come to between $3 billion and $4 billion. 
While some donors -- which include both nations and institutions -- said that was close to what Iraq could realistically absorb, American officials said the country could use far more in grants right away.
Some donors apparently pledged sums that they had already announced and transmitted earlier. Others included import credits, relief assistance -- including $500,000 worth of rice from Vietnam -- or other items not on the list of reconstruction and security needs for which the Madrid conference was called. Nor is it clear how much money will be available how soon.
Arab nations did not come through with the large number of grants that the administration had sought, in part because of antipathy toward the war in Iraq and, more recently, the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The United Arab Emirates offered $200 million to $250 million. Saudi Arabia offered $1 billion in low-cost loans and an additional $500 million to finance Saudi export credits. Kuwait came up with $500 million. 
Most loans come not from countries but from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which will most likely have to negotiate the terms of their aid along with a plan to reschedule and perhaps forgive at least some of Iraq's existing $120 billion in debts, according to World Bank officials.
The senior administration official said that while much of the money would be received as loans, interest rates and repayment schedules would be highly favorable to Iraq. Loans, he added, will supply quick infusions of cash to get construction projects going quickly.
Asked why loans were acceptable from the international agencies and other donors but not from Congress, American officials said that they had to recognize the reality of donor finances and that this did not diminish the need for Congress to provide grants.
"Sure, we prefer grants," Treasury Secretary John Snow said. "But what we really are counting on here is financial support, lines of credit, money in the bank that can be drawn on to finance the rebuilding of Iraq."
As delegates left Madrid on Friday evening, many questions remained about the sums pledged. Many development officials cautioned, for example, that the nations pledging them might not live up to their promises. That is what has happened, at least in part, with the $5 billion raised for Afghanistan last year.
The biggest unanswered question, many delegates said, is whether the troubled security situation in Iraq will prevent the aid from being delivered.
"Security is a problem," Mr. Powell said at a news conference closing the meeting. "We don't deny it. But we are confident that security will improve in a manner that will permit reconstruction to accelerate."
The $13 billion in loans and grants pledged here, if they materialize, could be added to the $20 billion that Congress is expected to approve for Iraq's reconstruction and security needs. The combined total of $33 billion falls substantially short of the $55 billion that the World Bank and the United States assessed as Iraq's needs in the next four years.
But development officials also say that $33 billion for one country over four or five years dwarfs what other impoverished or war-torn countries have received in the modern history of aid projects.
Moreover, administration officials emphasized that the money pledged here would be supplemented by future pledges and by $15 billion in oil revenues from 2005 to 2007, assuming that the Iraqi oil industry gets back on its feet.
The sums were announced at the end of a long day of speeches and presentations by envoys from more than 70 countries and organizations. During the day, American officials insisted that they did not know what the total would be by sundown. Some said the totals might not become clear for weeks.
Accompanying the pledges were heated demands and warnings from donor nations and from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions that the United States and Iraq must do a better job in disclosing how money is spent.
"So far there hasn't been a good accounting of how the money was used," said Mark Malloch Brown, head of the United Nations Development Program, referring to the several billion dollars already spent in Iraq from oil revenues and seized Iraqi assets.
American officials bridled at those accusations, saying there had been a full accounting even though it had not yet been made public. L. Paul Bremer III, administrator of the American-led Iraqi occupation, said the accounting would be on a Web site soon.
Immediate grants are the highest priority for American officials, but the exact amount of these was not clear on Friday night. The total pledged by the European Union and individual European countries was about $800 million. Conspicuous by their absence as individual donors were Germany and France, vigorous opponents of the war.
Iran, a longtime enemy of Saddam Hussein, came gladly to the conference. American officials avoided the delegation, in keeping with the administration's characterization of Iran as a potential nuclear-armed threat to peace and part of an "axis of evil."
Many Iraqis are themselves wary of Iran's apparent attempts to extend its influence. Iran announced that it would subsidize 100,000 tourists and Muslim pilgrims a month in Iraq, generating $500 million a year for Iraq. This money was not counted here as aid. Aid officials said that despite what American officials had said about the need for grants rather than loans, it was highly unrealistic to think that all aid could be in the form of grants.
Indeed, Mr. Malloch Brown of the United Nations backed the Bush administration's request for grants from Congress but said that if Iraq received all of its aid as grants, money for other impoverished regions of the world would effectively dry up.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about the conference of donor nations held in Madrid to rebuild Iraq referred incorrectly to the factors that depleted Iraq's water, power, health care and other basic systems. They suffered from years of war and neglect, as well as from the effects of the invasion six months ago and the looting and sabotage that followed. The American invasion was not the sole cause of the devastation.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE OVERVIEW; 
HUNG JURY ENDS TRIAL OF BANKER

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
A federal judge declared a mistrial yesterday in the obstruction of justice trial of Frank P. Quattrone, the Wall Street banker whose pay and deals made him a vivid symbol of the 1990's technology boom.
 Judge Richard Owen of Federal District Court in Manhattan declared the mistrial after the 11-member jury reported that it remained deadlocked on all three counts after nearly six full days of deliberations. 
 The trial of Mr. Quattrone, who led the initial stock offerings of companies like Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, has been the most prominent Wall Street criminal case since that of Michael R. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six securities charges in 1990. Like Mr. Milken, Mr. Quattrone, who earned $120 million in one year during the peak of the bubble, created a money machine that helped fuel a wave of innovation and a stock bubble. Page C1. 
The case against Mr. Quattrone, who took several nervous gulps of water as he stood stone-faced moments before the judge declared the mistrial, hinged on a single e-mail message that he had forwarded in December 2000 to his staff of bankers at Credit Suisse First Boston, endorsing a colleague's directions to follow the company's document retention policy and "clean up those files." Just days earlier, he had learned that subpoenas had been issued by a grand jury and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which were investigating whether the bank was making investors pay it kickbacks in exchange for access to hot stock offerings.
The outcome is a serious setback for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which has long been the front line in prosecution of corporate and Wall Street misconduct. Prosecutors had indicated that they would retry the case in the event of a mistrial, but said yesterday that no decision had been made.
The mistrial may also significantly influence how that office approaches a raft of coming corporate criminal trials, legal experts said, in particular that of Martha Stewart, who, like Mr. Quattrone, is accused of obstructing justice.
"For other corporate criminal defendants waiting in the wings, it is a good sign that the environment for taking these cases to trial may not be as toxic as many people thought," said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at McCarter & English. "The government's inability to make the charges stick suggests jurors were able to focus on the evidence and insulate their deliberations from any general outrage that they may feel toward Wall Street."
But one juror, Mayo Villalona, said yesterday that as many as eight jurors had wanted to find Mr. Quattrone guilty. Mr. Villalona, who supported an acquittal, said that if Mr. Quattrone had not taken the stand in his defense, he would probably have been acquitted.
"I heard a lot of jurors say if he hadn't been a witness, it would have been not guilty the first day," said Mr. Villalona, a 26-year-old Manhattan resident who works at HSBC Holdings.
Indeed, Mr. Quattrone, 48, often appeared evasive during cross-examination. At one point during the trial, he seemed to contradict his own testimony when he said that he had participated in the allocations for some stock offerings after telling jurors just a day earlier that the allocation process was "something that happened in a different department than mine."
The acknowledgment came after prosecutors presented scores of e-mail messages that showed him repeatedly involved in trying to influence which clients received shares, offering a telling glimpse into the inner workings of Wall Street during the late 1990's.
First Boston paid $100 million in 2001 to settle accusations by the S.E.C. and NASD, the regulator for the Nasdaq market, that it received kickbacks from hedge funds for access to offerings. It neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
Yesterday, Mr. Quattrone's lead lawyer, John W. Keker, told reporters after the mistrial was declared, "We are disappointed because Frank is innocent." With Mr. Quattrone standing silently next to him, Mr. Keker, a former prosecutor of Oliver L. North during the Iran-Contra trial, said, "Frank Quattrone is a man of integrity and is a man who has followed the rules."
At least some jurors were not persuaded that Mr. Quattrone chose to "encourage his employees to clean out their files even though he knew that there was a grand jury subpoena seeking some of those files," as David Anders, an assistant United States attorney, argued.
Prosecutors presented evidence that Mr. Quattrone, who was one of the first Wall Street bankers to set up shop in Silicon Valley in the 1980's, was told about grand jury and S.E.C. investigations on Dec. 3, 2000, and then sent an e-mail message to the technology investment bankers at First Boston sanctioning the destruction of documents on Dec. 5, 2000.
Only one First Boston employee testified that she destroyed a handful of documents.
Mr. Quattrone contended throughout the trial that when he sent his e-mail message, he had not been explicitly told about the scope of the investigation. He testified that First Boston's general counsel at the time, David M. Brodsky, told him that the investigation "was about hedge funds, commissions and allocation" -- activities he contended his investment bankers were not involved with and did not have files about.
Mr. Quattrone insisted repeatedly that if First Boston's lawyers had told him that the document retention policy was suspended he would never have sent the e-mail message.
But the prosecution painted a much different story, calling Mr. Brodsky as a witness who testified that he told Mr. Quattrone "the investigation is going to turn in the direction of getting information from you" during a call just eight hours before he sent his e-mail message. 
The idea for sending the original e-mail message about the document retention policy was introduced on Dec. 4 by Richard Char, a banker at First Boston. Mr. Char, without any knowledge of the investigations, proposed to his superiors that they send out such a notice because of the possibility of civil lawsuits over the collapse of many technology stocks they had underwritten.
"Today, it's administrative housekeeping. In January, it could be improper destruction of evidence," Mr. Char wrote in his proposal to two of his superiors. The message had also been copied to Mr. Quattrone and a First Boston lawyer based in the firm's office in Palo Alto, Calif. 
John Hodge, Mr. Char's boss, told Mr. Char to send the e-mail message out under the names of Mr. Hodge and Mr. Char as well as that of another colleague, also unaware of the investigation. The lawyer, who had not been told about the investigations either, never responded.
Mr. Quattrone, who had been notified of the investigations by Mr. Brodsky a day earlier, replied to Mr. Char's message, "You shouldn't make jokes like that on e-mail." This was an apparent reference to Mr. Char's line about destruction of evidence.
Mr. Char then sent the notice.
The next day, Mr. Brodsky talked to Mr. Quattrone by phone and told him more about the investigations, which he had first disclosed to Mr. Quattrone in an e-mail message on Dec. 3. During that phone call, Mr. Brodsky told Mr. Quattrone that he might need to hire a personal lawyer because he could be called as a witness related to the investigations.
That same morning, First Boston's lawyers in New York told Mr. Char separately that he should not have sent his notice and that they would send another notice that day rescinding his e-mail message.
They did not do so until two days later. But that evening, before Mr. Quattrone left the office, he pressed "reply to all" on Mr. Char's message and endorsed it. 
"Having been a key witness in a securities litigation case in south Texas," Mr. Quattrone wrote, "I strongly advise you to follow these procedures."
During his closing argument, Mr. Keker, Mr. Quattrone's lawyer, said his client "was a victim of a multicar train wreck, a multicar collision on the information superhighway."
Even if Mr. Quattrone is not retried, the charges against him, which also included witness tampering, effectively ended an extraordinary career on Wall Street. He was forced to resign from First Boston in March and still faces charges from NASD, which has accused him of violating several securities regulations.
As he left the courthouse uncharacteristically somber and silent, Mr. Quattrone was asked if he was looking forward to returning to his home near San Francisco. For a brief moment his trademark grin returned. "Yes, I am," he said.

HEADLINE: Cleaner at Wal-Mart Tells of Few Breaks and Low Pay 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Every night for months, Victor Zavala Jr., who was arrested on Thursday in a 21-state immigration raid, said he showedup at the Wal-Mart store in New Jersey to clean floors.
 As the store's regular employees left at 11 p.m., Mr. Zavala said, they often asked him whether he ever got a night off. 
 Mr. Zavala, identified by federal agents as an illegal immigrant from Mexico, told the Wal-Mart workers that he and four others employed by a cleaning contractor worked at the Wal-Mart in Old Bridge every night of the year, except Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
Now Mr. Zavala feels cheated, saying he worked as hard as he could pursuing the American dream, only to face an immigration hearing that could lead to deportation for himself, his wife, Eunice, and their three children, 10, 7 and 5 years old. He was one of 250 janitors employed by Wal-Mart contractors who were arrested at 60 Wal-Mart stores before dawn on Thursday.
"My family's not happy about this," said Mr. Zavala, who said he paid a "coyote" $2,000 to smuggle him into the United States three years ago. "My children do not want to leave and go back to Mexico."
A federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said yesterday that several current and former cleaning contractors for Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, were cooperating with the government in its investigation. On Thursday, federal officials acknowledged that they had wiretaps and recordings of conversations and meetings among Wal-Mart executives and contractors.
Federal officials said that as part of the Thursday raid, they searched the office of a middle-level manager at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. The officials said the government believed that Wal-Mart executives knew the cleaning contractors were using illegal immigrants. 
Federal officials noted that 102 illegal immigrants working for Wal-Mart cleaning contractors had been arrested in 1998 and 2001 and that 13 Wal-Mart cleaning contractors had pleaded guilty after those arrests. Those pleas remain under court seal.
Wal-Mart said yesterday that it had begun an internal investigation and would dismiss anyone in its work force who did not have proper immigration papers. Wal-Mart also told its officials to preserve any documents that might be relevant to the federal inquiry, which is being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Wal-Mart officials said that the raid surprised them, and that they had no idea the company's cleaning contractors used illegal immigrants.
They acknowledged yesterday that 10 immigrants arrested on Thursday in Arizona and Kentucky were employed directly by Wal-Mart. Company officials said they had brought these workers in-house after certain stores phased out the use of the contractors for whom the immigrants had worked.
Wal-Mart officials also said the company required its contractors to hire legal workers only.
"We have seen no evidence thus far that anyone in Wal-Mart is involved in any scheme involving illegal workers," Tom Williams, a company spokesman, said.
Government officials and Walmart executives declined yesterday to name the cleaning contractors whose employees were arrested.
"These arrests are part of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement mission and part of our continuing commitment to investigate companies that are hiring individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States," said Garrison Courtney, a spokesman for the immigration agency.
Federal officials said yesterday that the leading nation of origin for the janitors caught in Thursday's raids was Mexico, with 90. The Czech Republic was second with 35, followed by Mongolia with 22, Brazil with 20. Uzbekistan, Poland, Russia, Georgia and Lithuania each had about a dozen.
Mr. Zavala, the janitor in Old Bridge, N.J., said he got his job shortly after arriving in the United States, when a neighbor asked whether he wanted work cleaning buildings. Mr. Zavala, 28, said he did not know the name of his boss. 
Mr. Zavala said he believed that the Wal-Mart managers knew the janitors were illegal immigrants.
"Deep in their minds, of course the store managers knew it," he said. "The other guys from the crew didn't speak one word of English. Of course they knew it, but if you asked them, they'll say 'we thought they were citizens or residents.' "
Mr. Zavala said the contractor that he and Eunice, his wife, worked for paid them $400 a week each for working 56 hours. That would come to $6.25 an hour if time and a half overtime is included for all hours worked in excess of 40. 
"We don't know nothing about days off," said Mr. Zavala, whose hometown is Mexico City. "We don't know nothing about nights off, we don't know health insurance, we don't know life insurance, and we don't know anything about 401(k) plans."
He said that when he was arrested and taken to a detention center in Newark, immigration officials mocked him for taking a job that paid so little in a state where rents and living expenses are so high. He said that in his 16 months as a cleaner at Wal-Mart, he was given only two nights off.
He said he did not think that the contractor withheld taxes from his pay, raising questions about whether the contractor was making the required contributions for Social Security and unemployment insurance.
Misha Firer, an illegal immigrant from Russia, said he worked for three months last year as a cleaner at Wal-Marts in Ephrata, Pa., and Glens Falls, N.Y., working 90 consecutive days without having a day off.
Mr. Firer said that he earned $6 an hour, working the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, washing, waxing and buffing floors. He said the chemicals were so strong that some workers had nose bleeds, sore eyes and skin irritations.
"Nobody wanted to take the job," he said. "It was a night job and it paid very little."

HEADLINE: Democrats on Iraq 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Those of us who opposed the president's $87 billion blank check for Iraq and Afghanistan, did not, as David Brooks claimed ("The Good, the Bad, the Ugly," column, Oct. 18) vote to "choke off the funds" for our efforts. 
 Because President Bush lacked an adequate plan for postwar Iraq and failed to build a coalition of our allies, American soldiers are taking virtually all the risks and American taxpayers are paying virtually all the bills. 
Democrats offered a constructive alternative that would have spent an additional $4.6 billion to protect United States forces and would have converted half of the reconstruction aid to loans through the World Bank, costing American taxpayers less, avoiding an increase in the deficit, and encouraging greater international participation.
Democrats will continue to demand that the president develop a plan that ensures mission success by protecting our troops and encouraging other countries to contribute with manpower and money.

HEADLINE: A Visitor From China Eclipses Bush's Stop in Australia 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, addressed Australia's Parliament on Friday, a privilege accorded to him just one day after President Bush, and a juxtaposition almost inconceivable even a year ago in a nation long fearful of China. 
 Mr. Hu officially laid out in his speech what has become obvious: Australia's natural resources, particularly oil and gas, are playing a critical role in fueling China's fast-growing economy. 
 But in his parliamentary appearance, Mr. Hu went beyond economics by painting China as an all-around global player that was reaching out for broad diplomatic and cultural relations, including an increase in the already tens of thousands of Chinese students attending Australian universities. 
In contrast, Mr. Bush in his address on Thursday, dwelled on a narrow agenda of the campaign against terrorism, and his gratitude to Australia for sending troops to Iraq. 
The biggest difference was in style, with an almost complete role reversal of what might be expected. The Chinese leader was gregarious; the American president, aloof. 
Mr. Bush left after 21 hours in Australia, stuck to this sleepy capital, and was whisked around in motorcades on routes swept clear of ordinary people. He declined to hold a news conference, and was criticized in the usually pro-American press here for offering little beyond a pledge to complete the outline of a free trade agreement with Australia soon. 
Mr. Hu is lingering for three days. He took the traditional outing for visiting dignitaries -- a cruise on Sydney's splendid harbor. He met with Australian business executives at a working lunch, and, in an unusual move for a Chinese leader, held a news conference, albeit a fairly scripted affair.
"Bush came, Hu conquered," headlined the Financial Review, the conservative, business newspaper.
To reinforce the Chinese leader's theme, the two sides signed a letter of intent for a $21 billion deal calling for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to take an equity stake in an Australian natural gas field, and to buy the gas over a 25-year period.
The deal, slightly bigger than a similar one between China and Australia last year, would "lock in" Australia as Beijing's biggest gas provider, the minister for trade, Mark Vaile said.
Speaking to Parliament, whose members had been specially recalled to hear the back-to-back presidents, Mr. Hu stressed that "China and Australia are highly complementary economically." 
This appeared to be largely a reference to the vast quantities and types of Australian natural resources: iron ore and alumina, as well as natural gas. China is now Australia's third largest trading partner, and could replace Japan as the largest within five years, Australian officials said.
Since Mr. Howard became prime minister in 1996, trade between China and Australia has tripled, an important factor in Australia's prosperity.
In choosing to give Mr. Bush and Mr. Hu what amounted to symbolic parity, Mr. Howard was making a keen departure for Australian foreign policy, analysts here said. 
Mr. Howard's mentor in politics, Prime Minister Robert Menzies, regularly won re-election in the 1950's and 1960's with campaigns based on the threat of Communist China and with campaign literature illustrated with bold red arrows descending on Australia from China in the north. 
During a Labor government, Australia opened diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1973 but for years afterward, many Australians regarded China as Red China. 
In his welcome to Mr. Hu in Parliament on Friday, Mr. Howard said that Australia would have "close but different relationships" with China and the United States.
Mr. Howard suggested that Australia did not have to choose between the United States and China but needed each for particular reasons.
The United States would continue to provide the security and military alliances that Australia, as an isolated and sparsely populated country, feels it needs. China would rapidly become Australia's paramount trading partner and replace Japan as Australia's main link to Asia.
By pulling off lucrative natural resource contracts with China and welcoming more than 20,000 Chinese students to Australia, and promising to take more, Mr. Howard was able to overcome the criticism that he was ignoring Asia, analysts said.
"For Howard, Asia is China," said Hugh White, the director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and a former senior official in the Australian defense department. 
But having China as its main Asian trading partner was likely to present some new problems for Australia, particularly in its relationship with the United States, Mr. White said.
Because Japan is a treaty ally with the United States, Australia's trading relationship with Japan presented few problems for Australia in its dealings with Washington. In the future, that is unlikely to be the case with China.
In his speech, Mr. Hu made certain that Australia did not miss that point. He called on Australia to play a "constructive role in China's peaceful reunification" with Taiwan.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 31, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a speech to the Australian Parliament by China's president, Hu Jintao, misstated the date of the two countries' establishment of diplomatic relations. It was Dec. 21, 1972, not 1973.

HEADLINE: Japan Succumbs to Its Own Pork 

 BODY:
America's agricultural policies may be outrageous, but when it comes to coddling powerful farming interests, Japan leads the way. That's important to the rest of the world because Japan's determination to protect its farmers at all costs helps reinforce the international status quo, in which rich countries demand that poor countries open markets to manufactured goods even as the rich nations throw up barriers to imported farm products. It's also a stunning example of how agricultural protectionism can hurt a nation's general welfare. 
 Japan's latest self-inflicted wound occurred last week, when President Vicente Fox of Mexico was in Tokyo expecting to sign a trade agreement the two nations had spent a year negotiating. The Japanese government got cold feet and backed out under intense pressure from domestic pork and orange juice producers, which worried about having to compete with Mexican imports. Parliamentary elections are around the corner, and the governing Liberal Democratic Party has long counted farmers among its core supporters. Maybe later, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is now telling Mr. Fox. 
 This was a terrible blow to Japan's industrial groups, particularly the carmakers. Japan's automobile manufacturers compete at a terrible disadvantage within Mexico, given that country's free trade deals with the United States and the European Union. Companies like Nissan and Toyota are dismayed that Japan's broader economic interests have once again been hijacked by inefficient, yet politically powerful, farmers.
This is the reason Japan, though the world's second-largest economy, fails to play a constructive role -- let alone to exert any leadership -- at the World Trade Organization. This failure is all the more poignant, and morally indefensible, given that Japan owes its prosperity to others' willingness to import its manufactured goods.
The primary victims of this intransigence are not only the likes of Toyota and Nissan, but the voiceless poor farmers in developing nations who are hurt when rich nations close off their markets to imports, or depress world commodity prices by subsidizing their own farmers.
Industrial groups and consumers within Japan pay dearly to keep inefficient rice farmers in business and must become far more vocal in attacking the current policy.
For his part, Prime Minister Koizumi's ambition to become a forceful leader and reformer will remain unfulfilled until he takes on his country's self-defeating protectionism.

But on the book's back side, you will find a colorful full-page poster of a handsome civilian with a winning smile and the unmistakable ambition to commit more than military history. 
"Winning Modern Wars" turns out to be aptly wrapped. For its 200 pages, many of them updated just a month ago, are obviously designed to abet the swift transformation of a once embittered warrior and armchair television analyst into a hard-driving, platitudinous candidate for president. 
That jacket speaks louder than the coy words with which Clark denies any partisan purpose. He allows that while writing he heard "continuing speculation about whether I might engage in some manner" -- sic! -- "in the 2004 election." But that "looming decision had no bearing on my analysis." His only aim, he insists, is to give voice to the soldiers "far from home, in an uncertain mission," because they "cannot and should not speak for themselves." 
Well, those soldiers and their fellow citizens can vote. And the general cannot camouflage the partisan thrust of his polemic. His deft review of the battlefield tactics that won Baghdad in less than a month is merely the preface to a bitter, global indictment of George W. Bush. The president and his administration are condemned for recklessly squandering a brilliant military performance on the wrong war at the worst possible time, diverting resources and talent from the pursuit of Al Qaeda, neglecting urgent domestic needs and dissipating the post-9/11 sympathy and support of most of the world. 
No credit even for the one thing that Clark admires about the American performance in Iraq. He recounts with relish the "synchronization of high-tech airpower with agile ground maneuvers" -- how the rapid advance of armor forced Iraqi units to move and expose themselves to air and rocket attacks, which in turn facilitated more ground advances. But "the irony is that the vision of . . . a high-tech battlefield, viewed through an array of sensors, with battles fought and won by precision strikes and a slimmer ground component -- which the Bush administration, and especially Donald Rumsfeld, have trumpeted, is largely a reality that they inherited when they took office in 2001." 
In any case, the war in Iraq, though generally well fought, was a costly diversion. "Taking down Saddam became a hobbyhorse" for the group around Rumsfeld even before they achieved authority over the Pentagon. And they exploited 9/11 as "a gift-wrapped opportunity" to try to "clean up the Middle East." So instead of concentrating on a "knockout blow" against Al Qaeda, they turned the focus to Iraq and let the terrorists scatter from Afghanistan. 
As portrayed by Clark, the attack on Saddam Hussein -- without evidence to link him to Al Qaeda -- was not only wrong but deeply cynical. It bespoke a cold war mind-set of assigning terrorists a state sponsor, a "face" that could be more easily attacked. "It was almost certain to be successful. It emphasized U.S. military strengths and built on a decade of preparation for a refight of the gulf war." 
The benefit of toppling Hussein is only faintly acknowledged: "All else being equal the region and the Iraqi people were all better off with Saddam gone. But the U.S. actions against old adversaries like Saddam have costs and consequences that may still leave us far short of our objectives of winning the war on terror -- or, in themselves, may actually detract from our larger efforts." (Don't be fooled by those conditional "mays"; the general knows how to protect a rhetorical flank.)
The general's predictions were soon enough overtaken by the sour news from Iraq. No one had planned properly for the occupation of Iraq and how to keep its army. And the United States Army proved ill suited for the tasks of empire. Hedging against better news in the future, the general observes, "The occupation had thus far failed to meet popular Iraqi expectations in restoring security and minimal economic standards; Saddam Hussein had evaded capture for months; Baathist elements were hostile; Al Qaeda and other Islamic fighters were entering the country; and a steady diet of daily sniping attacks, bombings and ambushes were producing more casualties each week among the Americans." 
How would a President Clark deal with these failures? "Unfortunately, we are now engaged and fully committed" and can't leave Iraq in chaos or to a Baathist or radical Islamic regime. "Now, if possible, we must transform a successful military attack into victory by helping the Iraqi people to use this opportunity to establish representative government and the political and economic freedoms that can at least serve as an example to others throughout the region, as well as by demonstrating the awesome constructive power of U.S. values, ideas and resources." 
That may sound not unlike the policy of President Bush, and indeed the president may "at last" want to welcome a United Nations presence in Iraq, "internationalize the problem" and get the soldiers of other nations to replace some of our overtaxed forces. But Clark has no confidence in the Bush team's view of the world or management of home affairs. He thinks it has failed to find allies and friends around the world and made a mess of the domestic economy.
"Not since Vietnam had a U.S. administration made the mistake of going for 'guns and butter' simultaneously, or asked so little of an American people at a time of crisis." Might that be a gutsy call for higher taxes? Well, not really: "Tax cuts are a good idea, but we must be certain that we have sufficient funds for defense and other critical needs." It seems safer to dwell, at great length, on the need for "a new strategy for the 21st century -- a broader, more comprehensive and less unilateralist approach abroad coupled with greater attention to a sound U.S. economy at home, and long-range policies to take our nation forward successfully into the future." 
It is a breathtaking vision. Besides sidling out of Iraq, a President Clark would strengthen "and use" international institutions, "repair" trans-Atlantic relations, "resolve" the nuclear challenges of North Korea and Iran, help settle "disputes" between India and Pakistan and Israel and the Palestinians, and help to "ease the ongoing conflicts" in Africa. He would increasingly employ "the weapons of law enforcement rather than warfare in attacking terrorism," focus more on the "root causes" of Islamic terrorism and provide "substantial economic and political development assistance" to stimulate "far-reaching reforms in critical societies in the Middle East." 
In America, too, he favors "a fresh effort" to balance private initiatives and public responsibilities to enlarge opportunity and strengthen the nation's competitiveness. That means protecting our air, water and resources, retaining a pluralistic democracy "with institutional checks and balances," meeting "30-year challenges" in education and health care and "smoothing out the business cycle" with both monetary and fiscal tools. 
Clark glibly lists these objectives, and many more, without suggesting any priorities of effort. And he makes no attempt to explain how any American leader could effectively reconcile so many conflicting ambitions and sovereignties. His self-confidence seems rooted in his experience as commander of the NATO forces that bombed and pacified Kosovo in 1999, a headstrong performance that enlarged his faith in international collaborations while it poisoned his relations with peers and superiors at the Pentagon. 
As Clark recounted in a previous book, "Waging Modern War," his enemies in Washington managed to trick the Clinton White House into firing him from the post of supreme allied commander in Europe. And so he was left to watch from a CNN studio as a new administration employed the battle doctrines he had long championed in what he bitterly concluded was a misguided cause in Iraq. It was enough to drive a man to print, and to think he could do better, as commander in chief.

 BODY:
 LIVES OF THE
CIRCUS ANIMALS
By Christopher Bram.
341 pp. New York:
William Morrow. $24.95.
 Not even counting Broadway's "Phantom of the Opera," the theater is thousands of years old, so why are there so few memorable novels about it? In little more than a century the movie industry -- that Johnny-come-lately cousin -- has spawned dozens of classic fictions, from "The Day of the Locust" (1939) to "Myra Breckenridge" (1968) to "Pandaemonium" (1997). Surely the stage has as much to offer the novelist in terms of extreme characters, evocative atmosphere and built-in variations on the illusion-versus-reality theme. Yet the only great theater novel I can think of (leaving aside passages in Dickens and Twain) is Penelope Fitzgerald's "At Freddie's" -- a ruthless comedy about a seedy London academy for mostly pathetic child actors.
What accounts for the discrepancy? Partly it's a matter of access. Many novelists have toiled in or near Hollywood; comparatively few in the theater. (Penelope Fitzgerald did teach at a seedy London academy for mostly pathetic child actors.) Furthermore, a certain striving for impact naturally draws the writer interested in large effects to the more popular medium: bigger images, bigger stakes, a bigger place in the public imagination. And then there's what you might call the existential economics. Movies are a going concern, and keep on going forever; theater, especially in New York, is the Fabulous Invalid -- for decades threatening to disappear, and making good on its threat every night. You don't see too many novels about puppetry or mime, either.
But if the theater is always at a nearly dead end, so much the better for Christopher Bram, whose stage-struck eighth novel, "Lives of the Circus Animals," confidently takes its place in his pageant of passing worlds. As if deliberately setting out to avoid the trap of the contemporary navel-gazing novel (though he's written in that vein, too), Bram has typically explored social settings that are "almost history," as one of his titles has it -- imagining, before the book of received wisdom slams for good, the unrecorded lives that also played their parts. As such, his novels are populated with characters not merely forgotten but categorically obsolete: a 19th-century traveling spiritualist, an undercover male prostitute in World War II, a closeted McCarthy-era diplomat who eventually has an affair with Imelda Marcos's hairdresser. That many of his protagonists are gay is relevant but not central; it's gayness as a form of recurring obsolescence that captures Bram's imagination. In his most famous novel, "Father of Frankenstein," the real film director James Whale is rescued from oblivion just as he enters it, and it is no small irony that "Gods and Monsters," the movie version starring Ian McKellen, won an Academy Award though Whale never did.
McKellen figures in "Lives of the Circus Animals" too, at least indirectly: could the respected and openly gay British actor Henry Lewse, "the Hamlet of his generation," be modeled on anyone else? In any case, Lewse is the most compelling character in one of those circular Schnitzler plots you could enter anywhere: slumming in a tacky Broadway musical, he dallies with a dim young actor named Toby Vogler, who pines for his ex-boyfriend, the playwright Caleb Doyle, whose most recent play was savaged by a critic for The Times, Kenneth (the Buzzard of Off Broadway) Prager, whose daughter is performing in an elementary school production of "Show Boat" directed by a former actor named Frank Earp, who desultorily romances the young divorcee Jessica Doyle, who is the sister of the playwright Caleb -- and the personal assistant to Henry Lewse. Unlike "La Ronde," though, "Lives of the Circus Animals" does not take us once neatly about the circle; instead, Bram speeds round and round until the circle eventually degrades into chaos at a birthday celebration where all parties converge.
It's very cleverly done; Bram sets his traps long before they're required to spring. Indeed, the climax of the book -- it's the hilarious realization of many a playwright's fantasy -- neatly fulfills Chekhov's famous rule: a gun revealed in Act I must go off in Act IV. If "Lives of the Circus Animals" were merely a farce, there would be little to find fault with; it's well paced, sexy (both gay and straight) and deeply steeped in the traditions and personalities of the theatrical world. Lewse in particular is a fully realized creation, charmingly stepping on everyone's toes in the process of getting where he wants. A beautiful detail is that there are no chairs for anyone else in his dressing room: "Like most actors, Henry understood the concept of Other People but forgot the physical consequences." The actor is aware of his narcissism -- which, far from diminishing it, makes it absolute.
But Bram, as usual, is after something more than a well-made tale; his title, taken from Yeats's "Circus Animals' Desertion," tips his hand. The circus animals aren't just actors in their tawdriness, though Bram is all too convincing on Off Off Broadway workshops, downtown performance art and "life in the lower depths of showbiz, or, rather, the bargain basement." More pointedly, the circus animals are the semi-trained passions that animate a life in art. When those passions flee (or, in the case of most of Bram's characters, are euthanized), what's left? Yeats, in old age, dared face the loss as an omen of death: "I must lie down where all the ladders start, / in the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart." But for the characters in Bram's novel, death is the one thing they cannot incorporate. Most of them have faced obliteration of one sort or another: the loss of lovers to AIDS and age, the paradoxical and constant humiliation of a supposedly ennobling profession.
"You want strangers to love you?" is the first line of the book; it's asked by the critic's psychotherapist but applies to all the characters, whose answer is always yes. The "Hamlet of his generation" responds only to his audiences, the playwright has only anonymous phone sex, the dim young actor dances at a strip club not for the money but because it makes him feel "handsome and wanted." Even the grade schoolers in "Show Boat" are awed by the "sun shower of approval" that greets them during their curtain call; though Frank, their director, fears that this experience of satisfaction derived from artistry is "a dirty trick to play on kids, giving them a taste for something they could never get in real life."
Ultimately, Bram's concern here is less for performance than for what he sees as the modern development of the "performing self": the "social skin" that has made actors of us all. "Once upon a time, maybe, when everyone else was God-fearing and selfless," Lewse says, "we were freaks of vanity, monsters of egotism. Unlike the rest of humanity. Now, of course, everyone's a narcissist. Every nobody and somebody needs to strike a pose in the public mirror." In "Lives of the Circus Animals," the best acting and, unfortunately, the best descriptions of acting, are never onstage. To the extent that Bram cannot therefore jump-start the neglected genre of theater novels, it's because most of his characters have failed to master that most rudimentary drama school lesson: do something. The book is a merry-go-round with stationary mounts: beautifully carved, constantly moving but, with one exception, not moving enough.
The exception is that old pro Henry Lewse. Does it say too much about the theater, and the novel, that by the end of the book he's going Hollywood?

THE SMARTEST GUYS
IN THE ROOM
The Amazing Rise and
Scandalous Fall of Enron.
By Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind.
Illustrated. 435 pp. New York:
Portfolio. $26.95.
 The technology and telecommunications boom made fools of all of us. From the corporate executives who promised results that in hindsight seem absurd to the ordinary day traders who convinced themselves that they were channeling the legendary investor Benjamin Graham, all were overcome with a complex mixture of credulity, jealousy, vanity and greed that made the boom possible. In between were the enablers -- the regulators, bankers, analysts, consultants, accountants, lawyers, credit agencies and journalists who could have done something to stop the madness, but did nothing until way too late. Even this group seems to have been in part genuinely swept away with the euphoria of the age; for instance, Goldman Sachs did not just take the Internet grocerWebvan public, it invested at least $100 million of its own money at an astounding valuation. The difficulty in distinguishing the delusional from the dishonest is why prosecutors are having such a hard time bringing successful indictments in even the most obvious cases of fraud and why social historians will kill many trees trying to come to grips with what really happened.
The story of the rise and fall of Enron may provide the best window into the manifold dynamics that drove the boom. Created through the merger of two midsize natural-gas pipeline companies in the late 1980's, Enron reinvented itself as both an Internet and a telecommunications giant in the 90's. At one point in 2000 its value approached $100 billion. By this time, its natural-gas pipeline business represented much less than 10 percent of the company's imputed worth. Unfortunately for the shareholders, none of the other businesses were anything like management advertised, and most of them had only one thing in common -- they ate up cash at an astounding rate, with no realistic prospect of ever turning a real profit. 
Two books by journalists who covered Enron try to give a broad take on what really happened and why. The two books could not be more different. Both touch on most of the same key facts, dates and obscure accounting structures that make up the bare bones of the Enron narrative. But they have radically different views of what the story is. 
In "24 Days," two reporters for The Wall Street Journal, Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller, think the story is, well, the authors themselves. The book is basically about their investigation. And to be sure, Smith and Emshwiller's reporting (along with that of many others at The Journal) played a critical role in accelerating Enron's exposure. But while Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein certainly succeeded in telling an interesting book-length story around their investigation of Watergate, the Enron story does not lend itself to that approach. 
One problem for the narrative is that the day-to-day work of modern journalism is just not that interesting -- as the authors admit: "Journal news bureaus around the world had often been compared to insurance offices, and the Los Angeles bureau did nothing to challenge that description." Although the authors did get the occasional anonymous phone call, they did nothing exciting like meeting Deep Throat in a dark garage. Indeed, an entire chapter is devoted to one of the authors flying to Houston and failing to get anyone significant to talk with him. Such is the life of a journalist, but do we really need to know? Ditto for the numerous discussions about who got byline credit for which Journal article. Further aggravating the absence of high drama is the fact that Smith and Emshwiller work in different offices and communicated mostly by phone and e-mail. Finally, The Journal was never prominent in the overall story in the way that The Washington Post was in Watergate.
A more serious difficulty is that by organizing the book around various Journal scoops, Smith and Emshwiller give an unbalanced view of the underlying activity at Enron that was being exposed. By the time journalists started to turn a truly skeptical eye on Enron, its most egregious behavior was long in the past. The "24 Days" begin on Oct. 16, 2001, the day before the Journal first reported in detail on the off-balance-sheet partnerships in which Enron's chief financial officer had had a personal interest, but less than two months before the company filed for bankruptcy. The reader is left groping for the context about the people and institutions responsible for creating the monster.
Happily, "The Smartest Guys in the Room," Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind's powerful and shocking book, sees the story quite differently. By seeking an answer to the question of how so many of the best and the brightest allowed such a massive fraud to be perpetrated, the authors, both reporters at Fortune, succeed in opening a disturbing window into both the company and the era. The portrait of the narcissistic culture fostered by Enron's president, Kenneth Lay, since the mid-1980's is so vivid that the reader is amazed but not really shocked when the boom of the late 90's provides the spark that ultimately engulfs the entire enterprise in flames.
Each chapter presents an incisive portrait of some individual corporate executive, Enron division or enabling institution (like its accounting firm) or profession (like journalism and research analysis). There are no heroes here -- the closest thing is the short-selling community that relentlessly prodded journalists and regulators to investigate and expose Enron. The case McLean and Elkind make for the guilt (moral if not necessarily legal) of everyone involved is so overwhelming that the epilogue -- reminding us that to this day no key decision maker has taken any responsibility for his actions -- is truly chilling.
Although "24 Days" and "The Smartest Guys in the Room" are of similar length, the latter book is filled with fascinating characters and anecdotes that are completely absent from "24 Days." For instance, McLean and Elkind devote an entire chapter to the swashbuckling former military intelligence officer John Wing -- described as "Enron's first true prima donna." Although Wing was finally fired by Enron's board in 1991, his reign of terror is critical to understanding Enron's culture of greed and excess. Wing does not appear at all in "24 Days." How Enron's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, made his willingness to leave McKinsey for Enron in 1990 contingent on being able to use "a different type of accounting from the one ordinarily used by the natural-gas industry" is discussed in "The Smartest Guys in the Room" but not in "24 Days."
Even where "24 Days" should be strongest -- when Smith and Emshwiller describe the impact and implications of their articles -- it too often falls short. For instance, one of their earliest scoops was an interview with Skilling, who had just resigned, in August 2001. Although the stated motive for his resignation was "solely for personal and family reasons," the reporters got Skilling to admit that he would not have quit had Enron's stock price -- which by then was less than half of its high achieved the previous year -- stayed up. Yet Smith and Emshwiller do not speculate on this strange and stunning admission.
One of the defining characteristics of the mind-set of the recent boom was an irrational belief that stocks (as well as operating results and salaries and investment returns) could continue to go up indefinitely. This belief was often coupled with a conviction that we were personally responsible for this inexorable rise in value. Many of us arranged our business and personal affairs consistent with these delusional expectations and beliefs. When it all came crashing down, psychologists' offices were filled with patients sure that the crash reflected some personal failure. In Enron's case, executives used the value of the ever-rising Enron stock placed in secret partnerships as a way to hide mounting losses -- a structure one would never employ if there was a meaningful risk that the stock could go down. Might Skilling's admission reflect not only a realization that these structures would come crashing down but that the lower stock price really was his "personal reason" for quitting? There simply was no longer any distinction in Skilling's mind between who he was as a person and Enron's stock price. Enron is all of us.

HEADLINE: The Opt-Out Revolution 

BYLINE:  By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the magazine. She is the author of "Life's Work."

 BODY:
The scene in this cozy Atlanta living room would -- at first glance -- warm an early feminist's heart. Gathered by the fireplace one recent evening, sipping wine and nibbling cheese, are the members of a book club, each of them a beneficiary of all that feminists of 30-odd years ago held dear. 
 The eight women in the room have each earned a degree from Princeton, which was a citadel of everything male until the first co-educated class entered in 1969. And after Princeton, the women of this book club went on to do other things that women once were not expected to do. They received law degrees from Harvard and Columbia. They chose husbands who could keep up with them, not simply support them. They waited to have children because work was too exciting. They put on power suits and marched off to take on the world. 
 Yes, if an early feminist could peer into this scene, she would feel triumphant about the future. Until, of course, any one of these polished and purposeful women opened her mouth. 
"I don't want to be on the fast track leading to a partnership at a prestigious law firm," says Katherine Brokaw, who left that track in order to stay home with her three children. "Some people define that as success. I don't."
"I don't want to be famous; I don't want to conquer the world; I don't want that kind of life," says Sarah McArthur Amsbary, who was a theater artist and teacher and earned her master's degree in English, then stepped out of the work force when her daughter was born. "Maternity provides an escape hatch that paternity does not. Having a baby provides a graceful and convenient exit."
Wander into any Starbucks in any Starbucks kind of neighborhood in the hours after the commuters are gone. See all those mothers drinking coffee and watching over toddlers at play? If you look past the Lycra gym clothes and the Internet-access cellphones, the scene could be the 50's, but for the fact that the coffee is more expensive and the mothers have M.B.A.'s.
We've gotten so used to the sight that we've lost track of the fact that this was not the way it was supposed to be. Women -- specifically, educated professional women -- were supposed to achieve like men. Once the barriers came down, once the playing field was leveled, they were supposed to march toward the future and take rightful ownership of the universe, or at the very least, ownership of their half. The women's movement was largely about grabbing a fair share of power -- making equal money, standing at the helm in the macho realms of business and government and law. It was about running the world. 
"We thought there would be a woman president by now," says Marie Wilson, director of the Ms. Foundation for Women and president of the White House Project, who has been fighting to increase the representationof women in work and politics since 1975. "We expected that women would be leading half the companies in this country, that there would be parity on boards." Instead, Wilson has just finished a book that includes an examination, in her words, of "how far we haven't come," titled "Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and Must Help Run the World." 
Arguably, the barriers of 40 years ago are down. Fifty percent of the undergraduate class of 2003 at Yale was female; this year's graduating class at Berkeley Law School was 63 percent women; Harvard was 46 percent; Columbia was 51. Nearly 47 percent of medical students are women, as are 50percent of undergraduate business majors (though, interestingly, about 30percent of M.B.A. candidates). They are recruited by top firms in all fields. They start strong out of the gate. 
And then, suddenly, they stop. Despite all those women graduating from law school, they comprise only 16 percent of partners in law firms. Although men and women enter corporate training programs in equal numbers, just 16 percent of corporate officers are women, and only eight companies in the Fortune 500 have female C.E.O.'s. Of 435 members of the House of Representatives, 62 are women; there are 14 women in the 100-member Senate. 
Measured against the way things once were, this is certainly progress. But measured against the way things were expected to be, this is a revolution stalled. During the 90's, the talk was about the glass ceiling, about women who were turned away at the threshold of power simply because they were women. The talk of this new decade is less about the obstacles faced by women than it is about the obstacles faced by mothers. As Joan C. Williams, director of the Program on WorkLife Law at American University, wrote in the Harvard Women's Law Journal last spring, "Many women never get near" that glass ceiling, because "they are stopped long before by the maternal wall."
Look, for example, at the Stanford class of '81. Fifty-seven percent of mothers in that class spent at least a year at home caring for their infant children in the first decade after graduation. One out of four have stayed home three or more years. Look at Harvard Business School. A survey of women from the classes of 1981, 1985 and 1991 found that only 38 percent were working full time. Look at professional women in surveys across the board. Between one-quarter and one-third are out of the work force, depending on the study and the profession. Look at the United States Census, which shows that the number of children being cared for by stay-at-home moms has increased nearly 13 percent in less than a decade. At the same time, the percentage of new mothers who go back to work fell from 59 percent in 1998 to 55 percent in 2000.
Look, too, at the mothers who have not left completely but have scaled down or redefined their roles in the crucial career-building years (25 to 44). Two-thirds of those mothers work fewer than 40 hours a week -- in other words, part time. Only 5 percent work 50 or more hours weekly. Women leave the workplace to strike out on their own at equally telling rates; the number of businesses owned or co-owned by women jumped 11 percent since 1997, nearly twice the rate of businesses in general. 
Look at how all these numbers compare with those of men. Of white men with M.B.A.'s, 95 percent are working full time, but for white women with M.B.A.'s, that number drops to 67 percent. (Interestingly, the numbers for African-American women are closer to those for white men than to those for white women.)
And look atthe women of this Atlanta book club. A roomful of Princeton women each trained as well as any man. Of the 10 members, half are not working at all; one is in business with her husband; one works part time; two freelance; and the only one with a full-time job has no children.
Social scientists -- most of them women -- have made a specialty in recent years of studying why all this is so. Joan Williams ("Unbending Gender"), Sylvia Ann Hewlett ("Creating a Life"), Arlie Russell Hochschild (who coined the phrase "the second shift") and Felice N. Schwartz (who made popular the phrase "the mommy track"), to name just a few, have done important work about how the workplace has failed women. 
But to talk to the women of the book club -- or to the women of a San Francisco mothers' group with whom I also spent time, or the dozens of other women I interviewed, or the countless women I have come to know during the four years I have reported on the intersection of life and work -- is to sense that something more is happening here. It's not just that the workplace has failed women. It is also that women are rejecting the workplace. 
I say this with the full understanding that there are ambitious, achieving women out there who are the emotional and professional equals of any man, and that there are also women who stayed the course, climbed the work ladder without pause and were thwarted by lingering double standards and chauvinism. I also say this knowing that to suggest that women work differently than men -- that they leave more easily and find other parts of life more fulfilling -- is a dangerous and loaded statement. 
And lastly, I am very aware that, for the moment, this is true mostly of elite, successful women who can afford real choice -- who have partners with substantial salaries and health insurance -- making it easy to dismiss them as exceptions. To that I would argue that these are the very women who were supposed to be the professional equals of men right now, so the fact that so many are choosing otherwise is explosive. 
As these women look up at the "top," they are increasingly deciding that they don't want to do what it takes to get there. Women today have the equal right to make the same bargain that men have made for centuries -- to take time from their family in pursuit of success. Instead, women are redefining success. And in doing so, they are redefining work.
Time was when a woman's definition of success was said to be her apple-pie recipe. Or her husband's promotion. Or her well-turned-out children. Next, being successful required becoming a man. Remember those awful padded-shoulder suits and floppy ties? Success was about the male definition of money and power. 
There is nothing wrong with money or power. But they come at a high price. And lately when women talk about success they use words like satisfaction, balance and sanity. 
That's why a recent survey by the research firm Catalyst found that 26percent of women at the cusp of the most senior levels of management don't want the promotion. And it's why Fortune magazine found that of the 108 women who have appeared on its list of the top 50 most powerful women over the years, at least 20 have chosen to leave their high-powered jobs, most voluntarily, for lives that are less intense and more fulfilling. 
It's why President Bush's adviser Karen Hughes left the White House, saying her family was homesick and wanted to go back to Austin. It's why Brenda C. Barnes, who was the president and C.E.O. of Pepsi-Cola North America, left that job to move back to Illinois with her family. And it's why Wendy Chamberlin, who was ambassador to Pakistan, resigned, because security concerns meant she never saw her two young daughters.
Why don't women run the world? 
Maybe it's because they don't want to. 
Attitudes cluster in place and time. This is particularly true of a college campus, where one-quarter of the student population turns over every year. Undergraduates tend to think that the school they find is the one that always was, with no knowledge of the worldview of those even a few short years before. Looked at that way, the women of the Atlanta book club are a panoramic snapshot of change. 
Sally Sears, the oldest of the group, entered Princeton in the fall of 1971. Women had been fully admitted two years earlier, and the school was still very much a boys club. Sears had gone to a small public school in Alabama and entered college "very conscious of being a representative of women and a representative of the South." As she describes it, the air was electric with feminism. "Margaret Mead came to talk one night, and I was stunned by how penetrating her questions were about what it was like to be the first women," she says. "I thought, my God, she's thinking of us as Samoans."
Upon graduation in 1975, Sears felt both entitled and obligated to make good. "The clear message was, 'You've been given the key to a kingdom that used to be denied to people like you,"' she says. "It never occurred to me that my choices would be proscribed. I could have anything I wanted."
What she wanted, at first, was to be "a confirmed single person, childless, a world traveler." She spent a couple of years running The Childersburg Star, a small Alabama newspaper owned by her family, and then, in 1978, she took a job on the air at a television station in Birmingham. That led to a job in Memphis, followed by a yearlong trip around the world, then another TV job in Dallas. By 1984 she was on the air in Atlanta, where she became a local celebrity and where she met Richard Belcher, a fellow reporter and now a local anchor. They were married in 1988, when Sears was 35.
Three years later, their son, Will, was born. Soldiers of feminism take only the shortest of maternity leaves, and as soon as Sears recovered from her C-section she was back at work. The O.J. Simpson trial was the first real test of what she calls "work plus love plus a child," because both she and her husband were sent out to California for the duration. "I got my mom and dad to bring Will out, and we all camped out at the New Otani Hotel for a few weeks," she says. "I was determined not to blink."
By the time Katherine Brokaw arrived on campus, seven years after Sears got there, women were no longer a curiosity. "I guess I knew I was a significant minority," Brokaw says, "but I never felt like I didn't belong there."
Clearly she belonged there. She'd been scoring off the charts on tests since she started taking them, and by seventh grade she was a serious student of Latin and French. In high school she added ancient Greek and slam-dunked her SAT's. Two of the best classics departments in the country were at Princeton and Harvard; she was accepted to both and chose Princeton.
When Brokaw and her classmates spoke of the future, it was not about blazing paths, as Sears's generation had done, but it was certainly not about fitting work around motherhood either. "I always knew I wanted to get married and have children," she says, "but I was looking at careers in terms of what would I find intellectually stimulating and personally fulfilling." 
Brokaw thought briefly about pursuing a Ph.D. in classics. Worried that she would chafe within the ivory tower, she opted for law school instead. Because she would be paying for her law degree herself, she worked for several years -- first as the principal speechwriter for Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey and then as the speechwriter for the March of Dimes Foundation. She began Columbia Law School in the fall of 1987. There she met a student at the business school, and they were married in 1990. 
Success followed her to Columbia, in the form of a spot on a prestigious law journal, internships at New York's top law firms and a job offer from every firm to which she applied. She also nabbed a clerkship with a federal judge and then went on to become an associate at the firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell.
After Brokaw had been at Davis Polk for a year, her husband was offered a position in Atlanta that was worth the move. The change was particularly appealing to Brokaw, because Atlanta offered her something that Manhattan could not -- an easy commute. "I could practice law in a top firm and still be only 10 minutes from home," she says. "It seemed like an ideal way to have children and a career."
Three years later she became pregnant for the first time and went into labor at the office at 9:30 one November night. During her three-month maternity leave she had access to the firm's e-mail system through her laptop and then went back to work full time, "which was always my intention."
At first, she says, her new equation was "more manageable" than she had expected. She had a "wonderful nanny," and for a couple of months, her workload was relatively light. Her hours were regular; she took her breast pump to the office. But that didn't last. In mid-May she learned that a major case, on which she was the lead associate, had been moved up on the calendar by the presiding judge and would go to trial in mid-August. 
For the next three months Brokaw worked a crushing schedule, up to 15-hour days, seven days a week, while still nursing her daughter, who was not sleeping through the night. When the trial date came, she was exhausted but prepared. That morning, though, the judge postponed the case, and by the end of the week he announced that he had taken it off his calendar indefinitely. Later Brokaw would learn that he had decided to go fishing for two weeks.
That Sears and Brokaw were schooled in different generations is made clear by the different ways they gave up their jobs. Sears took nine years to quit. And she did so with great regret. "I would have hung in there, except the days kept getting longer and longer," she explains. "My five-day 50-hour week was becoming a 60-hour week." As news reports could be transmitted farther and farther from the "mother ship," she found herself an hour or two from home when the nightly news was done. "Will was growing up, and I was driving home from a fire," she says. "I knew there would always be wrecks and fires, but there wouldn't always be his childhood."
First she tried to reduce her schedule. "The station would not give me a part-time contract," she says. "They said it was all or nothing." So in August 2000, she walked away from her six-figure income and became a homeroom mom at her son's school. 
"It was wrenching for me to leave Channel 2," she says. "I miss being the lioness in the newsroom -- to walk through and have the interns say, 'There she goes.' It kills me that I'm not contributing to my 401(k) anymore. I do feel somehow that I let the cause down."
Brokaw, while torn about leaving, did so without nearly as much guilt or angst as Sears. She did not think for a moment that she had failed the movement, though she did wonder whether she had failed herself. Even while she was preparing for her trial she raised the possibility of a part-time schedule. She wrote a proposal that was circulated among the partners, and some back-and-forth had begun about, among other things, whether reduced hours would count as time toward partnership. 
"Every once in a while I would raise my head from the grind of getting this case ready and I would say, 'Where are we with my proposal?"' she remembers. "Finally, when the case was pulled from the calendar, I did a lot of soul-searching. My life, my home life and my new family life were at the mercy of other people's whims. The judge had chosen to go fishing. My partners had chosen not to place my request on high-enough priority."
One night she and her husband sat down, and he asked, "What is the ultimate goal?"
"In theory," she answered, "the goal is to become a partner."
"Does your life get better or worse if you become a partner?" 
"Well, financially it gets better, but in terms of my actual life, it gets worse."
And that is when Brokaw quit. She now cares full time for that eldest daughter, as well as the two children who followed. "I wish it had been possible to be the kind of parent I want to be and continue with my legal career," she says, "but I wore myself out trying to do both jobs well." 
Fast-forward a decade, and compare the decision that Brokaw, class of '82, made with that of Vicky McElhaney Benedict, class of '91. "Even before I became a mother, I suspected I wouldn't go back to work," she says. 
The Princeton Benedict entered was on its way to complete coeducation, and, she says, "I never felt discriminated against in any way." From there she went to Duke University School of Law, where she met her future husband, who was there earning his M.B.A. A native of Dallas, she "had fabulous offers from firms back home, but I didn't take them," she says. Though not yet engaged, she decided to follow Charlie Benedict to Atlanta instead, "where I joined a law firm that was not as high-profile." She made the choice, she says, looking back on it, "because I knew that the long-term career was going to be his."
The couple were married in 1995. Benedict quit her law job after nine months and began working in the development office of Emory University. Her daughter was born in 1998, and she quit that job while on maternity leave. Her son was born three years later, and she says she is secure with her decision. 
"This is what I was meant to do," she says. "I hate to say that because it sounds like I could have skipped college. But I mean this is what I was meant to do at this time. I know that's very un-p.c., but I like life's rhythms when I'm nurturing a child.
"I've had people tell me that it's women like me that are ruining the workplace because it makes employers suspicious," she continues. "I don't want to take on the mantle of all womanhood and fight a fight for some sister who isn't really my sister because I don't even know her."
These are fighting words of a most retro sort, and, no doubt, a 70's feminist peering in the window would be confused at best and depressed at worst. But unmapped roads are not, de facto, dead ends. Is this a movement that failed, or one reborn? What does this evolving spectrum of demands and choices tell us about women? And what does it mean for the future?
Katherine Brokaw and I were classmates. We did not know one another well at school, but the Princeton she describes was the one that I knew too. We were told we could be anything then, which we took to mean we could do everything, and all of it at the same time. We felt powerful and privileged when it came to being women (and, let's face it, only during freshman year did we learn to actually call ourselves women). Any generalization is dangerous, but for the most part we didn't feel the same obligation to succeed as the women before us, nor were we bordering on blase, like those who would follow. 
I rarely thought about combining life and work while I was at Princeton. In fact I never remember using the two words together in the same sentence. The only choice I thought I had to make was between journalism and law. Having chosen the former, I set my sights on the highest goal I could think of -- becoming editor of this newspaper, perhaps, or at least editor of this magazine -- and figured the path would be upward and linear. Then I got down to work. 
I enjoyed the work -- loved the work -- but life got in the way. My first readjustments were practical; while a national correspondent in Houston I learned you can't hop on a plane every morning to explore the wilds of Texas while leaving a nursing baby back home. 
Quickly, though, my choices became more philosophical. My second son was born while I was back in New York, working as a metro reporter. I decided to leave that full-time job in the newsroom for a more flexible freelance life writing from home, and I must admit that it was not a change I made only because my children needed me. It's more accurate to say I was no longer willing to work as hard -- commuting, navigating office politics, having my schedule be at the whim of the news, balancing all that with the needs of a family -- for a prize I was learning I didn't really want. 
I will never run this paper. But I will write for it, into old age, I hope, and that piece of the work is enough for me. Much of the writing I do now is in the form of a biweekly column for The Times about life and work. Over the years I have written more than 100,000 words and received more than 10,000 e-mail messages from readers on the subject. It's not a scientific sample, but it is a continuing conversation, and a surprising amount of the talk is not about how the workplace is unfair to women, but about how the relationship between work and life is different for women than for men. 
"Sometimes I worry that we're really just a little bit lazier," Sears says. "But in my heart of hearts, I think it's really because we're smarter. Maybe evolution has endowed us with the ability to turn back our rheostat faster, to not always charge ahead after one all-consuming thing. To prefer a life not with one pot boiling but with a lot of pots simmering; to prefer the patchwork quilt, not the down comforter. Oh, God, would you listen to these domestic analogies? Are they really coming out of my mouth?"
Sarah Amsbary also raises the question of biology. "It's all in the M.R.I.," she says, of studies that show the brains of men and women "light up" differently when they think or feel. And those different brains, she argues, inevitably make different choices. Amsbary graduated with a degree in English, not science, in 1988, and while at Princeton she was one of the first women in the University Cottage Club, which, when I was there, was still an all-male eating club known for attracting preppy good ol' boys. I can only imagine that being the first woman in such a place was its own kind of Darwinian experience.
When I talk to Jeannie Tarkenton, another member of the book club, biology comes up yet again. "I think some of us are swinging to a place where we enjoy, and can admit we enjoy, the stereotypical role of female/mother/caregiver," Tarkenton says. "I think we were born with those feelings." 
Tarkenton graduated in 1992 and worked first in publishing and then on the start-up of the Atlanta Girls' School, until she had her first child in 2000. She went back and worked three days a week, until her second child was born last year. "I didn't want to work that hard," she says of her decision to quit completely. "Women today, if we think about feminism at all, we see it as a battle fought for 'the choice.' For us, the freedom to choose work if we want to work is the feminist strain in our lives." 
When these women blame biology, they do so apologetically, and I find the tone as interesting as the words. Any parent can tell you that children are hard-wired from birth: this one is shy, this one is outgoing; this one is laid-back; this one is intense. They were born that way. And any student of the animal kingdom will tell you that males and females of a species act differently. Male baboons leave their mothers; female baboons stay close for life. The female kangaroo is oblivious to her young; the male seahorse carries fertilized eggs to term. Susan Allport, a naturalist, writes in her book "A Natural History of Parenting," "Males provide direct childcare in less than 5 percent of mammalian species, but in over 90 percent of bird species both male and female tend to their young."
In other words, we accept that humans are born with certain traits, and we accept that other species have innate differences between the sexes. What we are loath to do is extend that acceptance to humans. Partly that's because absolute scientific evidence one way or the other is impossible to collect. But mostly it is because so much of recent history (the civil rights movement, the women's movement) is an attempt to prove that biology is not destiny. To suggest otherwise is to resurrect an argument that can be -- and has been -- dangerously misused. 
"I am so conflicted on this," says Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an anthropologist and author of "Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural Selection." Female primates, she says, are "competitive" in that they seek status within their social order. So it would follow that women strive for status too. 
But there is an important qualifier. When primates compete, they do so in ways that increase the survival chances of their offspring. In other words, they do it for their children. "At this moment in Western civilization," Hrdy says, "seeking clout in a male world does not correlate with child well-being. Today, striving for status usually means leaving your children with an au pair who's just there for a year, or in inadequate day care. So it's not that women aren't competitive; it's just that they don't want to compete along the lines that are not compatible with their other goals.
"I'm very interested in my family and my environment and my work, not in forging ahead and climbing a power structure," Hrdy explains by way of personal illustration. "That is one of the inherent differences between the sexes." Then she warns, "But to turn that into dogma -- women are caring, men are not, or men should have power, women should not, that's dangerous and false."
In a loftlike apartment in San Francisco, a weekly play group is meeting over lunch. Lisa Tafuri Krim is "hands down" the best cook in the group, the other mothers all agree, as they grab bites of her crepes with goat cheeseand tomato while chasing their toddlers. The conversation, mostly about food allergies and baby music classes and coming birthday parties, occasionally drifts toward the faraway world of work.
"I got a call from a guy that I hired," says Krim (University of Michigan '93; Harvard Business School '98), who is working part time now at a brand-consulting firm she joined before she became pregnant. "Now he's way ahead of me on the ladder. He calls and says, 'Hi, stay-at-home mom."'
The women of this play group did not know each other when they were matched, purely on the basis of their children's ages, by the Golden Gate Mothers Group, an organization designed to make it easier to be a mom in San Francisco. But when they made their introductions at their first gathering more than a year ago, they saw themselves reflected in the capsule descriptions of one another's lives.
"Everyone had an M.B.A.," says Tracey Liao Van Hooser, the only one in the present group without one, though she does have a degree from Brown University and a decade of work in advertising and marketing to add to the cumulative resume. "It was wonderful to find a group of women who had made the same decisions I had. This play group is the reason I feel so happy with my choice." 
Since that first meeting, and even in the months since I first spent an afternoon with them this summer, those capsule descriptions have changed. Van Hooser, still home full time with Jack, is now pregnant with her second child. Anne Kresse (Stanford '91, U.C.L.A. '98), who had been working four days a week as a senior marketing manager and spending one day with Jackson, switched to three days, then just last month, quit completely. She's pregnant again, too. Courtney Klinge, on the other hand (Colgate '88, Harvard '95), had stayed home for a year and a half with her daughters, Eliana and Paulina, but last month she went back to work three days a week. 
All that coming and going, they say, is the entire point. "This is not permanent," Kresse says. "It's not black and white; it's gray. You're working. Then you're not working. Then maybe you're working part time or consulting. Then you go back. This is a chapter, not the whole book." 
Van Hooser says: "I am not a housewife. Is there still any such thing? I am doing what is right for me at the moment, not necessarily what is right for me forever." 
Talk to any professional woman who made this choice, and this is what she will say. She is not her mother or her grandmother. She has made a temporary decision for just a few years, not a permanent decision for the rest of her life. She has not lost her skills, just put them on hold. 
"I'm calling this my 'maternity leave,"' Sears says. "As long as I have the chit on the table that says 'This is not forever,' then I feel O.K. about it." 
Brokaw agrees, protesting, "Don't make me look like some 1950's Stepford wife." In the years since she left her law firm, she has helped found the Atlanta Girls' School (the same place where Tarkenton once worked) and also raised a successful challenge to a bridge that was to have spilled its traffic into her residential neighborhood. "I use my legal skills every day."
Don't look at her as something out of "The Bell Jar" either. She is not trapped. This is a choice. And don't worry for her that she will have no resources should something happen to her spouse, his career or their marriage, she insists. "My degree is my insurance policy." 
But is it enough insurance? Not only in the event that she needs to go back to work, but also when the time comes, that she wants to. Because at the moment, it is unclear what women like these will be able to go back to. This is the hot button of the work-life debate at the moment, a question on which the future of women and work might well hinge. For all the change happening in the office, the challenge of returning workers -- those who opted out completely, and those who ratcheted back -- is barely even starting to be addressed. 
If that workplace can reabsorb those who left into a career they find fulfilling, then stepping out may in fact be the answer to the frustrations of this generation. If not, then their ability to balance life and work will be no different than their mothers', after all. 
On the one hand, there are examples out there of successful women whose careers were not linear. Shirley Tilghman, president of Princeton and the first woman to run the university, spent years deflecting administrative jobs -- exactly the sort of jobs that traditionally lead to becoming university president. And Ann Fudge, now chairman and C.E.O. of Young & Rubicam, left the fast track for two years to travel the world with her husband and help start a tutoring program for African-American children. 
There are also trends working in these women's favor. One legacy of the dot-com era is that nonlinear career tracks are more accepted and employers are less put off by a resume with gaps and zigzags. Second, a labor shortage is looming in the coming decade, just as this cohort of women may well be planning to re-enter the work force. 
On the other hand, the current economy is hardly welcoming to re-entrants, and the traditional workplace structure does not include a Welcome Back mat. "As a society we have become very good at building offramps," says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, who caused a stir last year with her book, "Creating a Life," which postulated that the more successful the woman the less likely she was to marry or have children. "But we are seriously lacking onramps."
Hewlett has recently founded the Center for Work-Life Policy and, along with Cornel West, a Princeton professor, and Carolyn Buck Luce, a senior partner at Ernst & Young, has created a task force to study what she calls the "hidden brain drain" of women and minorities from the work force. (I have been invited to join that group.) Task-force members include representatives from a wide range of power bases -- large law firms, accounting firms, investment banks and universities -- who are coming to recognize that it is not enough to promote and retain talent. You have to acknowledge that talented workers will leave, and you have to find a way to help them come back. 
The task force begins its work this winter. But Hewlett's preliminary research makes her pessimistic about what today's women will face when they want to return to work. At any given time, she says, "two-thirds of all women who quit their career to raise children" are "seeking to re-enter professional life and finding it exceedingly difficult. These women may think they can get back in," she said, when I told her of what I had been hearing in San Francisco and Atlanta and on my own suburban street, where half the women with children at home are not working and where the jobs they quit include law partner and investment banker. "But my data show that it's harder than they anticipate. Are they going to live to the age of 83 and realize that they opted out of a career?" 
If so, they say they are braced for the trade-off. "I don't know how you just step out for three to five years until your kids are in kindergarten and then announce to the world that you're ready to pull out your resume and take on the challenging, fulfilling job that you deserve," Kresse says. "If and when I go back, it may never be full time. So given that I'm going to be a part-time person, is it also a given that my male colleagues are going to get ahead of me? Or is it going to be a meritocracy where talent really does matter most? I can't know that now."
Some are already preparing for re-entry by working part time. Sally Sears is one. The same television station that refused to give her a part-time contract in 2000 has started calling her in for periodic projects: a week of work during the summer while her son was at camp; five days straight when the Legislature opened its session. "The benefit to them is they get a seasoned, savvy reporter to grab the ball and run," she says. "And the benefit to me -- I get to say no."
Brokaw was asked back, too, but she declined -- for now. In the years since she left, her law firm has allowed several litigators to work a shorter week, and she has watched them struggle. One of those litigators, a member of the book club who would not let me use her name, asks: "How do you litigate part time? It's supposed to be 10 to 5 -- at a law firm, that's part time -- but lately I've been working until 4 a.m. because I have a project due. It's the type of job where if something's due, you work until it's done."
For the moment, therefore, the future is a question mark. "I assume my daughter will work," Jeannie Tarkenton says, "and I want to give her some example of working women as she grows up. I plan for this example to come from me, somehow. Maybe it will be part-time work, maybe full time, or maybe just through stories about the 10 years I worked before she arrived."
There is a powerful institution run largely by women: Princeton University. Shirley Tilghman is a molecular biologist who took the top job more than two years ago. Her provost, Amy Gutmann, is a professor of politics and was dean of the faculty before being appointed to the post by Tilghman. 
Of the five academic deans who report to Gutmann, three are women: Nancy Weiss Malkiel, a historian, is dean of the college; Maria M. Klawe is dean of the school of engineering; Anne-Marie Slaughter, a lawyer, is dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. On top of that, Janet Lavin Rapelye is the new dean of admissions. 
This has not gone unnoticed. One member of the class of '41 wrote to the Princeton Alumni Weekly magazine that since "we now have a lady president and a lady second in command, to save time I recommend that the trustees promptly convert Princeton to a single-sex female university and be done with it." Another wrote to suggest that the name of the school be changed to "Princesstonia." 
Tilghman says she was not really surprised by this old-guard crankiness. These were the same alums, she says, who objected to coeducation in the first place, arguing that women would not donate large amounts to their alma mater after they graduated. Meg Whitman, class of 1977 and president and C.E.O. of ebay Inc. seems to have silenced that objection with her recent $30 million gift.
What did surprise Tilghman, though, was the reaction -- or lack of reaction -- from current female students. Last spring, after one of these new deans was appointed, The Daily Princetonian ran an editorial suggesting that the president was practicing "gender-based affirmative action." Tilghman waited for the women on campus to "rise up in protest" at the implication that "the only way you can possibly justify appointing a woman is in the interest of affirmative action, because, after all, it couldn't possibly be because they were the best person for the job."
But nothing of the sort happened. "Have these young women internalized the idea that women really do not lead?" she asks sadly. "There was a time when that kind of thinking would have inspired outrage."
One such time was in 1968, when Tilghman graduated from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. "I am very much a child of that revolution," she says of the early years of the women's movement. "I came of age at the time when Betty Friedan set things in motion, and it had a tremendous impact on my life. It opened doors for me," as a woman in the sciences, "beyond a shadow of a doubt."
Now Tilghman finds herself presiding over a new generation, one that is, arguably, more accomplished and more qualified than any that has come before, but one that is not at all sure what to do with all that talent. She raised her son and daughter on her own (she was divorced when her children were young), and she is more than aware of the compromises made both at work and at home. She sees the effect those compromises have had, particularly on her daughter, a 2003 Princeton graduate. 
"A life in science, combined with motherhood, meant leaving undone a lot of things I might have wanted to do," she says. "There were books I wished I had read, courses I wished I had taken, community service I wished I had done, places I wished I had seen, friends I wished I had made -- but time constraints made this impossible." Her daughter, she says, "is not as ambitious as I was. I think she saw the trade-offs that I made as ones she might not be prepared to make herself. She is looking for more balance in her life." 
Other members of that generation seem to feel the same way, Tilghman says. She and I had dinner one night in a dining room of Prospect House, where university presidents, including Woodrow Wilson, used to live. We were joined there by Gutmann and Slaughter. Pointing at them, Tilghman said, "I think that for every one person who looks at an Amy or an Ann-Marie and says, 'I want to be like her,' there are three who say, 'I want to be anything but her."'
Tilghman is now a leader. In that role she wonders how to educate women to enter this shades-of-gray world and how to create an environment for her own staff that encourages a balanced life. But Tilghman is also a scientist, and she suspects that policies and committees, while crucially important, cannot change everything. And she wonders whether evolution has done both men and women a disservice. 
"My fantasy is a world where there are two kinds of people -- ones who like to stay home and care for children and ones who like to go out and have a career," she says. "In this fantasy, one of these kinds can only marry the other." But the way it seems to work now is that ambitious women seem to be attracted to ambitious men. Then when they have children together, "someone has to become less ambitious." And right now, it tends to be the woman who makes that choice. 
Sarah McArthur Amsbary of the Atlanta group leads a much-examined life. Back in college, she says, she gave no thought to melding life and work, but now, "I think about it almost constantly." 
And what she has concluded, after all this thinking, is that the exodus of professional women from the workplace isn't really about motherhood at all. It is really about work. "There's a misconception that it's mostly a pull toward motherhood and her precious baby that drives a woman to quit her job, or apparently, her entire career," she says. "Not that the precious baby doesn't magnetize many of us. Mine certainly did. As often as not, though, a woman would have loved to maintain some version of a career, but that job wasn't cutting it anymore. Among women I know, quitting is driven as much from the job-dissatisfaction side as from the pull-to-motherhood side." 
She compares all this to a romance gone sour. "Timing one's quitting to coincide with a baby is like timing a breakup to coincide with graduation," she says. "It's just a whole lot easier than breaking up in the middle of senior year."
That is the gift biology gives women, she says. It provides pauses, in the form of pregnancy and childbirth, that men do not have. And as the workplace becomes more stressful and all-consuming, the exit door is more attractive. "Women get to look around every few years and say, 'Is this still what I want to be doing?"' she says. "Maybe they have higher standards for job satisfaction because there is always the option of being their child's primary caregiver. When a man gets that dissatisfied with his job, he has to stick it out."
This, I would argue, is why the workplace needs women. Not just because they are 50 percent of the talent pool, but for the very fact that they are more willing to leave than men. That, in turn, makes employers work harder to keep them. It is why the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche has more than doubled the number of employees on flexible work schedules over the past decade and more than quintupled the number of female partners and directors (to 567, from 97) in the same period. It is why I.B.M. employees can request up to 156 weeks of job-protected family time off. It is why Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Pa., hired a husband and wife to fill one neonatology job, with a shared salary and shared health insurance, then let them decide who stays home and who comes to the hospital on any given day. It is why, everywhere you look, workers are doing their work in untraditional ways. 
Women started this conversation about life and work -- a conversation that is slowly coming to include men. Sanity, balance and a new definition of success, it seems, just might be contagious. And instead of women being forced to act like men, men are being freed to act like women. Because women are willing to leave, men are more willing to leave, too -- the number of married men who are full-time caregivers to their children has increased 18 percent. Because women are willing to leave, 46 percent of the employees taking parental leave at Ernst & Young last year were men. 
Looked at that way, this is not the failure of a revolution, but the start of a new one. It is about a door opened but a crack by women that could usher in a new environment for us all. 
Why don't women run the world? 
"In a way," Amsbary says, "we really do."

 Democrats do not need new ideas any more than Christians need a new Ten Commandments. What they need is a charismatic leader who can articulate traditional Democratic ideals in a way that will attract a winning constituency and then govern effectively. To me, Democrats have always stood for safeguarding civil liberties, maintaining human health and welfare, stimulating job growth, protecting the environment and acting responsibly in the world theater. And, therefore, I offer these four ideas: Equal rights. Full-employment economy. Universal safety net. Safer world.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-26-03: THE ETHICIST; 
Grading Reality

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
The university where I teach has a problem with grade inflation. I recently discovered that my grades are considerably below the average given in my department. Should I raise my grades(to be fair to my students, whose grades will be comparatively lower than they deserve), even though that contributes to grade inflation (which gives most students grades that are higher than they deserve)? Peter Kugel, Cambridge 
 Both hard markers like you and cream puffs like your grade-inflating colleagues should strive to give students the grades they actually deserve -- as a matter of honesty to the students and their parents, as a matter of fairness to the other students at your university and as a way to help your students assess their progress and improve their learning. But individual virtue can take you only so far. 
 Like any other inflated currency, grades can be brought into line only when a group -- your department, your university, all universities -- takes action. (My editor notes that I may ardently oppose inflationary trends in the dollar, but I am reluctant to be paid what newspaper writers earned in, for example, 1935, which, if you believe the movies, was $3 a week and a bottle of rye.) And so, while you should strive to grade accurately, you must seek real reform by working with others.
Some teachers, feeling as you do, have already made efforts in this direction. While few schools have formal policies about grade inflation, deferring to professorial autonomy, many keep faculty informed about how their grades compare with those of their colleagues. For example, at Pomona College, in California, the school regularly sends out notices to let professors know how their grades stack up. This information does influence some professors to rein in hyperinflationary grading.
One additional thought: Several academics to whom I spoke agreed that student evaluations of their professors is one force driving grade inflation. Unsurprisingly, students tend to give high ratings to professors who give them high grades. In some schools, these ratings can be an important factor in tenure decisions, and thus impel profs to be overly generous with the A's and A-pluses. 
This, too, is something to address in your attempts to reform this system.
A single, 50-ish gentleman joined our synagogue -- a lovely man, interested in learning, who takes all the study classes available. Recently, a large piece of wood propped up against the youth center fell onto his car. He wants the synagogue to pay for the damage. Some congregants are upset with him. They say the Jewish community is always in need of money and he should absorb this cost himself. Is he morally wrong to seek compensation? E.M., Florida
Had the synagogue been negligent, if its actions caused the mishap, then it (or, presumably, its insurance company) must make good the damages. I see no reason why this man should waive payment. 
To do so would be in effect to make a charitable donation to the synagogue -- 
a generous act, but one he is no more obligated to undertake than any other member. Like any congregant, particularly one who avails himself of the classes and other activities the synagogue provides, he should pay his fair share of its expenses. But this accident having occurred at a religious community makes it no different from a fender-bender at Wal-Mart.
I should add that the synagogue may not be responsible. This lovely man, distracted by all his studies, may have driven right into the innocent piece of wood. It is up to the lawyers to sort out who was at fault.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
B&B's Ride Out The Travel Downturn

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
WHILE the last few years have been hard times for hotels, from plush palaces to mundane motels, bed-and-breakfasts have been doing comparatively well, according to hotel analysts. 
 Fear of flying in the age of terrorism coupled with an economic downturn has left hotels with a shortage of their mainstay: business travelers. But the uneasy climate has spurred a desire for the brief getaway, and that has been good for B&B's and their slightly larger cousins, country inns. 
 Some road warriors also stay in B&B's as relief from the sameness of chain hotels. The keepers of little inns, often with no more than a handful of rooms, have responded with such amenities as high-speed Internet connections and free local phone calls. 
 At least 19,000 bed-and-breakfasts and country inns are now operating around the country, according to the Professional Association of Innkeepers International, a trade group in Santa Barbara, Calif.
 "People still want a vacation and they still want to be pampered," said Marti Mayne, a spokeswoman for bedandbreakfast.com, a Denver-based online directory of B&B's. "People want to feel safe and secure and they don't want to travel very far. When it comes to business travelers, they're increasingly becoming unhappy with the additional fees hotels are charging."
 In a B&B, breakfast, which can run to six courses and dessert, is included in the room price, which averages $136.70 nationwide, according to the innkeepers' association. Some B&B's offer rooms for as little as $40 a night, Ms. Mayne said, while rooms with a whirlpool and fireplace can go for $350.
 One of the big appeals of bed-and-breakfasts is that, in many ways, they are the opposite of hotels. 
 "Hotels say: 'Our location is convenient, we're near the sights of the city, or we're near the amusement park,"' said Bjorn Hanson, a specialist in the hotel business at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm. "But the bed-and-breakfast people say: 'Come here, we have the ambience. You can do things that are less organized, not, for example, go to the ride that starts at 9 A.M.' Bed-and-breakfasts offer that getaway experience."
 The hotel and bed-and-breakfast businesses peaked in 2000 with the booming stock market. Over the next two years, occupancy rates were down 7 percent for hotels, but only 4 percent for B&B's and country inns, according to a study by Michigan State University and the hospitality group of PFK Consulting in Atlanta. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers noted a slight improvement in the hotel business this year, and Mr. Hanson said hotels were expected to do considerably better in 2004. Pamela Horowitz, the chief executive of the Professional Association of Innkeepers International, said that there had been little change in the B&B business this year, but that "people are pretty optimistic about next year."
 A result of the improvement in hotel business, Mr. Hanson said, is that there are "fewer of the very deeply discounted room rates."
 Instead of declining after business peaked in March 2000, room rates at bed-and-breakfasts rose a little more than 6 percent in the next two years, according to the Michigan State-PFK Consulting study, to $136.70. But the B&B business is more seasonal than the hotel business. Overall occupancy often runs 20 percentage points lower for them than for hotels, and the dip over the last two years caused several hundred to go out of business, according to the Professional Association of Innkeepers International.
 "The hotels are still making money," said Robert Mandelbaum, an analyst at PFK Consulting. "They're just not making as much as they did in the late 90's."
 Sixteen years ago, John and Diane Sheiry bought the Waverly Inn, a 14-room bed-and-breakfast in a big white Victorian house in Hendersonville, N.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He cooks the big breakfast, dishes like Moravian whole wheat buttermilk pancakes with blueberries; she keeps the inn looking good and takes care of the books. Her sister, Darla Olmstead, bakes chocolate cakes and cherry pies and does the laundry; an employee cleans the rooms.
 Many of the inn's guests, who pay an average of $130 a night, double occupancy, go the area for mountain hiking, the Flatrock Playhouse and to see the homewhere Carl Sandburg spent the last 22 years of his life. Other clients include those doing business at the hospital up the street and the nearby plants run by Kimberly-Clark, General Electric, Borg-Warner and other corporations.
 "We've got six or seven major chain motels about two miles from us, and we haven't suffered anywhere near as much as they have," Mr. Sheiry said early one Friday evening in October, when he was welcoming a full house for the weekend. "Our revenues are up this year over last and all the indicators are that next year is going to be better."
 With the nearby motels charging about half as much, how are the Sheirys doing so well?
 "Personal service," Mr. Sheiry said. "People want to go some place where people know their name. Sixty-one percent of our business is repeat business. I don't charge for Internet access or faxes or local phone calls. Cokes, coffee, tea and hot chocolate are free. I know all the restaurants and the owners and what kind of food they serve. When people decide what they want, we'll make a reservation for them." 
 He added: "No denigration meant toward the chain motels, but their staffs just don't know this stuff."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Point and Click, Or Call Agent?

BYLINE:  By BARRY ESTABROOK; BARRY ESTABROOK contributes frequently to the Travel section.

 BODY:
BOBBY TUCKER, an executive at a brokerage in Little Rock, Ark., was looking forward to a vacation most travelers only dream about: a quick stop in London, a safari in Tanzania with a week to unwind afterward in the Seychelles and possibly a few days in Paris and Burgundy on the way home.
 Unfortunately, on the day in March that he and his wife were scheduled to depart, Mr. Tucker had to cancel. The stock market was in free fall, and nervous clients were clamoring for attention. However, his son was available to take his place on the trip, so Mr. Tucker called his travel agent, Ellison Poe of Poe Travel, a family-owned firm in Little Rock, and asked her if there was anything she could do. Within hours she had not only switched Mr. Tucker's tickets over to his son, but she had also arranged for the visa and necessary inoculations during the London stopover. 
 Two days later, the market had settled, and Mr. Tucker had a change of heart. He again called Ms. Poe. Was there any way she could arrange for him to meet up with his wife and son? He threw in one other twist: Could she book his ticket using frequent flier miles -- not his, but those that one of his friends was willing to give to him? 
 "It was Friday afternoon, and I wanted to leave the following Monday," Mr. Tucker said. "I just dumped it all in her lap."

A Government Proposal
 While millions have become their own travel agents, booking their trips online, there are still occasions when a human is invaluable. But traditional agencies are facing hard times. Not only have terrorism, war and a poor economy kept their customers home but the airlines have also eliminated many of the commissions upon which travel agents have depended. And now, if regulations currently being considered by the Department of Transportation go into effect, travel agents will suffer another blow, according to William A. Maloney, executive vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents, based in Washington. 
 In March, the Department of Transportation proposed to change regulations governing the computer reservation systems that all travel agencies use. Airlines are now required to post virtually all their flights and fares on all four of the major reservation systems (except for "Web specials," offered exclusively on the airlines' own sites).
 "Whether you are going to Adelaide, Australia, or Albany, N.Y., your travel agent can have instant access to information about what airlines fly there, what their fares are, what hotels are nearby and what car rental companies are there," Mr. Maloney said.
 Under the proposed rules, airlines would have the option not to post information, meaning that agents would have to check several sites and even then not be certain they had found the best fare. "The new regulations will not only hasten but ensure the demise of travel agents," said Mr. Maloney, whose organization's membership has dropped to 22,000 from 27,000 three years ago, as travel agencies amalgamated or went out of business during the slump after Sept. 11. "Consumers will be forced to deal with airlines directly." The department has yet to make a final decision on the regulations. 
 Travel agents also face competition from Internet travel sellers that rely on the same computer reservation systems travel agents use and would also be affected by the rules.
 In 2002, most major airlines eliminated commissions they once paid to travel agents on tickets sold in the United States and Canada. Now most travel agents charge clients $15 to $35 to make an airline reservation, a service that was formerly free.
 Even though they still book 78 percent of airline tickets and more than 95 percent of tours and packages, according to Mr. Maloney, traditional travel agents like Ms. Poe sometimes seem like quaint anachronisms in today's point-and-click world, where anyone with rudimentary computer skills and a credit card can book airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars in minutes and even save money in the process.

Your Money or Your Time
 Given the unsettled state of the industry, the question is, do travelers really need agents?
 "For point-to-point simple travel, if you're computer minded, you can do your own, and you'll save a little money -- maybe," said Alexander Anolik, a San Francisco travel lawyer and author of "Traveler's Rights" (Sphinx Publishing, 2003).
 But for more complicated itineraries, Mr. Anolik, who has represented traditional travel agents and online travel companies, recommended using a travel agent. "If you are going to a foreign destination, if your trip involves possible changes or if you need accurate, up-to-date information, the answer is that you are better off with an agent," he said. "That way, when things go wrong, you have someone to go to." 
 It also matters whether it is more important to save time or money. If money is the deciding factor, a computer may be the way to go. "The computer can give you rates," said Martin Rapp, vice president of Altour International in Manhattan. "But a computer won't tell you whether the hotel you just booked is in good shape or in a good location."
 For travelers like Mr. Tucker, time is much more valuable than money. "A good travel agent -- and that's the key: a good one -- can save you a lot of time," said Gary Topping of Gulfstream Travel in Gulf Shores, Ala. "The other day I was looking around on the Internet on travel sites. It took forever to get what I wanted. You can call a travel agent and it's done in a flash."
 For travelers who don't know someone who can recommend an agent, Mr. Rapp suggested seeking an agency affiliated with a prominent consortium or cooperative like Leisure Travel Group (to which his agency belongs) or Virtuoso.
 Virtuoso, a consortium of 285 agencies, will direct travelers to members with expertise in particular regions or types of vacations. Clients also benefit from the group's buying power, said Keith Waldon, director of public relations for Virtuoso. "Our agencies do $2.5 billion of business per year, and we go out and negotiate on behalf of the clients by flexing our muscle with travel providers," he said. That can mean upgrades or free spa treatments and meals.
 "Clients have to have someone to champion them, whether it's to get a room when supposedly there isn't one, or a credit when they have to cancel," said Anne Scully, vice president of McCabe Bremer Travel in McLean, Va. "You like your travel agent when things are going well, but you love your travel agent when you're in trouble."
 As he had hoped, Mr. Tucker boarded a plane in Little Rock that Monday morning. Ms. Poe had not only secured a free ticket for him but had also gotten him upgraded to business class. Thirty-six hours and four flights later, he stepped outside into the night at the airport at Kilimanjaro and saw a sight that would boost the spirits of any jet-lagged traveler. A lone driver stood in the darkness holding up piece of white cardboard on which was scrawled a single word: "Tucker."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING ON; 
The Big Island

BYLINE:  By MICHELE KAYAL; MICHELE KAYAL is a journalist who lives in Honolulu.

 BODY:
One easy cure for "rock fever" -- the vague claustrophobia that sometimes overwhelms residents of the smaller Hawaiian islands -- is to head for the wide-open spaces of the Big Island, also called Hawaii. Nearly twice the size of the five other major islands combined and one of the most diverse, the Big Island's soaring peaks and bubbling volcano, ancient Hawaiian sites and many resorts offer visitors a compact sampling of the state's best attributes. 
 The Big Island is believed to be the landing place of the very first Hawaiians, and some of their spirit is captured by musicians, like the masters who will lead a ukulele and slack-key guitar program in the upcountry town of Waimea. South of the volcano, considered sacred by many Hawaiians, elders hold front-porch-style chats that offer insights into the culture beyond the hotel luau. 
 The island is also a place of beauty and brawn, with a community of prolific artists thriving deep in the rain forest of Volcano Village, and nearly two centuries of paniolo (cowboy) culture kept alive in rodeos and livestock auctions. The coming weeks offer a rare chance to dip into all of it. 

Events
People in this fertile countryside pride themselves on knowing how to eat, and visitors can join in at the Big Island Festival, (866) 424-3378, www.bigislandfestival.com, Nov. 5 to 9, which this year has lured chefs like Cornelius Gallagher of Oceana in New York and local celebrities like George Mavrothalassitis, known as Chef Mavro, a 2003 James Beard Award winner. Gourmands can get tips from nearly two dozen chefs. A tour of a state-of-the-art aquaculture facility (which produces lobster, clams, oysters and other seafood) just outside the Kona airport ends with a seafood lunch. An "adventure tasting" seminar with Keith Famie, a Food Network personality (and "Survivor II" participant), will challenge festivalgoers to identify exotic foods. Tickets for the more than 80 events, spread among seven resorts on the Kohala Coast (on the Kona side), range from $55 to $150, with multiple-event passes from $140.
A lantern parade through the seaside town of Kailua-Kona on Nov. 7 officially kicks off the Kona Coffee Cultural Festival, Nov. 6 to 16, www.konacoffeefest.com, (808) 326-7820. A coffee-picking contest, a "cupping" workshop -- think wine-tasting for coffee fanatics -- and other events celebrate Kona's 600-plus coffee farms. A $3 festival button, available at events, provides general admission; some events have additional fees and require reservations. 
Anyone who has fallen in love with Hawaii through its music can participate in the Waimea Ukulele and Slack Key Guitar Institute, Nov. 8 to 10, at the Kahilu Theatre, 67-1186 Lindsey Road (behind Parker Ranch Center), Waimea; (808) 885-6868, www.kahilutheatre.org. Masters including Led Kaapana and the father-son team of Dennis and David Kamakahi will lead beginners, experts and nonmusicians in workshops, master classes and kanikapila, or jam sessions. Per-class fees are $40 to $60. The artists will also pluck and chat in conversational forums called "talk story" sessions ($10). A master concert Nov. 7 opens the event, with tickets $25 to $35.
The Hawaiian cultural specialist Kepa Maly will sit under an ohia tree at He Kula Na Mea Hawaii (A School of Things Hawaiian) on the corner of Tiki Lane and Princess Kaiulani Streets in Ocean View, (808) 929-8700, www.hekula.org, on Nov. 8 at 7 p.m. and tell stories of the surrounding Kau district, the southern region where the first Hawaiians are thought to have landed on their journey from Polynesia. The program is free; a fish dinner costs $10. Uncle George Naope, one of Hawaii's best-loved hula masters and musicians, and others will follow on Dec. 6 from 4 to 8 p.m. with songs and tales of Hawaii's past. Admission is $15, with dinner; reservations required.
In the nearby town of Naalehu, paniolos from more than a half-dozen ranches will wrestle cattle and rope steers in the Kau Roping and Riding Association's Big Island Invitational Ranch Rodeo on Nov. 22 at Naalehu Arena on Spur Road, Naalehu; (808) 929-8079. The homegrown rodeo is one of many throughout the year on the Big Island, the seat of Hawaii's ranching industry. Admission: $5 at the gate. Also that day, the public is invited to the livestock auction at Parker Ranch Rodeo Arena, Mamalahoa Highway, Waimea, (808) 885-7311, where ranchers and cowboys will bid on Angus bulls, cows, heifers and horses (free).

In Mount Kisco, a Store Rises From the Ashes

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO 

 BODY:
DESTROYED in a fire three years ago, the Elephant's Trunk, a family-owned clothing and costume store here since the early 1970's, reopened last week in a new brick building on Main Street. It becomes a co-anchor with the national retailer Borders Books and Music in a redeveloping section of this northern Westchester village, a retail and commercial hub about 35 miles north of Manhattan.
 The return of Elephant's Trunk, which sold jeans and hippie-styled clothing when it first opened 32 years ago and these days offers mother-of-the-bride ensembles to many of those same customers, attests to the success of the village's expansion and revitalization efforts. 
 The downtown area had struggled in the slow economy of the early 1990's, and then at the end of the decade was stricken by a flood related to the tropical storm Floyd and, less that a year later, the fire at the Elephant's Trunk.
As part of the recovery effort, the village installed storm drains and contained a creek in a former swamp area between Main Street and South Moger Avenue. It has also planted grass and built parking lots and walkways in the now parklike setting that connects its two main retail streets. 
With several hundred stores, Mount Kisco has mom-and-pop retailers, some of them dating back several generations, as well as larger chain stores like Banana Republic, Victoria's Secret, the Gap and Starbucks. Nancy Hack, the president of Mount Kisco's Chamber of Commerce and president of Hack Insurance Agency, a family business dating back to 1918, described Mount Kisco as "a smaller version of White Plains with a hometown feeling."
Referring to the explosive retail and residential growth now taking place in White Plains, which is about 18 miles south of Mount Kisco, Ms. Hack said, "We're growing here too, but on a smaller scale and in keeping with the suburban community that we are." She said Mount Kisco's retail and commercial sectors mainly serve residents in northern Westchester and lower Putnam County. In White Plains, meanwhile, several large shopping centers and a new $350 million retail-entertainment-residential complex draw from a broad area encompassing New Rochelle to the south and Fairfield County to the north and east. 
Covering 3.1 miles, Mount Kisco has a population of 10,000 residents, and twice that number on workdays. The village's three largest employers are Northern Westchester Hospital Center, Mount Kisco Medical Group and the Visiting Nurse Association of Hudson Valley. In all, the village has 775,091 square feet of commercial office space and a 5 percent office vacancy rate, according to Phyllis Tunnell, a commercial real estate broker with T Square Properties, which has offices here and in White Plains.
Ms. Tunnell observed that a few law firms and financial firms had opened satellite offices in Mount Kisco rather than in White Plains. The growth of Mount Kisco's commercial and retail sectors is reflected in the Chamber of Commerce's growing membership, which recently reached 150, Ms. Hack said. 
THE owners of Elephant's Trunk, the brothers Rafael and Robert Brache, who grew up in Mount Kisco and started the business when they were 21 and 19 respectively, said they decided to rebuild the new three-story store at the same site as the original wood-frame building because of Main Street's rebirth.
"We were lonely here for many years, but that's not the case anymore," Rafael Brache said, explaining that restaurants, boutiques and other smaller retailers have opened new stores or expanded existing ones along Main Street and that Borders Books had brought more foot traffic to the area. The first of a number of chains to move to Mount Kisco, Borders arrived in the mid-1990's, followed by the Gap and others.
South Moger Avenue, which runs parallel to Main Street and is home to just a handful of smaller concerns, has attracted more of the chains, including the Gap, Baby Gap, Chico's and Starbucks. In addition, a new retail area of about half a dozen stores was built just behind South Moger when the village renovated the area between the two streets. At the same time, some stores that were accessible only to the street created second entrances from the parking area. 
At the new Elephant's Trunk on Main Street, the brothers have discontinued their costume rental business, instead creating space for two more retailers. They recently leased storefronts to Dorothy Stein of Eastchester, a lingerie concern, and Chiara Scura, a shoe store in Chappaqua. It is the first expansion for each retailer.
The Brache brothers purchased the original building, an empty site that had at various times been an antique store, hotel and bar, in the early 1970's for $100,000 and had just paid off their mortgage when the building was struck by the fire, which apparently started in an electrical box and was ruled accidental. The new $1 million building has 9,000 square feet of space, the same as the old building.
To maximize the space available, the owners obtained village approval to rebuild on the original store's footprint, even though current zoning requires more setback space from the street and sidewalk. The owners also created a third floor where only a loft had existed before.
To relieve some of the pressure on parking in the village, the owners chipped 50 feet off a granite outcropping in the rear of their property, creating 16 spaces for cars where there had previously been eight. Part of the parking lot will be covered in a porous mixture of grass and concrete to minimize the amount of runoff to the main roadway and storm drains.
DANIEL MONTROY, the architect for the project, said the owners chose weathered brick for the exterior instead of replicating the 1920's wood frame structure, because they wanted the new store to blend in with Village Hall across the street and to create a more substantial appearance on that section of the busy street.
The interior of the new Elephant's Trunk is designed to suggest that of a European opera house, with arched windows, 10-foot ceilings, elaborate chandeliers and a soaring staircase, said Mr. Montroy, a partner in Montroy Andersen Design Group in Manhattan.
Mayor Patricia M. Reilly, a fifth-generation resident of Mount Kisco, noted that the smaller retailers and the larger chains provide a healthy mix today for the village. "You can go to any Banana Republic in any place in the U.S. and find the same items for sale," she said. "With the smaller stores mixed in, you have a counterbalance."
On South Moger Avenue, Jeffrey and Edward Smilkstein, twin brothers who own Smilkstein's Shoes, agreed that the arrival of chain retailers had helped to inject new energy into the retail area. Members of the Smilkstein family have been retailers here since 1910, but in the 1980's the family sold off other property, including a department store. All that remains of the family business is the children's shoe store.
As the mayor said, "When the chains came in, some of us who were born here worried that the village would never be the same." Her mother, she recalled, shopped in the now-defunct Abel's Department Store, where the sales clerks knew not only their customers' first names, but also the sizes of everyone in the family.
"Yes, the village has changed," said the mayor, a retired health services coordinator for the Bedford Central School District, "and Mount Kisco may not be the same as it was when I was growing up here. But the changes are for the good, because we've been able to balance the old in a way that hasn't sacrificed the small-town qualities that drew us here to begin with."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/East Midtown; 
New Hotel Seeks Executives on Extended Stays

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
DESPITE the decline in occupancy and steep falloff in nightly room rates over the past three years, this is a good time to open a new hotel in New York, said Mary Lou Pollack, general manager of the Alex on 45th Street just east of Third Avenue. Her hotel is expected to open within a few weeks when the last fixtures are installed and city approvals are obtained.
 "Things may look bad compared to the big party in 2000," when the occupancy rate citywide approached 84 percent, "but occupancy in this neighborhood has reached into the 80's," she said. "That is not bad. Fall is a strong time in New York, and room rates in the premium sector are up 12 to 13 percent over last year." 
 Across the city, the numbers have just begun to move upward from a decline that began in early 2001 and was greatly aggravated by the attack of Sept. 11. But industry executives and consultants say the market for hotel properties is coming back to life after having been frozen in place for several years. Capital is available to finance hotel deals, and buildings are once again changing hands. 
In fact, it was announced last week that Marriott would open the first new hotel in Harlem since the 1950's, as part of a mixed-use development at 125th Street and Park Avenue. 
Hotel investors are seeking to position themselves to take advantage in an anticipated economic recovery and increase in travel said Arthur Adler, managing director for the Americas of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, a division of the brokerage and services company.
"It has been a tough couple of years, but now owners are looking at their properties and deciding whether to sell now or wait," he said. There is expected to be no shortage of eager buyers.
"There are barriers to entry in New York, just are there are in other major cities," Mr. Adler said. "When the economic tide turns, they stand to benefit."
"There is a tremendous amount of capital interested in investing in lodging right now," said Mark Gordon, a managing director of the Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, an investment banker specializing in real estate. He said that investors were seeking to put money into hotel deals and lenders seemed to have funds available as well. 
"It is a great time to refinance hotels," he said. "Rates are at a 40-year low and lots of lenders are interested in doing refinancing. Sonnenblick-Goldman has done $2 billion in hotel refinancing in the last two years and has another $500 million in deals pending."
On the equity side, he said, foreign companies in particular are looking to buy or build hotels, primarily in New York to establish a presence in this country. "Look at the Mandarin in Columbus Circle" at the Time Warner Center, he said. "That is going to be their headquarters in this country, and you have to pay a premium to do that." 
Some people think the operating side of the business has started to bounce up from the bottom. The revenue per available room, a key economic indicator for the industry, increased one-tenth of a percentage point in New York in June compared with the corresponding month in 2002, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. That may not seem like much, but it was the first time this year that the financial performance exceeded the year-earlier month.
It was driven by an increase in occupancy of 5.8 percentage points, to 82.6 percent; hotel operators are wary about trying to raise rates until it is clear that the occupancy gains can be sustained. Although the movement was in the upward direction, there is a long way to go. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, revenue per available room fell from a high of $189 in 2000 to $140 in 2002 and continued to decline this year until the reversal in June, when it rose to $142.61.
Anecdotal evidence may precede the statistics. "I tried to find a room last weekend for a business associate, and it was hard to do," said Izak Senbahar, one of the developers of the 33-story Alex. "Hotels in the city are starting to fill up."
He said there has been an increase in business activity on Third Avenue, where many of the existing buildings have been refurbished. The Alex, he said, has been designed for corporate executives visiting those businesses, with 73 of the hotel's 203 guest rooms equipped with full kitchens for people planning to stay for more than a few days. Room rates range from $375 to $1,500 a night, although discounts are available for longer stays.
"Our target is business people planning to stay for a few weeks or a few months," Mr. Senbahar said.
TO accommodate those guests, each of the rooms is equipped with desks with telephone and Internet connections. And the hotel has printers and fax machines on wheeled carts that can be quickly moved into rooms. The idea, Ms. Pollock said, is to have the machines available without making the rooms look like office cubicles.
For those who do not want to cook for themselves, the hotel will include a restaurant created by Marcus Samuelsson, the executive chef at Aquavit. The restaurant, Riingo, whose name is derived from the Japanese word for apple, will have its own entrance on 45th Street, but will also provide 24-hour room service to the hotel.
Even though the hotel business seems to be recovering, the strong market for permanent residential space is leading to some conversions from hotel use. One example is the Delmonico Hotel, on Park Avenue and 59th Street, which is being converted into condominiums. "A hotel today cannot compete with residential at a prime location like Park and 59th," Mr. Gordon said.
Other hotels that are expected to become residences are the Empire, Middletown and Windsor, industry professionals say. The Courtyard hotel, on Third Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets, currently in bankruptcy proceedings, is also expected to be converted into long-term residences.
Butsome properties changing hands are expected to stay as hotels, often after extensive renovation. The 722-room Metropolitan Hotel on 51st Street and Lexington Avenue was sold in July by Loews Hotel to a group including Goldman Sachs's Whitehall fund. It is expected to undergo a $22 million refurbishment, including the addition of 10 guest rooms, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The 180-room Doral Park Avenue at 38th Street was also sold this year and will be managed by the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, that company's first property in New York. It is expected to have a $19 million renovation, which will include a major restaurant and the addition of 17 guest rooms.
Another hotel that has been the subject of speculation is the Roosevelt on Madison Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets, which has more than 1,000 rooms. Many industry analysts expect that the building, which occupies a full block just north of Grand Central Terminal, will be converted to an office building. 
"That is a great office building site," said Mr. Adler. "It is just south of the new Bear Stearns headquarters, and it is a big hotel with small rooms."
Also on the block are the last two of the group of four boutique hotels developed by Bernard Goldberg and currently owned by Credit Suisse First Boston. The Roger Williams and the Franklin have been sold, and the Mansfield and Shoreham remain available.
Developing a new hotel during a downturn had its advantages, Ms. Pollack said. "We caught the labor market at the low end this summer," she said. "People are happy to come to work in a new project. That condition did not exist in 2000."
If the upturn in occupancy continues, hotel operators will rely less on heavily discounted Internet sales to fill rooms, improving their revenues, said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York area hospitality practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
But, he said, labor, insurance and property taxes are going up as well, squeezing profitability. "It's an improvement, but not a case for joy," he said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Nongambling Attractions For Atlantic City Project

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
MENTION the name of this city and two words pop to mind: casino and boardwalk. 
 That sums up the essential experience of visiting Atlantic City, conceded Dennis C. Gomes, president for resort operations for the Aztar Corporation, which owns the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City and an establishment with the same name in Las Vegas. "You come, you gamble, maybe you walk along the ocean a little bit, and that's pretty much it for many people," he said. 
 In Las Vegas, by contrast, the city is nearly as famous for its lavish shows and enticing shopping as for its casinos -- and nongambling properties generate substantial profits, Mr. Gomes added. 
In 2002, according to gambling control authorities in Nevada and New Jersey, the 43 casinos in the Las Vegas "Strip" generated $4.6 billion in gambling receipts, but Atlantic City generated almost as much, $4.3 billion, with only 12 casinos.
On the other hand, the 43 properties on the Las Vegas Strip also generate about $4.4 billion in nongambling revenue, including lodging, from their 40 million annual visitors, Mr. Gomes said. This compares with $300 million from 32 million visitors a year for Atlantic City's 12 properties, he said.
"Imagine the market potential for Atlantic City if we could up the ante and provide a more well rounded gaming and nongaming experience to visitors," said Mr. Gomes, who held various executive positions in casino hotels in both Atlantic City and Las Vegas before becoming the head of Aztar's resort operations.
Now, his company is making a big play to do that very thing, with a $245 million expansion project at the Tropicana here that possesses what Mr. Gomes calls "Las Vegas meets Atlantic City" qualities. The project includes a new 28-story tower across Pacific Avenue from the Tropicana. This building has 505 new hotel rooms on 18 floors, bringing the resort's total to 2,126 rooms, making it the largest hotel in New Jersey. Other features include 45,000 square feet of meeting rooms, executive boardrooms and four convention and hospitality suites on the top floor that are to feature floor-to-ceiling windows. The building's other 10 floors are taken by a parking garage.
But the ground-breaking aspect, Mr. Gomes said, will be the Quarter, a separate building with three floors and 200,000 square feet of nongambling space.
Designed to suggest the look of old Havana, the new buildings are going up on a former parking lot across from the Tropicana's three towers along the ocean boardwalk. The Quarter is to be connected with the existing towers by a wide bridge over Pacific Avenue that will house some of 40 new shops that are to be added. The new tower, which has a Spanish-style dome and cupola, has already been topped out. The Quarter is not expected to open until April 2004.
Earlier this year, the Tropicana's 220-yard oceanside facade was renovated to extend the Spanish architectural elements, bright stained glass and teal and terra cotta colors that will distinguish the Quarter over to the Boardwalk. The Marketplace at the Boardwalk, on the lower floors of the Tropicana, also opened earlier this year, with 12 dining, nightclub, retail and live entertainment spots. 
The Quarter at the Tropicana will house a mix of national and regional retailers, live music venues and a number of well-known bars and restaurants from New York, Philadelphia and Las Vegas.
The list of tenants so far includes retailers like Brooks Brothers, Chico's, Mondi, Swarovski, the Spy Store and Zephyr Gallery. The restaurants will be Carmine's, based in New York; Cuba Libre, based in Philadelphia; and Red Square, based in Las Vegas; plus chains found in other parts of the country like Murray Bros. Caddyshack, the Palm, P. F. Chang's China Bistro and Ri Ra Irish Pub. The Sound of Philadelphia will feature a nightclub, as will Cuba Libre.
There will also be live entertainment at the Ri Ra pub, and a Planet Rose karaoke club will be another tenant at the Quarter. An expanded version of Tropicana's Comedy Stop Cafe and Cabaret and the new Tango's Casino Lounge will be housed there as well. In addition, there will be strolling entertainers in the Quarter's courtyards and open spaces. An Imax theater will also be part of the mix.
Earlier this year, the ultramodern Borgata casino opened in Atlantic City -- the first new casino in 13 years -- with 2,010 hotel rooms, a swanky retail mall with 10 boutique shops, six new restaurants, a nightclub and a luxurious spa. The dramatic design of the Borgata, which is located away from the Boardwalk in the Renaissance Point area, is generally agreed to have been a factor in drawing a healthy business to its casino.
Mr. Gomes, who is the president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, which lobbies with legislators on behalf of all the Atlantic City casinos, said Aztar had begun planning the Quarter four years ago, well before the Borgata came on the scene. "It's not about competition," he said. "It's about economic potential."
Aztar projects that the economic impact of the Quarter will be substantial for the city and state: 600 construction jobs and 2,000 new permanent jobs paying $35 million in annual wages; more than $26 million annually in state and local taxes; $15 million in state casino taxes; $9 million in Atlantic City taxes; and $2 million in annual Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and parking fees to be paid by Aztar.
MR. GOMES also maintains that his company is taking a very different approach in its selection of tenants than the Borgata took. The Borgata aims to "create" their own chefs and nightclubs, whereas, Mr. Gomes said, "we have opted to secure well-known brand names to increase traffic and attract more diverse audiences to Atlantic City."
Mr. Gomes, who insists that the expanded Tropicana will be a standout among Jersey casinos, is himself unusual among Atlantic City's casino operators. He began his career in law enforcement in Las Vegas 35 years ago. Mr. Gomes said the book and film "Casino" are based on an investigation he led for the Nevada Gaming Control Board's Audit and Special Investigations Department.
After that, he became chief of New Jersey's Gaming Enforcement Special Investigations Bureau and contributed to the development of the state's casino control regulations as the industry began to develop 25 years ago in Atlantic City. Mr. Gomes was in charge of the first investigation of a New Jersey casino operator.
"I've never gambled," he said with a chuckle. "My mother still thinks this is a nice business. I've got her convinced this is no different than any other form of entertainment."
Mr. Gomes said he remembers Atlantic City in its early days, when it was a major tourist attraction in the Northeast, and later, after it became "decrepit." 
"I believe that we are now in the beginning stages of bringing Atlantic City back to what it used to be -- the ancient glories," he said.
The Tropicana, among the first casinos built in Atlantic City, opened its North Tower in 1981, expanded with 500 additional hotel rooms in its South Tower in 1988 and another 500 hotel rooms over a parking garage and transportation center in the West Tower in 1996. In 1996, the Tropicana also expanded its theater to seat more than2,000. It also opened the first comedy club in Atlantic City 20 years ago.
The Tropicana is responsible for some gambling innovations, too, Mr. Gomes pointed out. In 1997, it opened the Change Your Life video poker room, where for the first time a slot player could win noncash jackpots like a new house, car or college tuition. Two years ago, it pioneered with exercise slot machines, for those who like to work out as they gamble.

HEADLINE: It's a Girl! (Will the Economy Su ffer?) 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
LOOKING for a distraction, the two economists sauntered out of their offices at the University of California at Berkeley last spring and met near the water cooler. 
 The economists, Gordon B. Dahl and Enrico Moretti, are both experts in a rarefied part of the field known as econometrics. On this day, however, their conversation quickly drifted to a wide-ranging discussion of the reasons for the persistent wage gap between men and women. 
 Could the problem stretch far beyond the workplace, they wondered, and all the way back to childhood and the ways that parents treat boys and girls? Was it possible that even in the United States, even in 2003, parents favor boys in a way that has lifelong implications?
One way to look for such a preference, they realized, would be to see whether parents of girls divorced more often than parents of boys, as has long been the case in male-centric societies like China. So the two economists scurried back to their respective offices and, over the next three days, did what economists do: plugged reams of data into a computer and ran regressions, statistical speak for the search for patterns. 
"We thought, 'There is no way we are going to find something systematic,"' Mr. Moretti said. "The results were shocking."
In every decade since the 1940's, couples with girls indeed divorced more often than those with boys, United States Census Bureau data showed. The effect was not huge -- just a few percentage points -- but it was unmistakable. It happened in every region of the country. It happened among whites more than blacks and among people with only high school diplomas more than those with college degrees.
Over the last 60 years, parents with an only child that was a girl were 6 percent more likely to split up than parents of a single boy. The gap rose to 8 percent for parents of two girls versus those of two boys, 10 percent for families with three children of the same sex and 13 percent for four. Every year, more than 10,000 American divorces appear to stem partly from the number of girls in the family.
Whatever the cause, and there are some prime suspects, the effects are as obvious as they are pernicious. Children from divorced families are twice as likely as other children to drop out of high school, become parents while teenagers or be jobless as young adults, earlier studies show. The new research makes clear that girls are bearing more than their share of these costs.
"I'd rather boys and girls have the same crack at success in life," said Mr. Dahl, an assistant professor at the University of Rochester.
THE study fits in with a fast-growing interest among economists in how families operate, research that is moving beyond the ways that women's family roles affect their finances to include fathers and children as well.
"This is part of well-known economic imperialism," said Shelly Lundberg, a professor of economics at the University of Washington at Seattle, referring to her field's penchant for sticking its nose into just about every human endeavor. "How families operate and how husbands and wives make decisions has important economic implications."
Taken together, this research strongly suggests that the age-old favoring of boys is not confined to the past or to developing countries like China and India. It is subtle and less widespread than it once was in the United States, but it still gives boys an important leg up. 
Parents, and especially fathers, appear to invest more in their families when they include a boy. They put more money into their homes, spending an additional $600 a year on housing, according to a study of families with an only child by Ms. Lundberg and her colleague Elaina Rose, an associate professor of economics.
In addition, fathers increase their workweeks by more than two hours, and their earnings, after the birth of a first, male child. When the first child is a girl, workweeks increase by less than an hour.
The effects go beyond mere dollars and cents. Among unmarried couples, fathers read to baby girls and put them to bed as often as they do for boys. But the fathers feed the boys, change their diapers and play with them more often than they do with baby girls, concluded Ms. Lundberg, Ms. Rose and Sara McLanahan, director of the Center for Research on Child Well-Being at Princeton. 
And among unmarried women who had ultrasound scans, those carrying boys were slightly more likely to marry the father than those with girls, a study of California records from the early 90's by Mr. Dahl and Mr. Moretti showed.
By itself, of course, the higher divorce rate among parents of girls does not prove that society prefers baby boys. Mothers might tolerate a difficult marriage if they have sons, thinking that the presence of a father is crucial to the boys. 
Or mothers and fathers might both have a slight preference for children of their own sex. Some fathers might spend more time with their family when it includes boys, strengthening the marriage. Other fathers, knowing they are likely to lose a custody battle, might avoid a divorce when it would cost them time with their sons.
But a wide array of findings from family research suggests that these factors alone do not explain the gap. 
"The weight of the evidence suggests that parents have a preference for boys," said Mr. Moretti, an assistant professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who, like Mr. Dahl, had been on sabbatical at Berkeley. "The differences are not huge, but they are not trivial."
Researchers also found a Henry VIII-like eagerness for a male heir in many parents. Over the last six decades, 33.7 percent of families whose first four children were girls had a fifth child, while only 31.5 percent of those who start with four boys kept going.
The preference for boys could matter a lot more in the future. Technology already permits parents to choose a baby's sex, and as the cost of the procedure falls, it could create a divisive social issue. 
For about $3,000 on top of the usual fee for in vitro fertilization or artificial insemination, the Genetics & IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va., will sort sperm by weight, separating the X chromosomes, which produce girls, from the smaller Y's.When its customers are indeed able to become pregnant, the institute claims a 75 percent success rate for parents who request boys and 90 percent success for those who want girls. Another method boasts a success rate closer to 95 percent for each sex, but it is more controversial because doctors check for gender after in vitro fertilization and discard the embryos of the unwanted sex.
"There is reliable technology for gender selection," said Dr. Norbert Gleicher, chairman of the Centers for Human Reproduction, which has clinics in Chicago and New York. Whether it becomes more popular "will depend to a large degree on the political climate."
President Bush has appointed a committee, led by Dr. Leon R. Kass, to advise him on biotechnology and issues related to the beginning of human life. In an preliminary report it released on Oct. 16, the committee questioned the wisdom of sex selection. 
THE research by Mr. Dahl and Mr. Moretti, which was first reported in the online magazine Slate by Steven E. Landsburg, another economist at Rochester, seems to offer a new reason to be squeamish about the process. 
If parents, as a group, showed no preference for one gender over another, the new technology would be able to do little more than reallocate boys and girls in society. But if parents favor one sex, then acquire new degrees of control, the delicate balance between boys and girls could easily be upset, researchers say. 
Consider what would happen if many parents with two girls opted for sex selection when having a third child, while those with two boys were more likely to leave the gender of their third child to nature. Over decades, the population would slowly become more male.
"This presents enormous ethical and social problems," Mr. Moretti said.
Nobody seems to believe that the United States will end up like China or India, where the combination of ultrasound scans and abortion has created a vast gap between the number of boys and girls being born. The good news for society, researchers say, appears to be that the preference for boys is waning somewhat in the United States.
In the 1940's, for example, couples with an only child who was a girl were 8 percent more likely to get a divorce than those with a lone boy. In 2000, the gap was just 5 percent.
"Gender is just not what it used to be," said S. Philip Morgan, chairman of the sociology department at Duke University and a fertility expert. Girls now play high school sports about as often as boys, for example, and they enroll in college more often. 
In fact, Mr. Morgan, who wrote about the divorce gap in the late 1980's, said he could no longer notice it among the group he studied. But because Mr. Dahl and Mr. Moretti used a larger sample, the Census, he said he did not doubt their findings. The two economists are now presenting the paper at seminars across the country and plan to submit it to a journal next month. 
As clear as its results seem to be, Mr. Dahl emphasized that they were not necessarily an indictment of all, or even most, parents' attitudes toward girls: "Remember, the numbers aren't huge. So it doesn't mean this affects the whole population. It might just be a small fraction."
Obviously, that fraction would not include Mr. Dahl, who is the father of three girls. 
"I could not imagine it any other way," he said of his family.

A Tight Job Market Dampens Ivy League Hopes

BYLINE:  By AMY WU

 BODY:
LIKE many other Ivy League students, Rachael M. Roewe had lofty dreams when she entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania four years ago. She would study econom ics, then embark on a career analyzing emerging markets. 
 But the closest she has come to Wall Street since she graduated last May with a bachelor's degree is the MeKong Vietnamese Restaurant and Bar in Greenwich Village, where she works as a waitress on weekday nights and as a bartender on weekends. Last month, she spent her days as a freelance makeup artist at the cosmetics counters of Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue. 
 "I'm just doing this for fun," and to help pay the expenses of living in Manhattan, said Ms. Roewe, 22, who grew up in Burlington, Iowa. She said she had sent out countless resumes and job applications and had even interviewed at a few investment banks, but that she had been told she was either underqualified or overqualified for the few jobs available. 
"I went to a really good school and I did all the right things, so what else can you do?" said Ms. Roewe, who says she was the only person in her high school class to attend an Ivy League college. She said she graduated from Wharton with a 3.1 grade-point average. "You realize that just because you went to the best undergraduate business school doesn't guarantee that you will have a job," she said. 
Almost half a year after finishing their studies, many graduates of Ivy League and other elite colleges have come to that same realization and, like Ms. Roewe, many are settling for jobs that have little to do with their career goals. Some are riding out the tight job market in graduate school.
In a survey last winter of 162 colleges, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that, on average, 51.6 percent of students who finished school last year had a job at graduation, compared with a 62.6 percent rate for graduates the previous year. Most students who had not found a full-time job were willing to pursue other alternatives, with part-time work, unpaid internships and volunteer work the most common options cited. 
The job outlook is likely to remain difficult for the next batch of college graduates, from elite universities or otherwise, but there is a glimmer of hope: some colleges are reporting an increase in on-campus recruiting so far this fall.
The economy is also showing signs of improving, although the nation's overall unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, up from 4.1 percent three years ago. Since February 2001, some 2.84 million jobs have been lost, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And during August, 1.9 million Americans had been looking for work for 27 weeks or more.
ALTHOUGH few Ivy League universities have released employment numbers for the class of 2003, data from the previous two years confirm the continuing challenge in finding jobs. At the Harvard Business School, 87.6 percent of students accepted job offers at graduation in 2000; that number fell to 77.6 percent in 2003, according to David Lampe, a spokesman.
Peggy L. Curchack, an associate director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the job scene this year was "the most difficult market that I've had students try to enter." 
But Ms. Curchack, who has worked at the school's career services department since 1982, said that some investment banks that did not recruit last year had come back for this fall's recruiting, which began last month and continues through November. "What we're beginning to see is a little bit of an increase, and it's looking a little less dismal than we feared," she said. 
Columbia University has had a 10 percent increase in on-campus recruiting this fall, according to Laura Hoffman, director of employer and alumni relations at the university's career center. 
"We're not back anywhere near 2000 levels," she said. But, she added, "I'm cautiously optimistic that things are improving." 
Bain & Company, the management consulting firm, which recruits heavily at Ivy League universities, plans to increase the number of people it recruits on college campuses by 30 percent this year, said Mark E. Jones, director of the company's office in Dallas. 
"We're definitely more optimistic than six to nine months ago," he said. 
In the boom years of the late 1990's, Ivy League students were often courted by corporate recruiters long before graduation. Some students, particularly those in high-demand fields like technology and finance, were flooded with lucrative job offers. Some received perks like club memberships. Although fewer such offers are being made, most Ivy League colleges say their students are still better off than others. 
"Companies are still very interested in students of this kind of caliber," said Philip Jones, the career services director and an assistant dean for undergraduates at Yale. "It's not to sound blase about it because things could be better, and it certainly has been a challenge compared to a few years ago."
Steve Pollock, the president of WetFeet Inc., a company in San Francisco that offers recruiting services, said major companies are more likely to continue recruiting at elite universities because of the high caliber of job candidates and the businesses' long history at the schools. "The companies usually have a core set of schools they focus on, and many are top-ranked academically," he said. 
Many universities have extensive and loyal alumni networks, and they have been bolstering their career services departments by adding staff members and holding workshops. Some want students to come in for career counseling as early as their freshman year.
Last year, Brown University began turning to parents and professors for job leads. It even approached potential employers at professional conferences on campus. "We're being much more proactive to establish relationships; we use every opportunity to reach out as much as possible," said Kimberly G. DelGizzo, Brown's director of career services. 
Still, many recent Ivy League graduates remain in a holding pattern. Ms. Roewe said that her Wharton roommate, who also graduated last spring, had a $7-an-hour internship at Universal Studios, and that another former classmate was working at a Gap store.
Margie Tsaousis, 22, who received a political science degree from Vassar College last spring, worked as an unpaid intern at City Hall in San Francisco before being hired as a legal assistant in that city. She is paid $10 an hour and receives no benefits.
As graduates look for high-paying jobs, many may be wondering if the high price of their education was worth it. Ms. Roewe noted that it cost her parents around $100,000 in tuition alone to send her to Wharton for four years. Last week, the College Board reported that it now costs an average of $26,854 a year to attend a four-year private school, including tuition, fees, room and board, up 5.7 percent from last year.
Carlos Sanchez, 22, of Los Angeles said he thought that the bachelor's degree in economics he received from Princeton in May would land him a six-figure job at an investment bank. The reality check came when he met with a recruiter at a temporary agency. 
"She asked, 'What is your ideal job?' and I said, 'I'd like to get $100,000 a year.' She said: 'What, are you crazy? It's more like $30,000, and you're going to have to settle with that,"' said Mr. Sanchez, who has moved back in with his parents in Rowland Heights, Calif..
Most recently, after a six-month search, he received an offer to be a manager at an industrial supplies company in Los Angeles. He said he would most likely accept the position, though he was still hoping for a job at an investment bank.
"I'll probably stay at the job and play it by ear," he said.
SOME graduates blame themselves for their predicaments. Sunny Cheung, 22, who graduated this year from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in computer science, said: "When I got into Berkeley, people told me you'd get a good job for sure, so I didn't think about jobs until my third year in school. By then I started to worry because I had no internship experience."
Mr. Cheung said that by the time he graduated, he had applied to about 50 companies but was only offered four interviews. He said he took the first offer he received: a $7-an-hour internship at an Internet company in San Francisco, with no benefits apart from the free snacks. He said the Berkeley name is somewhat of an added burden.
"My parents were happy about me finally finding a job, but they think the wage is too low." he said. "They weren't happy about a Berkeley grad getting such a low wage."
Ms. Roewe, meanwhile, says she is hopeful about eventually finding a job on Wall Street. 
"Our generation thinks that you shouldn't have to do things like wait tables," she said. "My dad worked on a farm and worked an egg-processing job while he was in college, so he tells me I don't want to hear about waitressing. I feel like it isn't the worst thing I could do. Maybe I'd even learn something about hard work."

HEADLINE: Conde Nast Redesigns Its Future 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
THE lights of Midtown Manhattan still twinkle in the early-morning darkness as a man walks toward 4 Times Square, a huge office tower. He is short and moves with a shuffle, a gait that suggests he may be a bit old for punching a clock at 5 a.m. With his khakis, loafers and a green sweatshirt that seems too big on him, he could be one of the kitchen staff showing up to prep food at the vaunted Conde Nast cafeteria, four floors up. 
 But look closer at the sweatshirt and the outline of the New Yorker logo emerges. Peer closer at the man and S.I. Newhouse Jr. is revealed, one of the world's richest men and the owner, along with the rest of his family, of a far-flung and immensely profitable media empire. 
 As chairman of Conde Nast Publications, he presides over magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and, yes, The New Yorker -- shiny totems built to assemble wealthy readers and the advertisers who covet them. 
During the day that follows, he might consult his brother, Donald, about acquisitions, have lunch with one of his prized editors and examine printing bills. 
At 75, Mr. Newhouse, known to all as "Si," is a Medici of a glossy fief who finds no detail too small to merit his attention. He and Donald Newhouse, 74, oversee Advance Publications, a family-owned business built on the triad of magazines, newspapers and cable that has $4.2 billion in revenue and more than 22,000 employees. Si Newhouse is this parent company's chairman and Donald its president. 
The company was founded by S.I. Newhouse Sr., but it became a truly diversified enterprise under the sons, with Si running the magazines and Donald in charge of the newspapers. For years, the two brothers ran the business the way their father did, working off the back of the envelope and managing by the seat of their pants.
That approach is changing rapidly. For all the palace intrigue over who will succeed Si Newhouse, the revolution that many thought would occur in the next generation has already taken place -- and has created a markedly different company. 
In the past, Conde Nast's ability to increase revenue was matched only by its ability to spend wildly on content. Little more than a decade ago, the magazine company managed to lose $20 million in a year, but this year it will make more than $120 million, according to industry executives familiar with the numbers. 
American business history is rife with examples of visionary builders who successfully managed to pass on both their legacy and assets to the next generation. But by the third generation, most of it having known only wealth, the dispersal of power often leads to infighting and a sell-off. From the Chandlers of Los Angeles to the Cowles of Minneapolis, many of the biggest owners in media have eventually succumbed. 
THE Newhouses now spend every day making sure that the same thing does not happen to the company their father built out of a single dilapidated newspaper. Si Newhouse is trying to ensure that his values are carried into the future by the people he has chosen as his heirs apparent. 
The only problem with the succession plan, company executives say, is that there probably won't be a succession anytime soon; Mr. Newhouse is hardly frail. Having modernized the business and rendered it more manageable for the next generation, he still expects to be leading the organization for many years. That, inevitably, has caused discomfort, even in the most well behaved of family enterprises.
The family operators of the next generation not only have apprenticed but also have had significant roles. Officially, Steven Newhouse, 46, the son of Donald, heads the Internet operations of both the magazines and the newspapers, retains the title of editor in chief of The Jersey Journal and oversees the Golf Digest division. But as a practical matter, people at the company say, he is deeply involved in every significant initiative at Conde Nast. (Steven Newhouse declined to be interviewed for this article, as did Si and Donald.) 
Working from London, Jonathan Newhouse, 51, the younger cousin of Donald and Si, has taken the brands of Conde Nast and helped build an international division that has half the revenue of its counterpart in the United States. The British version of Glamour magazine in particular has achieved startling success, quickly becoming Britain's leading women's magazine. Both younger Newhouses defer to Si, but executives at the company say that each is ready to run Conde Nast. How those roles will be brokered is up to a very secretive family. 
"There is no need to grandstand," a company executive said. "Everyone knows who has the power." 
Led by a man of few and sometimes mumbled words, the magazine company is not big on rhetoric. Conde Nast and its parent company are highly compartmentalized, and normally loquacious media executives get a serious case of lockjaw when the subject of the family business comes up. That remains true even though the company has a very good story to tell. 
Through shrewd if expensive acquisitions and very well-timed sales, the Newhouses have managed to position their family company for the long haul in an era of behemoths. The profits from cable and the newspapers have been used to build Advance into the second-largest magazine company in the country. 
Historically, the Newhouse newspapers were unambitious but high-earning, and the magazine division was the opposite -- prestigious but with very low returns. Now the newspapers, like The Star-Ledger of Newark and The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, are winning Pulitzers. The New Yorker, a longtime problem child that had lost a total of $200 million since 1985, is finally making money. 
The Newhouses have never been big on synergy -- their various divisions have been uncooperative by design -- but the company reached a size and complexity in which the cost and revenue benefits of acting in concert could no longer be ignored. The severe advertising recession of the past two years has pushed Conde Nast, a paragon of profligacy known for its conga line of idling Town Cars surrounding the building, into focusing on costs. 
As recently as 10 years ago, editors and publishers at Conde Nast had no budgets. Now they find themselves in quarterly budget meetings where they are asked again and again to account for their decisions. The building still has editorial divas with million-dollar contracts swanning about, but on the business side it is no longer enough to pile up ad pages regardless of the price they fetched. 
Si Newhouse once famously compared Conde Nast to MGM in the 1930's, when various stars were kept under contract and allowed to pursue their art. 
James Truman, editorial director of Conde Nast, said: "We are still very much like a movie studio. Except that it's now a modern movie company. It is run like a business."
IN the past, Conde Nast's magazine sales representatives talked trash about corporate siblings in order to land a sale. Now they are part of an integrated corporate media sales effort -- engineered by Steven T. Florio, the president and chief executive of Conde Nast-- that accounts for much of the company's revenue. 
Although the company says it does not negotiate rates, advertisers say it does precisely that with its large corporate package deals. Many of those contracts result in huge special sections that have grown to the point where they threaten to overwhelm the magazines they inhabit and the consumers who try to read them.
Conde Nast charges consumers very little for lavishly produced magazines like Allure;subscribers pay around $1 an issue. In doing so, the company forgoes significant circulation revenue in favor of building an audience for advertisers. 
After generating profit margins of 2 percent or worse in the mid-90's, Conde Nast has now crept into the low teens, according to senior executives. That is still below the industry average, but with revenue of about $1.2 billion, it means that the company is producing at least $120 million a year in earnings. 
The decision, in 1998, to sell Random House to Bertelsmann -- for $1 billion, according to a senior executive at the company -- helped fuel a buying spree. In the last four years, Advance has spent more than $1.1 billion on acquisitions. It bought Fairchild Publications from Disney for $650 million in 1999, and later added Golf Digest from The New York Times Company at a cost of $435 million. Last year, the company bought Modern Bride magazine from Primedia for $52 million, consolidating its position in a niche where it already owned Bride's magazine. 
With the addition of the new divisions, the need for a shared back office for things like human resources, computer systems and purchasing became manifest. So the company not only brought in Michael Wolf, a media consultant from McKinsey & Company, in 2001, but actually put his recommendations into effect. 
In addition, the cowboy culture on the sales side of the organization has been replaced by a much more buttoned-down professionalism. Ron Galotti, a legendary publisher who returned to Conde Nast after the failure of Talk magazine, soon found himself out of a job, in part because his combative style of selling no longer fit with a company that had changed significantly in the years he was gone. 
After a long drought in new titles, the company introduced Lucky, a shopping magazine for women, in 2000. It is connecting with both readers and advertisers and is headed into the black after just three years, according to company executives. And Teen Vogue, a younger, more accessible version of Vogue that began publishing this year, has also elbowed out a place in a very crowded teenage market. Over all, advertising pages are up 7.5 percent at Conde Nast this year.
Fairchild Publications, the division of Advance that produces trade publications like Women's Wear Daily and consumer magazines like W, has established a lower-cost model of publishing under Mary Berner, its president and chief executive. Details, an upmarket men's magazine which floundered under Conde Nast's cost structure, is now flourishing at Fairchild. 
The upshot is that magazine publishing, long considered an expensive hobby at the company, is helping the bottom line.
"We are now making a contribution to the parent company, one that is becoming more and more meaningful," said Charles H. Townsend, chief operating officer of the Advance Magazine Group, the operating company for all the magazine divisions. "We have adopted a certain amount of discipline and have had some success. The risk is that we step over the line and curtail creativity."
There is also the risk that the job goes unfinished. Alexander Liberman, the legendary creative muse of Conde Nast, once suggested that waste was an intrinsic part of the creative process, and some of that ethos remains embedded in the culture. Conde Nast headquarters is still a rarefied environment driven by the fashion of the moment, the kind of place where a poor choice of shoes can turn an elevator ride into an exercise in social Darwinism. Even with an increased emphasis on the bottom line, the publishing company is not going to turn into Wal-Mart anytime soon.
"There is a culture of entitlement here like few businesses I have ever seen," one senior executive at Conde Nast said. "We have made strides, but there is much still to be done."
THE work on both the revenue and the cost side is exactly the kind of thing that companies do to clean themselves up when they are about to be sold or go public. Neither outcome is a possibility with the Newhouses. By remaining private, the company has been able to invest for the long haul and not worry about quarterly performance. 
With Time Warner preoccupied with repairing the damage done by the AOL merger, Advance, which seemed somewhat imperiled five years ago precisely because it was private, can now compete with virtually anyone in the industry. 
The Fairchild acquisition allowed Advance to step up its dominance in fashion magazines. And by acquiring Golf Digest, the company gained more male readers while adding a new population of the wealthy demographic that is its core expertise. 
The company has the money -- and the inclination -- for further shopping. Conde Nast executives said Si Newhouse sent back the sale proposal for New York magazine, which recently came on the market, without looking at it, in part because he believes that the likely price will not be supported by the performance of the magazine. But the appetite for growth remains.
The possibilities are many but not easy to predict. As Primedia sells off more assets, Conde Nast could acquire its car magazines as a way to diversify its advertising base. Or American Express could decide that its lucrative publishing partnership with Time Inc. would be a better fit with Conde Nast. Or perhaps Hachette Filipacchi Media will let go of some of its American holdings, which include fashion titles and male-oriented magazines like Car and Driver.
It all depends on willing sellers, but the Newhouses move swiftly, sometimes with little regard for price, when they are in the mood to buy.
"If Si and Donald want something, there are not a lot of people to run it by," said one executive at the company. "They can do a deal over dinner if they wish."
EVEN as the third generation becomes ever more ready to take control, Mr. Newhouse squeezes the wheel all the tighter. His management is old school to a fault, although it has been upgraded technologically. His legendary "yellow rain," a hail of notes and questions scrawled on yellow notepad paper, has been digitized as e-mail messages.
"The day that Si figured out how to use e-mail was a bad day for all of us here," one senior executive said.
Mr. Florio has managed to remain chief executive of Conde Nast in part because he and Richard Beckman, chief marketing officer, have put together huge corporate deals that have fueled much of the growth. But part of Mr. Florio's durability comes from his willingness to execute Mr. Newhouse's whims, which can change by the hour, and his ability to motivate and soothe people who might otherwise become worn out by Mr. Newhouse's rougher edges. Mr. Florio is the public face of the company, and he is everything Mr. Newhouse is not: jovial, talkative and prone to bragging.
Mr. Newhouse remains a micromanager who is just as interested in the number of regional ad pages a competitor ran or a layout deep in one of the magazines as he is in major acquisitions, according to several company officials. He is not big on communication, but his opinions are known, they say.
"Si has a real eye for the weakness of something," Mr. Truman, the editorial director, said. "He won't say much, but just by standing there and going from one foot to the other while he looks as something, you know it needs work. His gift is knowing what makes people want to read magazines."
He also has an eye for talent. When he made the decision to replace Grace Mirabella with Anna Wintour at Vogue, his choice was ridiculed in every corner. Under Ms. Wintour, Vogue continues to be one of the most dominant magazines in publishing.
"He has always been incredibly supportive at the personal and professional level," Ms. Wintour said. "Being at Vogue without Si is unthinkable. He is a very important source of advice for me."
If history is any indication, he will be available for quite some time. Mr. Newhouse's father died in 1979 at the age of 83, and he worked nearly every day of his life. People who know the family say that the subject of succession is a nonissue, in part because Si and Donald are in excellent health and in part because it is just not seemly. The Newhouses have never engaged in the kind of public bickering that often tears apart families and their businesses, these people say.
"They have managed to steer clear of the internal fighting that splits up other family businesses," said Roger L. Martin, the dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto and a former adviser to privately owned companies. "Donald and Si each have coherent defined roles, they clearly enjoy what they are doing and are using the fact that they are private to accomplish a great deal."
Mr. Newhouse and his brother have managed to set the table for those who will come behind them in much the same way their father did before them. The last part will be the hard part: getting out of the way.

When Jobs Move Overseas (to South Carolina)

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

DATELINE: CAMDEN, S.C. 

 BODY:
WHILE many American manufacturers look to China as a place to make their products with cheap labor, an odd turnabout is taking place in this small town northeast of Columbia. 
 There, one of China's best-known companies, the Haier Group, is churning out refrigerators at a factory staffed by American workers. 
 The decision to build in South Carolina was a step toward the company's goal of making Haier a household name in America, like Whirlpool or Maytag. Haier argues that the plant saves transportation costs.
To the company, which had $8.5 billion in revenue last year, the plant is at the core of its vision to expand in the United States. The factory, completed in 2000 at a cost of $40 million, is designed to respond nimbly to American retailers, who stock little inventory but want to replenish supplies quickly when products run out, said David Parks, a senior vice president of Haier's American unit. Shipping refrigerators from Asia can take up to six weeks. 
"The factory makes perfect sense," Mr. Parks said. "When you ship refrigerators, you ship a lot of air, and shipping air is expensive."
But the factory is about far more than saving money on refrigerators. It is an expression of nationalist pride and of the Chinese government's determination to expand overseas in markets that it considers prestigious. 
The government's objective is to catapult at least 50 Chinese companies onto the Fortune Global 500 list, according to its official media, up from the current 11. Haier is not on the Fortune list, which ranks the world's largest companies, but has been picked by the government to make the leap. 
So far, the factory has brought Zhang Ruimin, the company's chief executive, glowing coverage in the Chinese news media. 
Mr. Zhang has sometimes called himself the Jack Welch of China. Last year, he was admitted into the Communist Party's elite ruling club, the Central Committee. The story of his success at turning an anemic state-owned factory into an appliance giant with overseas sales has been made into a movie. Many Chinese have become more enamored with corporate executives than revolutionaries, so Mr. Zhang is something of a national hero. In that context, the opening of Haier's American factory is as much a cultural victory as a business one. To gain market share from Whirlpool and Maytag on their own turf, however, may be tough. "In this industry, people buy on the price and the name recognition," said Diane Ritchey, the editor of Appliance, a trade magazine. "Everybody knows Maytag or Whirlpool orFrigidaire. People are going to buy what their mothers or grandmothers used. 
"Some people cannot even pronounce their name," Ms. Ritchey said of Haier. "How comfortable are you going to be to have something in your home when you cannot pronounce its brand?" (The name is pronounced "higher.")
Haier, partially owned by the government of the northern city of Qingdao, where it is based, has made some headway in small American market niches. It had a third of the market for compact refrigerators last year, three years after it began selling them here, and it captured half the market for refrigerated wine cabinets in about a year, according to a report by McKinsey, the management consulting firm. 
Those products, often selling for a third less than those of competitors, can be found in Target, Wal-Mart, Costco and Best Buy stores.
But the company has set its sights higher. It wants 10 percent of the United States market for standard-sized refrigerators by 2005, Mr. Parks said. Last year, it sold about 100,000 of them, or 2 percent of the total. Consumers have found them to be generally reliable, and they are cheaper than similar refrigerators selling under American brand names. Steven Duthie, a spokesman for Whirlpool, called Haier "a still very minor player" and its popular compact refrigerators "tiny little" appliances that are not much of a threat in the broader refrigerator market. 
In Camden, a quiet town of 6,000, the boxlike, squeaky-clean factory among the hayfields provides 200 much-needed jobs, as several American manufacturers have shrunk or closed plants in the area. Cultural clashes are few because almost every employee at the factory is American.
Inside the plant, the presence of the Chinese company is felt in dozens of slogans, written in both Chinese and English, on banners hanging from the ceilings. ("Never Say No to the Market," one says.) Managers decorate their offices with at least one award certificate issued and signed by Mr. Zhang.
Haier pays most of its American machine operators a little more than $10 an hour, 10 times what it pays in China, along with health care benefits. Donna Fortner, whose family has lived in Camden for generations, came to work for the plant three years ago after she was laid off by a nearby truck maker. 
At the beginning, Ms. Fortner worked with some Chinese technicians, who all returned home a few months ago. Although she couldn't understand the accented English some of them spoke, they managed to teach her how to operate the machinery by simply showing her. When one of her three children needed to do school projects on foreign countries, she collected the Chinese newspapers that wrapped spare machinery parts and asked her Chinese mentors to translate the articles. 
WHEN the factory was opening, Gerald Reeves, the human resources director, led a team of 10 workers to visit the headquarters in Qingdao, which is known for its sea breezes. Besides finding fermented Chinese eggs inedible, he was impressed by how disciplined Chinese workers are. "When they had their end-of-day group meetings, they stood in nice straight lines," Mr. Reeves said. "I'll never get my people to stand in lines like that."
For Allan Guberski, general manager of the plant, the discovery on the trip was the "strategic business unit" approach to management, widely used at the Haier plants in Qingdao. This approach turns each worker into an independent unit, rewarded for inventing ways to save the company money and punished for wasting its resources. 
"I want the workers to know that their jobs each day are tocontribute enough to the business to pay their own salaries," Mr. Guberski said. 
He is still seeking an acceptable way to put the system in place, because labor laws in the two countries are different. "Here, for example, you cannot have somebody work overtime and not pay him," he said.
The only employee from the company headquarters who has remained in Camden is Sihai Wu, 29, the factory's chief financial officer. "Finance is the most critical link," Mr. Wu said, "and the top bosses want to make sure that it is done right." 
Conversations between the factory and the Qingdao headquarters happen three or four times a week, Mr. Parks said. Haier designs new products mostly in Qingdao, but Camden sometimes sends ideas back to headquarters. The refrigerators the company sells in China tend to be smaller than those it offers in the United States because Chinese homes are not as big. Although Haier, which offers stocks for two of its divisions on the Shanghai exchange, has widely trumpeted its overseas achievement back home, there are doubters. They have pressed the company to say how much profit it has earned in the United States. Haier has refused. 
Paul Gao, a McKinsey consultant based in Shanghai, said it is common for Chinese companies to forge ahead abroad with the domestic audience in mind. "Good news from America certainly makes the brands look stronger back at home," he said. 
Scholars of Chinese business say leaders of state-owned companies are often willing to try tactics that don't make economic sense for their companies but yield political benefits for themselves. The careers of top managers at companies like Haier that are entirely or partially state-owned are heavily directed by the government.
"Ultimately, the managers are accountable to the political leaders," said Zhiwu Chen, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management. "They are not accountable to the shareholders."
Although the Chinese government does not give outright subsidies to native companies to encourage overseas expansion, it has arranged for state-run banks to offer them low-interest loans. 
But other large Chinese companies eager to grab market share in the United States are not following Haier in building American factories. They know the market can be perilous. Konka, which dominates China's television market, shut its sales and promotional branch in San Diego two years ago after failing to crack the American market and hemorrhaging money for three years. 
At times, the government's enthusiasm makes some of the Chinese companies' American business partners cringe. Roger Zhao, who has set up a joint venture with S.V.A., a large television maker in Shanghai, to sell its products in the United States, said his objective and his partner's are "disconnected." While his aim is to maximize profit, he said, his partner's is tinged with a wish for political glory.
As for why Haier has set up an American plant, he has his own explanations.
"To have it in Mexico would make more sense," he said. "But to the Chinese, expanding abroad without expanding to America doesn't feel like the real thing."

The Call of the Franchise Grows Louder

BYLINE:  By BETSY CUMMINGS

 BODY:
UNTIL last March, Tami Swearingin was a division general manager in Atlanta for PPG Industries, the glass, sealant and coating conglomerate, with a six-figure salary and a sure path toward a top-tier position. Now she is driving trucks and sharpening blades as owner of a U.S. Lawns franchise in Phoenix. Her sales for this year will be an estimated $558, 000, she said, down from an annual figure of $20 million at her old job, and her number of co-workers has fallen to 16 from 30,000. But her autonomy and enthusiasm have risen conversely.
 "In a franchise," she said, "it's a great feeling to wake up everyday being able to be creative, and knowing you can take action, versus going through some long, laborious process of decision making and bureaucracy." 
 Many dissatisfied executives have been exploring franchising as a path to career independence. For some, it is a chance to build a business from the ground up. For others, it is a way to step away from depleted 401(k) plans, thin staffs and restrictive management.
Franchising typically increases in tough economic times as managers, fearful of downsizing or other job uncertainties, seek new options. But this year, franchisers say they are talking to more executives than ever. 
At chains like Subway, Au Bon Pain and Panera Bread, managers from other companies are applying to be franchisees. "We get 200 to 300 sales leads a month," said Geoff Hill, senior vice president for franchise sales and development at Carvel, the ice cream store franchiser. "As many as 75 percent of those are people currently in corporate America, or those who have just left." 
At the 7-Eleven chain, half of the more than six dozen franchisee applicants this year are executives, said Margaret Shebree, a spokeswoman. Don Fertman, Subway's director of development, said that roughly 20 percent of about 2,800 stores that Subway expects to open by year's end would be run by former executives. 
Terry Powell, chief executive and founder of the Entrepreneur's Source, a business ownership consultant in Southbury, Conn., said: "People are looking to take control of their destiny and become self-sufficient. Our organization has grown from 70 offices to 250 in the past two years to meet demand for those looking to explore options in franchising."
For former executives who have never run a company, franchises offer a relatively safe entree into business ownership because they include a developed brand, training support and management advice. But those with visions of huge cash flow and a "prop your feet on the desk" management style are unrealistic, said Scott Shane, a franchising expert and professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
Last fall, Jamie McDonald left her executive position with a Deutsche Bank unit in Baltimore. "I had 16 years of a fabulous career," Ms. McDonald said. "But I had a yearning to do something different. My learning curve was flatter than it had ever been, and I was ready for a change." 
Ms. McDonald, who is 40, spent months exploring business options, including franchising. In October, she opened a franchise of Velocity Sports Performance, which offers group or individual athletic training. While Velocity, founded in 1999, does not have the brand recognition of, say, a Burger King, it marries Ms. McDonald's passion for athletics with her financial acumen. In addition, Velocity's start-up price was $250,000, while Burger King franchises start at $400,000.
PICKING an unknown brand can be risky, Mr. Shane said. A 1999 study published in the journal Management Science by Mr. Shane and Maw-Der Foo, a professor at the National University of Singapore, showed that only 25 percent of new franchise systems, those without brand recognition, survived more than 10 years. Only 15 percent made it to 17 years. 
But for executives with the capital to take a risk, that may not be such a disturbing trend. This April, Patrick Schneider, 42, a former partner at Accenture, left his high-powered corporate position to start several HCX International hair salons. 
"My wife's concern was that it would wipe us out," said Mr. Schneider, who invested $200,000. "I said, 'We could fall flat on our face and lose everything and it won't put us in bankruptcy."' 
At his former Accenture office, in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Schneider oversaw a $15 million relationship with FleetBoston, an account he had been responsible for since 2000. "I took that client as far as I could take it," he said. "I spent 12 years on airplanes Monday through Friday. I wanted to get back home to my 2-year-old daughter and stop chasing planes for a living."
Another Accenture partner, Roy Phelan, took a voluntary severance package and left the company in 2000. He has opened the first of a planned 24 Supercuts hair salons over the next eight years in the Cleveland area. "I wanted a good brand name, but I didn't want to be behind the counter," he said. 
Franchising experts say hands-on management can help first-time franchisees. "Absentee-managed businesses do not perform nearly as efficiently" as those with managers who are actively involved, said Chris Lehnes, vice president for business development at CIT Small Business Lending, which provides franchise loans through the Small Business Administration. 
Many franchisees contend that to succeed, owners need to be both janitor and chief executive. Rick Postle, 54, former president of Panera Bread and now a franchisee of the company in three mid-Atlantic states, routinely works more than 70 hours a week. He typically arrives at a store by 6 a.m. and assists bakers for the next eight hours. "You have to go back to work, you have to depend more on yourself, and you always get paid last," he said.
But many franchisees say the sacrifice is worth it. Ms. McDonald said of her fitness business: "It's more intense than anything I've done in a long time. If this works, it's going to be my success. If it fails, it's going to be my failure.
"I find myself waking up at 4 a.m. thinking about something that needs to be done. If I don't get up then and do it, I worry it won't get done. But, honestly, I'm smiling the whole time. It's all me."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Anthony L.T. Cragg; 
Strong Asia Pacific Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
ANTHONY L. T. CRAGG, manager of the $115 million Strong Asia Pacific fund, says that his mutual fund is dominated by value stocks, a lingering result of the Asian financial crisis that began in 1998, but that he is beginning to look for shares of faster-growing companies. 
 "Asia fell off the radar screen," Mr. Cragg said from his home office in Evergreen, Colo. "Lots of names have been ignored" by investors and analysts, he said, adding: "Many of these economies are just turning the corner, and valuations are still cheap. But as the economies heat up, we're getting into more growth stories." 
 The fund returned 4.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, ranking in the top 1 percent of diversified Pacific-Asia funds. That category lost 6.6 percent, annualized, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund returned 55.9 percent in the last 12 months, compared with 28.2 percent for its group.
Mr. Cragg, 47, works for Strong Capital Management, the fund's adviser in Milwaukee. Strong's trading practices are under investigation by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, who said that the company had allowed a hedge fund, Canary Capital, to engage in frequent trades, known as market timing, to the detriment of other shareholders. Richard S. Strong, the company's chairman, said it had hired outsiders, including the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm, to conduct an internal review of the accusations. He said that Strong would provide restitution to any affected shareholder "if it is determined that the transactions by Canary caused a monetary loss to the funds referenced in the complaint."
William S. Rocco, senior analyst for Morningstar, called Strong Asia Pacific a "quirky fund that has done reasonably well over time." He said, however, that because of the investigation, Morningstar recommends that investors not buy shares in Strong funds and sell funds that they already own, subject to tax and other financial planning considerations.
Mr. Cragg picks the 60 to 70 stocks in the Asia Pacific fund from more than a dozen countries, including China, Japan, Malaysia, India, Thailand and Australia, and says he uses no computer screens to identify purchases. Instead, he relies on his knowledge of the region. (He lived and worked on and off in Japan and Hong Kong from 1977 to 1986.)
He is betting on a recovery of the travel and leisure industries in Asia, he said, and has been investing in hotels, airlines and other tourism-related companies. He has also invested in natural resources companies, expecting heavy demand for materials as manufacturing grows in China.
Investing in Asia poses particular challenges, Mr. Cragg said, because analysts have less comprehensive information than they would in the United States, and the accounting is often murky. Still, he said, there are good values to be found.
Mr. Cragg began buying shares of the Hainan Meilan Airport Company in April. The company, whose shares trade in Hong Kong, operates an airport on Hainan, a tropical island off of mainland China that he calls the "Hawaii of China." "More Chinese have the means, the money and the freedom to travel," he said. 
He paid 3.82 Hong Kong dollars a share, on average, for the position. On Friday, the stock closed at 5.45 Hong Kong dollars. 
In September, he started buying shares of Royal Garden Resorts, traded in Bangkok. He paid 15.96 Thai baht, on average, for the shares, which now trade at 17.3 baht. 
Royal Garden now has eight hotels in Thailand under several brand names and plans to open three others in Asia in the next two years, including two Four Seasons hotels. The company should benefit from the rebound in Asian travel, he added. The growth of Jubilee Mines, an Australian producer of nickel ore, should be driven by increasing demand, particularly from China for steel manufacturing, Mr. Cragg said. Moreover, analysts projectthat nickel prices will rise about 20 percent in 2004, "and that has a leveraged impact on its bottom line," he added.
The fund began buying shares in September, paying 3.47 Australian dollars, on average; they are now at 4.49 Australian dollars.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
Hmm. ThatFever in the Market Looks Familiar.

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
BASED on current projections, corporate earnings will surpass their 2000 peak next year. Many individual stocks have had a spectacular year. Avaya, a maker of office telephone equipment, is up 422 percent for the year, the best performance in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 The economy is growing at about a 6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the best period in almost three years, spurred in part by the $350 billion tax cut approved this spring. 
 These factors have contributed to a year that almost certainly will break the three-year plunge in the stock market. As of Friday, the S.&P. 500 is up 17 percent for the year. The broader S.&P. 1,500 supercomposite -- which includes the 500 index and many smaller companies that have performed well this year -- has climbed 17.8 percent. With a huge boost from technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index is up a breathtaking 39.7 percent.
But all is not well in the stock market. There is a spot of speculative fever, the same type that infected the market at the end of the 1990's. The positive market factors right now can be parsed in ways that make one wonder about the outlook.
For example, 222 stocks in the S.&P. 1,500 index had prices of $10 or less at the end of 2002. On average, they are up 64.4 percent this year, the best average performance of any group of stocks in the index. But 103 of them, almost half, have no earnings, according to Birinyi Associates, a research and money management firm in Westport, Conn. 
"You hear that X percent of companies beat estimates, but to me they are not the right companies" beating expectations, said Laszlo Birinyi, the president of the firm. "It just shows to me a little hint of the 1990's."
Avaya, which was a spin-off from the earnings-challenged Lucent Technologies, had a loss in the first quarter, no earnings in the second quarter and then an earnings jump in the third quarter, to 6 cents a share, from a loss of 18 cents a share in the third quarter a year earlier. Through Oct. 14, the stock was up 461.6 percent for the year, though it has slipped a bit recently. 
At Johnson & Johnson, the maker of health care products, earnings have been steady for years. The company's profits jumped 17 percent in the first and second quarters this year and rose 19 percent in the third quarter, based on the earnings data compiled by Thomson First Call. 
But the Johnson & Johnsons have been no match for companies that barely have earnings but have promised pennies in increases that translate into huge percentage gains. Johnson & Johnson's stock is down 6.3 percent for the year.
As for the tax cut, it did help the economy, many analysts are now acknowledging. But the reduction in tax on corporate dividends that was its thematic centerpiece didn't do that much for dividend-paying stocks.
Barra Inc., which analyzes market risk, has found that the appetite for stocks with high dividend yields began to decline abruptly in early June, just weeks after the dividend tax cut was approved. In performance, these stocks have since lagged behind those that don't pay dividends.
There are 368 stocks in the S.&P. 500 that pay dividends. The average total return for them this year through Thursday is 21.9 percent, according to Howard Silverblatt, equity analyst at S.&P. The average return for those not paying dividends is almost twice that, at 41.7 percent.
THESE bothersome trends should not upset the market if the economy continues to expand at a healthy clip and earnings exceed expectations. But earnings may still prove to be a problem. 
The current forecast calls for quarterly earnings growth to slow from 21 percent in the third quarter and 22 percent in the fourth to about 12 percent next year. That could dampen the enthusiasm of investors who have been snapping up low-priced stocks with big earnings promises.

HEADLINE: As Silicon Valley Reboots, the Geeks Take Charge 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 

 BODY:
THE look and attitude of the place is loose, irreverent and bustling. Large canvas umbrellas rise over cubicles like giant office toadstools. Quirky stuffed toys and personal memorabilia clutter the desks, surrounding the flat-panel computer screens. 
 Here at Tellme Networks, youthful executives speak of riding a wave that will change the balance of power and economics of their industry. "It sort of has the feel of an Internet start-up of around 1996," said Michael McCue, the company's president. 
 Are the good times back in Silicon Valley? After all, technology stocks are up sharply this year. A number of tech stalwarts, led by the computer chip giant Intel, have recently reported robust quarterly results. And scores of start-ups like Tellme Networks are thriving again. 
But this is no bubble redux. Instead, Silicon Valley, the entrepreneurial hub of the nation's high-tech economy, is rebooting, just as a computer does after it crashes. And this time, the geeks are the ones with the upper hand. 
The valley is populated with people of various talents, but its essence begins with the software and hardware engineers. They create technology tools that then find investors and users in the marketplace. It is, first and foremost, a high-tech tool shop. 
That fundamental truth was forgotten in the boom years. The short-lived dot-coms were just marketing plans lashed to the Internet. They had no technology edge; they were run by marketers and M.B.A.'s. But most of the young companies that survived the crash -- and the start-ups that have risen since -- are based on innovation and are run by people with deep technical skills.
"The failure rate was highest for the start-ups that were Internet bets on a business model," said Peter Currie, a partner in the Silicon Valley office of General Atlantic Partners, a venture capital firm. "Others, with a large technology component, have often found a way for the technology and the company to go forward." 
A recent tour through a handful of young companies provided a glimpse of the renewal, innovation, optimism and, yes, challenges evident in the incubator that is Silicon Valley. Someday, biotechnology or nanotechnology or something else may drive the nation's high-tech economy. But for now, information technology -- which represents more than half of all business capital investment -- will remain the engine. And judging from what's going on in the valley, there seems to be plenty of fuel left. 

A Quick Shift in Focus
Tellme was founded in 1999, amid the boom, with a bold idea and an impressive pedigree. Its unofficial start came a bit earlier, during a conversation between Mr. McCue, former vice president of technology at Netscape Communications, the Internet browser pioneer, and John Doerr, the venture capitalist and general partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Mr. Doerr liked the idea, and the money soon flowed from Kleiner and other venture capital firms. From 1999 to the fall of 2000, Tellme raised $238 million. "Even back then, it was a lot of money," Mr. McCue noted.
The Tellme team was heavy with young technologists from Netscape, including Mr. McCue, Angus Davis and John Giannandrea, who is the chief technology officer. They were looking for a new challenge after Netscape was sold to AOL, and their vision was to bring flexible, low-cost Internet technology to the staid world of telecommunications. Using voice-recognition software, a person would ask for a stock price, sports score or restaurant listing over the phone, the search would be run and the answer would come back, translated into speech.
The idea was Web-style searching for telephones. It started mainly as a consumer service, and its toll-free phone number was advertised on the sides of buses. The company's payroll peaked at 230 people in early 2001. But as the economy soured, Tellme shelved the consumer business and focused instead on applying the technology to help big companies automate their call centers -- a market it had been developing in tandem with the consumer business. 
"We got ahead of ourselves," Mr. McCue said, explaining the reversal. "We had a big vision, and we raised a lot of money and it was the go-go years." 
Today, Tellme has about 20 big customers including American Airlines, Merrill Lynch and Verizon. It has data centers in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Mesa, Ariz., and employs 170 people. It collects a fee for each call handled but offers huge cost savings to customers. The higher the percentage of calls that can be automated -- handled by voice recognition, voice synthesis and Web search software instead of a human operator -- the greater the savings. 
For the largest call centers, analysts estimate, an increase of one percentage point in automation generates a savings of $5 million a year. Using Tellme, AT&T's directory assistance service for toll-free numbers (800-555-1212) has gone from 15 percent automated handling with an older system to 70 percent using Tellme. 
The company started generating positive cash flow last quarter and expects revenue to reach $100 million next year. "We've crossed the line," Mr. McCue said. 
Mr. Giannandrea added, "We changed the business model to survive, but the actual technology has been the same since Day One."
Companies across Silicon Valley tell similar stories. The marketing plan, business model and sometimes the company itself die, but good technology tends to live on. Think of it as the business-and-technology equivalent of the "selfish gene," a term coined by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who argues that the gene rather than the larger organism is the fundamental unit of survival.

From 380 Employees to 32
The InterTrust Technologies Corporation is a prime example. A former public company that had 380 employees in 2001, InterTrust is now a private company with 32 workers.
Talal Shamoon, a computer scientist who became its chief executive earlier this year, lived through the roller coaster ride. In 1994, he joined the NEC Research Center in Princeton, N.J., where he worked with a colleague on software that applied the equivalent of a watermark to digital pictures. The technology promised to be useful in the nascent field of digital rights management, a fancy name for piracy protection.
In 1997, Mr. Shamoon said, "the call of the valley was strong," and he moved west with the idea of starting a company. Instead, he joined InterTrust, based in Santa Clara, Calif., which had been developing rights-handling software for commercial content like music and movies. 
Its concept was ambitious -- a kind of operating system for securely managing, billing and protecting digital media. InterTrust was working with several big media companies including Universal, Bertelsmann, EMI and AOL. The company went public in the fall of 1999 and raised more than $200 million.
But the economy stumbled, and media companies were slow to adopt strategies for digital rights management or to make commitments to technology suppliers like InterTrust. By the summer of 2001, the company was burning cash well beyond its revenue. "We realized we had to chew off our leg to get out of the bear trap," Mr. Shamoon said.
So the company pulled back from its elaborate plans and adopted a business model based on licensing patents to others.
In April 2001, after discussions with Microsoft fell apart, InterTrust filed a patent infringement suit contending that the company illegally used InterTrust's technology in its Windows Media Player and other products. The suit is pending.
But the sudden shift in strategy and the prospect of costly litigation did not frighten off corporate investors, who were impressed by InterTrust's technology. An investment group including Sony and Phillips bought InterTrust last year for $453 million. 
"No one gets too torn up about a business plan or a company failing in the valley," Mr. Shamoon said. "That leads to a certain technological immortality. The vessel may die, but the intellectual capital lives on."
But not without a cost. "I fired 350 people, and it's pretty depressing," said William Rainey, vice president and associate general counsel of InterTrust. "But people understood. The business model changed. There was no real animosity."

A Juggling Act in Software
When Diane Greene, chief executive of VMware, was making the rounds of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley in the late 1990's, she found few takers. "We would have taken V.C. money," Ms. Greene said. "But it was the bubble, and we were an old-fashioned software company." 
Today, VMware has 360 employees, its sales are growing strongly and it has been profitable for four consecutive quarters. The company's success is based on a clever technology that saves money in corporate data centers and gives technology managers more freedom in how they use computer hardware. 
VMware sells software that allows a computer to run different operating systems at the same time, or several instances of the same operating system, so that one machine can reliably handle a variety of computing chores. This kind of software, known as a virtual machine, has been used since the 1960's on mainframe computers, but VMware's technology is tailored for lower-cost machines powered by chips from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.
VMware's first offering ran on desktop computers and became a hit among software developers, who were able to design and test different programs easily on one machine. But the company's major business now is allowing multiple copies of Linux or Windows operating systems, and the applications that run on them, to work on one data-serving computer. This pushes the larger machines in corporate data centers to run more efficiently, keeping them busy 80 percent of the time instead of 20 percent.
In December, VMware plans to ship a product that allows programs running across networks of computers to divide the work automatically among machines for better performance, or to allow hardware to be repaired while the programs keep running -- almost as a juggler can keep several balls in the air without dropping one.
VMware also offers a glimpse of the social network of Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay area. Ms. Greene is a veteran of Sybase, Tandem Computer, Silicon Graphics and a couple of start-ups. She was trained first as a naval architect at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but became fascinated by computing because much of the ship design work she did at a San Francisco consulting firm was computer-aided. 
So she studied computer science and earned a master's degree at the University of California at Berkeley, where she met her husband, Mendel Rosenblum, who is now a computer science professor at Stanford and was a founder of VMware, down the road from the Stanford campus in Palo Alto. Mr. Rosenblum is a well-known researcher in operating systems design, and part of his research formed the technological basis for VMware. 
The company's product development requires technologists with deep computer science and mathematical skills, and VMware has been among the biggest recruiters of such skilled workers.
"The valley has an amazing concentration of people who really love to create things, to build this technology," Ms. Greene observed.

Betting on E-Mail and Linux
By 2002, Julie Hanna Farris had been on the founding team of three Internet start-ups -- Portola, 2Bridge and Onebox.com -- in an exhilarating and exhausting run. After that, the only business idea that intrigued her was opening "a Betty Ford clinic for burned-out entrepreneurs," she recalled. 
But a brief stint as entrepreneur-in-residence at Mayfield, a venture capital firm, whetted her appetite for another technology start-up. Opportunity, she said, beckons in Silicon Valley these days. 
"There is a lot of phenomenal intellectual property that has not found its way into the marketplace yet," Ms. Farris said.
The opportunity that caught her eye was to develop e-mail server software to run on the Linux operating system. Ms. Farris, who has spent much of her career working on computer messaging products, determined that some e-mail software called OpenMail, created in the early 1990's by Hewlett-Packard, was a good starting point. 
The software was well designed, but it never took off in a marketplace. Yet OpenMail, Ms. Farris noted, was built in a modular design, resembling Lego blocks of code, so the server software could be decoupled and made to work seamlessly behind the desktop e-mail programs of Microsoft and others.
So Ms. Farris licensed the OpenMail software from Hewlett-Packard, hired veteran e-mail engineers and founded Scalix in June 2002. The start-up, based in San Mateo,has raised more than $13 million in venture financing, has hired more than 20 people and plans to have about 40 by year-end. 
Like executives at other companies hoping to ride the Linux bandwagon, Ms. Farris says the appeal of Linux is as much about allowing corporate customers to move onto inexpensive PC hardware as it is about the operating system itself. Each big shift in computing, from the mainframe to the personal computer, opened the door to a fresh approach to e-mail and demand for new products from new companies.
"My bet with Scalix is that Linux is bringing a similar opportunity today," Ms. Farris said. "Our bet is that utility-class messaging -- secure, reliable and rich e-mail for tens of thousands of corporate users -- will be a killer application for Linux."
Ms. Farris, 38, says her years in Silicon Valley have taught her that experience, vision and technology are the vital ingredients for entrepreneurial success. A dose of optimism also helps. "You've got to be willing to suspend disbelief," she said.
As tech bounces back, however, there is concern that Wall Street may be a little too optimistic. Venture capitalists here shake their heads at what some call today's "echo bubble" in tech stocks, given the uneven progress of the economic recovery and the still-sluggish pace of corporate purchases of computer hardware, software and services. 
Silicon Valley, they say, is not going back to the manic boom times of the 1990's. It has simply gone back to doing what it has always done best -- innovating, investing and bringing new technology to the marketplace.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Statistic That Tells Only Half The Story

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS; Daniel Gross writes the Moneybox column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
EVERY Thursday morning, investors, economic forecasters and, increasingly, political pundits pounce on the Labor Department's numbers for new jobless claims. The report provides a sort of weekly thumbs up or thumbs down on the economy's progress and, hence, on the Bush administration's economic policy. 
 Last week, the department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000, to 386,000, in the week ended Oct. 18.The four-week average -- more useful because it smoothes weekly fluctuations -- held steady at 392,250. Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao hailed the data as another tile placed in an increasingly shiny mosaic. "With the president's jobs and growth plan now having a real, positive and lasting impact on the economy, we expect to see increased job creation in the coming months," she said. 
 Should we really be encouraged? After all, aren't 386,000 more people -- roughly the population of Sacramento, Calif. -- now standing on unemployment lines? 
Yet the four-week average is below what economists and forecasters commonly regard as the magic number: 400,000. Jennifer Kelleher, who is an economist at Economy.com, which provides economic, financial and industry research, said that at least since 1990, "when the first-time claims fall below 400,000, the overall trend in employment will be flat or up." 
In fact, over the last 13 years, a sub-400,000 figure has been a pretty good coincident indicator for job growth. From October 1990 to October 1992, a period of job loss, the first-time claims figure remained stubbornly above 400,000. From mid-October 1992 through May 2001, a period in which the economy added a stunning 23 million jobs, the four-week average never topped 400,000.
There are other reasons to pay heed. The figure is a rare weekly gauge of the economy's health. And the claims data is hard and comprehensive: state labor offices tally the claims filed and forward them to Washington. By contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics arrives at the monthly figures on household employment and business payrolls by sampling a small slice of the economic pie.
Some economists suggest that the unemployment claims numbers are worth watching not for what they say but for who else is watching them. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, "pays a lot of attention to that figure," said Lawrence F. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. "The market is always trying to guess what the Fed's likely reaction to the data will be." Even when the government shut down in the mid-1990's in a budget battle, Mr. Greenspan arranged to get the weekly data. 
But it is not as if the economy starts to lose jobs the week the metric exceeds 400,000 and the job-production machinery creaks into gear the week it falls below. More recently, the 400,000 figure has been less a tipping point than a fuzzy guidepost. 
In June 2000, when first-time claims were only about 280,000, the economy lost jobs. From March 2001 through July 2002, when the number of payroll jobs declined each month, the four-week average ranged from 365,000 to 496,000. It did not top 400,000 until June 2001 -- three months into the job-letting. In the fall of 2002, the number of payroll jobs grew while the claims figures were above 400,000.
WHAT has been maddening about this recovery is that claims have not fallen much below 400,000. After all, the difference between 390,000 new claims and 401,000 new claims -- on a job base of 129 million--is not significant. "All these numbers are so tentative and so close to borderline that nobody is jumping out and saying that jobs are ready to recover right now," Ms. Kelleher said.
Ultimately, the claims tell only half the story. A rapidly changing economy with flexible labor markets, like that of the United States, is constantly putting people out of work. For much of the last decade, jobs were so plentiful that many displaced employees found new work quickly, without submitting claims for benefits. An increase in claims is not a symptom that companies are suddenly shedding jobs. It is a sign that displaced workers are not finding new positions quickly.
Based on the recent trends in first-time claims -- they have been below 400,000 for three consecutive weeks -- the Labor Department anticipates an increase in payroll jobs for October. But here, too, there is another nice, round figure to watch. If payrolls add 150,000 jobs in a month -- a figure not recorded since May 2000 -- economists say that will be a sign that the economy is in serious job-creation mode.

 BODY:
Bleak Reading, From Arabs, About the Arab World
THE second annual Arab Human Development Report, released by the United Nations Development Program and written by "leading Arab intellectuals and policy analysts writing primarily for an Arab audience," describes an Arab world that is failing to educate its people, offer them basic freedoms, encourage individual enterprise or support women's rights. An excerpt from the report follows: 
 Knowledge in Arab countries today appears to be on the retreat. Ingrained structural impediments stand in the way of building the knowledge society in the region. Current political and social orientations diminish the role played by knowledge in Arab societies. . . . While knowledge in the region stumbles, the developed world is racing toward knowledge-intensive societies. This trend will further accentuate the asymmetry of world knowledge development and endow a few countries with near-supremacy in knowledge production and consumption. 
 Based on their present performance, Arabs would remain in a marginal position in this next phase of human history. This position would be the logical consequence of a decline that has lasted for seven centuries, while much of the world made enormous progress in developing knowledge and human welfare. Continuing with this historic slide is an untenable course if the Arab people are to have a dignified, purposeful and productive existence in the third millennium.

Google Grief
 IN a recent issue of The Observer magazine, part of England's Guardian newspaper, Michele Kirsch noted that the World Wide Web makes it easy to locate old friends, which has become a popular activity. 
But what if the one you're searching for has died? 
That is what happened to Ms. Kirsch, and the grief she felt, for a kind of cyber-ghost, left her unsettled.
"I think when you hear that someone who is still part of your inner world, somebody you still think about, has died, it must feel like a loss of part of yourself," one psychologist told her.
Whatever the psycholgical impact of of her lost friend's death, Ms. Kirsch learned that her current friends and loved ones had limited patience for her hearing about it. "Google grieving has taught me" she said, "that if you find out that someone you once loved but lost touch with has the temerity to die without telling you, you are entitled to one cup of tea, an hour's worth of sympathy, and about a half an hour's eulogy. . . . You are allowed to be vaguely miserable, but not to sob your heart out for two days, because everybody will lose patience."

Brains and Beauty
GABRIELA MONTELL reports in The Chronicle of Higher Education that Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, has found that good looking teachers get better student evaluations than unattractive ones -- findings that cast doubt on "the use of student evaluations as a valid measure of teaching quality." Excerpts follow:
In their study, Mr. Hamermesh and Ms. Parker asked students to look at photographs of 94 professors and rate their beauty. Then they compared those ratings to the average student evaluation scores for the courses taught by those professors. The two found that the professors who had been rated among the most beautiful scored a point higher than those rated least beautiful (that's a substantial difference, since student evaluations don't generally vary by much). . . .
In addition, "Good looks generated more of a premium, and bad looks more of a penalty, for male instructors," say Mr. Hamermesh and Ms. Parker in a paper about their findings. According to their data, the effect of beauty (or lack thereof) on teaching evaluations for men was three times as great as it was for women.

Job Creation Math: The Three-Card Monte of Economics

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WHAT does an increase in jobs really mean? 
 John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, raised the issue last week by saying that he expected the economy to add 200,000 jobs a month for the next year. With almost three million jobs having been lost since early 2001, the comment had an air of bold optimism to it and caused a bit of a stir on Wall Street. 
 "We are surprised," a senior economist at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients, "that Snow would choose to hand the Democratic presidential candidates this optimistic prediction."
But it looks optimistic mainly because people think of zero as the threshold. In fact, job creation must keep up with population growth in order to prevent the labor market from deteriorating. 
These days, the economy must add from 150,000 to 200,000 jobs every month to keep the unemployment rate from rising, economists say.
In 1997, the economy added 250,000 jobs a month, and the unemployment rate fell substantially. But in 1995, 180,000 new jobs were created each month, and the jobless rate ticked up slightly.
Shortly after a downturn ends, people who had dropped out of the labor force during the slump -- no longer working or looking for work -- begin their job search again. This swells the ranks of the officially unemployed and makes a monthly gain of 200,000 look even smaller.
"It's entirely possible that you'll see an uptick in the unemployment rate even with" a monthly increase of more than 150,000, said Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. 
So without changing his meaning, Mr. Snow instead could have said, "We're not going to have enough job growth over the next year to bring down the jobless rate very much, if at all."
Given that the Bush administration last year predicted a monthly job gain of about 300,000 for 2004, Mr. Snow could even have added, truthfully, "This estimate of job growth is about 50 percent lower than the last one the administration made."
Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Mr. Snow, said the secretary was merely repeating the prediction of a private forecaster when he made his comments about the 200,000 jobs.
In the end, however, the reaction to Mr. Snow's comments may say less about him or about Wall Street than it does about the economy. Following the worst hiring slump in 20 years and countless overly rosy forecasts from the nation's economists, even talk of a job market improving at only a meager pace has started to sound downright sunny.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 2, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about ways of evaluating job gains and employment misstated the percentage difference between an estimate of job growth cited by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and an earlier estimate made by the Bush administration in 2002. Mr. Snow's figure of 200,000 jobs per month was 33 percent lower than the administration's figure of about 300,000, not 50 percent lower.

HEADLINE: The War of Words About Lost Jobs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Bush administration looks at the current gains in the stock market as the panacea that we've been waiting for, to strengthen the economy and put the country back on its feet. 
 However, it neglects to take into account that corporate America is increasing its profits by attrition, by cutting pension and health benefits for existing employees and by sending thousands of jobs to third-world countries.
The stock market relies on people who are experienced in buying low and selling high, who don't know or care what they buy as long as they profit. This gives a false indication of how the economy really is. Many average Americans do not own stocks and are not affected by the market's rise or fall. But many of them are still losing their jobs.

HEADLINE: What Business Will Do When Boomers Retire 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Who'll Sit at the Boomers' Desks?" (Seniority, Oct. 12), which contended that the retirement of the huge baby-boom generation would cause a labor shortage in the United States: 
 But what about the companies across the country that are outsourcing technical jobs, research jobs, manufacturing jobs -- any jobs they can -- to India, China, Russia and elsewhere? 
Jobs and even factories are pouring out of the country faster than the baby boomers retire. 
Of course, baby boomers may have to delay their retirement given the heavy damage to their retirement accounts and pensions over the last couple of years, the problems with Social Security funding and the job losses these last two years.

Do Some Pay Too Little for Health Care?

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
CONSIDER what would happen if employers paid for their workers' car insurance and if that insurance covered routine maintenance. No doubt, the cars would spend a good deal more time in the shop, and the price of repairs and the cost of auto insurance would skyrocket.
 By the same token, some health policy experts say, Americans see doctors more often, have more procedures and take more medicine than they need because most, if not all, of the cost is covered by insurance. 
 "When consumers don't have to pay any regard to price, they overconsume," said Kate Sullivan, director of health policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "You get more value for what you buy when you have a stake in it." 
But there would be another consequence if people's cars received more service: they would run a lot better and last a lot longer. This analogy may also apply to health care. "People who have affordable and good health insurance get good preventive care and treatment when they need it," said Christine Owens, a health policy specialist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "People who don't have good, affordable health care delay treatment and are in poorer health."
The question of whether Americans should have to pay more of their health care expenses out of pocket has become a central one in labor negotiations and in the political debates here and in state capitals. More than 80,000 supermarket workers are now on strike in California and four other states over proposed cuts in their medical benefits. Transit workers in Los Angeles and garbage workers in Chicago also walked out this month over changes in their health insurance.
Workers at Verizon and the Big Three automakers agreed to much smaller pay raises than they might have expected this year so that their contracts would retain health plans allowing them to pay little or nothing for comprehensive health coverage. 
In Congress, negotiators are struggling over what the elderly should pay if prescription drugs are covered under Medicare. They are considering charging people who are on Medicare for part of the cost of home visits by health aides.
Faced with spiraling costs for Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, many states have begun requiring low-income adults and the parents of children covered by the State Children's Health Insurance Program to make co-payments when they receive medical treatment.
"The public is more worried about their rising health care costs than they are about anything else -- even about their mortgage payments or whether they will lose their savings in the stock market," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducts opinion polls about health matters.
But many economists, liberals and conservatives alike, have concluded that health costs will continue to rise out of control unless patients are required to pay more out of pocket for the services they use.
"As we've moved away from managed care as a cost-control device, we have no choice but to move to higher deductibles and co-pays," said John F. Holahan, director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington.
The latest Kaiser study shows that workers are dipping into their wallets more often these days to meet medical expenses. Since 2000, the average annual cost of insurance premiums has risen to $9,068 from $6,230 for family coverage, and the worker's average share is now $2,412, up from $1,619, an increase of nearly 50 percent. Co-payments (what patients pay out of pocket for each service) and deductibles (the annual amount people must pay before insurance kicks in) have also risen. 
What insured workers actually pay for health care varies widely. The average deductible is $275 for people in preferred-provider organizations, the most common type of health plan, but for workers in small companies, it is almost $500. Co-payments for doctor visits range from $5 to more than $25, depending on the plan.
But in almost all cases, the expense is not so great that workers change their behavior -- not enough, say, for most patients to ask doctors in advance what they charge. Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, argues that to limit overuse of health care, people should have to pay enough of the cost out of pocket that it pinches. Perhaps poor people should be exempt from cost sharing, he said, but "people with union contracts are affluent enough that they can afford some co-pays."
Some economists disagree with Mr. Gruber. Market principles do not apply to health care, they say, because most people believe good health is priceless.
"If you make people pay more for their health care," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, "all you are doing is rationing health care according to income. People like you and me would continue to get all we want, and those without means would have to do without."
Some economists who are comfortable with the principle of making people pay more are not sure how much it would take to keep overall costs down, because all insurance plans would still cover catastrophic expenses. A large proportion of total costs are attributable to a relatively small number of people who are very sick, and their bills generally exceed the ceiling on catastrophic expenses.
There is no conclusive evidence that people's health would deteriorate if they were charged more for care. Mr. Gruber said he was convinced that "the health gains" from generous health insurance "are not large enough to justify the additional costs in aggregate."
But Mr. Reinhardt was skeptical and fell back on the auto insurance analogy. "When I was young and could not afford regular maintenance, my cars constantly broke down," he said. "Now my cars run forever."

HEADLINE: Generous Medicare Payments Spur Specialty Hospital Boom 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
The hospitals here hospitals across the United States, for that matter -- covet patients like Robert E. Wilson. Mr. Wilson, 79, has had two open-heart operations, five angioplasties, three cardiac catheterizations and an implanted defibrillator. Just last month, he checked into the Heart Center of Indiana to get his first stent, a tiny bit of wire scaffolding that helps keep arteries open.
 Mr. Wilson's primary health insurance is Medicare, and Medicare pays generously for cardiac care -- so generously that hospitals and doctors scramble after the business. 
 The Heart Center, a 60-bed hospital that cost $60 million and boasts not just the most sophisticated new imaging technology but an executive chef and what it calls "room service," opened last December. Indeed, all four major hospital groups in Indianapolis are investing in new heart hospitals, collectively spending $215 million on multistory buildings with catheterization labs and bedside computers. 
Cranes have been raised over construction sites in places like Milwaukee, Phoenix and Houston, too, with money flowing into new hospitals specializing not just in cardiac care, but in other well-reimbursed specialties like orthopedics and surgery. In a report this month, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, counted at least 26 specialty hospitals under construction across the country.
Medicare -- which pays for some $100 billion of inpatient hospital care annually, and sets the pattern for many private insurers, as well -- is not the sole driver of this investment. But health executives say that Medicare's payment system for hospitals, with its emphasis on procedures and its weak ties to the actual costs of providing care, exerts a strong influence on which medical needs in a community are met.
Amid the building boom here in Indianapolis, some hospitals are laying off employees or scaling back programs, like psychiatric care, that are less generously reimbursed. Preventive care and case management, health experts add, get short shrift.
"The incentives are terribly misaligned," said Samuel R. Nussbaum, a doctor and former hospital executive who is now the chief medical officer of Anthem, a large health insurer here.

Creating Excess Demand
A study of Indianapolis health care last year concluded that the construction of so many new heart hospitals could create excess demand for treatment rather than produce better cardiac care.
"Improving clinical quality did not appear to be a driving force for new facilities or services," said the report, by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group. "Given these market conditions, provider competition could, alternatively, result in higher use rates and costs."
In Washington, lawmakers rushing to complete a compromise bill that would establish a Medicare prescription drug benefit are now turning their attention to the growth of specialty hospitals. The Senate version of the Medicare bill would make it harder for doctors to invest in and refer patients to such hospitals, and full-service hospitals are lobbying hard for the provision.
Hospitals will typically not disclose how much they profit from a particular procedure, like a coronary bypass or angioplasty. And Medicare -- with little information about the cost of treatment -- cannot say, either. But one full-service medical center that is leading the lobbying campaign against specialty hospitals, Sioux Valley Hospital in South Dakota, estimates that it makes nearly $1,500 for a typical coronary bypass under Medicare, while it loses almost $1,800 treating a case of simple pneumonia and $2,500 on a patient with kidney failure.
Cardiac procedures "are absolutely our highest margin business," said Becky Nelson, the president of Sioux Valley, who estimates that they account for 13 percent of the hospital's patient volume but 28 percent of its profits. Costs and payment levels vary so widely around the country that Dr. John Birkmeyer, a surgeon who studies health care at Dartmouth Medical School, estimates that some hospitals may make nearly $20,000 on a coronary bypass.
In Indianapolis, there is recognition that reimbursement levels have influenced hospitals' behavior.
"We're working on a payment system that has been jerry-rigged so many times, we've been looking for the loopholes," said Jack C. Frank, an executive at Community Health Network, which opened the Indiana Heart Hospital this year in partnership with local doctors.

Hospital Building Boom
Just 20 minutes southeast of the Heart Center of Indiana, Mr. Frank's $60 million center says it is the nation's first all-digital heart hospital, using electronic patient records to track care. Roughly 45 minutes to the south, construction is well under way on the latest -- and most expensive -- competitor here, the St. Francis Cardiac and Vascular Care Center, expected to cost about $65 million when it opens next year. 
Even some of the people building the hospitals worry that Indianapolis may not be able to support them all, though heart disease is the leading cause of death among Indiana residents.
"It can't work," said Daniel F. Evans Jr., the chief executive of Clarian Health Partners, whose Clarian Cardiovascular Center is the most modest of the undertakings, at $30 million, and the only one built within a full-service hospital. 
Executives, of course, vigorously defend the decisions to build their own facilities. Heart hospitals, they say, help pay for money-losing cases, like accident victims or patients with congestive heart failure.
"Cardiac care has been a source of some margin, which has been very important in subsidizing some services," said Robert J. Brody, the chief executive of St. Francis Hospital and Health Centers.
Nothing in the Medicare legislation before Congress would directly alter the hospital payment system. But advocates, mainly Republicans, for provisions aimed at encouraging more beneficiaries to enroll in private health plans say that bigger plans would have more leverage to negotiate better prices.
"The prices are being fixed" by the government, said Thomas A. Scully, who runs Medicare as administrator of the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Local insurance companies would be much better at deciding how to pay doctors and hospitals to deliver quality care, he said.

Payment System Is Dated
The current system was adopted in 1983, in an effort by the federal government to control costs. Until then, Medicare basically reimbursed hospitals for their costs of delivering care, an arrangement that offered them no incentive to keep hospital stays short. The new plan established fixed prices for treating a specific disease or performing a given procedure. Some cases might cost more and some less, but the price Medicare paid was supposed to represent the average.
As a cost-control mechanism, the system has been largely successful. The problem, say hospital executives and industry analysts, is that after 20 years, the payments are out of whack: Medicare frequently pays too much for some kinds of care and too little for others. 
To take account of the rapid changes in medicine, like new technologies and treatments, Medicare collects data on hospital charges -- essentially list prices for everything from a cardiac catheterization to bypass surgery to treatment for pneumonia. The agency then tweaks prices relative to one another, updating its payment schedule once a year.
But charges often bear little relation to a hospital's actual costs, any more than a car's sticker price directly indicates what it costs to build the car. And hospitals rarely, if ever, lower their charges, say industry analysts, even when their costs fall significantly. 
"Administered price systems tend to break down over time," said Joseph P. Newhouse, a Harvard University professor of health policy who is a member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. "If you're overpaid, everybody smiles on the way to the bank, and you may induce more services." 
Just how overpaid is unclear. Many hospitals lack the accounting systems to determine their exact expenses for specific procedures. Hospitals also have tremendous discretion in allocating expenses across departments, let alone procedures.
In the case of a coronary bypass, for example, hospital charges increased nearly 30 percent from 1993 to 2001, even as the average hospitalization decreased to 9 days from nearly 12 days, according to data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a government group in Rockville, Md.

Profitability Varies Widely
What seems certain is that there are wide variations in the profitability of different hospital services under Medicare. Mark Wietecha, who directs health care consulting for Kurt Salmon Associates, estimates that the profit margin for surgery, including cardiovascular cases, is about 15 percent for some hospitals, compared to just 2 percent for gastrointestinal care. 
"People build their business plans and facilities on these profitabilities," he said.
In Indianapolis, the rush to build heart hospitals is leading to what appears to be significant duplication of services. 
Heart transplants are offered only by St. Vincent and Clarian, which is affiliated with Indiana University, but many services are available at all four heart hospitals. In fact, St. Vincent's new heart hospital, the Heart Center of Indiana, competes directly with its parent hospital for patients. And some doctors at Clarian who have invested in the Heart Center are sending profitable cases there, according to Mr. Evans, Clarian's chief executive, working on only the most difficult -- and expensive -- cases at his hospital.
The construction boom here was influenced by the threat of a new competitor, the MedCath Corporation, a for-profit chain with 11 heart hospitals in nine states that opened discussions with some local doctors. To avert MedCath's entry into the market, Community Health and St. Vincent made deals of their own with doctors to build facilities. 
Hospital executives here are quick to agree that more needs to be done to help people stop smoking or lose weight -- steps that could help prevent the diseases they make money treating. "Our reimbursement is all around acute care," said Sister Sharon Richardt, a St. Vincent executive. "I think where the flaw is we need to keep people well. We need to start reimbursing for prevention."
But Medicare was created nearly four decades ago to prevent the financial catastrophe that often occurred when an older person suffered a heart attack or when a disease like cancer was diagnosed. Payments are therefore "episodic" rather than intended to encourage hospitals and doctors to prevent disease or coordinate care, said Dr. Gerard F. Anderson, a former federal health official who helped develop the system and now teaches at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Patients Can Lose
Patients like Corinne Walker, an 83-year-old Indianapolis woman who suffers from congestive heart failure, are not always well served. In late 2000, she developed cellulitis, a serious bacterial infection, in her legs, and spent months in three hospitals. No one bothered talking to her personal doctor, Ms. Walker said. To her, it seemed as if the people treating her virtually ignored her heart condition, although it contributed to her cellulitis. 
"They were working on my legs, period," Ms. Walker said. Only after she was sent home, with a nurse orchestrating her care, was she finally able to get better, Ms. Walker said. 
In Indianapolis, the treatment of chronic conditions "has fallen throughthe cracks," acknowledged Mr. Frank, the Community Health Network executive. With long hospital stays and few options for aggressive intervention, congestive heart failure is a particularly money-losing diagnosis, executives say; the Sioux Falls hospital says it loses $1,200 on the average case.
Even so, there is little constituency -- outside a circle of policy analysts -- for overhauling a payment system that produces such results. 
Many hospitals have figured out how to make the most of the status quo. Tenet Healthcare has been formally accused of abusing the system by which Medicare pays for the most expensive cases. But hospitals generally try to fit their care into the most lucrative billing codes.
"In fact, you see a great deal of gaming going on," said David Butz, a health economist at the University of Michigan.
Lawmakers, meanwhile, focus on small fixes to the system. With cuts in spending on cancer or heart disease politically unpalatable, they tend, under lobbying pressure, to expand coverage or increase payments.
Impetus to refine the existing system has also been blunted by the unwillingness of Congress to better analyze the cost of care, policy analysts say. Some experts say that Medicare's administrative expenses -- 2 to 3 percent of its overall budget -- have been kept too low. 
Armed with more information, they say, Congress could realign the incentives to cut costs and improve care.
"We have a limited budget," Dr. Christopher M. Callahan, the director of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research, said. "From a public health perspective," he added, the question is: "Where would those dollars best be spent?"

HEADLINE: India Steps Up Effort to Halt Abortions of Female Fetuses 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: FATEHGARH SAHIB, India 

 BODY:
India's "son complex" is visible in this prosperous market town on the rich plains of the Punjab. Girls, by the thousands, are missing. 
 For the last 20 years, local parents in search of a son, a prize in Indian culture, have taken advantage of a mixture of technology and tradition to bear their child of choice. They have used ultrasound machines to determine the sex of the fetus growing in the mother's womb. If the fetus is male, the parents keep it, census figures suggest. If it is female, they often abort it. 
 J. K. Banthia, the Indian census commissioner, estimates that several million fetuses have been aborted in India in the last two decades because they were female. 
Interpreting census figures of the last century showing widening divergences in the ratio of females to males, he estimates that as many as 25 million female fetuses and babies have been killed before, during or after birth in India. 
In 1996 India banned the use of ultrasound machines for sex determination. But the government only began to take broad action after the 2001 census figures appeared. They showed 927 girls for every 1,000 boys under age 6, a precipitous decline from 962 girls 20 years earlier. 
Since the latest census, some states have mounted stepped-up enforcement campaigns that include public education, inspections and edicts from religious leaders. But Mr. Banthia, the Indian census commissioner, said he believed that the government had only slowed the spread of the practice. "I wouldn't say it has decreased," he said.
The greatest disparity exists in this prosperous agricultural district of 500,000 people in northern India, where middle-class farmers work fertile land reminiscent of the American Great Plains. This district had only 754 girls for every 1,000 boys.
"The people in this part of the country, they prefer boys," said Benjamin Mathew, the principal of a private school here that has 473 boys and 292 girls, a ratio that also reflects families' unwillingness to pay for a girl's education. 
Abortion is legal in India, but it is illegal to abort a fetus because of its sex, and so the determination tests are banned. 
The country's health minister, Sushma Swaraj, recently proposed that the government begin an advertising campaign warning that there would not be enough women for men to marry if the trend continued, a situation that some say already exists here in northern India.
Officials are also considering paying families a supplement if they have a girl. 
Public health officials say that in the last two years they have registered 21,072 ultrasound machines, which are legal as long as they are not used to determine the sex of the fetus. The authorities have seized 199 of the machines and charged 405 doctors with performing illegal tests. No figure was available for the number of doctors convicted. Pregnant women who seek tests are generally not charged. 
Health officials say they have some signs of success. Sprawling billboards and splashy newspaper advertisements that once openly offered sex determination ultrasound tests and mysterious preconception sex determination techniques have mostly disappeared here. Some gynecologists, who value their medical licenses as well as their images, are declining to perform sex determination tests. 
"The people who are good guys, they have actually stopped," said Dr. Mira Shiva, director of women's health and development for the Voluntary Health Association of India, a nonprofit group that has campaigned against the practice. "They don't want to ruin their reputation." 
Both economic and cultural forces drive the desire for boys, public health officials said. 
In the traditional South Asian family, a son is expected to live with his parents, earn an income, inherit property, care for his forebears in their old age and light their funeral pyre. 
When a daughter marries, the bride's family pays the bridegroom's family a dowry and she moves in with her husband's family, leaving her parents with nothing or even a debt.
Baidyanath Sahu, a 37-year-old bicycle rickshaw driver in the city of Chandigarh, said he wanted sons. "He earns for the family," he said. "The daughter wouldn't earn anything." 
Dr. Baljit Singh Dahiya, the director general of health services in the state of Haryana, said it would take decades to change time-honored attitudes that led to some mothers being demeaned if they failed to bear boys. 
New television and radio advertising campaigns in Haryana, Punjab and other states are trying to change attitudes, declaring "daughters are our pride" and "female feticide is illegal."
"We are just putting drops in the ocean," Dr. Dahiya said. "That's how huge the problem is." 
On a recent morning, two of Dr. Dahiya's inspectors drove to Ambala, a city of 350,000 in the northern state of Haryana to show off new tactics they are using to stop the sex tests. Haryana has the second most extreme ratio of girls to boys of any state in India, with 820 girls for every 1,000 boys under 6. Neighboring Punjab state has the worst, with 793 girls for every 1,000 boys. 
Both states are among the most prosperous in the nation. New Delhi, the Indian capital, also has a low rate, with 865 girls for every 1,000 boys. 
Public health officials in Ambala told the inspectors, Dr. Gulshan Saluja and Girbhari Singal, that three women had asked for sex tests in a government hospital that morning. 
The inspectors decided that after telling the women that the tests were illegal, they would ask the three to serve as decoys. A health department driver would pose as a husband, and together, they would ask a local clinic for the test. 
Almost immediately, the plan unraveled. Two of the women refused to cooperate. The driver got cold feet. In the end, Paramjeet Singh, a 30-year-old maid, went into the clinic alone. "I asked for the sex of the baby," Ms. Singh said after having an ultrasound performed. "She didn't reveal it." 
Public health officials say that may indicate how practitioners have become increasingly shrewd. 
In some areas, doctors perform the test only if the patient is accompanied by an agent the physician knows. In others, officials say, they use hand signals, like a "V for victory" sign, or code words, like the name of a candy, to indicate a boy. 
Some expensive fertility clinics will even implant male embryos instead of female ones if asked, public health officials said. 
In India, middle-class women who already have one or two daughters are among the most likely to abort, officials said. Eager for a small family, like many Indians today, they have the resources for the test and an abortion, which together cost up to $200. India's average annual per capita income is $450. 
Doctors, meanwhile, complain that the campaign against the testing is overzealous. After the failed raid in Ambala, inspectors revoked the clinic's ultrasound certificate because the office did not have a proper referral form for 4 of the 98 ultrasound tests it performed in September. 
"All of the doctors are becoming clerks," said Dr. Namrata Madan, who runs the clinic and who refused to perform the ultrasound test on the decoy. 
Here in Fatehgarh Sahib, the top local health official, Dr. Parshotam Lal Goel, said he had closed two clinics for improper recordkeeping, but said he did not use decoys. M. P. Arora, the district's No. 2 government administrator, questioned the validity of the census figures showing that the district had the greatest gender imbalance in the nation. 
"There must be some technical error in the figure," Mr. Arora said.
On a recent afternoon, a young Indian woman working as an interpreter for The New York Times walked into the Sood medical clinic on one of Fatehgarh Sahib's main thoroughfares. She asked about sex determination tests. 
Instead of telling her the tests were illegal, a male and female employee quizzed the young woman about where she was from and why she was asking. After several minutes of questioning, the man suggested the young lady return to the clinic in a few hours. 
"Come later," he said. "We can talk later."

PERSON: William Goldberg 

HEADLINE: William Goldberg, 77, Dies; A Trader in Rare Diamonds 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William Goldberg, a leader of Manhattan's diamond district known both for dealing in some of the biggest diamonds sold in modern times and for trying to lift his industry's historic veil of secrecy, died Monday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 77.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, Barry Berg, his son-in-law, said. 
 Modern Jeweler magazine in 1990 said Mr. Goldberg was the first gem dealer to find fame while remaining part of 47th Street, as the diamond-littered blocklong stretch on the West Side is internationally known. A buzzing, cluttered bazaar of wholesalers, retailers and everybody in between, it lies between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. 
The magazine said that industry giants like Harry Winston and Lazare Kaplan either bypassed the street or rose above it. Mr. Goldberg not only stayed but also served three terms as president of the Diamond Dealers Club, where billions of dollars worth of diamonds are exchanged every year on the strength of a handshake and the Yiddish expression "mazel und brucha," meaning luck and a blessing.
"He wields the greatest influence ever of any United States diamond dealer," the magazine said.
In an interview Friday, Ronald Winston, chairman and managing director of the Harry Winston company, called Mr. Goldberg "one of the great diamond dealers that we worked with."
Mr. Goldberg's voice was heard on matters from security on 47th Street to "conflict diamonds" in Africa, but his greatest fame came from quietly buying and selling some of the world's biggest and best gems -- and then, of course, talking vociferously about the deals to anybody who would listen.
In the 1970's, there was the Queen of Holland diamond, part of a necklace once owned by an Indian maharajah. Mr. Goldberg found it in a Swiss bank vault and bought it, in an episode he described as "right out of the movies" in an interview with Newsday in 1991.
Then there was the 353.9-carat rough diamond he picked off a conveyor belt at a South African diamond mine. It was cut into three flawless diamonds, including a 137-carat pear-shaped gem known as the Premier Rose, which sold in 1989 for $10 million, a price many believe was the most ever paid for a diamond, then or possibly ever.
Mr. Goldberg was celebrated for the colors of his diamonds as well as for their size. The rarest are red, and he sold the largest flawless red diamond known, the 5.11-carat Red Shield. His famous Pumpkin gem was a vivid orange and had a finished weight of 5.54 carats. His personal favorites were the deep yellow gems known as canary diamonds.
Laurence Graff, one of the world's largest diamond dealers, said in an interview that Mr. Goldberg was unusual because he would shave off more of the stone to improve the gem's appearance, even though a lighter stone fetched a lower price.
"He loved every stone he handled," Mr. Graff said.
Mr. Goldberg was born Dec. 22, 1925, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where his parents owned a candy store. His mother wanted him to become a rabbi, but paid the $250 fee for him to become an apprentice diamond cutter while he attended City College of New York. 
She and her husband had little time for their children because of their long hours at the candy shop. Mr. Goldberg said in an interview in 2000 on CNNfn, the cable financial channel, that this deprivation influenced him subconsciously to want to make other people smile, "and that's when I got involved in trying to create the most beautiful smiling diamonds to make other people happy."
He was all thumbs as a cutter at Harry Winston, but solved this problem by forming a partnership with Irving Weiss, an expert cutter, in 1952. Mr. Weiss took care of the diamonds while Mr. Goldberg took care of buying and selling. His approach was unusual: he did not low-ball.
"Anybody can try to buy a $10,000 stone for $9,600," he said in a Modern Jeweler interview. "The real feat is to pay $10,500 if you know you'll later regret not having bought it."
In 1978, he ran for president of the Diamond Dealers Club, proposing more security after the murder of a diamond broker the previous year, as well as greater openness on 47th Street, in keeping with its new prominence in a changing world economy.
Using bold, untraditional means like sound trucks and leaflets, he beat the five-term incumbent, Stephen Korngold, 727 to 512. His three two-year terms were nonetheless rocky: members refused to endorse moving the headquarters to West 43rd Street, despite lower rent. 
A large man with a mane of flowing gray hair and a booming voice, Mr. Goldberg magnified his influence with his sense of humor. When arguing that the club needed better quarters to reflect the fact that 80 percent of the diamonds sold in the United States pass through 47th Street, he suggested that the old quarters smelled like herring.
Mr. Goldberg is survived by his son, Saul, of Manhattan; his daughters, Deborah Berg of Englewood, N.J., and Eve Goldberg of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; and two sisters, Bea Kauder and Bernice Weiss, both of Queens.
His penchant for largeness showed in an article in National Geographic last year. He was pondering what to name one of four gems cut from a 265.82-carat rough diamond.
"Maybe the Beluga," he mused, referring to the largest caviar eggs, "because it's the best of the best."

HEADLINE: Americans Stake Claims in a Baja Land Rush 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: NOPALO, Mexico 

 BODY:
Slowly but surely, acre by acre, Mexico's Baja Peninsula is becoming an American colony.
 "For Sale" signs are sprouting all over the 800-mile-long peninsula, offering thousands of beachfront properties. Americans are snapping them up. They have already created communities where the dollar is the local currency, English the main language and Americans the new immigrants transforming an old culture. 
 "Everything's for sale, every lot you can imagine," said Alfonso Gavito, director of a cultural institute in La Paz, the capital of Baja California Sur, a state with 400,000 citizens and some of the last undeveloped beaches in North America. "It's like 20 years of changes have happened in three months." 
This new land rush, involving billions of dollars, tens of thousands of Americans, and hundreds of miles of coastline, is gaining speed despite the fact that Mexico's Constitution bars foreigners from directly owning land by the sea.
Mexico's government wants foreign capital as much as Americans want a house on the beach -- maybe more. So it worked around the Constitution. In 1997, it changed the law to allow foreign ownership through locally administered land trusts. A Mexican bank acts as trustee, the foreigner its beneficiary.
It took about four years before that new system worked smoothly. But now, most often, it does. One result has been a boom in migration, speculation and permanent vacation. "It's human greed -- it's human nature," said David Halliburton, who owns a hotel outside Cabo San Lucas, on Baja's southern tip, where uncontrolled growth already strains the social fabric. "The amount of money coming in here through overzealous developers and buyers is staggering."
Baja is closer by land and air to the United States than it is to the rest of Mexico; state officials recorded more than 30 million trips by Americans who spent well over $1 billion last year. They say they have no idea how many Americans are living in Baja today, because a certain number are illegal immigrants who never register their presence. Anecdotal and statistical evidence suggests that the number is more than 100,000, probably far more, and growing fast since the Sept. 11 attacks and the souring of the economy in the United States two years ago.
"Since 2001, we have seen a boom in real estate sales, and the full-time population of Americans is growing rapidly," said Tony Colleraine, an American in San Felipe, about 160 miles southeast of San Diego. He said about one-quarter of the town's roughly 30,000 residents were Americans, many of whom want to "get away from the regulations and rhetoric, and get out of the bull's-eye" in the United States.
In Rosarito, an hour's drive south of the United States border, about one-quarter of the 55,000 residents are Americans. "An increasing number of Americans are moving here to escape their government's policies and the costs of living," said Herb Kinsey, a Rosarito resident with roots in the United States, Canada and Germany. "They find a higher standard of living and a greater degree of freedom."
At least 600,000 Americans -- again, an acknowledged undercount based on government records -- are permanent residents of Mexico. That is by far the largest number of United States citizens living in any foreign country.
Americans living throughout Baja say their new neighbors include professionals in their 30's and 40's putting downroots, not just retirees in recreational vehicles. In Rosarito, the new home buyers include lawyers and members of the military who commute across the border to San Diego, where housing costs are about five times higher. A pleasant house by the Pacific in Rosarito can cost less than $150,000; property taxes are about $75 a year.
The Americans living in Rosarito set up a municipal office in April. Two members are Ed Jones, an entertainer, and Rita Gullicson, a teacher.
Americans "want to claim Baja as part of the United States, and they always have," Ms. Gullicson said. Mr. Jones finished her thought, saying, "And now they are doing it with money."
Baja's future, Mexican officials say, lies in American land investment. The government strongly promotes foreign direct investment, which is the only reliable source of economic growth in Mexico.
Here in the empty streets of Nopalo, the future is coming on fast. A totally American town is about to be built.
The site of a failed government-backed tourist development, Nopalo, which means "place of vipers," lies just outside the town of Loreto, founded in 1697, population 11,000. American and Canadian developers plan to build 5,000 new homes for 12,000 fellow citizens.
Their master plan depicts a particularly affluent suburb, with houses selling for up to $2 million each. The developers plan to break ground in January. They envision a $2 billion investment over 15 years.
"People will come by the hundreds of thousands" to Baja, said one of the developers, David Butterfield. "Mexico gives you an opportunity to build something you cannot build in the U.S. or Canada today. You cannot build great things in America today. Regulations and litigation prevent change."
There are limits to change in Baja, too. They are set by nature. It rains five inches a year or less in many parts of the peninsula. A barrel of water here is effectively worth more than a barrel of oil, and it takes many millions of gallons to sustain a golf course, much less a suburb.
There is no drinking water in Loreto -- it is piped in from 16 miles away -- and no place for thousands of construction and service workers to live. Many Mexicans wonder if the new community will truly be the "sustainable development" its backers promise. "I'm not sure there's anyplace in the modern world that's sustainable," Mr. Butterfield said. "I hope we're going to create one."
Homero Davis, Loreto's mayor, supports the project, somewhat warily. "The quality of life is a moral issue here," he said. "The culture is at stake. We don't want to be like Cabo San Lucas," where hotels and condominiums have swamped what was once a little village.
But that scale of development is precisely what Fonatur, the federal agency that promotes tourism in Mexico, has in mind for Loreto and the rest of Baja.
Fonatur, which conceived and built mega-resorts like Cancun, envisions marinas for American yachts, four-star hotels and fancy golf courses ringing the peninsula in a plan called the Escalera Nautica, or Nautical Ladder, which involves $210 million in public money and hopes for $1.7 billion in investment from developers.
"The whole premise of the Escalera Nautica is to create a land rush, and I'm not sure that's good for anybody," said Tim Means, who has lived in La Paz for 35 years and runs a respected ecotourism outfit called Baja Expeditions.
Baja was isolated from the outside world until the government paved a road through the peninsula in the 1970's and 80's. The road connected Baja more closely to the United States than to the Mexican mainland. That connection is deepening as more and more Americans move here. So is a sense of remoteness, of difference, from the rest of Mexico.
"People on the mainland don't know we exist," said Doris Johnson, the daughter of a Mexican mother and an American father, who runs a hotel in Mulege. "They ask, 'Do they speak Spanish in Baja? Do you need a passport to go there?' "
Ms. Johnson wonders what will become of Baja as it becomes more and more of an American place. "We have our own culture here," she said. "But we don't have much influence over what's changing our culture."

HEADLINE: Chinatown Journal; 
Store Founded in 1891 Succumbs to Effects of 9/11

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Next to a kitschy gift shop that sells ninja action figures and wax paper umbrellas, a metal security gate shrouds a storefront. Standing on the sidewalk, Paul J. Q. Lee, the stocky 53-year-old proprietor of the shuttered business, peers inside through a tiny slit and shakes his head.
 For more than a century, Mr. Lee's family worked here, selling everything from salted duck eggs to porcelain figurines. It was Chinatown's longest continuously operating store. 
 "It's so painful," Mr. Lee said. "The torch went out on my watch."
 Last month, his shop, the 32 Mott Street General Store, became the latest victim of the economic troubles that have gripped this community since Sept. 11, 2001. City marshals came and evicted Mr. Lee, who had fallen badly behind in his rent.
It is clear now that the store, long a stop on Chinatown walking tours, will not be reopening. Mr. Lee says he hopes to salvage some items inside and move on, but the process is dragging on because he and the landlord are no longer on speaking terms.
For a once-proud institution, it is an undignified ending.
Historians and preservationists hope the store's interior, largely unchanged from a century ago, can somehow be preserved.
Gutting it for a new tenant "would be disastrous," said Prof. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program at New York University. "The interior is one of the most important surviving historical sites as far as I am concerned in the whole city from the 19th century."
Mr. Lee's grandfather, Lee Lok, opened the store in the heart of Chinatown in 1891, calling it Quong Yuen Shing & Company. Although it was a few years after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese laborers from entering the country, Chinatown was already a bustling enclave.
His grandfather sold medicinal herbs, groceries, restaurant supplies and silk brocade for ceremonial clothing, Mr. Lee said. But like other shops in the area, he said, Quong Yuen Shing functioned as much more than a store. At that point, Chinatown was essentially a bachelors' society because immigration law forced men to leave their wives in China. They gathered at the shop to pass the time. Those who were illiterate could get help writing letters home. Many used the store as a postal address. Safes were kept for immigrants because Chinese were barred from opening bank accounts. In the back, workers slept on wooden shelves. 
 When Mr. Lee's father, Peter Lee, took over the business, he transformed it into a restaurant wholesaler, importing canned goods, dried mushrooms and cookware. Mr. Lee said he inherited the store in the mid-1980's and modernized it in many ways, by taking credit cards and staying open on Sundays, for example. He changed its name and switched to yet another niche: selling Asian giftware, porcelain figurines and dishes to tourists and locals.
Otherwise, the store remained mostly as it was a century ago, with the original wooden counters and shelves, the tin ceiling, the Chinese prints above the register and the elaborate wood-carved archway, the kind once common in Chinatown shops.
By the time Mr. Lee took charge, though, Chinatown had evolved. In its heyday, the store depended on immigrants from Toishan, a village in southern China. But now people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia had settled in the area. The store had trouble adapting, he said.
 Mr. Lee branched out into selling bus tickets to Atlantic City and tried to get into the Chinese wedding registry business. More recently, he started handling phone and utility bill payments for elderly residents and recent immigrants who did not have checking accounts, charging a small fee for each transaction.
Then came Sept. 11, which proved to be the final blow. Mr. Lee said his business dwindled to nearly nothing in the weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center. He estimates that he never recovered more than half his old revenue.
 He cites many factors, including the closing of a section of Park Row, once a major artery for the neighborhood, to protect Police Headquarters, and the loss of parking places to police vehicles.
 "I've been screaming bloody murder for two years, testifying everywhere," Mr. Lee said. "Even now, I know the politicians are just giving lip service to Chinatown."
Mr. Lee's store is not alone. Nearby, on Doyers Street, China Handicrafts, a giftware store like Mr. Lee's, was also shuttered recently. Kam Kuo, a six-story supermarket farther down Mott Street, will also close soon. 
 Workers took down the sign on Mr. Lee's store two weeks ago to install the security gate. They tossed it in the trash bin, but it was retrieved by members of the church across the street. Last week, someone from the Museum of Chinese in the Americas in Chinatown retrieved it for safekeeping, said Fay Chew Matsuda, the museum's executive director. 
 Daniel Yee, whose family manages the building, said that they are aware of the store's significance but that plans are still up in the air about what to do. "Obviously what we're definitely going to try to do is rent the place out," he said, adding, "We're definitely going to try to preserve the interior of the store as much as possible."
 The family gave Mr. Lee chance after chance to catch up on his rent, Mr. Yee said. In the end, he said, there was nothing they could do but force him to leave.

HEADLINE: The Philippines Struggles to Cope With Deficits and Insurgents 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
In the last few months, Armando Rosimo had become a symbol of hope in the Philippines, a fearless government investigator leading a series of inquiries into the pervasive tax evasion, corruption and fraud by wealthy families and big businesses that have crippled this nation's finances for decades. 
 But as Mr. Rosimo drove his Honda Civic out the front gate of his home on the morning of Oct. 16, a man waiting just outside with a pistol fired two .45-caliber bullets into his head, killing him, the Philippine National Police reported. 
 The gunman and five accomplices yanked open the car's doors, checked to make sure Mr. Rosimo was dead, then commandeered a passing van and disappeared, said Col. Don Montenegro, the senior police superintendent investigating the case. 
The assassination, which came less than two months after a less senior tax official was killed in the central Philippines, was a serious blow to a country struggling to cope with chronic budget deficits. 
Weak revenues have paralyzed the government's ability to pay for problems ranging from insolvent banks to armed insurgencies to a poorly trained and equipped military. Mr. Rosimo's death was significant because improving tax collection will be harder, said Adam Le Mesurier, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs specializing in Southeast Asia. "I'm not sure the next person is going to be as eager," he said. 
Scott Harrison, the managing director of Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a risk consulting firm here, said it was difficult to create the political will to address fraud and tax evasion. Mr. Rosimo's death, he said, "is what happens when you try to uncover major wrongdoing."
Julia Heidemann, a government spokeswoman, said President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was determined to persist in improving tax collection. "The government had declared war against tax fraud," she said. 
The killing of Mr. Rosimo came as other security threats in the Philippines seemed to have waned. 
Many leaders and members of Abu Sayyaf, a small terror and kidnapping group, have been killed or detained in the southern Philippines by local soldiers assisted by American military advisers. 
On Oct. 12, Philippine security forces shot and killed Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi, an Indonesian fugitive believed to be the top bomb maker for Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian group thought by Western intelligence officials to have been behind the Bali bombings last year. 
A Communist insurgency has been less active in recent weeks, although it continues to extort what it describes as "tax payments" from owners of a few rural businesses. 
The government also concluded a cease-fire in July with the last big Muslim insurgency group in the Philippines, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. But Western experts are still concerned about the risk of attacks by Islamic militants. 
"Manila is probably the most target-rich environment in Southeast Asia, in terms of Western-style clubs, discos, hotels and symbols of Western culture, such as multinational businesses and fast-food outlets," Robert Hill, Australia's defense minister, warned in a speech on Oct. 9. 
The Philippine economy fails to make effective use of one of the best-educated, English-speaking populations in Asia. A tenth of the Philippine population has moved overseas and those left behind depend heavily on the remittances of those who left. 
As foreign investment has poured into the region in the past decade, the Philippines has lost a series of big investments to its more stable and faster-growing rival, Thailand, and now faces rapidly growing competition from China in the electronics industry, which accounts for three-fifths of Philippine exports. 
Government borrowing has sucked up much of the nation's savings, leaving little money for banks to lend to businesses that might invest in new factories or other job-creating efforts. Economists have recommended that the Philippines stabilize the banking system with a partial bailout like the rescue of the American savings and loan industry in the late 1980's, but the government lacks the money.

HEADLINE: Tenants' Group Sues Nassau Rent Board 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
IN a move to avert sharp rent increases for a slowly dwindling supply of affordable apartments, a tenants' group is charging that the Nassau County Rent Guidelines Board violated the state's open meeting law when it set the rent increases last June. 
 At the meeting, the appointed board voted 5 to 3 to allow rent increases of 5 percent for one-year lease renewals and 8 percent for two-year renewals for the estimated 13,000 rent-stabilized apartments in the county. Last year the board granted increases of 1.5 percent for one-year renewals and 2.5 percent for two-year renewals. 
 The statewide tenants' group, the New York State Tenants & Neighbors Coalition, and two tenants of rent-stabilized apartments filed a lawsuit against the board earlier this month in State Supreme Court in Mineola. 
They contend that the June 12 meeting, held in a basement lunchroom in the North Hempstead Town Hall in Manhasset, could accommodate only 50 people, or about half of the tenants who turned out. 
The group and the tenants said that board members could not be heard even by those who gained admittance to the low-ceilinged lunchroom because it lacked a sound system and board members made insufficient efforts to be heard over audience noise. They said that tenants forced to stand outside could neither hear nor see the board, denying them access to a public meeting in violation of the open meeting law. 
"It was one of the most chaotic meetings I have ever attended," said Carlos Mackey, a plaintiff who is the president of the Tenants Council of the Village of Hempstead and a tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment. "The way they carried on that meeting that was so important to so many people, it really upset me."
The tenants criticized Catherine Kirk, the board's chairwoman, for failing to keep order, allowing board members to engage in private conversations and declining an offer from May W. Newburger, North Hempstead's town supervisor, to relocate the meeting to the Town Board meeting room, where there would have been seats for all who attended and microphones for board members.
Ms. Kirk, a lawyer in Mineola who voted against the rent increases, said she could not comment because of the pending lawsuit.
But a spokesman for the division of housing and community renewal in Manhattan, the state agency that oversees rent stabilization and is defending the board, said that no violations of the open meeting law had occurred. "We are confident that the Nassau County Rent Guidelines Board followed the open meeting law and will prevail in court," the spokesman, Peter Moses, said. 
The division of housing and community renewal appoints the county rent boards based on recommendations from the County Legislatures. 
The Hofstra School of Law Community Legal Assistance Corporation is representing the coalition and the tenants. The suit seeks to overturn the rent increases, which the tenants call excessive and unjustified. 
The suits also charges that the board violated the open meeting law on a second occasion by giving no public notice for a Sept. 25 meeting that a prominent landlord lawyer was permitted to attend. 
The rent increases, which took effect on Oct. 1, were based on financial reports submitted by apartment owners who say they are facing increases in property taxes, insurance and heating fuel. Rent-stabilized apartments typically cost hundreds of dollars less than apartments rented at current market rates. Many of the stabilized tenants are elderly or members of minority groups or both; they contend that many tenants will not be able to pay the higher stabilized rents. 
Nassau is one of three suburban counties permitted to authorize rent stabilization under the Emergency Tenants Protection Act of 1974. The other two counties are Westchester and Rockland. Most of the Nassau apartments are in Hempstead, Great Neck, Mineola, Long Beach, Freeport and Rockville Centre. The law applies to apartment buildings constructed before 1973. 
The rent guidelines board had scheduled the June meeting for the Town Board meeting room but relocated the meeting to the basement lunchroom because the North Hempstead Town Board was holding an emergency meeting in the upstairs room.
Mrs. Newburger, the North Hempstead supervisor, said she could not recall inviting the rent board to relocate to the Town Board meeting room after the Town Board session ended. But, she added, "I'm sure we offered because I do remember feeling embarrassed that there was a mix-up."
Robert J. Freeman, the executive director of the Committee on Open Government, a state agency, said the open meeting law did not specify where public meetings must be held. But he said that the committee advises government agencies that accommodating people who want to attend a meeting is within the law's intent. 
"If there is an alternate location that would accommodate those people, it would be unreasonable not to hold the meeting in that second facility," he said.

HEADLINE: For Many College Students, A Job (or Two) to Pay Tuition 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
BRANDON COX, a senior at the University of Kansas, has struggled to make ends meet throughout his college years. In particularly hard times, he has considered selling his blood to earn extra cash. 
 But this year, with tuition rising 20 percent, money is tighter than ever for Mr. Cox, a 21-year old philosophy major, and in August he applied for 30 jobs at a campus job fair. Last month, he began splitting his time between two on-campus positions, the first as a research assistant and the other as a nude model for the school's art department. 
 With the economy shaky and college tuition continuing to rise, many college administrators say they are seeing more students than ever looking for part-time jobs on campus. 
Off-campus jobs often pay better, but some students have found them hard to land in the current employment slump. In addition, on-campus positions offer students greater scheduling flexibility, according to both students and college administrators. Administrators also say that more students are using work-study options under a federal program that pays at least part of students' on-campus wages. 
Trudy Steinfeld, New York University's director of career services, said "students in record numbers" are applying for even mundane low-paying on-campus jobs involving faxing, filing and checking identification cards. In past years, she said, many departments complained that they could not fill all their positions. 
But this year, that has not been a problem. Ms. Steinfeld estimated that 20 to 30 percent more students are applying for on-campus jobs than at this time last year. By the end of the academic year, she expects that the campus will employ 12,000 students, compared with the 10,000 of previous years. Some students will even have shorter shifts this year as the university tries to provide more job seekers with at least some work. 
"I think it's about economic factors," Ms. Steinfeld said. "Tuition's expensive, text books are expensive. Parents can't contribute as much to living expenses any more. We have parents calling and coming into the office with students, telling us that their children need to get a job." 
Adrienne Caulk, a freshman at N.Y.U., said she would like to be spending her time adjusting to the rigors of campus life. Instead, she has been in the career service center, scanning the job boards for an office or clerical position. Ms. Caulk, an international-business major from Philadelphia, has a $4,000 work-study grant. 
"I'm just looking for a paycheck and right now I'm not being choosy," she said. "I think a lot of people's parents' income has gone down and now they need to be more responsible. But I won't do anything demeaning. I'm not going to strip my way through college." 
Amelia Feuer, another N.Y.U. freshman from the Philadelphia area, said that when her older brother was in college several years ago, he was more likely to receive spending money from their parents. "That's not the case for me," she said. "My dad lost a lot of money in the stock market." 
She has landed a $10-an-hour job as a tutor at a Manhattan elementary school, part of the federal work-study program at N.Y.U. 
The number of college students working at least part time has been rising steadily since the 1980's, according to a 2001 study commissioned by Upromise, an Internet company that helps families save for college education. In 2000, about 57 percent of full-time college students were working part time or full time compared with 49 percent in 1984. 
But at some colleges and universities there has been a more pronounced spike in student employment in the last several months. At Merrimack College, a private 2,000-student college in North Andover, Mass., James F. Greeley, the director of career services and cooperative education, is finding that nearly every department on campus has received more job applications from students this semester.
Applications are even rising for positions that have been hard to fill in past years, like food service and maintenance jobs, Mr. Greeley said. The career services department, which hires eight students each year, was barraged with 58 resumes this semester. The department usually receives about 15 applications, Mr. Greeley said. 
"Even if a school's tuition rises 4 to 5 percent a year, that's still 20 percent over four years," he said. "With families' 401(k) funds dwindling, college costs really become a major concern." 
Mr. Greeley said the competition for on-campus jobs appeared similar to what is happening in the larger job market. He said many "superbly qualified" Merrimack alumni are returning to campus seeking advice after being laid off or to discuss job-hunting strategies. 
At the University of Wisconsin at Madison, an increase in students seeking on-campus employment has meant that some semiskilled nonstudent employees have been replaced by undergraduates, working fewer hours and earning closer to the minimum wage.
"This was a campuswide decision," said Barbara Phelan, the manager of Frank's Place, a dormitory cafeteria that serves about 7,000 students. "Students live with us, they're our community and our priority." 
Several years ago, Ms. Phelan said, the university could not cajole enough students to take jobs as dishwashers and cashiers. Those who were hired often left soon after for better-paying positions. This year, there is a waiting list of several hundred students hoping for jobs with the university's housing division, including the jobs at Frank's Place. 
Matt Guziewski, 20, a junior at the university, is happy to pick up extra money at Frank's Place. He acknowledged that kitchen work is not always the most gratifying, but the $8.60 hourly wage helps pay his off-campus rent and other living costs of about $375 a month. With his parents taking out three student loans to pay for tuition, there was a strong expectation that he would get a job, he said. 
All the hard work does have a payoff beyond money, experts said. Ms. Steinfeld of N.Y.U. said campus jobs help students develop a strong work ethic, learn customer service skills and follow through on assignments. "These are all transferable professional skills," she said. 
If so, Victoria Cepeida-Mojarro, who majors in metropolitan studies at N.Y.U., gets a double helping of that kind of skill development. She has two jobs, working on campus at the university gymnasium and off-campus at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant. Ms. Cepeida-Mojarro has always worked since entering college but realized last semester that one job was no longer enough. 
"Right now making ends meet is much harder than it's been in the past," she said. "Working two jobs and paying for education and rent is so stressful."

Honest Work, Sure Hands And Lots Of Questions

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; E-mail: amh@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HEATHCOTE Avenue, just one block long, seems very far from anywhere, let alone Wall Street. It is a place that time forgot, a jumble of auto repair stores and junkyards off I-95 in the northeastern Bronx. Tucked in the middle of the block is Dennis Barbaria's small machine shop, B&L Automotive, hardly bigger than a two-car garage. 
 Mr. Barbaria, a laconic 63-year-old with a bushy salt-and-pepper beard and a level gaze, founded B&L in 1962, when he was 22. New York's manufacturing base had not yet withered, and the demand for men trained in fixing machines was brisk. Now he is vestigial, a throwback to the days when a person could be a blue-collar worker and still keep self-respect. 
 A child of Pelham Parkway, Mr. Barbaria graduated from Columbus High School and the Academy of Aeronautics at La Guardia Airport. Just out of school he received two job offers, one as an aerospace mechanic, the field he had trained for, earning $117 a week, the other in a machine shop, earning $200 a week. Mr. Barbaria followed the money.
Within a few years, he had acquired a wife, two sons and responsibilities. So when he and a partner, Joel LoSecco (the L in B&L) found the garage on Heathcote, hard by Co-op City, they jumped at it. The partner did not last long, perhaps, Mr. Barbaria says, because the job, which often involved long hours and dirty hands, "was too much like work." 
But Mr. Barbaria endured, able to recreate an antique part from diagrams and fix any engine from a 1929 Pierce Arrow to a late-model Maserati. 
The mechanical bug bit Mr. Barbaria many years earlier, when drag racing was hot. In 1956, when he was 16, he was a member of a race car club called the Highwaymen that owned a Chrysler-engine dragster. These were not street cars. These were top-fuel dragsters, capable of hitting 230 miles an hour, with a driver protected only by fast reflexes and a helmet.
Mr. Barbaria used to take his two boys on the circuit with him, to Detroit, Kansas City, Tulsa. As in that movie "Heart Like a Wheel"? Exactly. His sons hung out in Shirley Muldowney's trailer, and she fed them tuna sandwiches.
The race crew would let five kids, including Scott and Keith, pile into the push car. "If you were a race car brat, they'd never say no," Scott recalled. The boys had so much fun, they wanted to be just like their dad.
That sort of thing wouldn't happen now, because drag racing has become a lucrative industry, controlled by corporations, not guys from the Bronx. "You can sit at home and watch it on TV," Scott said.
But hooked by that early exposure, Scott, now 43, works at B&L. His brother, Keith, 40, stayed through engineering school, then left to design jet parts. (A related field? "No," Mr. Barbaria said flatly. "He's at a different level.") 
Mr. Barbaria doubts that his four young grandchildren will follow the same blue-collar path; they are already expressing other ambitions. "When you have the mechanical bent, when you're 8 or 9 years old, you're already taking things apart," he explained. "You find an old vacuum cleaner, you take it apart. The intrigue of the machine has to catch you. By the time you're 9 or 10 years old, if it hasn't, you move on." Besides, he wouldn't let them. "It's better to use your head than your hands, probably." Mr. Barbaria has pulled back some, too. Now he works 9 to 6, six days a week, instead of 9 to 9. But in the early years, the garage "used to be a hangout," Scott Barbaria said with a grin, and the long hours had as much to do with male bonding over big machines as with making money. Now the men's constant companion is National Public Radio, playing in the background, though his friend Sal, from the old neighborhood, often drops in with newspapers and paper cups of takeout espresso, syrupy and sweet.
Frankly, there is not as much to do these days. Better engineered cars have hurt machinists. But something else is going on too. Whatever the larger economic reasons, from where Mr. Barbaria sits, the recovery is not yet evident. His corporate customers aren't spending on machine parts. Car dealerships, repair shops and machinists seem to close every day. "A shop that would give us 10 jobs a month is now doing three jobs a month," he said.
Is foreign competition to blame? "I think this is too immediate and too local," Mr. Barbaria said. "They're not sending the cars to India to be fixed." Wall Street may be looking up, but on Heathcote Avenue, the indicators are still down.

HEADLINE: Market Cheer, Deficit Worries 

 BODY:
Though it has taken a breather in the past week, the stock market has been on a tear recently. The Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 15 percent this year. The Nasdaq composite, the index dominated by technology stocks, is still down 60 percent from its bubbly highs of 2000, but has risen almost 40 percent on the year. 
 Investors' cheer seems justified. The economy is growing at an impressive clip, productivity gains remain strong and the long-beleaguered manufacturing sector is rebounding. Corporate profits are up and consumers, encouraged by low interest rates, have been the economy's stalwarts since before the recovery. What's more, prospects for the global economy have brightened. 
 All this good news, of course, means little for millions of Americans who still cannot find jobs. No recovery will seem real and lasting until employment figures improve. This is not merely a matter of empathizing with those left behind; corporate America's belief in the strength of this recovery can be measured by its hiring decisions.
After a recession, there is often talk initially of a "jobless recovery" because businesses can increase production with excess capacity built up during the previous boom. But they must eventually start hiring again, and make other investments, to achieve sustained growth. The last period of real growth created 22 million new jobs.
The dismal employment picture may be changing as companies start trying to satisfy customers who want more of products that currently are in short supply. The economy has started adding jobs again, raising hopes that the unemployment rate will dip below 6 percent before year's end.
On the eve of an election year, these positive trends cheer policy makers in Washington as much as they do investors, but they also create some challenges. The Federal Reserve, which not long ago was fretting about prices falling too much, will most likely have to raise interest rates more than once during an election year, to check inflation. 
Treasury Secretary John Snow said last week that he would be concerned if interest rates did not start creeping up. The White House should be worrying more about how its reckless budget deficits threaten a healthy economy. It's no accident that the economic expansion of the last decade was preceded by the Clinton administration's determination to get the deficit under control.
President Bush and his aides are in denial about the deficit's potential impact on long-term interest rates. It's true that a stronger economy, producing more income for Uncle Sam, may make the deficit projections less dire, but the books will not balance magically. The administration's tax cuts went too far for that. Democrats on the campaign trail are right to want to repeal some of the cuts awarded to the wealthiest Americans. It isn't simply a matter of fairness, but of sound economics.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Cheap and Lethal, It Fits in a Golf Bag

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER

 BODY:
AT a series of training seminars held in Bangkok earlier this month, about 5,000 taxi motorcyclists were asked to take a good long look at a golf bag. Inside the bag was a plastic tube, and inside the tube was a shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile. 
 "If I had not been trained, I would not have known what the missile looked like," a taxi driver told the Bangkok Post. "I have seen them in movies." 
 To many of the world's governments and security experts, however, the threat posed by such missiles is now all too real.
The golf-bag lessons followed reports that six shoulder-fired missiles had been smuggled into Thailand, possibly for a terrorist attack on a world economic summit that was held there last week. American officials secured commitments from the meeting's other attendees to limit international trade in portable missiles, but it is the widespread presence of these weapons on the global black market -- and in the hands of stateless enemies -- that may one day force hard questions over what to do about them. 
"This falls into the category of really tough problems with no good solution," said Charles V. Pena, the director of defense policy studies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian research organization in Washington. That's because the equation is skewed in favor of anyone hoping to wreak havoc by launching a missile at an American plane: the weapons are relatively cheap (low-end models can be had for under $10,000) and plentiful, while potential deterrents, such that exist, are few and incredibly expensive. 
"It wouldn't even have to hit anything," Mr. Pena said. "Just having it known that a plane was fired on could be catastrophic for the airline industry, and it would have an effect that would ripple through the entire economy."
The exact number of these shoulder-fired missiles -- often called Man Portable Air Defense Systems, or Manpads -- outside the hands of governments is impossible to know. A steady supply of stolen, traded or illegally purchased missiles moves through the shadow markets of arms dealers, while hundreds of others sit in the arsenals of at least two dozen insurgent and terrorist groups around the globe. Many are leftovers from past wars -- like those supplied by the United States to Afghan fighters during the Soviet occupation of the 1980's.
After terrorists armed with Manpads fired on an Israeli airliner leaving the airport in Mombasa, Kenya, last November, American officials wanted action. Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security began soliciting proposals for military-grade antimissile technologies that might be adapted to the nation's commercial fleet, from flares that could lure heat-seeking missiles away from a jet's engines, to more sophisticated systems that use lasers to jam a rocket's homing device. Stepped-up patrols around airports have also been recommended. 
"We take the threat of Manpads extremely seriously and continue to perform vulnerability assessments on our airports," said Adm. James M. Loy, head of the Transportation Security Administration, in Congressional testimony two weeks ago. "I want to emphasize," he added, "that there is no credible evidence that Manpads are in the hands of terrorists in this country."
But experts say it is only a matter of time.
"If somebody wants to do it, they're going to do it," said David Isenberg, a senior analyst with the British American Security Information Council, an independent research group in Washington and London. "If you look at the existing black market for all kinds of things -- for human trafficking, for drugs -- the networks are there. And if you offer a transporter a high enough price, they will get the job done."
If that's the case, then securing the commercial airline industry seems daunting. Many Manpads have a three- to five-mile range, and any rooftop, warehouse window or deserted street corner near urban airports becomes a potential launching site. The costs and logistical difficulties of adequately patrolling such areas would be extremely high. And retrofitting airplanes with antimissile technology would carry a multibillion-dollar price tag that, should the government decide to pay it, would raise questions about protecting other potential targets as well.
"Buildings are obviously targets too," Mr. Pena said. "Does the government become responsible for securing every building over, say, 10 stories tall?"
The question highlights how combating terrorism has become something of a hamster wheel. Stamp out weapons of mass destruction and determined terrorists will turn to weapons of lesser destruction. Harden a target and they will aim elsewhere. And as the cost grows, which weapons remain threatening enough to pay for their elimination? Which targets will be worth shielding and which will be sacrificed to chance?
"You can only think of maybe a million things that a terrorist might do," Mr. Pena said, "and then you have to ask yourself if you're prepared to pay the costs of dealing with each and every one of them.
"It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation."

HEADLINE: The Nation: No, You Go First; 
Cutting Greenhouse Gases, or Not

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
IN the international debate over how to deal with global warming, the United States and China occupy center stage.
 The United States has long been the dominant producer of carbon dioxide emissions and the other heat-trapping greenhouse gases associated with rising temperatures. 
 China still lags far behind in total emissions, but its vast population and rapid rate of economic growth put it high on experts' lists of future sources of the warming gases. India is not too far behind. 
China is rapidly increasing its consumption of coal and oil to fuel an ever more electrified and mobile society. India is experiencing a similar energy surge for similar reasons, and like China, it hopes rapid growth will help to reduce widespread poverty.
But if the United States, China and India are critical to meeting the threat of greenhouse gases, the question is: who goes first?
The emissions restrictions called for in the pending climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol apply only to industrialized countries that ratify it. 
There are provisions that could allow a rich country to gain credits for investing in emissions-reducing projects in poorer ones, but the rules remain mired in disputes over how to measure gains and what kinds of projects should qualify.
In the meantime, President Bush has rejected the Kyoto pact, objecting that it is costly and ignores China, India and other big developing nations.
Nonetheless, many global warming experts say that history and logic require the United States to take the lead. 
In almost all international environmental agreements in recent decades, the so-called developing world has essentially been allowed to sit out the first round or two. 
Whether the goal has been curbing global warming, restoring the ozone layer or phasing out toxic organic chemicals, there has long been a broad consensus that the first steps should be taken by the industrial powers.
The 1992 climate treaty, which underpins the pending Kyoto Protocol, explicitly speaks of "differentiated responsibilities" for advanced and advancing nations. After all, the logic goes, rich countries achieved their prosperity in part because they were unhampered by restrictions on the use of natural resources. 
Still, the Bush administration remains opposed to any emissions restrictions, though it has been sending mixed signals of late.
Last November, for example, during international treaty talks in India on the climate change issue, Paula J. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for global affairs, said, "We do not see targets and timetables as realistic for developing countries."
But critics of Mr. Bush say that is not a sign of progress.
"Their messages at home and abroad are both calculated to discourage action," said Elliot Diringer, the director of international strategies for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a private group advocating emissions cuts. 
"At home you say Kyoto is unfair because it doesn't include developing countries and in negotiations you say it's unfair to ask developing countries to take targets," he said. "The message is inconsistent but the strategy is consistent -- for more delay."

HEADLINE: The War of Words About Lost Jobs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Rhetoric Vies With Reality on a Hot Topic: Jobs" (Economic View, Oct. 12), in which David Leonhardt said that Republicans tend to understate the number of jobs lost during the Bush administration, while the Democrats overstate them: 
 I believe that both parties understate the real losses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs lost since President Bush took office is estimated at 2.84 million, and the writer criticizes some Democratic candidates for claiming that more than 3 million jobs have been lost.
However, in an essay by Mr. Leonhardt in 2001, he observed that if the 3.4 million who were working part time because they couldn't find full-time work were counted as fractionally unemployed, the unemployment rate would be higher than the bureau's statistics claimed. By the same token, if the number of full-time jobs that have been replaced by part-time jobs were counted as a fraction of that number, one would find that the actual full-time equivalent job loss is far greater than 3 million.
Furthermore, if the replacement of the tens of thousands of lost high-wage manufacturing jobs by low-paying jobs in the service sector were factored in, the effective job-loss numbers would be even greater.

HEADLINE: Don't Tread on Us; 
Radical Islam Gains a Seductive New Voice

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
AMERICAN officials scolded Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia last week for declaring to the world's largest Muslim organization that Jews control the world and that frustrated Muslims should try to learn from them. President Bush privately told the Malaysian leader that his comments were "wrong and divisive," presidential aides said. The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said, "I don't think they are emblematic of the Muslim world."
 By many accounts, though, Ms. Rice is voicing wishful thinking. 
 After Mr. Mahathir spoke, the Muslim heads of state gathered at the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference gave him a standing ovation for his speech, which ultimately criticized the Islamic world for failing to modernize. 
The acceptance of such conspiratorial views may strike Americans as despicable or even laughable, but they reflect the influence of Islamic radicals on the worldviews of millions of Muslims. Conveyed with ease and authority via the Internet and satellite television, anti-American and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories abound, not only in Muslim countries but across the world.
Many of these theories are spread by radical groups that adhere to an ideology loosely known as political Islam. Stridently anti-Western and antimodern, political Islam portrays itself as the strongest ideological counter to democracy and capitalism.
Radical Islamists do far more than simply declare that President Bush and Israel, for example, are evil. Political Islam is a sophisticated mixture of fundamentalism and nationalism that can foment acts of violence against Western targets. But for its followers, it is a romantic liberation movement -- a militant ideology with Marxist echoes that combines Islam's powerful call for social equality with a critique of Western corporate imperialism and the corrupt Muslim elites who benefit from it.
The growing voice of political Islam suggests that the United States faces a much more nebulous enemy in its war on terrorism than a movement of religious zealots. It is an ideology that persuades some alienated young Muslims, whether deeply religious or not, to join what they see as an epic struggle against an evil empire.
Pollsters emphasize that popular support for radical Islamists remains relatively low in the Muslim world, a vast amalgam of 1.5 billion people that is by no means monolithic. But by taking advantage of overwhelming Muslim public disapproval of American policies in Israel and Iraq, political Islam appears to be gaining traction in some regions.
Growing numbers of Muslims surveyed after the invasion of Iraq say they see the American war on terrorism as a campaign to weaken Muslims -- a charge long made by radical Islamists. Majorities in seven of eight predominantly Muslim countries say they worry that the United States might threaten their countries.
At the same time, statements by Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders perceived to be offensive are instantly transmitted around the world on satellite TV or on the Internet, fueling polarization on all sides. Recent comments made at a church breakfast by Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, a top Pentagon official, likening America's war against Muslim extremists to a battle against Satan, are a case in point.
Statements like that, analysts say, play into Islamist conspiracy theories, which blame the United States and Jews for the Muslim world's oppressive rulers, stagnant economies and sense of powerlessness.
"You are explaining events that are painful to the public, for which the public has no other explanation that is available, and over which the public has no power," said Shibley Telhami, a professor at the University of Maryland and a member of a Bush administration panel that recently surveyed Muslim attitudes and found "shocking levels of hostility" toward the United States. "They put forth a theory that explains that the responsibility lies with someone else."
The Islamist groups are keenly political, often with excellent organizational and public relations skills. In Pakistan, for example, a coalition of religious parties that received only 11 percent of the popular vote in parliamentary elections last year has turned itself into the country's main opposition group.
The organizations vary widely, ranging from Algeria's ultra-conservative and ultra-violent Armed Islamic Group to Jamaat-e-Islami, a decades-old political movement in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India that calls for establishing Islamic rule through nonviolent, democratic means. The goal, like that of any political organization, is gaining power. At times, they blame their enemies for their most reprehensible acts. They try to turn their own weakness, as well as their opponents' overwhelming strength, into an asset. 
After a car bombing on Oct. 12 at an American complex in Baghdad, crowds of Iraqis began chanting that the United States had set off the explosion itself. Two years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many Pakistanis still believe the United States invaded Afghanistan solely for its natural gas reserves, which are, by global standards, comparatively small. 
Last week, President Bush appeared to be surprised by the depth of suspicion that moderate religious leaders expressed to him in Indonesia. "Do they really believe that we think all Muslims are terrorists?" he asked his aides, shaking his head.
Robert Jackall, a sociology professor at Williams College, said the Islamists' voice was far larger than their numbers. "There is a fanatical group, a fringe element," he said, "that have been able to command the media and have been able to propagate a series of fantastic world images and a series of fantastic conspiracy theories."
From Iraq to Afghanistan, the number of people who join the guerrilla wars being waged against American forces may not be large, but as past attacks have shown, even a small number can do huge damage.
In an Oct. 16 memo published by USA Today last week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked whether the United States was losing the effort to halt the creation of a next generation of terrorists. "Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?" Mr. Rumsfeld wrote, referring to Islamic religious schools. "The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' costs of millions."
For American policymakers, countering political Islam and its conspiracy theories can seem baffling. After his meeting with Muslim leaders in Indonesia, Mr. Bush seemed particularly perplexed by their belief that the United States was uninterested in the creation of a Palestinian state, something the president has repeatedly said he supports. It was unclear whether the Muslim leaders had not heard Mr. Bush's prior statements or considered them a subterfuge.
Fouad Ajami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University, said part of political Islam's antimodern approach was a rejection of the Western scientific method. So when some Islamists declared, for instance, that al Qaeda caused this summer's blackout on the East Coast, that could be accepted without any proof. 
"When there is a break in cause and effect," Mr. Ajami said, "it's easy to sell these views of the world."
Supporters of an aggressive military campaign against terrorism say the United States, as the world's lone superpower, will be distrusted no matter what it does. But members of the Bush administration panel that surveyed Muslim attitudes say American public diplomacy efforts must be redoubled.
Professor Jackall said the problem was more difficult in some ways than battling Communism. Sweeping efforts to counter political Islam could confirm its conspiracy theories and demonstrate its suppleness as an ideology. After Mr. Mahathir's statements were harshly criticized, for example, the Malaysian prime minister said the outcry his speech provoked had proved him right. "The reaction of the world shows that they control the world," he said, referring to the Jews.

HEADLINE: Davis's Last-Minute Appointments in Doubt 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Dozens of last-minute appointments by lame-duck Gov. Gray Davis were thrown into doubt on Friday when the Senate's leader said lawmakers would not reconvene to confirm the nominations before Mr. Davis leaves office. 
 Mr. Davis has nominated nearly 90 people, including some of his top aides, to state posts since voters recalled him on Oct. 7. Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger can withdraw appointments if they are not confirmed by the time he takes office on Nov. 17. The Senate is not scheduled to meet again until January. 
 John Burton, the Senate president pro tem, had planned to have the Senate meet before Mr. Davis, a fellow Democrat, leaves office. But other senators expressed reluctance to confirm so many appointments by the first governor in California history to be recalled.
Senate sources told several newspapers that Senate leaders were negotiating with aides to Mr. Schwarzenegger to allow 12 to 15 Davis appointments to go through later.
But a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, H. D. Palmer, refused to say whether the Republican had agreed to any deal.
"I'm just not going to get into speculation about what's going to happen once he gets into office," Mr. Palmer said. "I'm not going to speculate on speculation."
Mr. Davis's press secretary, Steve Maviglio, said Mr. Davis was "confident the Senate will do what it thinks is right." Mr. Maviglio, whom Mr. Davis nominated for a $114,191-a-year seat on the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, said the governor stood behind the appointments.
"You have some of the most talented people in state government" working for the governor, Mr. Maviglio said. "It would be a shame to let that talent go to waste."
But Mr. Schwarzenegger's spokeswoman, Karen Hanretty, described the appointments as "payoffs made behind closed doors."
A dozen appointments are for jobs paying $86,196 to $117,396 a year. Some of the jobs are unsalaried.
The appointments are typical of departing governors, as will be Mr. Schwarzenegger's anticipated moves to block them. In his first days as governor, Mr. Davis rejected 134 last-minute appointments by his predecessor, Pete Wilson.

HEADLINE: North Koreans, In Shift, to Mull Security Offer 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE and DAVID E. SANGER; James Brooke reported for this article from Tokyo and David E. Sanger from Washington. Samuel Len contributed from Seoul, South Korea.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
In a marked shift, North Korea said Saturday that it would evaluate President Bush's offer of a security guarantee signed by its neighbors and the United States, which Mr. Bush made provided that the North dismantles its nuclear weapons program.
 Earlier in the week, North Korea had dismissed President Bush's offer as "laughable." Now that statement seems to have been a rote reaction by the North's propaganda machine. 
 The carefully worded Saturday statement, which was carried by North Korea's official news agency, omitted the usual criticism of the United States. But it did not set a date to resume six-party talks, which began with one session in Beijing in August. 
"We are ready to consider Bush's remarks on the written assurances of nonaggression if they are based on the intention to coexist," the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
It stressed the principle of "simultaneous actions." That has meant diplomatic recognition by the United States, building nuclear power plants and foreign aid in return for North Korea's abandoning its bomb program.
The C.I.A. has said that North Korea already has one or two nuclear weapons, and this summer the North has admitted to building some. It recently threatened to test a bomb. 
Next week, Wu Bangguo, the head of China's legislature, is to visit Pyongyang, the North Korea capital. He will be the highest-ranking Chinese dignitary to visit the North in several years.
With China increasingly seen as the deal maker in the North Korea standoff, the North may have released its statement before Mr. Wu's arrival to avoid any impression that it was acting at the bidding of the Chinese.
China now maintains close economic ties with South Korea, but it has longstanding links to the North and great leverage on it. The largest supplier of food and oil to North Korea, China flexed its muscle earlier this year by briefly cutting off the oil. 
China is frustrated that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has not followed the economic model laid out by Beijing. China, which fears that that waves of impoverished North Koreans will cross the land border between the nations this winter, has reportedly stationed 150,000 troops along the frontier.
If North Korea follows through on the Saturday announcement, it could mark a breakthrough in the yearlong standoff with the United States.
Mr. Bush has refused to conduct direct talks with the North, as the State Department and many outside experts have urged. He has insisted that the only way to press North Korea was to bring all of its neighbors into the process, especially China. Mr. Bush has encouraged China to take on the role of both intermediary and negotiating partner.
But until last week, during his trip to Asia, Mr. Bush refused to offer North Korea anything concrete in return for giving up its nuclear weapons program, and for surrendering its weapons and stockpiles. 
That changed in Bangkok last Sunday, when Mr. Bush indicated for the first time that the United States would offer the North a written security guarantee that would probably also be signed by the other parties in the talks: China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. "We will not have a treaty, if that's what you're asking," he said during a meeting with Thailand's prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. "That's off the table." 
The North previously demanded a formal treaty, ratified by the Senate. Mr. Bush would not agree, and as a matter of political reality, it is highly unlikely that the Senate would approve a treaty with a nation that still has no diplomatic relations with the United States, and that has not, in legal terms, agreed on a treaty ending the Korean War.
A senior White House official said today that the Bush administration was notified of North Korea's new position through the North's representatives at the United Nations on Friday. The official said the administration was still examining the statement and had reached no conclusions. 
Next week, Hwang Jang Yop, the highest-ranking defector from North Korea, is to arrive in Washington and testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is expected to give Congress and news organizations details of the inner workings of the Kim Jong Il government. Once a close aide to Kim Jong Il, Mr. Hwang is considered to have been the architect of North Korea's ideology of self-reliance, known as juche.
Discussing North Korea, Mr. Bush said "perhaps there are other ways we can look at" the problem, and his aides sketched out a plan that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been working on for months, involving the security guarantee among the several partners.
The theory, one senior administration official said, is that if the North reneged, and refused to dismantle its nuclear arms infrastructure, including a plant at Yongbyon, it would be defying not only the United States but also all of its primary allies. "We think it is a lot harder for the North Koreans to offer their traditional gesture of defiance to everyone at once," the official said.
One channel may open up next week, when Rep. Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican, is to lead a Congressional group to Pyongyang, his second visit since June. 
"I was told in June that if we came back we would be allowed to meet Kim Jong Il and to visit Yongbyon," Representative Weldon said in a telephone interview. "My concern is that we not allow ourselves to get sucked into a military conflict with the North. I believe we have to exhaust every possible bit of diplomacy." 
Timing is crucial to the Bush plan. Mr. Bush has made it clear that while the North will learn the details of the security guarantee, it will not take effect until the country's weapons program is being dismantled, its nuclear material is being shipped out of the country and inspectors have free run of the North.

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz's Hotel Is Attacked in Baghdad 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sunday, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The hotel where Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz stayed overnight during a visit to Iraq was hit by what American soldiers said were rockets early Sunday morning, wounding a number of people. Mr. Wolfowitz was not hurt.
 Shortly after 6 a.m., three or four explosions were heard outside the Rashid Hotel, where Mr. Wolfowitz and his delegation are staying. The hotel is also a center for American contract workers in Baghdad. 
 Although details remained sketchy shortly after the attack, it appeared that rockets hit on the 3rd, 8th and 11th floors. There were an unknown number of people wounded. At least three were seen being carried though the lobby on stretchers. Mr. Wolfowitz appeared to be unhurt, and he was rushed by security guards out a side door of the lobby. He appeared unfazed, and even exchanged greetings with correspondents who had rushed to the lobby. Smoke filled some of the upper floors, but there were no signs of a fire immediately after the attack. 
The attack on the well-known Rashid, especially during the visit of a high-ranking American dignitary, will only serve to underscore security concerns for the American-led stabilization effort and questions about how best to rout loyalists of the Saddam Hussein government. 
The rockets fired at the hotel came from beyond a tall security wall that marks the perimeter. One left a line of fireworks-style sparks as it came toward the building, and the 11th floor, where correspondents traveling with Mr. Wolfowitz were staying, shuddered.
One soldier outside the compound said 12 rockets had been left nearby on a generator. Six or seven remained, all set to go off. "It looks professional," the soldier said. "Whoever set this up knew what they were doing."
It was the second attack on the hotel in a month. On Sept. 27, three explosive devices blasted through the concrete and barbed-wire cocoon of security around the main compound for Americans in Baghdad, hitting the 14th floor but causing little damage and no injuries. 
Hotel residents were evacuated on Sunday through fire stairways, following a light trail of blood left by the wounded as they were carried out by colleagues and emergency medical workers.
The shell that struck a room on the eighth floor punctured a fist-sized circle through the window and wrecked the room. 
The atack was a stark contrast to a visit to Kirkuk on Saturday by Mr. Wolfowitz, the intellectual architect of the plan to oust Mr. Hussein. There he wrapped a flak jacket over his button-down blue shirt and went out on foot patrol with paratroopers in volatile northern Iraq. 
A little girl ran up and shouted, "Saddam is a donkey!" Mr. Wolfowitz laughed. 
A young woman hugged him. He responded with Ramadan greetings in the smattering of Arabic he has taught himself.
A money changer plying his trade from a card table held up an old note with Mr. Hussein's picture, jubilantly tearing it to pieces. Mr. Wolfowitz, a former graduate school dean and not a politician, responded by discussing the progress in introducing a new Iraqi currency. 
In the bustling marketplace of Kirkuk, Mr. Wolfowitz was cheered, exactly the kind of response that he desired and that his weekend trip to Iraq was devised to demonstrate to the American public, to skeptical members of Congress and to American allies. 
But like the two Apache helicopter gunships that whirled overhead in a heavy security force, policy questions also shadowed his visit.
Almost six months since President Bush declared that major combat operations had ended, the administration is being dogged by questions about what America's mission is today in Iraq, and how well it is being accomplished. "I think I'm a realist, as well as an optimist," said Mr. Wolfowitz, who visibly agonizes over reports of daily violence, attacks and death, but argues that perspective is missing in assessing the strides made in stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq, and pointing it toward democracy. 
"If you measure this place by unrealistic standards, you can get discouraged," he said. "If you measure it by the horror it's been through for the last 35 years, it's already an enormous breakthrough. And if you measure it by the quite impressive progress it has made in just six months, again it is encouraging." 
He did not deny that problems remained. But he appears indefatigable in making others take note of progress in creating a stable and democratic Iraq. He is undeterred by the continued attacks on American troops and Iraqi security forces, the setbacks in securing foreign commitments for more troops, and the sense of the long slog ahead that darkens Congressional debate and even appeared in a recent internal memo by his boss, Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
Mr. Wolfowitz is a man in a hurry to make his point. 
He is devoting a grueling weekend trip of 18-hour days to throwing a spotlight on a nascent women's rights movement, on easing ethnic and religious tensions, on the growth of Iraqi security forces, and on steps to improve quality of life by bringing power plants back online. No big change in strategy is needed, he said, just a greater determination to push onto the Iraqis responsibility for their own security and economy.
Along the way, he asked every Iraqi he met if a relative had been killed under Mr. Hussein's rule and if they were better off today. He asked every member of the new Iraqi security force he met whether they were getting what they needed, and he clearly hoped Congress would listen as they described their needs. 
Security remains a priority. A week before Mr. Wolfowitz's visit, two paratroopers were killed in an ambush outside of Kirkuk. Early Saturday, a Black Hawk helicopter that had landed to support an American patrol outside Tikrit was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and damaged, military officials said. Its crew was evacuated. 
Even one of Mr. Wolfowitz's motorcades in Baghdad was rerouted when the Iraqi police set up a roadblock after an improvised explosive device was found along the route four hours before his arrival, senior military officers said. 
Mr. Wolfowitz's focus was on the steps being taken to turn Iraqi security over to Iraqis, and he visited a neighborhood police station in Kirkuk. Its officers and patrolmen were trained at a special academy run by the 173rd Airborne Brigade. 
"We've worked ourselves out of a job," said Lt. Col. Dominic Caraccilo, in charge of training the Kirkuk police, describing how the new force allows his troops to step further out of harm's way.
"They control the city," he said of the force. "We're in the antiterror business." 
During a Saturday morning visit with members of the new Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, Mr. Wolfowitz complimented the young Iraqis who "are stepping forward to fight for their country alongside our people."
"There are things they can do that we can't do," he said. "They can read the local situation, read the population in ways that we can't. Iraqis come forward with information much more readily than they do with us." 
Senior officials traveling with Mr. Wolfowitz carry reams of statistics describing efforts in Iraq, as if they are tracking futures of a stock they are certain will grow and in which they have invested heavily. 
Prewar electricity production was 3,300 megawatts, officials said, which had dropped to 200 megawatts on May 1, the day Mr. Bush declared the end of major combat. Power production is now up to 4,417 megawatts. 
About 85,500 Iraqis are now in the ranks of the new border patrol, the police, the civil defense corps, the infrastructure protection service and the new army. The goal is to reach 170,300 people filling those rosters by next year, officials said. 
In a session with 11 Islamic clerics at a new museum in Kirkuk, Mr. Wolfowitz spoke of his time as ambassador to Indonesia, with its population of 200 million Muslims. After the expected pleasantries, the clerics -- who were Arab and Turkmen and Kurd, but all Sunni Muslim -- complained about alcohol sales since the fall of the old government. They asked why mosques in Tikrit, which Mr. Wolfowitz also visited on Saturday, were getting more money than those in Kirkuk.
They saw nothing odd about asking Mr. Wolfowitz, the son of a Polish-Jewish emigre to America, to intercede with Islamic leaders in Baghdad to declare the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that begins with the sighting of the first sliver of the new moon.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
After the 90's Boom, a Bounty of Blame

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN; William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
AN intellectual battle is shaping up over what message the Democratic Party should carry into the presidential election. One camp argues that the Democrats should strike a pragmatic pose, cutting deals with Republicans to attack problems like the lack of health insurance for millions of Americans. The other contends that Democrats need to remain true to their populist roots and not make compromises.
 Joseph E. Stiglitz, winner of the 2001 Nobel in economic science, has staked out the second position. His new book, "The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade" (W.W. Norton, $25.95), is a stinging rebuke of the Clinton administration's search for a middle ground. 
 Mr. Stiglitz certainly had a ringside view of what happened during the 1990's. He was a member and then chairman of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1997 and chief economist of the World Bank from 1997 to 2000. His previous book, "Globalization and Its Discontents," was an attack on the International Monetary Fund for the way it forced countries in economic disarray to cut spending.
The new book is a roundhouse assault on Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, as well as chief executives and corporations, Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry and just about everyone who helped shape the boom of the 1990's or profited from it. 
Mr. Stiglitz says he left his job as a Princeton professor and came to Washington because he supported President-elect Clinton's more populist inclinations. But President Clinton sought to portray himself as a "New Democrat" who wasn't a tax-and-spender. When the Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 election, Mr. Clinton moved even further to the center.
Although he never criticizes Mr. Clinton personally, Mr. Stiglitz says the administration as a whole sold out to deregulation, globalization, flawed accounting systems and other forces. That benefited a handful of special interests in the short run, he writes, but it also created worse imbalances between rich and poor. 
Of course, Mr. Stiglitz also criticizes what he calls the "Bush II" presidency. But he argues that the roots of today's economic malaise lie in the Clinton years.
"Americans should face up to the fact that in the very boom were planted some of the seeds of destruction, seeds which would not yield their noxious fruit for several years," he argues.
"What happened in the Roaring Nineties," Mr. Stiglitz writes, "was that a set of longstanding checks and balances -- a balance between Wall Street, Main Street (or High Street, as it is called in the United Kingdom), and labor; between Old Industry and New Technology, government and the market -- was upset, in some essential ways, by the new ascendancy of Finance."
By "Finance," Mr. Stiglitz includes Mr. Greenspan, who, he says, did little to defuse the stock market bubble despite acknowledging that "irrational exuberance" was at work. 
But most of Mr. Stiglitz's sting is reserved for Mr. Rubin, who was at Goldman Sachs before taking over the Treasury and then going to Citigroup. It may have escaped much attention, but there was a bitter fight at the heart of Mr. Clinton's economic decision-making apparatus. Mr. Stiglitz blames Mr. Rubin for pushing the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, for blocking more spending on social priorities and for letting the I.M.F. impose draconian solutions on debtor nations. "Treasury's views did not coincide with those of Clinton," Mr. Stiglitz writes. "Treasury had its own perspectives, its own ideology, its own agenda, and it was largely, though not completely, able to follow that agenda internationally through its domination of the I.M.F."
MR. STIGLITZ plays upon the old saying that what's good for General Motors is good for America. "The new mantra was what is good for Goldman Sachs, or Wall Street, is good for America and the world," he writes.
A sweeping critique, indeed. The author, though trained in the "dismal science" as an economist, displays nothing short of moral outrage. What, then, would he have us do? His core issue is that the nation needs to strike a better balance between markets and government. 
"The battle of ideas between those who advocate a minimalist role for the state," he writes, "and those who believe that there is a greater need for government if we are to achieve the kind of society we would like is being fought in country after country, in the developing world no less than in the developed, on both sides of the Atlantic and the Pacific."
Mr. Stiglitz argues that market forces have gone too far and that it's time for "a new democratic idealism." He expresses hope that the next cycle in American opinion and politics will emphasize equality, not greed. "Democratic idealism holds that there are legitimate areas for government activity -- from education to the promotion of technology, to social protection for the aged and the disadvantaged," he says.
Even if the author is correct about what went wrong in the 90's, will Americans buy it? Will they sacrifice economic gains at home to bring about "global social justice," as he advocates?
It may be fine to argue that the balance between the market and government has gone askew and needs to be recalibrated, but Mr. Stiglitz seems to become carried away with his passion, and overtly hostile to American business. ("Hidden theft had evidently been part of capitalism for a long time," he writes.)
Not all chief executives, of course, have been involved in financial sleight of hand. To build a more balanced economic future, any government must have at least civil relations with the people who decide whether to invest in research, build factories and hire people.
Agree with him or not, this is a powerful book written by apowerful intellect. And as they try to reclaim the White House, the Democrats will have to decide whether to heed Mr. Stiglitz's call.

HEADLINE: ART; 
Redrawn by Rembrandt

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH WEISGALL; Deborah Weisgall writes about the arts from Boston.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
"REMBRANDT'S JOURNEY," a subtle exhibition examining the artist as storyteller at the Museum of Fine Arts here through Jan. 18, includes only one image not by Rembrandt. It is an etching by Hercules Segers, a Dutch painter and printmaker who died around 1638, when Rembrandt was 32. Segers made this print, "Tobias and the Angel," sometime in the 1620's. About 30 years later, Rembrandt altered the copper plate to tell a different story, "The Flight Into Egypt." 
 Segers was the most innovative and expressive printmaker of his time. He printed on colored paper and with different colored inks, he printed on cloth, he added color to prints after they had been struck. A pupil of Rembrandt wrote that Segers "printed painting." His works are extremely rare, and most of his surviving images, almost all of them landscapes, are unique variants rather than editions of prints. 
 But Segers could not support himself with his art. The story goes that he was so depressed by his lack of artistic success that he turned to drink and died from a drunken fall before he was 50.
After his death, however, his reputation flourished. Rembrandt was fascinated by Segers and owned eight of his paintings; he must have acquired this plate, too. Segers's etching is a meticulously rendered landscape printed with green ink, a view over hills and forest to a meandering river with a town along its banks. Two tall figures cross the foreground: Tobias, exhausted, drags a big dead fish, while the angel Raphael regards him with tender sympathy.
This story, one of the books of the Apocrypha, concerns the righteous man Tobit, who was blinded by bird droppings. Tobit, wishing to die, sends his son Tobias to collect a debt. Tobias travels with a young man who suggests that Tobias catch a fish in the Tigris River. The fish cures Tobit's blindness, Tobias gets the money and finds a wife and his kind friend reveals himself to be Raphael.
Rembrandt set this story in several prints and drawings, all of them interiors, scenes of family life. He reworked Segers's landscape into an outdoor subject. At first glance, it seems to have nothing to do with the original, but, looking more closely, it's evident that Rembrandt changed the plate with great economy.
He turned Tobias and the angel into tree trunks and branches and disguised Raphael's wings as foliage; on the far right you can still find feathers. With strong, spare strokes, he drew the small group -- Joseph, with Mary and the baby on the donkey -- against the dark copse. He laid washes of shadowy tone over Segers's precise and intricate terrain, but he kept the lizard near the bottom and the tiny shepherd standing on the left. In Segers's etching, solace radiates from the angel. In Rembrandt's version, the forest embraces the family, as if the leaves that were once wings have retained divine power. They shield the family from sight, abetting their escape.
Why did Rembrandt do this? Clifford S. Ackley, the curator of the exhibition, pointed out that Segers's etching is a free variation on a painting by Adam Elsheimer, a German painter who died in 1610, from whose work Rembrandt also took ideas (including a nocturnal painting of the "Flight"). Segers and Rembrandt would have known Elsheimer's paintings from prints, made by yet another artist. "This is a long conversation over time," Mr. Ackley said. "And it is a collaboration between one artist who was living and one who was dead."

HEADLINE: High Anxiety 

BYLINE:  By KATE STONE LOMBARDI and MERRI ROSENBERG

 BODY:
IT'S the high season for one of the toughest games in town: the college admissions process.
 The pressure is mounting. Guidance counselors, parents and students alike are reaching for the toughest headache remedies. One-upsmanship and backbiting have been observed among particularly competitive parents. Some friendships are fraying, both parent friendships and student ones, by many accounts. And those who have "graduated" from the process tell stories of how awful it was to feel suddenly that every move of senior year relates to the question of what college or university decal will go on the back of the family car. 
 The topic is never far away. As Abigail Dalton, a senior at Ardsley High School, said: "A day has not yet gone by since the first day of school when I have not been asked where I'm applying early. Everybody wants to know their competition." 
 The pressure is, of course, not limited to Westchester and it is by no means universal. In many families, the decision is clear and the path to freshman year is smooth. Yet in a county where high-stakes public and private schools and high-achieving families are common, the agita level is high as early-decision deadlines approach around early November. Also, if the pressure seems higher this year in an already high-pressure game, that may be because it actually is. There are more seniors than there once were because of the baby boomlet. Those seniors fill out more applications, and more are applying early decision, because early applicants tend to have a better chance of getting the school of their choice. The college admissions game is tough and getting tougher. Will it be the Ivies? A state school? A safety school? And when will it be over? When?
 For Marleen Kassel Kerson, an Ardsley parent whose daughter graduated from Washington University in St. Louis last spring and whose son is a freshman at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, senior year was a difficult experience.
 "It was a year-and-a-half-long phenomenon," she said. "People staked out the Ivies, and the other kids slink away, and parents do, too. The kids who are headed for the Ivies take three to five A.P. classes a year, and are in honors courses. When kids aren't applying to the Ivies, then their parents walk to the back of the barbecue."
 Pure demographics is one cause of increased college competition. In 1990, there were about 2.6 million students nationally who graduated from high school; by 2009, demographers predict there will be 3.2 million, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. (Here in Westchester, about 10,000 high school seniors are seeking admission for the class of 2008, according to the Westchester Putnam College Conference Committee, an organization of local guidance counselors that runs the various countywide college fairs.)
 In 1998, there were 50,000 early applications; in 2002, there were 70,000 applications for a slot during the fall go-round, according to the College Board. Colleges are able to be more selective. At Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, for example, during the last five years there has been a 35 percent increase in applications, and now the college accepts 40 percent of applicants, rather than 50 percent. 
 For parents who may have been accustomed to smoothing their children's way from infancy onward, the reality check can be disturbing. "The colleges are not necessarily impressed by parents' wealth," said Scott Steinberg, a counselor at Briarcliff High School for the last 20 years. "Coming out of Westchester is not necessarily beneficial at the top tier schools. For the Ivy League schools, there are so many applicants from Westchester, they're just knocking each other out. 
 "We're a small school, 116 seniors, and we're encouraging all students and parents to keep the process confidential. Overall, these are good kids, who've known each other their whole lives, and good parents. But there's some jealousy, envy and hostility. A lot of friendships are broken over this."
 Parents who have been through the process before are sometimes stunned by just how much things have changed.
 "When my older daughter applied to Penn early, 11 years ago, the dean practically said, 'Go buy the sweatshirt,"' said one Scarsdale mother. "No one would say that now."
 Dr. Ellen Klausner, a psychologist with offices in White Plains and Manhattan, said that college admissions is a continuation of the competitive game that began when parents bragged that their baby was already sleeping through the night, walking at 9 months or toilet trained at a year old. 
 Parents become intensely invested in the college admissions process, she said, because they view it as a reflection of their success as parents. Beyond that, many status-conscious parents often view college as one more statement of prestige, she said. 
 "We live in a very competitive environment and a college is not unlike a Prada or a Mercedes," she said. "You have a label that you can attach to where your child goes. People look for status symbols everywhere."
 Nor are teenagers themselves immune to the game. Lizzy Schulzinger, who graduated several years ago from Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, recalls the spring of her senior year, when college acceptances began to roll in.
 "Once they get into a school, the next morning they have the decal up on their car in the Greeley parking lot, so you know so-and-so got into Harvard," she said. "Someone got the super-size Yale one that takes up half the window. It was disgusting."
 How bad can the competitiveness get? So bad that Penny Oberg, former head of the guidance department at Horace Greeley, felt that she had to share an anecdote about bad behavior in a newsletter sent to students and parents in 2002. Ms. Oberg described a mother whose daughter was accepted to a college, and who then called the admissions department to complain about another student who was wait listed.
 "The parent (who remained anonymous) was angry and claimed that wait listing the other student, who the parent believed was not as qualified, diminished the acceptance," Ms. Oberg wrote. She went on to ask parents to please consider what kind of image such conduct gave their community.
 To be sure, not all communities and not all schools see conduct worthy of reproach. Yonkers, despite its school system's troubled history, has successful students who go to the nation's most prestigious colleges. Administrators there say the atmosphere is different as far as Ivy League status symbols.
 "Our group of top kids is just as obsessed, and focused on their long-range plans, as any others," said Jerilynne Fierstein, director of public relations for the Yonkers public schools and the director of the district's gifted and the arts programs. "Our honors kids do apply, and get into the Harvards, Yales, Stanfords. But I would say it's not so much of an issue for the community."
 In places where the endless discussion of Ivy League applications and SAT scores is common, parents who had been friends may begin to avoid one another in the grocery store. 
 As the post cards arrive inviting students who have scored well on their PSAT's to special information sessions, the information filters through high school hallways, or is left on family answering machines. "You're not going to the Yale session at the school on Tuesday? Oh. Pity, I thought Robert would have been invited."
 Mundane tasks like the college tour are part of the equation. Some families mention heading off for the weekend to Hanover or Cambridge (translation: Dartmouth, Harvard or M.I.T.) as a subtle form of name-dropping. 
 Deborah Kerson, an Ardsley High School graduate of the class of 1999 who graduated in the spring from Washington University, remembered that there was no escaping the social pressures.
"When I applied to Washington University early, nobody had heard of it, " she said. "People were weird, like I was going to this random school. From the high school perspective, there was the idea that if you're not going to a good college, your life is basically over. And I do remember typing kids in my class by the schools they applied to."
 Strong feelings aren't limited to those who seek acceptance at selective colleges. Parents of student athletes check the sports statistics, anxious about competition that may deprive their own child of a sports scholarship to a desired school. Other parents, whose children have talents in music, drama or the arts, are just as concerned about who gets first chair in the orchestra, or the lead in the fall play or who wins the essay contest.
 One Westchester educator, who reacted to the friction by agreeing to speak only on the condition that he not be identified, has a daughter who earned a full academic scholarship to a solid college, partly based on her talents as an athlete. "There was resentment that she got the money, and a few other scholarships available locally that she wasn't given," he said. "There's competition for ever more limited dollars."
 With everyone looking for that special edge, the sense of others' advantages raises the pressure -- for example, if Mom went to Harvard or, even better, if Grandpa gave a building to Yale. 
 "All the issues involved with legacy, athletes and affirmative action just exacerbate all the emotional feelings," said Carol Gill, a private college counselor in Dobbs Ferry. (Of course, even the decision to hire a private counselor like Ms. Gill is something some families can't do or won't do.) Ms. Schulzinger talked about a girl in her high school class who applied as an American Indian.
 "She was like one-twentieth Native American, and her sister even got a Native American scholarship to Columbia," she said. "She told me this herself in physics class." 
 The early decision equation has also changed the mix. Increasingly, for the most high-profile colleges, statistics show that an early application, in the fall, with the student committing to go to the college or university if accepted, gives a student a distinct advantage over a regular application, which is usually sent between Dec. 1 and Feb. 1. As a result, many students feel they have no choice but to apply during the fall early decision window.
 "This increases their opportunity," said Marjorie Jacobs, director of counseling at Scarsdale High School. "Over 50 percent of our class applies early, and has since the 1990's. Now, perhaps 65 to 70 percent of our students are out early and looking early. They understood it's to their advantage."
 EARLY decision is complicated on another front, though. Early decision applicants make an early commitment, and they must take what they are offered in financial aid, rather than waiting until spring and comparing financial aid packages, assuming they are accepted at several schools. Income issues leap to the foreground. 
 "Who's applying early?" said Ms. Jacobs of Scarsdale. "Kids from communities that are knowledgeable, where they're likely to be paying full tuition. That's what's driving the early process." Matt Sergi, a 1999 graduate of Ardsley High School and a 2003 graduate of New York University, found his experience as the child of divorced parents gave him an unusual perspective. 
 "I myself was both privileged and unprivileged," he said. "In high school, I remember people talking about SUNY Binghamton as the school you went to 'if you can get into an Ivy but can't afford it.' There were whispers about one of the few minority students in the class, whispers like 'I wish I were black to get special financial aid.' I also remember how clear the economic strata lines were in high school, how they lined up with the academic strata -- there were the honors kids, the Regents kids and the below-Regents kids. It was such a caste system."
 As if there isn't enough stress between parents and teenagers, the application process brings even more stress into the relationship. It is by no means unusual to hear of children who refuse to discuss the issue with their parents, or parents and children who don't agree on which school or schools are the best. That didn't happen for Mr. Sergi, but in his family there was an extra layer of anguish.
 "There was stress between me and my mom because of finances when I was applying to college, with all the forms to fill out with financial aid requests," he said. "For me, it was so heart-wrenching -- is Mom paying? Is Dad paying? I was terribly uncomfortable. It brought back all the stress of growing up as a child of divorce." 
 As unpleasant as the process has become, say those who have done it, it seems there's no escaping it. Ms. Gill, the college counselor, said she gets most phone calls from parents on Monday, "after the cocktail party or soccer game over the weekend."
 "What happens is that very often parents feed on each other, and I get questions that range from the sublime to the ridiculous about college admissions," she said.
 Teenagers, too, say the topic is ubiquitous, on the soccer field, at Thanksgiving dinner, in school hallways. 
 "That's all anyone asked all the time," said Ms. Schulzinger. "That's who you were -- you were applying to schools. It's almost like you have no other aspect of your personality. Where are you looking? Did you stay over? Did you interview? How did that go? Do you think you'll get in? "
 That discussion often begins with the question, "So what colleges is Caitlin looking at?" 
 Bob Sweeney, a guidance counselor at Mamaroneck High School, said: "It does get loaded. When that question is asked, there's a certain intimidation, so that the parent thinks, "I'm going to tell them the more prestigious schools, so that I look good."' 
 Not surprisingly many families also try to keep their college plans to themselves.
 "Students are reluctant to tell others about where they're applying," said Ms. Jacobs of Scarsdale High School. "I have seen youngsters be concerned about a friend applying to the same school. There are issues of ownership. They're sensitive to their peers, and don't want to offend them. Kids get very conflicted, because they care about each other."
 Students are well aware of the high stakes involved. 
 "Everyone watches out where other people are going," said Sipra Rathi, a senior at Edgemont High School. "With the Ivy League, if more than two students are applying, people get nervous. They think it lowers the chances of getting into places like Harvard, Princeton or Yale. People feel they're competing directly against each other. If you're hanging out with the top of the class, it gets competitive. People kind of try not to ask, which creates some tension, as they're trying to figure out who's going where."
 Linda Pennell, who had two daughters graduate from Horace Greeley, remembers the intrusiveness of neighbors, acquaintances and strangers.
 "People who wouldn't even begin to ask you intimate personal questions have decided that this is fair game," Ms. Pennell said. "It's as if the whole college process is fair game for opening up your lives to public scrutiny, and everyone has an opinion on whether or not you're applying to the right schools."
 Of course, when the acceptances and rejections begin to arrive, all privacy bets are off. News travels fast, "I heard he didn't really have a safety." "Oh, sure she got in -- she's a legacy, you know." 
 A few months later, the teenagers pack for college and the next class begins its autumn ordeal. One who remembers it well is Ms. Schulzinger, who is now on the other side of the process, working as a student interviewer at Kenyon College. 
 "I had a kid recently who was taking five AP's, was head of the student council and he was so stressed out," she said. "You could see it in his face -- 'I'm really smart and I'm not going to get in anywhere.' It's awful. It's like he thought he was going to ruin the rest of his life if he didn't get in. I really wish I could tell them, 'You're going to be O.K., I promise you."'

HEADLINE: JERSEY; 
Take Heed! Winter Is Coming, Ready or Not

BYLINE:  By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
THE leaves are changing color and the ugly sweaters are coming out of storage, which can only mean that it's time for the Jersey Column's annual Guide to Getting Your Home and Yard Ready for Winter. 
 By "annual" we do not mean to imply that we write one of these guides annually; in truth, this will be our first. Yet plunking the word annual in front of something gives it an air of authority (the annual State of the State Address, the annual U.S. News and World Report Randomly Generated Ranking of Colleges and Universities), and since we actually know little about getting homes and yards ready for winter, we need all the authority we can get. 
 It goes without saying that proper preparation for winter is vital, because otherwise hardware stores, nurseries and fertilizer manufacturers would have practically nothing to sell at this time of year, dealing another blow to New Jersey's already shaky economy. Many amazing products are available for the home and yard in the fall, like magic fertilizer that, if applied now, will somehow make your lawn green and weed-free seven months in the future. Customers buying such fertilizer will find the same stores eager to sell them bridges in Brooklyn. 
 Purchase as many of these products as your car will hold, making sure the neighbors are watching when you unload them so they will be impressed with your industriousness. Here are some other winterizing tips:
 The Vegetable Garden: Remove all dead tomato plants from the garden bed. Do not stop to calculate how much you spent buying and fertilizing these plants for the sake of the six or eight tomatoes they produced. Note that there are no dead plants to remove at the spots where you planted cucumbers, broccoli and green peppers, because those things never did actually grow, did they? On a piece of paper write, "Do Not Plant This Stuff Again in 2004." Stick the paper in a Ziploc bag and place it in the garden.
 The Flower Garden: Churn up the soil to the depth of four inches, mixing in humus, tofu and shredded business records as desired. Keep in mind that insects and small wild animals may be hidden in garden debris, like the 10-foot boa constrictor The Trentonian said was found a few days ago off Warren Street. If you find a boa constrictor in your garden, do not try to apprehend it. Instead, slowly walk backward into your home, pick up the phone, call a real estate agent and put your house on the market. Do not mention the boa constrictor in your house-for-sale advertisements.
 The Bird Feeder: Replace the summer seed mixture in your bird feeder with a fall/winter mix, after consulting with your cat as to which birds it would most like to harass. Bird-harassing cats displease the New Jersey Audubon Society, which will give you an impassioned argument as to why cats should be kept indoors 24/7, but feel free to ignore this perfectly sound advice because, hey, they're just birds, right? Explain to your cat, however, that some birds are better left unharassed, like the emu that has popped up in Hamilton of late. Savor the mental image of your cat's reaction were it to bound out to the bird feeder and find a gigantic emu there.
 Shrubs and Trees: With shears and/or a chainsaw, trim all shrubs and trees as necessary. Try not to leave any stumps in the shape of religious figures unless you have adequate parking for pilgrims and curiosity seekers. To find out exactly how much parking you might need, call city hall in Passaic, where a tree stump that may resemble the Virgin Mary has been generating publicity in recent days. As long as you have city hall on the line, also ask about the dos and don'ts of animal sacrifice, another recent news item there. Suggest that someone in city hall consider writing a book titled, "Things They Never Taught Us in Government School."
 Home Maintenance: Inspect the exterior of your home and note any painting, window replacement, reroofing, caulking, etc. that needs doing. Hire someone to do it. To learn how to pay for all this work, call the governor's office and ask for the details of Public Question No. 1 on the Nov. 4 ballot, which claims that it will somehow allow us to buy another $150 million worth of open space without costing us a cent. Suggest to whoever answers the phone that we use this same budgetary voodoo to erase the gazillion-dollar deficit the state now faces. Then go spread your magic fertilizer; it could snow any day now.

HEADLINE: The View's Great, But the Course Is a Real Dump 

BYLINE:  By JOE CONCHA

DATELINE: BAYONNE 

 BODY:
WHEN the city of Bayonne is mentioned, any number of words come to mind. Probably making most people's top 10 would be "pizza," "tanker," and "landfill." Near the bottom of the list would be the word "golf."
 This thought process is understandable considering that Bayonne, situated in Hudson County, is the only one of the state's 21 counties not to be home to a golf course of any kind. The reason the trickle-down effect of Tiger-mania had not hit the state's most densely populated region earlier is because golf -- with its demands for large swaths of land, alluring scenery and a measure of privacy -- is the last sport that could be properly accommodated in such a cramped area. 
 But come 2005, golfers will be teeing off at a gilt-edged Scottish-style links course built atop of one of the few places in Bayonne that is not populated: a former waste disposal site. The project is being headed up by Empire Golf USA, which operates nine courses throughout the country, including three top-ranked courses in New Jersey. 
 The attraction of building a golf course in Bayonne -- a blue-collar port city that at one time was a leading oil refiner and shipping terminus -- is strictly based on its proximity to Manhattan.
 What's more, the novelty of providing Manhattan's power players with a complete golfing experience a John Daly tee shot from the city is spreading. In addition to the Bayonne Golf Club, a course at Port Liberte in Jersey City -- a paradise for those who work primarily in the city's financial district on the banks of the Hudson -- is being designed by Tom Kite, a United States Open champion, and that is also expected to open in 2005.
 In northern Europe, links courses generally sit on seaside soil unsuitable for farming. Bayonne's longtime garbage dump on this active shipping strait actually fits that description. And in keeping with the design of links courses overseas, all 18 holes at the The Bayonne Golf Club will play into the teeth of Upper New York Bay. The par 70, 6,900-yard course will not only include rolling fairways and stiff breezes off the water, but will feature 100-foot dunes, the highest on the East Coast. 
 "The course will be fair, but it will be very challenging," explained Eric Bergstol, president of Empire Golf and designer of the Bayonne Golf Club.
 Mr. Bergstol estimated that the cost to prepare the 126-acre site, truck the dredge material and build the course and clubhouse would come to more than $100 million, making it the most expensive course ever built in the state.
Since the course sits on a former landfill, it will have no trees, making the surrounding scenery -- in this case the Verrazano Bridge and Statue of Liberty -- visible from every hole. Even on cloudy days the Manhattan skyline sits as a backdrop as old barges and huge oil tankers slip in and out of the adjacent peninsula at the old Military Ocean Terminal, also known as Bayonne Harbor. 
 To take advantage of the course's proximity to New York, particularly Wall Street, Empire plans to offer ferry and private yacht service so that its well-heeled members will be able to avoid tunnel traffic or (gasp) the PATH train. After all, the course is only 10 minutes away by water from downtown Manhattan 
 "Any spectacular golf course would be embraced, regardless of geography," said Michael Esposito, a New Jersey Public Golf Organization member -- and a five handicap. "A 10-minute ferry ride is much more convenient than traveling to Long Island or golf courses throughout North Jersey."
 Still, not everyone agrees with the club's primary selling point -- urban convenience. 
 "I don't think the big guns in the finance industry would embrace such a course," said Gil Pagovich, a sports marketing agent in New York. "No one will want to have their golfing guests carrying their clubs on and off a ferry." 
 Cherokee Investment Partners -- a company based in England that specializes in buying landfills in America and Britain and morphing them into profit-turning golf courses -- is financing the endeavor. Like all private golf clubs, Cherokee will be looking for a return on its investment through initiation and membership fees. To join the club, a prospective member will first have to receive an invitation. 
 Don't bother rushing to the mail box. It is not likely that the invitation will be mass mailed and addressed to "occupant," considering the initiation fee has been set at $100,000 for those who join before the club opens, and $250,000 thereafter. 
 Most Bayonne residents -- who were once led to believe this would be a public course -- can now forget about it. According to the mayor, Joseph P. Doria, the original plan called for a public as well as a private course, but the difficulty in gaining environmental approval for both limited the project to one course. A recent Census report indicated that of the city's 61,274 residents, only 245 earn more than $200,000 a year.
 To avoid being totally shut out, Mayor Doria was able to gain a concession from Empire Golf that included 500 rounds of golf a year at half price for Bayonne residents as well as construction of a 2.5-mile walkway along the waterfront.
 "We're opening up an area that was totally industrial in the past that obviously was environmentally challenged," Mr. Doria said. "None of this was available to the people of Bayonne before."
 While $250,000 is an estimable chunk of change, it is not the most expensive initiation fee in New Jersey. 
 Take Donald J. Trump's 520-acre course in Bedminster that is scheduled to open in 2004. The course, to be called the Trump National Golf Club, will feature the usual over-the-top amenities that have become a staple of any property owned by the flamboyant real estate developer. Mr. Trump is including a separate area for equestrian sports and skeet shooting, for example. Consequently, joining the Trump course will cost more than $300,000. 
 Nor are clubs for the wealthy in short supply in New Jersey. The Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield -- which has been host to 15 United States Golf Association championships in its 108-year history -- charges a $50,000 initiation fee, and members are also required to purchase a $10,000 club-issued bond. At Metedeconk National in Jackson, $140,000 is the price of getting past the security gates. And at Hamilton Farm Golf Club in Gladstone, $250,000 is needed to get on to the first tee. 
 "If the economy were to rebound to a major degree, Bayonne would obviously have a much improved chance for the success," said Chuck Stogel, a former president of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association. "But even given that, people and companies -- those who would have easily jumped at buying into a corporate membership package -- are being much more careful with spending, especially discretionary funds."
 To this day, many ridicule the decision by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to build Giants Stadium atop a swamp. The location and smell would keep fans away, critics said. But judging by the combined 40-year waiting list for season tickets to Giants and Jets games, the location appears to be doing fine. 
 Al Czervik -- a real estate developer played by Rodney Dangerfield in the 1980 movie "Caddyshack" -- once declared that "golf courses and cemeteries are the biggest wastes of prime real estate."
 Al may have been on to something.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 26 about a golf course under construction in Bayonne misstated the headquarters location of the developer, Cherokee Investment Partners, and referred incompletely to the scope of its business. The company is in Raleigh, N.C., not in London. In addition to creating golf courses, it cleans up manufacturing and industrial sites.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT; 
A Scary Crop

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: MEDFORD 

 BODY:
ON an overcast October afternoon, the pickings should have been great as 5-year-old Mary Wilson searched rows of pumpkins set out at Johnson's Corner Farm, long a popular fall stop in this rapidly developing part of Burlington County.
 "Every one seems to have spots, Daddy," Mary told her father, William Wilson. The two fingered through a couple dozen pumpkins before settling on one of medium size with a few scratches. 
 "Guess it's been a bad year," Mr. Wilson said. "The pumpkins look rather sad." 
 Sad, indeed. Though the seemingly endless days of rain last spring and summer have been a bonanza for a colorful coat of foliage this fall, they played havoc with New Jersey's pumpkin crop. That has put a dent in a rural economy that has come to depend on the weekend picker, the hayride enthusiast and the fan of corn mazes to rev up farmstand sales at the end of the season.
 "We're seeing anywhere from 60 to 80 percent loss in the yields," said Michelle Infante-Casella, the pumpkin expert among the Gloucester County agricultural agents. "That means some places lost 100 percent of the crop. There was a lot of fungus out there, and if they didn't treat it with anti-fungal sprays as we warned, they could have lost everything."
 The main culprit has been the weather. In May, the prime month for planting pumpkin seedlings, it rained 26 days. The rain was double the normal amount in June, and rain fell on 14 days each in July and August, when the plants do most of their flowering. Even though the rain has subsided a bit this fall, the ground soil is so wet that each time it does rain, puddles form, drenching the grown pumpkins.
 "Pumpkins, cucumbers, cantaloupes, watermelons, all sorts of vine plants are susceptible to disease when there is too much water," said Ray Samulis, the county agriculture agent for the Rutgers Cooperative Extension in Burlington County. "The problems start early and continue right on."
 Mr. Samulis said that in May many seedlings died, drowned in those constant rains. Farmers replanted later, but most of those plants did not survive either. Many were afflicted with mildew - either powdery mildew, a white-colored disease on the top of the leaves, or downy mildew, a brown one on the underside. 
 Enter, next, the lazy, shybees, Ms. Infante-Casella said.
 "Bees like to pollinate when there is sun and clear weather," she said. "Cloudy conditions will impede a honey bee from working. They just don't do anything then. And if a flower, in this case a pumpkin flower, doesn't get pollinated, there isn't any fruit."
 To top it off, many pumpkins that did make it through all this contracted a fungus on the outside from being drenched in puddles. Their stems softened and fell off and their shells became fleshy and weak.
"Strangely enough, that wouldn't have been so bad if we grew a lot of pumpkins here for food," Mr. Samulis said. "But it's mostly what the farmers call Face Pumpkins, the kind people buy for show for Halloween." The meat in many of the weaker pumpkins would still be fine, he said, but no one wants to buy a pumpkin for a jack-o'-lantern that doesn't have a strong stem and a clear complexion.
 Harvey Ort, the fourth-generation owner of Ort Farms in Long Valley, near Chester, said he lost about 50 percent of his pumpkin crop but saved enough to sell at his farmstand and to give to people who take his hayrides this fall.
 "It was just too wet," Mr. Ort said. "You can't just wash off a fungus and sell the pumpkin. Leave any fruit in your house in something too moist for a few days and you'll see. It's horrible."
 Ms. Infante-Casella said that many retailers, especially in South Jersey, ended up buying pumpkins from Pennsylvania. It's not that it rained much less there, but the farming process is different, primarily among the Amish who make up much of the farming community in Lancaster County.
 "We tend to specialize in either animal or crop farming in New Jersey, and there they do both dairy and vegetable farming," she said. "They also do more natural farming. They leave a cover crop of straw or living mulch on the soil, which keeps it dryer. They use cow manure, which makes a nice soil environment. Plus the soil out there is really fertile and is a little hillier, so the water drains better and doesn't sit in irrigation ditches."
 Nevertheless, determined pumpkin pickers can take heart. In a sort of Darwinian process, the New Jersey pumpkins that did survive seem more colorful and heartier, Mr. Samulis said. Counting the pumpkins imported from nearby states, there should be quite enough to go around. He also said that corn crops look good now, so Indian corn decorations should be good, and corn mazes should also be in fine shape, unless they were damaged by recent winds of near-hurricane strength.
 Mr. Ort of Ort Farms suggests that those taking home a pumpkin wash it in a solution of 2 percent Clorox to water, to make sure that any fungus is wiped away. He is selling his pumpkins at 49 cents a pound - the going rate around the state and the same as he did last year.
 "Oh, I just gave up the wholesale pumpkins, that other 50 percent," he said. "It will be a little colder winter for us, a little less money coming in, but we intend to have a fun Halloween with hayrides and all anyway."

Brash Managers Need to Have Brash Pitchers

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
EVER since most of America discovered Josh Beckett -- that is to say, when Sammy Sosa bristled during the National League Championship Series -- almost every mention of Beckett has included the adjective "brash."
 Brashness often pays off in sports. And it paid off gloriously last night as Beckett pitched a superb five-hit shutout and the improbable Florida Marlins beat the Yankees, 2-0, to win the World Series in six games. 
 The visitors then celebrated on the mound in Yankee Stadium, a sight that had not been seen in the postseason for 22 years. The Yankees have not won a World Series in three seasons, but who is counting? 
Two figures dominated the World Series. One was the bongo-banging septuagenarian Jack McKeon -- Zorba the Manager -- who has been known to sit in with the band long after midnight.
It was McKeon who chose Beckett to pitch last night, no doubt blowing cigar smoke in his face and saying something like, "Let's get it over with, kid, so we can party right away."
And when a Champagne-drenched McKeon came out for his interviews, he chortled, but in a nice way: "You believe me now? Anything can happen."
The other dominant figure was Beckett, who lost Game 3 on Tuesday, but who gave up only two runs. He was clearly McKeon's best pitcher as this thrilling autumn evolved.
Last night Beckett, on only three days of rest, outlasted the gallant Andy Pettitte. Throwing fastballs in the high 90's, Beckett struck out nine and ruled the Yankees right to the end.
"This guy is special, I told you that," McKeon crowed, but pleasantly. "He's very tough. I knew he had the confidence to do the job tonight."
There had been a potential for second-guessing McKeon for going with his ace a day early. However, this was a decision of two adult parties. Beckett wanted the ball, and McKeon had no problem handing it to him.
"He's a fun guy to play for, man," Beckett said last night. "He expects a lot out of you. He's a good guy who likes to have fun."
They are an odd couple of age and youth. Beckett, the swaggering righty from Texas, shows little deference to his elders, or his peers, either. He buzzed Sosa in the league series, when the Marlins were down by three games to one, and when Sammy took exception to the heat, Beckett said he thought Sammy was over-reacting.
Then after throwing a two-hitter against the Cubs, and showing them to be vulnerable, Beckett said he fully expected to be pitching relief in Chicago in the seventh game, which indeed he was.
There is a school of thought that says McKeon should have saved Beckett to be fully rested today and played mix-and-match -- as he has often done in the postseason -- last night. But McKeon played down the four-day rest that has been the norm for almost every pitcher in baseball this generation.
"That stuff is in the past, this is the future," McKeon said. "I would not take him out in the ninth after 99 pitches."
Beckett concurred, to a point, saying: "In my case, it was O.K., but through the whole year you can't do it. You get stiff arms in a five-man rotation."
Beckett signed out of high school in Spring, Tex., and made the majors in his second year as a professional. Limited by injury, he has only a 17-17 record in parts of three seasons. Last night he shut down the Yankees in their own park and helped win a World Series at age 23.
Even if the Marlins had lost last night, McKeon was not likely to morph into Grady Little, the manager of the Boston Red Sox, who has become a legendary figure in the Greater New England Pantheon of Gloom and Doom because he stuck with Pedro Martinez, a fragile pitcher known for his full four days of rest and his pitch counts.
Little challenged that accurate profile of Martinez, and will pay the price, perhaps in unemployment, certainly in historical repute.
If it had gone badly last night, McKeon would not have had a problem with hauling the kid off the mound. He was never shy about moving people around when he was a general manager known as Trader Jack.
McKeon was rescued from the dreaded R-word last summer when the Marlins' leadership, under Jeffrey Loria, recognized that McKeon was too young at heart to hang around on his porch. A few months later, the Marlins were in the World Series, and McKeon was on the top step pounding his chest and yelling at umpires, the best possible exercise for elderly managers.
With Donald Rumsfeld having a bad season, McKeon might very well become the nation's No. 1 pinup among senior citizens. People sense his zest for life. He does not come off as some Hefnerian old goat, but rather a man who talks about his wife and grandchildren, attends morning Mass, likes to have a good time -- music, cigars, cocktails, theater, opera and lots of baseball hypotheses in the sultry and smoky night air. 
McKeon has given us a refresher course in loving life and loving his business.
Josh Beckett is a bit of a throwback, too. They both wanted to play ball. Plus, as Zorba might have said, there is no second-guessing a manager who plays the bongos.

YANKEES' SILENT SURRENDER

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
The familiar figure in a blue blazer and a white turtleneck anxiously waited for an elevator about 45 minutes before the first pitch at Yankee Stadium last night. George Steinbrenner shuffled his feet and discussed a family issue. But it took Steinbrenner only about a minute to sound like the demanding principal owner the Yankees know, expect and fear.
 When Steinbrenner was asked for a prediction for Game 6 of the World Series between the Yankees and the Florida Marlins, he turned toward the questioner, stopped shuffling, stopped using syllables on the other topic and said, "My gut is we better win." 
 We better win. Not we better play well. We better win. Steinbrenner's comments were not surprising. He could have made the same proclamation in January or July and probably did. What made Steinbrenner's mandate compelling is how emphatic he was, and because the Yankees really had to win to keep their season alive.
The Yankees failed to satisfy Steinbrenner's gut or themselves as they lost to the Marlins, 2-0, and watched their season end with three straight losses to a team most figured they would defeat. But the Marlins were more resilient than the fading Yankees, who looked and played like a tattered team, whose hitters were invisible and who have made next season incredibly tense because they have not won a title for three straight seasons.
"I guess it's kind of strange to say, but I still think we got the best team in the league," Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte said. "But we didn't win.Obviously, we're not the best team because we didn't win."
Pettitte pitched seven gutsy innings and allowed one earned run, but he blamed himself for throwing too good a pitch to Luis Castillo that resulted in a run-scoring single in the fifth. He could have also blamed himself for not getting an out at third on a bunt in the sixth, even as catcher Jorge Posada was shouting for Pettitte to throw it there. 
But Pettitte is not the reason the Yankees lost this game and suddenly gave themselves a lot of time to catch a movie or grab dinner tonight. Obviously, the Yankees wanted to be at the Stadium playing a Game 7. Pick a Yankee, any Yankee, who waved a bat against Josh Beckett and flopped. Those lifeless hitters are the reasons the Yankees will spend the winter wondering what went awry and why the batting coach Rick Down could be the first man on the unemployment line.
"I guess I'm still kind of shocked a little bit," Pettitte said. "I didn't expect this to happen. I felt as confident walking out of the bullpen that we would win as I ever have."
Steinbrenner was pensive as he waited for the game that would determine whether his $180 million Yankees would play for a title tonight. When someone mentioned to Steinbrenner that he must have felt confident with Pettitte going because he had already saved the Yankees three times this postseason, Steinbrenner was prescient as he sought admittance to the Josh Beckett Fan Club.
"What about the other guy?" Steinbrenner said. "He's a good pitcher. We've got to hit."
Even Steinbrenner knew it. Steinbrenner continued ranting to a friend: "We can't swing at the first pitch against this guy. First pitch, all the time. We've got to be patient."
Guess what? Beckett said he actually felt the Yankees were more patient against him last night than they were in Game 3, but he adjusted by mixing in more off-speed pitches and making several hitters look befuddled. Derek Jeter, who had the only three hits off Beckett in his last start, was 0 for 4, stranded three runners and made an error that led to Florida's second run. The player Luis Sojo called "the real Mr. October" played like it was a meaningless month. 
"It never sets in," Jeter said. "You start in the middle of February with one goal, to win a championship. We didn't do it."
The Yankees were 0 for 12 with runners on base last night and hit a brutal .169 with men on base for the series. There were chances for the Yankees sprinkled throughout every game, including having runners in scoring position five times off Beckett, but they never capitalized. If $180 million bought Steinbrenner anything this season, it should have bought him a couple of players who could have slapped two-out hits.
As the Yankees trudged around a quiet clubhouse like zombies, some of them believed they had lost to a team they should have stopped. The Marlins are deserving champions, a loose band of players who followed Manager Jack McKeon to the pinnacle of the sport and had fun every inch of the way. Jeter said the Marlins were "better than us in this series," stopping short of saying Florida was better than the Yankees. Saying that would have been too painful on a painful night.
After winning four titles in five seasons, the Yankees are winless in the last three so it will probably be time to separate the 2004 Yankees from those championship teams. Even though there will be players remaining from those teams, they are not champions anymore. 
"There'll be changes, I'm sure," Pettitte said. "Right now, I'm sick. I'm sick to my stomach right now."

HEADLINE: A Campaign Without Big Guns 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
WHEN New Jersey voters talk about the election, more often than not they are referring to Arnold and California -- or perhaps to the passel of Democratic presidential contenders -- but not to Jim and John, the leaders of the state Democrat and Republican parties respectively. 
 Little wonder. The state's top political leaders have not exactly been hitting the campaign trail with splashy events. They have barely been hitting it at all. 
 For the record, Jim is better known as James E. McGreevey, the beleaguered governor of New Jersey, whose poll numbers have been plummeting. Although Mr. McGreevey is not up for re-election until 2005, the voters' measure of his first two years in office are likely to play a role in the November election. 
And John is John O. Bennett, the Republican co-president of the evenly divided Senate and the highest-ranking Republican in the state, has been struggling because of an investigation into his billing practices while a municipal attorney. Although the two party leaders have been working behind the scenes to raise money for the fall races -- Governor McGreevey, in particular, with great success -- neither man has been very visible in a campaign that has all 120 seats in the Legislature up for grabs. 
Since taking office, Governor McGreevey's poll numbers have been in a consistent decline, so much so that the most recent Quinnipiac University survey, made public on Sept. 25, showed that only 35 percent of the respondents approved of the governor's performance, and 52 percent disapproved. 
And Mr. Bennett -- who earlier this year insisted on staying in his race despite pleas from local party officials to consider withdrawing -- finds himself in the fight of his political life. A defeat in his Monmouth County district could mean not only the loss of a Republican seat but even a shift in the balance of power in the Senate.
As a consequence, the baggage of the political leaders is making the outcome of this midterm election difficult to predict. But its importance cannot be underestimated. Not only will the elections on Nov. 4 be about who controls the two legislative branches of state government, but they will also determine who leads the two parties in the near future. That matters because whoever emerges in a leadership position will largely set the agenda and determine who gets to run for governor in 2005.
Yet while the stakes are high, pollsters see just a handful of races -- about 4 or 5 of the 40 districts -- deciding which party will control the Legislature.
For Governor McGreevey, the outcome could be a crucial factor in whether Democrats want him to seek a second term. With voter approval ratings already low, the loss of either the Assembly or the Senate could set off a call for change that would be hard for the Democratic leadership to ignore.
"If Republicans do win both houses, you will likely start hearing Democrats start talking publicly about Doomsday in 2005," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University.
Carl Golden, a former spokesman for Mr. McGreevey's Republican predecessor, Christie Whitman, was only too happy to concur. "If he loses one house it's bad; if he loses both houses it's a catastrophe," Mr. Golden said. 
Mr. Golden added, "The only conclusion one could draw from that is that it is a repudiation or rebuke of the governor Unfortunately, that's what happens when you're the governor. As the only state official elected statewide, everything sooner or later washes up at the front door of the governor's mansion."
In truth, it would be hard -- if not virtually impossible -- for Democrats to deny the governor the chance to seek re-election, though Republicans are certainly trying, And so they have already started to campaign against Mr. McGreevey, making him the main focus of this election.
They are counting on his low approval with voters, missteps during his first two years in office and his handling of the state budget as a reason for voters to change parties.
In one Republican mailing, the candidates who are actually running were barely mentioned. Instead, the governor was pictured amid newspaper articles about budget cuts, with a caption saying: "Jim McGreevey wants to elect a Democratic Legislature so he can keep raising taxes. Only you can stop him This year send Governor McGreevey as message. Vote Republican."
Republicans have denounced cuts in property tax rebates to homeowners, higher taxes on cigarettes, automobile fees and a lack in increased financing for suburban schools. The governor has also irked constituencies within his own party by first proposing to cut money for artistic and cultural programs, although mosrt of the funds were were ultimately restored. Educators in the state's poorest districts have also decried a lack of financing for their court-ordered programs.
Democrats believe the focus will backfire.
"It won't resonate," said Adam Green, communications director for the state Democratic Party. "Republicans are trying to make this election a referendum on the word 'McGreevey,' but they will not run against Democrats on the actual accomplishment we've had on issues." 
Mr. Green said that candidates who have been going door-to-door "have found no visceral reaction to Governor McGreevey," and he added that when it came to economic issues, "to the extent that people are attributing blame, they are just as willing to blame former Governor Whitman and President Bush."
It boils down to this: Republicans are looking at Mr. McGreevey and thinking they see James J. Florio, the last Democratic governor, who was voted out of office in 1993 after just one term for pushing a $2.8 billion tax increase through the State Legislature more than a decade ago. Before that election was over, Republicans also effectively turned voter angst against Democrats in general, regaining both houses of the state Legislature.
But while voters may not like Governor McGreevey, few political experts see the sentiment against him approaching the level of the anti-Florio years.
McGreevey Still Has Time
"The independents who traditionally decide elections are fairly well read and discerning and can be ticket splitters, but I don't think at this point I see any real anti-McGreevey sentiment that would translate against legislative candidates from his ownparty," said Mark Magyar, president of the Public Policy Center of New Jersey.
Mr. Magyar said that even if Democrats lose one house of the Legislature, Governor McGreevey still has two years -- an eternity in politics -- to bolster his image and make the case for his re-election.
Republicans, on the other hand, have a much harder task at hand. With less money coming in and crucial battles in districts that have historically leaned Democratic, they face a challenge trying to regain both legislative houses.
What makes the task more difficult for Republicans is the perception that the party has been devoid of leadership since the departure of several power brokers -- Governor Whitman; Donald DiFrancesco, the former acting governor and Senate president; former Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and former Representative Bob Franks. The post-election job facing Republicans -- whatever the outcome next month -- will be to shore up a new coalition to run their Senate caucus.
Yet far from helping other Republicans get elected, Mr. Bennett is having enough difficulty getting in a race that to this point is considered too close to call. 
In the spring, Mr. Bennett decided to seek re-election despite newspaper articles that raised questions about his billing practices as a municipal attorney, something that state and federal officials are still looking into. For his part, Mr. Bennett -- who has featured himself in campaign advertisements with an actual bulldog -- said he has unfairly become the target of the governor, who Mr. Bennett said is keeping an "enemies list" of prominent Republicans. 
The Democratic State Committee acknowledged it had hired a political consulting firm to compile information on the state's most prominent Republican leaders, though for "opposition research" and nothing more. 
Still, some of Mr. Bennett's problems have come from within his own party. In March, the Republican chairman of Monmouth County, William Dowd, said that there was a general agreement among local party officials that Mr. Bennett should not seek re-election. In the end, Mr. Bennett chose to stay in the race, easily defeating a primary challenger.
During his victory speech, he said he intended to frame the general election as a referendum on Governor McGreevey, adding that his Democratic challenger, Ellen Karcher, was "going to end up having Jim McGreevey on her arm, but I'm going to have the people of the 12th District on my arm." 
But in his own district, the strategy does not appear to be working. A recent survey conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University showed Ms. Karcher --the daughter of former Assembly Speaker Alan Karcher --running ahead of Mr. Bennett, 43 percent to 37 percent. This led Bruce Larson, a political science professor at the university, to conclude, "The issue shaping this election so far is not McGreevey, it is voters' perception of Bennett."
Interestingly, Mr. Bennett's race is crucial because only a few legislative districts are considered competitive enough to end up tilting the balance of power in the Legislature, and his is one of them.
In addition to Mr. Bennett's race 12th District, Republicans are working overtime for control of other seats as well. In the Fourth Legislative District, which includes Camden County, state Senator George F. Geist is going up against Fred Madden, a former acting superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, who along with the rest of his ticket has been the beneficiary of about $1.4 million in donations -- making this the state's most expensive contest. 
Republicans also want to hold onto their Senate seat in the 14th Legislative District in Mercer and Middlesex Counties. Although the district is predominantly Democratic, voters have looked favorably on state Senator Peter Inverso in the past, and his current challenger, Anthony Cimino, is not expected to unseat him. 
Democrats, on the other hand, want to hold onto their seats in Bergen County's 38th Legislative District and in the 36th District, which also includes Essex and Passaic Counties. In Bergen County, Assemblywoman Rose Heck, a Republican, is challenging Joseph Coniglio, the Democratic incumbent, in the hope of restoring some Republican rule to the county, which largely favored Democrats in the last election. In the 36th District, the Democrat, Paul Sarlo, is facing John Kelly, who lost in his last bid for the Senate in 2001.
Should Mr. Bennett prevail and his party either remain co-equals in the Senate or gain control outright, there is some possibility that the leadership roles could change. But some observers are wondering if there is any muscle -- or even the desire -- for such change in the party's leadership.
If Mr. Bennett is re-elected and wants to stay on, "it would be hard to deny him," said Steve Salmore, a former Republican consultant and research professor at Farleigh Dickinson University. "I don't see anyone who is going to organize the kind of take over coalition you need to establish take him out."
Perhaps Mr. Bennett is taking out an insurance policy, since he has already told Republicans that should he win, this will be his last term in office.
Once the midterm elections are out of the way and the parties cast their gaze on the governor's race -- considered the brass ring in state electoral politics --one of the most frequently mentioned of the possible Republican candidates is state Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr. To position himself carefully and avoid picking up any unneeded scar tissue, members of the party have been counseling Mr. Kean to seek a committee chairmanship rather than a Senate majority leadership role should Republicans win the Senate. 
Unlike most candidates, Mr. Kean -- the son of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who is still beloved by a wide swath of New Jersey voters -- does not need to improve his name recognition, said , Roger Bodman, a Republican lobbyist and onetime aide to the governor. "With the prominence of his name, he doesn't need to be Senate president," Mr. Bodman said. Instead, he can remain behind the scenes, working with colleagues and hammering out his own agenda. 
Besides, said Mr. Bodman, "you don't get that much out of the leadership role as you might think."
The worst possible scenario for Republicans would be for the party to lose its split control of the Senate, leaving little momentum as it headed into the governor's race. If that were to happen, the pressure would build among Republicans to find a new leader to rally the troops and start building momentum for 2005.
Republicans Face 'Real Trouble'
"This race is a real opportunity for the Republican Party to get back to parity if they can win at least one house," said Mr. Magyar. "If they don't, they're in real trouble."
To that end, Democrats are trying their hardest to persuade voters through costly television advertising to stay with their party. Indeed, as the election in New Jersey enters its final week, fundraising for legislative campaigns has reached record levels. 
"We're girding ourselves for a $2.5 million blitz on network television," said Bill Baroni a Republican who is challenging two Democrats, Gary Guear and Linda Greenstein, in the 14th Legislative District in Mercer County. 
For their part, Republicans insist the Democrats' tactic may backfire with voters because of the negative tone of the ads.
"Watching California commercials and watching New Jersey commercials is like watching the Disney Channel and then switching over to the Sci-Fi Channel," said Dale Florio, the Republican chairman of Somerset County. "The tone and the go-for-the-jugular approach is truly Garden State politics at its worst."
Still, Mr. Florio conceded that there was no real way of knowing whether the ads were catching on simply considered abrasive until Election Day. Historically, legislative races in New Jersey have been driven by local events.
But this year, besides the run-of-the-mill issues that are the mainstay of local campaigns, there are other factors at work. For instance, some districts are relatively new, having been redrawn after the 2000 Census. This is the second election since the districts were reconfigured, and Republicans wonder if some results in the last election were atypical, since voters were also selecting a governor. At the time, Mr. McGreevey was well ahead of his Republican challenger, Bret Schundler, in the polls.
The other factor making the race hard to predict are the various ethics charges that have been swirling. For instance, Assemblyman Michael J. Arnone, a Republican from Red Bank, has been criticized by Democrats who say readers of the state's legislative Web page were led to believe that he graduated from Seton Hall University. And in the 14th Legislative District, District, Assemblyman Gary Guear has been criticized for hiring his wife as consitituent services director, a job that pays $55,000 annually.
What experts cannot predict is how much these issues will affect the way people vote. Most agree that the tight races will largely come down to money and turning out the vote, an area in which Republicans concede that Democrats may have the upper hand.
"The huge factor here is that the Democrats appear to have extraordinary sums of money," said Mr. Florio. 
Reports released recently by the state's Election Law Enforcement Commission show Democrats well ahead of Republicans when it comes to raising money for this race; so far the Democratic State Committee has raised $14.5 million compared with just $3.7 million collected by the Republicans.
Yet for all the expense, the biggest challenge for both parties simply may be getting people to the polls. 
It appears as though the public has answered the New Jersey election this fall with a resounding yawn. These legislative midterm elections, sandwiched between the California recall race and the 1994 presidential election, don't seem to be capturing much attention, as far as pollsters can tell. Consultants predict that this could historically be one of the lowest turnouts in New Jersey history, with well under 30 percent of registered voters going to the polls.
"You know how it is the goal of every candidate to personally call every potential voter?" Mr. Florio said. "Well, this year you can actually do it."

Who Is Running? Go Online
WHAT do you mean there's an election coming?
For those who have been distracted, unaware or otherwise come up short in conversation about the statewide elections on Nov, 4, there is time -- and a way -- to get up to speed.
For the first time, New Jersey voters will be able to go to a Web site -- www.njvoterinfo.org -- which is being run by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University under the banner "Don't Give Them a Seat Until You Know Where They Stand."
When readers go to the site they will find information about the incumbents, their challengers, the districts in which they live, the major issues and recent newspapers articles about the races.
"Unfortunately, New Jerseyans have limited opportunities to get information about this election," said Ingrid Reed, director of the Eagleton Institute's New Jersey project. "Eagleton has created the first and only Web site that gives voters the information they need to make the election relevant and it has the enthusiastic support of the candidates."
Ms. Reed said the site would be updated through Election Day.

HEADLINE: How Much for That Professor? 

BYLINE:  By David L. Kirp; David L. Kirp, professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, is author of "Shakespeare, Einstein and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education."

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
It was big news in academe last winter when New York University bested Harvard and lured Niall Ferguson, the most widely discussed and controversial British historian of his generation, away from Oxford. But recruiting superstars was nothing new for the university. Its strategy has been to achieve world-class status by attracting a critical mass of top-flight faculty. An institution that was nearly bankrupt in the mid-1970's has become the success story inhigher education.
 Having mastered this frenzy of renown, New York University now wants to change the rules of the game, turning its prized collection of individual talents into citizens of the academic commonweal. In a widely circulated report, the university's president, John Sexton, has issued a "summons to engagement." It calls for the research faculty to spend more time with students inside and outside class, "engage with colleagues of differing views of expertise" -- even hobnob with alumni and participate in admissions. 
 The university, and academia in general, will be better off if Mr. Sexton can pull off this sea change -- a shift from "me, myself and I" entrepreneurship to participation in a genuine community of scholars. But unless other top-rank schools decide, improbably, to declare a truce in the star wars, his efforts are likely to fail. In higher education as elsewhere, competition, not the congregation, rules.
Stealing luminaries from other universities has long been regarded as a sure-fire way to climb the academic prestige ladder. In recent years, though, such talent searches have become more commonplace and the offers have grown more outsized. No one outside the world of education used to notice these comings and goings, but now the news media have turned professors into luminaries. 
It was big news in the business section of this newspaper when, a few years back, Columbia offered the economist Robert Barro the sun and the moon, and also carte blanche to hire five additional faculty members, in a bid to lure him from Harvard. (Mr. Barro initially accepted the offer, only to change his mind and remain in Cambridge.) Last year, the Cornel West soap opera made front pages around the country. Would the Harvard professor and hip-hop musician, his intellectual prowess challenged and his pride wounded by Harvard's impolitic president, decamp to Princeton? (Yes.)
As mobility in the senior ranks of faculty members has increased, so have the differences in compensation between the most sought-after professors -- those whom Mr. Sexton lauds as his "blue team" -- and the "gray team," everyone else. Trophy professors are wooed with outsized paychecks, splendid housing, travel allowances, well-endowed research centers, brilliant colleagues -- and the promise that they'll rarely encounter an undergraduate.
Other striving universities -- among them Rice, Georgia Tech and George Mason -- have gone on such star treks, though with mixed success. The newest combatant is the University of Southern California. In an explicit bid to become the next New York University, it has created a war chest of $100 million to recruit 100 luminaries in just three years, with a promise of more money and more star hires down the road. Already this attention-grabbing move is heating up the bidding wars.
What's good for a university's reputation, however, isn't necessarily good for its students' education. Since the standing of top-rung professors, their bankable asset, depends on what they write, not how they teach, their main loyalty isn't to their students or their institution. 
While Mr. Sexton says he is determined to turn this trend around at New York University, some recent initiatives there have reinforced this professorial narcissism. Take the university's philosophy department. In 1995, the department didn't even have a Ph.D. program. Just five years later it was rated as the top department in the web-based publication "The Philosophical Gourmet," the philosophers' version of the U.S. News & World Report college ranking and the bible for prospective graduate students.
A bevy of star hires has elevated the department's academic standing, and with it the university's. But the new recruits have only modest teaching responsibilities; especially in big undergraduate courses, the burden of teaching falls on graduate student instructors and adjunct faculty, higher education's replaceable parts. What's more, the newcomers are narrow-gauge specialists whose intellectual insularity -- a disengagement from both the classroom and the common public sphere -- presents a formidable obstacle to the neighborliness that Mr. Sexton now asks of his "blue team."
If all big research universities were to pledge not to use lightened teaching loads as a bargaining chip, a "common enterprise university" might stand a decent chance. But that's not how this blood sport is played. New York University knows this very well. Barely six months after the university stole him from Oxford, Niall Ferguson accepted an offer from Harvard, which for more than a century has made the poaching of star professors an art form.

HEADLINE: The Doughnut's Hole 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"As you ramble on through life, brother," goes advice on coffee shop walls, "whatever be your goal -- keep your eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole."
 That wisdom is at the heart of the compromise that may be struck in a Congressional conference on a low-premium prescription drug benefit for people over 65. 
 In the first bite of the doughnut, a senior would pay only one-fourth of his drug costs up to about $2,000. Then comes the hole: the next $2,000 or so of costs isn't covered at all. But then the doughnut gets delicious: the senior pays only 5 percent of all costs above that. Only the poor would get a free ride, but nobody would be wiped out by the cost of catastrophic illness. 
Other issues are yet to be resolved; conservatives (uncharacteristically) want high-income seniors to pay higher premiums, and liberals (typically) don't want private insurers competing with the government, offering the elderly a choice.
What bothers me in this healthy dickering is the move to encourage Americans -- including governors and mayors who should know better -- to buy U.S. drugs at half price or less in Canada and overseas where there are government controls on prices.
The price of most new prescription drugs is high in the U.S. mainly because it includes the producers' huge investment in scientific research. In Canada, the government strips out the cost of such research and imposes a low price ceiling. Shortsightedly, our pharmaceutical companies have meekly or greedily gone along with this foreign rip-off, picking up extra sales on a research investment already made.
But this foolish acceptance of foreign price controls means that the U.S. consumer is subsidizing the foreign consumer. Not being dopes, pursuing their economic interest, American bargain-hunters are now buying these drugs where they are sold cheaply -- outside the U.S. 
To counter this trend, our federal officials have been warning that imported drugs may be counterfeit or conflict with other drugs. That may scare some buyers, but most will take their chances. In reality, what with an open border and the Internet, sales will go to the cheapest seller. More Americans will join Canadians in buying drugs that do not support the cost of research into new drugs. 
Thus has Phanny Pharma outsmarted itself. By willingly cutting its prices to sell into price-controlled economies, not only has it invited American buyers to go where the bargains are, but it has also invited U.S. politicians to call for foreign prices on products bought by U.S. state and local governments. And there go billions in private capital and earnings needed for costly research into new cures and treatments.
How do we stop our subsidy to foreigners that cannibalizes our home market? No new federal laws are needed to deal with this economic inequity; our drug marketers should just apply the irrevocable law of supply and demand.
The tough-minded approach: Raise overseas sales prices to include the cost of research (which should lower prices here somewhat). If the Canadian government says no, let Canadians who want our products buy direct from the U.S. via Internet or mail at the price that pays for research, as Americans do. If Canada forbids that, let its legislators answer to citizens who want prescriptions filled. 
The tenderhearted approach: Our drug companies can accurately estimate the current Canadian-only prescription demand in Canada or elsewhere. They should restrict supply of those products at low prices to that level. When American purchasers compete with Canadians for that limited supply, price controls will come under pressure. Canada can then impose rationing, always unpopular in peacetime; or tolerate black markets; or lift its controls until U.S. bargain-hunters see no purpose in competing with Canadian buyers. 
History continually teaches us that free markets work best. Government price controls discourage production and competition, create shortages and breed corruption. That's the lesson we're trying to teach Iraqis; why can't the pharmaceutical houses -- as well as House and Senate conferees working to combine a costly new drug benefit with reform of Medicare -- grasp that lesson at home?
In this, the doughnut is research-driven innovation; the hole is controls. As you ramble on through life, brother . . .

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Falls for First Time in Years 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Donations to the country's largest charities in 2002 dropped for the first time in a dozen years, with some categories, like health and the arts, slipping by more than 20 percent, according to a survey by The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
 The nation's 400 biggest charities, ranked by how much they gather in money and gifts each year, collected a total of $46.9 billion worth of donations in 2002, compared with $47.5 billion in 2001, after adjusting for inflation. That is a drop of 1.2 percent, a notable departure from the average annual increase of 12 percent over the previous five years, the survey found. 
 Some causes inspired more giving than in previous years, like international relief organizations and those helping the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the survey showed. 
Even so, The Chronicle credited the overall decline in philanthropy to the tribulations of the stock market in 2002, a year in which the Standard & Poor's 500, a common measure of the market's health, fell 23 percent.
"A lot of donors are choosing between the one or two charities that matter to them most, as opposed to their top three or four," said Stacy Palmer, The Chronicle's editor. "So, the strategy that the charities are using is to become that No. 1 on their donor's list. They're trying to make their donors feel really special.' 
Colleges and universities, occupying 123 of the 400 slots in the survey and historically among the most savvy institutions when it comes to amassing donations, had a 3.3 percent drop in gifts last year. 
Some elite universities fared much worse, with a decline of 30 percent at Harvard, 29 percent at Emory, 26 percent at Yale and 24 percent at Columbia, the survey found. That is a far cry from flusher times, when surging portfolios helped inspire wealthy alumni and other donors to give more freely.
"Now we're seeing the flip side of the equation," said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents colleges. When private fund-raising goes down, he said, pressure builds for another revenue source to go up. "It's called tuition." 
Though a general economic malaise seemed to be the culprit for most of the declines, The Chronicle said, world events and the nation's political atmosphere bolstered giving to certain causes. 
Perceived threats to the nation's natural resources, like the proposal to drill for oil in the Alaskan wilderness, helped to increase donations to environmental groups by 4.5 percent, Ms. Palmer said.
Controversial domestic policies like the Patriot Act, which started a debate over civil liberties, fueled an 18 percent increase in donations to public affairs groups on both sides of the political spectrum, she added. 
Violence in Israel contributed to a 7.5 percent rise in gifts to Jewish associations, Ms. Palmer said, while growing awareness of the plight of the poor and those displaced by military actions like the war in Afghanistan increased giving to international organizations by 10.4 percent. 
Donations stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks helped push up contributions to human service organizations by 15 percent and to large branches of the United Way by 28.6 percent. Such giving was enough to place the American National Red Cross and its Sept. 11 fund in the top fund-raising slot, bumping out the Salvation Army for the first time in the survey's 12-year history. 
Still, certain categories of giving suffered significant declines, most notably arts and cultural organizations, which had a 26.5 percent decrease. Some of that loss can be explained by exceptionally large one-time gifts the year before, The Chronicle said, which made the drop seem more dramatic.
Donations to hospitals crept up, but support for health awareness and research organizations waned considerably. On average, giving to health groups like the American Heart Association and the American Institute for Cancer Research fell 22.7 percent, and neither The Chronicle nor the groups said they knew exactly why this category had fared so poorly.

HEADLINE: In a Concrete City, Fruit of the Land; 
Buying Clubs Help New York Forge Farm-to-Table Connection

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
A lot of things are making it harder these days to bond with one's broccoli. 
 The convenience of prepared foods and the siren song of takeout can lure even ardent cooks away from the stove. The raging controversies of modern agriculture, meanwhile, from bioengineering to pesticides, can make serving fresh vegetables feel complicated and questionable. And in many lower-income New York City neighborhoods, good produce is not even an option. Green markets tend to be concentrated where there is green to be spent. 
 But in tiny ways and still small numbers, a response is emerging in New York around an old and half-forgotten word in the urban food lexicon: harvest. 
At least 6,000 New Yorkers, including many in the poorer parts of the city, have joined together in buying clubs in just the last few years to get organic vegetables fresh from the farm throughout the growing season. They get bags of leeks and tomatoes in the mix one week, squash and radishes the next. Farmers from around the region, trundling their crops into neighborhoods like Harlem or East New York, Brooklyn, are meeting their customers face to face.
Both sides of this culinary crossing say they are being changed.
Mike and Cheryl Rogowski, a brother-and-sister farming team from Warwick, N.Y., who began selling their organic produce to mostly Hispanic buying clubs in Brooklyn four years ago, altered their mix of crops to meet the new demand. Subscribers wanted different kinds of beets, more cilantro and more peppers. The Rogowskis now grow 50 different kinds of chilies.
Food club buyers, for their part, say they are being forced to learn, or relearn, that seasons and weather have significance beyond the adjustment of a thermostat. Nature's whims of heat and precipitation dictate weekly vegetable mixes that vary in concert with what has taken root and what has delivered fruit.
"It's become an education in how to live with the land and not expect instant gratification," said Nora Bock, who helped start a buying group last year in her building on East 28th Street in Manhattan.
But there is more at stake in these farm-to-table clubs than ripe tomatoes or environmentally friendly farm techniques. The concept, called community supported agriculture, or C.S.A. in farm-club jargon, aims, simply but profoundly, to restore a sense of place to the food that people eat. Knowing exactly where those carrots came from and who grew them makes people think differently and eat differently, nutritionists and organizers say.
Even the sense of time can be affected. Some social theorists who specialize in the cultural connections of food say they think that the harried, time-starved American who craves kitchen convenience above all else is at least partly a marketing creation of a food industry eager to sell its profitable, but often unhealthy, prepared and processed products. The weekly vegetable subscription that comes from participating in a C.S.A. club, they say, short-circuits that marketing pitch.
Vegetables, in short, are not always convenient. In the C.S.A. universe, this constitutes a selling point.
"We've been sold a bill of goods about convenience in American life," said Alice Julier, a sociologist at Smith College and the president of the Association for the Study of Food and Human Society. "Convenience marketing has shifted people's tastes so that eating fresh from the farm is almost something that people need to be re-educated about -- what vegetables are and what different apples taste like." 
But the effort to push produce clubs in New York City is also an overt economic and political calculation. 
A nonprofit group called the Glynwood Center, founded in the mid-1990's in Cold Spring, N.Y., with the goal of helping communities plan and preserve open space, has worked to connect farmers and urban buying groups, arguing that economically healthy farmers will stay in business, thus preserving farmland. Food buyers with emotional connections to farmers, the group's leaders say, are also more likely to favor open-land preservation next time the subject comes up. 
Today, at a ceremony in Manhattan, the group plans to give out its first Glynwood Harvest awards to groups and individuals around the country that are advancing that agenda. Recipients include the Rogowskis and a small nonprofit organization in Manhattan called Just Food, which was formed in 1995 to push community supported agriculture in the city.
Glynwood's president, Judith LaBelle, said that building bridges on the basis of food was a powerful tool, with benefits that spiral in every direction -- from public health to environmentalism.
"It creates a new market for farmers," she said, "and a new constituency as well that will understand and support farmers." 
Hardly anyone is anticipating that New York City will become the nation's veggie-crunching capital. 
The C.S.A. movement began expanding in the United States in the mid-1980's and came to the city later. Some experts trace its roots to an effort by a group of women in Japan in the 1960's to find pesticide-free foods. Places like Berkeley, Calif., and Madison, Wis., food experts say, are probably at the vanguard. Smaller cities in the Northeast, where farms are closer at hand, have also had access to organic-food-buying clubs for years. 
But the numbers are increasing.
Of the estimated 1,000 C.S.A. groups across the nation, 28 are in New York City, up from 19 over the last two years, according to figures from Just Food and csacenter.org, a Web site that encourages and tracks the trend. On average, a seasonal share for a family costs about $350 to $400, although many groups also sell half-shares and have discounts for low-income buyers.
"People tend to be more disconnected from their food sources here than in other cities -- and there are a lot of competing interests," said Ruth Katz, the executive director of Just Food. The physical distances between residents and farmers are great, she said, and the psychological distances can be even greater. "If we have a smaller percentage of residents than other places, it might be that we have more hurdles."
And maybe a few more culinary novices as well. Many of the city's C.S.A. clubs invite cooks in during the weekly vegetable pickup to give advice to people who might be mystified or intimidated by that bristly bunch of bok choy that was just dropped into their bag. 
Some members admit they have been perplexed more than once by the barrage of things with cores and seeds and shells and husks and peels and pits that the farmers delivered.
"Truthfully, some of these things -- I didn't even know what they were. Collard greens -- I'd never had collard greens," said Audrey Goffin, an antiques consultant in Manhattan who recently joined a Midtown vegetable club. "But I was forced to learn, and I enjoyed the challenge."
Cooking lessons can also stave off monotony during those periods of the harvest season when some of the same vegetables show up week after week, said Tina Fuchs, who organized a buying group three years ago at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, partly to encourage heart-healthy diets among hospital employees and local residents.
"By the fourth or fifth week, you're really looking for a new way to cook it," she said.
Fatima Shama, who was picking up her vegetables last week on Manhattan's East Side -- her farm's final delivery for the season -- said she knew exactly what she was going to do with her mix: prepare a vegetable potpourri that her mother used to make called Crazy Kid Soup. 
The virtue of the soup, she said, as she weighed out her two-pound allotment of blue and yellow potatoes and packed her bunches of scallions and carrots, is that it will accommodate any and all improvisation. 
"It's the luck of the draw," she said. "So I have to be creative."
Some farmers who participate in buying clubs say they have been surprised by how fervently city people have reached back to them as the clubs have taken root.
Members have organized weekend trips to visit their farm. The Rogowskis often have a barbecue picnic when subscribers come by, and sometimes offer cooking classes.
"This is not for every farmer -- it's a very different way of life, very people-oriented," Ms. Rogowski said. "These people know where you live, and they don't hesitate to knock on your door, and if you don't have the personality to meet with them one on one, it won't work."
Farmers and club members say that the key to their dialogue is that despite everything -- the fading of family farms, the ever faster pace of urban life, the endless choices of the convenience culture -- the land and the things that spring from it still carry a mystique.
"I like to think a lot of people still have a farming gene rattling around in their DNA somewhere," said Steve Gilman, the owner of Ruckytucks Farm in Stillwater, N.Y., who has worked with buying clubs in nearby Saratoga. "People find themselves in office jobs, but they still keep plants on their window sills, and I think they still want to experience, in some way, the farm life."

HEADLINE: More Needy Seeking Help From the State 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
New York's public assistance rolls, in steep decline since the start of welfare reform seven years ago, have begun to climb in recent months. The increase so far is modest, but officials worry that the trend is long term and that the implications may be costly.
 The increase is due in part to a sharp rise in the number of people who have reached the five-year limit on federal benefits and are now signing up for a state program called Safety Net Assistance. The city and state bear the full costs of the program, which pays clients the same amount as federal welfare but for an unlimited amount of time. 
 In some respects, the growth of the Safety Net Assistance program is the realization of a fear that many city and state officials shared when federal welfare reform was enacted in 1996. The state Constitution obligates local governments to continue to take care of all who are needy without regard to a time limit. That means that the most troubled, hobbled and entrenched must eventually be covered on the local dime.
As the consequences of having no time limit catch up with the state, which covers 50 percent of local welfare costs, officials are starting to think hard about what, if anything, new they can do for or about those families who pass five years and still require or cling to assistance. 
"We are very concerned," said Patricia M. Smith, first deputy commissioner of New York City's Human Resources Administration, which administers the program. "These are families that have been with us over five years. Why were we not able to assist them to self-sufficiency?"
For the 2004 fiscal year, the city will pay about $60 million to support families who have exhausted their federal benefits and moved to the state rolls, according to the Independent Budget Office. As part of the 1996 reform, the city is required by federal law to spend a fixed amount on welfare even as the caseload drops, thus the $60 million is not as bad as it sounds because it comes from the fixed sum. But it could be used for child care, job training and other supports for working welfare recipients. 
As of August, about 41,000 families had moved to Safety Net Assistance after passing the five-year limit for federal welfare -- enough that the city is beginning to get a picture of these families. For instance, a third are employed at least part time, yet still earn little enough to qualify for aid. This is at least partly because families on Safety Net Assistance are on average larger than families receiving federal welfare benefits, so they must earn more to keep the refrigerator stocked and the rent paid.
But city officials say there is another sizable group of families who do not seem to have any reason that their caseworkers deem serious enough to keep them from participating in the welfare-to-work effort. More than 13 percent of families on Safety Net have lost some percentage of their benefit for not cooperating with city work and training requirements -- almost double the number of families who have not hit their five-year limit for federal benefits. An additional 10 percent have been threatened with losing some part of their Safety Net benefits for noncooperation and are appealing.
Lately, city welfare administrators are fuming that there is little they can do to get these people to comply, because New York State regulations will not allow them to stop the Safety Net benefit completely. The stiffest penalty the city can impose is to withhold a mother's portion of the benefit. Thus, a mother of four would lose a fifth of the benefit. A mother of one, however, would lose half. "We would like more tools," Ms. Smith said.
Advocates for the poor see danger in this kind of talk. They say that too many people have already been thrown off the rolls because of bureaucratic error and that it is unrealistic to expect the least educated of the population to find work in the current economy. An advocacy group based in Brooklyn, Families United for Racial and Economic Equality, says Genease Jerido, 43, of Staten Island, is one of those people who would be hurt by stricter regulation.
Ms. Jerido began receiving public assistance in 1981 when she first had children. She was converted to Safety Net more than a year ago. For a brief time recently, she was employed by the New York City Parks Department as a seasonal worker, she says, but rising blood pressure forced her to leave the job. Ms. Jerido, who never finished high school, says the bad economy has hurt her ability to get other work. "I sent out a couple of resumes but haven't heard back from anybody," she said. "And mostdon't pay enough to pay my bills and rent anyway." She thinks she will certainly be on public assistance a while longer. 
The acting commissioner of the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, Robert Doar, supports giving the state and local governments the authority to end benefits to a family for whom partial sanctions have failed. "Those policies are in existence in other states, and other states's commissioners say they are successful without causing harm," he said. The point, he insists, is not to punish but to prod.
Sonia Morales, 48, of the Bronx, was on and off public assistance for more than 13 years before she was transferred to the Safety Net program in June. She contends that health problems, which she says include three heart attacks, diabetes, asthma, depression, anxiety attacks and heel spurs, should exempt her from working. For many years the city, which she says lost her medical file at least once, did not agree.
In 2000, the city tried to force her into a work program in the parks, but Ms. Morales bluntly refused -- not just because she was sick but because she felt it was exploitative. "I was not going to kill myself to be a slave," she said. "I am sorry."
For a brief period she was a telemarketer for Verizon but was fired, she says, when her calls did not produce enough sales. Ms. Morales says that by then her grant had dropped to $14.10 every two weeks and eventually she could not pay for her apartment and became homeless. Through the city's homeless program, she got an apartment in the Bronx a year ago, and through a new Human Resources Administration initiative, she is temporarily exempted from looking for work because of her ailments.
But Ms. Morales says she has resigned herself to needing long-term Safety Net benefits, which for her include rental assistance and $91 every two weeks. "I wish I could go back to work so bad, but because of my health problems and their stupidness," she said, referring to welfare administrators, "they have made me too nervous and anxious inside."

HEADLINE: Wage Increases Giving Economy Unexpected Lift 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Wage increases for employees at almost all income levels are giving important and unexpected support to the nation's economy. If the gains continue, they offer hope that the rapid economic expansion of recent months could prove more durable than other spurts of growth over the last two years.
 Forecasters expect the Commerce Department to say in its quarterly report on Thursday that the economy grew about 6 percent in the three-month period ending in September, which would be the fastest pace since 1999. Most of that growth stemmed from a sharp rise in consumer spending, driven largely by a continuing boom in mortgage refinancing and checks that were mailed out as part of the recent tax cut. 
 With those forces receding and business spending still slack, the economy will depend increasingly on regular paychecks, analysts say. Hourly wages have already surprised most economists by growing more quickly than inflation since 2001 in spite of the worst decline in employment in 20 years. 
The wage gains have not been enough to overcome the economy's problems, however. Many families still have less income than they did a year ago because companies have reduced their workers' hours, and health care costs have risen rapidly. But economists say that the wage raises have provided a buffer, allowing consumer spending to continue rising every quarter for the last 12 years, according to the Commerce Department.
The contradictory mix of high unemployment with fast growth and resilient wages is part of the conundrum that the Federal Reserve will face tomorrow, when its monetary policy committee meets to set interest rates.
Fed officials have signaled that they will keep short-term rates at just 1 percent and repeat their cautious economic outlook because they remain worried about the slow pace of job growth and the risk of a deflationary price spiral. 
According to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group, hourly wages have increased more sharply than at any time since early 2002 -- more than 2 percent, after being adjusted for inflation -- for a median of about $14 an hour.
Another government survey suggests that wage growth is falling but remains above the annual inflation rate, which is roughly 2 percent. Wage increases trailed inflation for long periods during the 1980's and early 90's.
"What seems to be happening is that companies that are staying in business want to hold onto the people they have," Stephen R. Sleigh, director of strategic resources at the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which has negotiated annual pay increases of more than 3 percent on most recent contracts. "It's a very unusual labor market right now."
As companies have reacted to the increasing competition of a global economy and figured out how they can use technology smartly, they have become more efficient in recent years, ending decades of slow productivity growth. This productivity surge has contributed to the lack of hiring since 2001, because companies can make more goods without adding new workers, but it has also left a larger amount of revenue to be split between hourly wages and corporate profits.
"We all talk about the dark side of productivity growth," Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said. "This is the positive side. Companies couldn't afford to pay more if they weren't getting more out of their workers."
With the help of the money from refinancing and the tax cut, retail sales surged last month; Gap, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and other chains reported some of their best results since last year.
The increase in wages "has been a hallmark of the last several years and a cushion for the consumer," Mr. Berner said. "It's an important and often overlooked aspect of what's going on."
Thursday's report on economic growth will offer clear political advantages for the White House, adding legitimacy to its argument that the recent tax cut has turned around the economy. But many economists, including some at the Fed, caution that major parts of the current growth spurt are unsustainable.
Laurence H. Meyer, an economist and a former Fed governor, estimates that the combination of tax cuts and bigger government spending, mostly for the military, essentially doubled the pace of economic growth in the third quarter, to 6 percent from 3 percent. But Mr. Meyer said that that effect is already wearing off and that the fiscal policy will actually become a drag on growth by the end of next year.
Interest rates are also likely to rise as the economy recovers, as John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, pointed out in closely followed remarks last week. That could cause a big decline in mortgage refinancing.
The best hope for a run of solid economic growth that lasts more than a few months, which has not happened since the late 90's, lies in corporate America, where many executives remain too circumspect to invest significantly in new buildings, equipment or technology. Should that change, employment could begin growing at a healthy rate again and income and consumer spending could rise with it, creating a virtuous cycle, economists say.
The economy added jobs in September for the first time since January, but the new hiring was not strong enough to cause a drop in the unemployment rate. 
The key is "the whole hand-off from consumers to business," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup. "The business sector has to promote growth by restocking, hiring, advertising, contributing to income growth," he said.
Most forecasters predict that the current recovery will take hold, even if the gaudy growth of the third quarter does not last. 
But Wall Street and government economists have repeatedly been too optimistic over the last two years, and a few analysts remain concerned that companies are still working off the excess of the late-90's bubble in stock prices and technology spending.
If employment does not begin growing at a healthy pace soon, the wage increases will probably not last, many economists say. Changes in pay often lag otherparts of the economy.
The recent wage increases appear to grow out of both the sharp recent increases in the nation's productivity and the relative strength of the labor market, compared with its condition in the aftermath of other recessions. 
With the jobless rate at 6.1 percent last month, compared with a peak of almost 11 percent during the 80's, companies also have less bargaining power than they had during other periods of slow economic growth. A survey of employers by Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm, found that they plan to pay average salary increases of 3.4 percent next year, up from 3.2 percent this year.
SAS, a software maker based in Cary, N.C., has reduced the amount of money it pays to employees from its profit-sharing plan as business has weakened in the last two years. But SAS has increased salaries 4 to 5 percent a year on average, with most of the raises going to the employees whom executives fear losing the most, said Jeff Chambers, vice president of human resources at the company, which employs 5,000 people in this country.
"We've made money available to people who have the magic -- the critical performers in the critical roles," Mr. Chambers said.
Other significant pay increases this year have included raises of almost 10 percent for public school teachers and administrators in Washington and raises of almost 30 percent for nurses, who are still in high demand nationwide, at Tenet Healthcare.
But the picture is hardly uniform. Airline and steel workers have agreed to pay cuts as their companies struggle to avoid or emerge from bankruptcy. In August, President Bush announced that he was cutting the raises of more than one million federal workers, to 2 percent from 2.7 percent, to help pay for military actions and to avoid the need for other spending cuts.
Over all, workers at the very bottom of the income distribution are among the only ones whose hourly wages have trailed inflation recently. Congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997, and its buying power has been slowly eroded by inflation. 
Workers in the middle have received somewhat larger increases than those at the top, according to Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Men's wages grew in the third quarter of 2003 for the first time in a year, Mr. Bernstein said, based on his analysis of a survey of households conducted by the Census Bureau.

HEADLINE: Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H. 

 BODY:
A few things stand out about this unprepossessing city. It just broke its own Guinness Book world record for the most lighted jack-o'-lanterns with 28,952. It claims to have the world's widest Main Street.
 And recently, Keene became the home of Justin Somma, a 26-year-old freelance copywriter from Suffern, N.Y., and a foot soldier in an upstart political movement. That movement, the Free State Project, aims to make all of New Hampshire a laboratory for libertarian politics by recruiting libertarian-leaning people from across the country to move to New Hampshire and throw their collective weight around. Leaders of the project figure 20,000 people would do the trick, and so far 4,960 have pledged to make the move. 
 The idea is to concentrate enough fellow travelers in a single state to jump-start political change. Members, most of whom have met only over the Internet, chose New Hampshire over nine other states in a heated contest that lasted months. 
(The other contenders were Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. One frequently asked question on the project's Web site was "Can't you make a warmer state an option?")
Once here, they plan to field candidates in elections and become active in schools and community groups, doing all they can to sow the libertarian ideals of curbing taxes, minimizing regulation of guns and drugs, privatizing schools and reducing government programs.
"We want to make New Hampshire our home, and we want to make it a better place for everybody," said Elizabeth McKinstry, a project spokeswoman. "Many times government gets in the way."
One appeal of New Hampshire is the state's reputation for flinty individualism (although it has only about 400 dues-paying Libertarian Party members). The 150 Free Staters already living here lobbied hard for the state, and Gov. Craig Benson, a Republican, met with visiting members and told them to "come on up, we'd love to have you."
If the idea catches on, the movement may benefit from the unusually high political profile New Hampshire has because of its early presidential primary.
Some Free Staters plan to move when the project attracts 20,000 participants, which it hopes to do by 2006. But many intend to move sooner, and a few have already arrived.
"Having so many people move into a state means we can really raise issues," Mr. Somma said. "Once we start to elect people to the Statehouse, I think the low-hanging fruit will be issues like educational reform and medical marijuana."
Keene, a college town of 24,000, is not the only Free Stater destination in New Hampshire. Indeed, as many members acknowledge, one quandary for a movement of individualistic people is that it can be hard to get everyone on the same page.
Devera Morgan and her husband, Bruce, a computer consultant, plan to move soon from Royse City, Tex., possibly to far-north Coos County or the White Mountain town of North Conway. "I didn't think I would ever leave Texas; that's how much I believe in this project," said Ms. Morgan, 34, who wants to lift restrictions on home schooling and says she may run for office in New Hampshire. 
Although Jackie Casey had voted for Wyoming, she just moved from Portland, Ore., to Merrimack, between Nashua and Manchester, renting a basement apartment with her cat, Soopa Doopa Hoopa, and her two 9-millimeter handguns. (She wants a machine gun "or at least a rifle" for Christmas.) She has already hung one wall and her bathroom with framed posters of Frank Zappa, who was a libertarian himself.
"I don't like to go places that don't let me have my gun," said Ms. Casey, 33, who sells memberships to a Las Vegas survivalist training institute and models for comic books (her likeness has graced the cover of one called Reload). Her New Hampshire plans include starting eight businesses "because nine out of every 10 fail, and I've already started two, so I need to do eight more."
"I want to be a billionaire in my lifetime," she added, "and I don't want to live among people who think that's bad."
One project member chose the tiny town of Freedom. Also planning to move to New Hampshire are two candidates for the 2004 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.
Some project members favor zeroing in on one county or town to maximize their influence, and are scouting out about 30 communities light on property taxes and strictures like building codes. "We completely support and respect that," Ms. McKinstry said. "We just would never dictate to people."
The Free State has its opponents here, and shoulder shruggers too.
"If you've got people saying we just want to mind our own business, keep government out of our lives, hey, we all feel that way," said Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. "But if they want to have a radical change in our form of government, no, you're not welcome here."
Michael Blastos, Keene's Democratic mayor, said he was not concerned because Keene had too little housing to accommodate many newcomers, and "anything at all that would stimulate the voters and get them stirred up is a good thing."
Linda Fowler, a government professor at Dartmouth, called the project a "gimmick" and dismissed "the idea that 20,000 people are going to make a critical difference in New Hampshire, a state of a million and a half people with very high voter participation."
But, she said, "I suppose if they really did produce 20,000 people, then that might provide a margin in some legislative elections in some parts of the state."
That seems to be exactly what the project has in mind, according to an article by its founder, Jason Sorens, a political science lecturer at Yale.
"When we arrive in our state, we will have to do our best to blend in, lay down roots in the community, and slowly build our individual reputations," he wrote. "If we come in trumpeting an 'abolish-everything' platform, we will make enemies out of people who might otherwise be sympathetic to us. The key idea behind the F.S.P. is that for every activist, we will be able to generate several voters."
Dr. Sorens wrote that "within about 10 years after our move, we should have people in the state legislature and we should have entrenched political control of several towns and counties." He added that "once we have control of the county sheriffs' offices, we can order federal law enforcement agents out, or exercise strict supervision of their activities," and "once we have obtained some success in the state legislature, we can start working on the governor's race."
New Hampshire's constitution guarantees the "right of revolution" if "the ends of government are perverted and public liberty manifestly endangered."
But that is not their intention, Ms. McKinstry said, pointing to their mascot, a porcupine -- "a friendly little forest creature who doesn't harm anyone else, minds his own business, but is not really someone that you want to mess with or you might get stuck and a little ouchy."
Dr. Sorens, 26, said the project reflected his upbringing in Houston as the son of a single mother who pulled herself out of poverty with help from relatives and a Christian charity. He also drew on the migration of the Mormons, the journey of the Pilgrims and the movement of many liberal-minded people to Vermont in the 1970's.
Free Staters, many of them college graduates under 50 earning $60,000 or more, were looking for a state that was small (fewer than 1.5 million people), with low campaign spending, so Free State candidates could compete.
New Hampshire's lack of income tax and sales tax, relatively healthy economy, liberal gun laws and proximity to Boston helped. A big plus was its legislature, the country's largest with 417 members and a state representative for roughly every 3,000 people.
"In New Hampshire, there's so many elected positions that anyone can become cemetery trustee or dog catcher," Ms. McKinstry said.
About 1,000 project members opted out of moving to New Hampshire, largely for geographic reasons, and Dr. Sorens said the project might eventually designate a second free state out west. Ultimately, he said, he hopes for regional chapters and a new political party with broader appeal than the Libertarian Party.
So far, Free Staters range along the libertarian spectrum, some more moderate than others.
Ms. Casey advocates eliminating entitlements because "then you'd only attract immigrants who are hard-working people." She said: "I radically oppose public education. It's demeaning and it creates criminals." And she says "the thing that hurts poor people is they don't know how to think of themselves as rich."
Mr. Somma doesn't argue against public schools, but maintains that they get too much money, which is good only "if you have to have nice school buildings and computers and all that." "Back in the day," he said, "they didn't need all that to teach kids. Back in the day, you were sitting around on rocks and listening to a guy talk."
Mr. Somma, who grew up in Brooklyn, confessed that he and his wife moved for lifestyle reasons, too, not just political ones.
Otherwise, he said, "I could never pitch to my parents, my wife: Listen, here's this group of people going to move to another state, and I'm going with them."

A City Seeks Its Identity Atop a Spire Of Debate

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The last few decades did not go well for this city 30 miles south of Seattle. It was always the lesser city on Puget Sound: smelly, crumbling Tacoma; hometown of Ted Bundy, serial killer; a dusty, dying, pulp-mill mudhole with an understandable ego problem.
 But life here began to look up a few years ago. The pulp mills, culprits in the famously putrid "aroma of Tacoma," were shut long ago. And while other engines of the economy, like Sears and several department stores, left in the 1960's and 1970's, other businesses are moving in. 
 A multimillion-dollar revitalization of downtown is under way. Along the waterfront, hip lofts, sleek museums and a theater district have replaced burned-out warehouses and abandoned mills. The city of nearly 200,000 people is beginning to thrive.
The question remains, though: Can they build the Tower of Tacoma?
And if so, can a 400-foot-tall spire shrouded in controversy rise above the sparse Tacoma skyline to save this city's soul?
That may sound melodramatic. But proponents of the plan to build the tower, an elongated pyramid that would look like a shorter Washington Monument in stainless-steel mesh and glass, like to point out that a lot of Parisians hated Eiffel's idea, too. The French found Gustave Eiffel's vision for what was, in the late 1800's, supposed to be a temporary tower distasteful and a crushing insult to the high art and history of France.
Granted, Tacoma is no Paris. But closer to home, Seattle's landmark Space Needle was denounced by skeptics who said it looked like a "U.F.O. on a stick" before it was completed in 1962, spire supporters said. The Space Needle is 605 feet, which is, not surprisingly, substantially higher -- by 205 feet -- than the proposed Tower of Tacoma. The spire would be the city's tallest structure, visible from Interstate 5, the main freeway through here. The most prominent landmark seen from the freeway now is the Tacoma Dome, a sports and entertainment complex that looks like a giant white blob.
Many Tacomans say the spire, which is expected to cost about $7 million and would stand beside the Tacoma convention center now under construction, sounds like a big waste of money. They also suspect some Space Needle envy is behind the desire for the spire.
"Tacoma and Seattle have always been in competition," said Vicki Trout, 49, who grew up in East Tacoma and runs a Web-site promotion business here. "Seattle always looks down on Tacoma, and this spire makes us seem like we're trying to have a Space Needle."
Ms. Trout is one of many Tacoma residents who have voiced loud opposition to public financing of the spire. Responding to the criticism, the City Council recently put off a vote on whether to finance the tower at all.
Another spire critic is Neko Case, the alt-country singer, who grew up in Tacoma and paid tribute to her hometown in a 2000 song titled "Thrice All American," a reference to the city's being named an All American City three times.
"I want to tell you about my hometown," the lyrics begin.
It's a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound
Well, the factories churn and the timber's all cut down
And life goes by slow in Tacoma
People they laugh when they hear you're from my town
They say it's a sour and used-up old place
I defended its honor, shrugged off the putdowns.
Ms. Case, 33, moved away in 1994 and now lives in Chicago. She heard about the spire situation recently.
"Tacoma needs money for other things," Ms. Case said in a telephone interview. "It's such a great place and people don't realize what they have. They don't realize how great it is, how beautiful it is. Tacoma has so many beautiful buildings and landmarks that are crumbling."
Supporters say the spire would not only beautify the skyline but also raise money from tourists visiting the observation decks and people having parties and weddings there.
Tower supporters say the plan is not dead. They say they hope to win the public's support for the spire before November 2004, the expected completion date for the Greater Tacoma Convention Center, to take advantage of the construction crews now working on the center.
The chief designer of the spire, Wyn Bielaska, a Canadian architect whose work includes the new and popular Museum of Glass in Tacoma, remains optimistic.
"The political climate is a bit messy right now," Mr. Bielaska said. "The dilemma of a lot of American cities is that after 5 p.m., the city is dead, everyone goes home and there is no life downtown. We're trying to change that."
Mr. Bielaska added: "Icons make a city memorable. Look at the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument: these things build pride in people."
City Councilman Doug Miller, who supports building the spire, said residents who opposed it were understandably "beaten down" and mistrustful of government officials, in light of recent municipal scandals: the murder-suicide case involving the police chief, David Brame, who shot his estranged wife and then himself last April, and an investigation into corruption in local government. 
"I just think people aren't ready to feel good about themselves again," Mr. Miller said. "This could be our Eiffel Tower. Or it could also be the Eiffel Tower that never was."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about debate in Tacoma, Wash., over whether to build a 400-foot tower as part of an effort to rejuvenate the city referred incorrectly to two local businesses. The city still has a pulp mill and two Sears stores; they have not left.

HEADLINE: There's A Catch: Jobs 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The president tells us the economy is accelerating, and the statistics seem to bear him out. But don't hold your breath waiting for your standard of living to improve. Bush country is not a good environment for working families.
 In the real world, which is the world of families trying to pay their mortgages and get their children off to college, the economy remains troubled. While the analysts and commentators of the comfortable class are assuring us that the president's tax cuts and the billions being spent on Iraq have been good for the gross domestic product, the workaday folks are locked in a less sanguine reality. 
 It's a reality in which:
* The number of Americans living in poverty has increased by three million in the past two years.
* The median household income has fallen for the past two years.
* The number of dual-income families, particularly those with children under 18, has declined sharply.
The administration can spin its "recovery" any way it wants. But working families can't pay their bills with data about the gross domestic product. They need the income from steady employment. And when it comes to employment, the Bush administration has compiled the worst record since the Great Depression.
The jobs picture is far more harrowing than it is usually presented by the media. Despite modest wage increases for those who are working, the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, which represents almost nine million people. Millions more have become discouraged and left the labor market. And there are millions of men and women who are employed but working significantly fewer hours than they'd like.
Jared Bernstein, a senioreconomist at the Economic Policy Institute, has taken a look at the hours being worked by families, rather than individuals. It's a calculation that gets to the heart of a family's standard of living.
The declines he found were "of a magnitude that's historically been commensurate with double-digit unemployment rates," he said. It was not just that there were fewer family members working. The ones who were employed were working fewer hours.
According to government statistics, there are nearly 4.5 million people working part-time because they have been unable to find full-time work. In many cases, as the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas noted in a recent report, the part-time worker is "earning far less money than his or her background and experience warrant -- i.e. a computer programmer working at a coffee shop."
Economists expect some modest job creation to occur over the next several months. But there's a "just in time for the election" quality to the current economic surge, and even Republicans are worried that the momentum may not last. The president has played his tax-cut card. The spending on Iraq, most Americans fervently hope, will not go on indefinitely. And President Bush's own Treasury secretary is talking about an inevitable return to higher interest rates.
Where's the jobs creation miracle in this dismal mix?
Meanwhile, these are some of the things working (and jobless) Americans continue to face:
* Sharply increasing local taxes, including property taxes.
* Steep annual increases in health care costs.
* Soaring tuition costs at public and private universities.
Families are living very close to the edge economically. And this situation is compounded, made even more precarious, by the mountains of debt American families are carrying -- mortgages, overloaded credit cards, college loans, etc.
The Bush administration has made absolutely no secret of the fact that it is committed to the interests of the very wealthy. Leona Helmsley is supposed to have said that "only the little people pay taxes." The Bush crowd has turned that into a national fiat.
A cornerstone of post-Depression policy in this country has been a commitment to policies aimed at raising the standard of living of the poor and the middle class. That's over.
When it comes to jobs, taxes, education and middle-class entitlement programs like Social Security, the message from the Bush administration couldn't be clearer: You're on your own.

Investors Take a Dim View Of Cablevision's Strategy
Wall Street has long been skeptical of efforts by the chairman of Cablevision Systems, Charles F. Dolan, to start a satellite service to compete with the established services EchoStar and DirecTV.
 So investors might have been expected to welcome the news that Cablevision would split in two and that the service, Rainbow DBS, would be off Cablevision's balance sheet. But investors evidently found other reasons to worry about Cablevision and its shares fell 9 percent the day after the announcement. Market Place. Page C2.

As the holidaysapproach, online retailers seek to spiff up their sites and minimize consumer frustration.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
E-TAILING'S annual dress rehearsal is under way.
 Online retailers are engaged in a flurry of operational and cosmetic enhancements that they hope will propel them through this holiday season -- and repeat the year-end spikes of recent years -- while turning new visitors into long-term customers. 
 Analysts say the efforts are improving online shopping for millions of consumers, who this holiday season will be doing business with an industry that increasingly understands how to help customers shop with a minimum of frustration.
"The good sites these days are definitely much better than we've seen over the past five years," said Harley Manning, an analyst with the technology consulting firm Forrester Research.
Mr. Manning, who wrote a report last month ranking Web site designs in several categories, said online retail sites were considerably better than media, travel and auto sites, in terms of layout and navigational clues for users. 
Other research firms report various improvements by e-commerce sites. According to comScore Networks, 10 of the top 15 biggest-selling Web sites in the last year increased the rate at which visitors became buyers -- the so-called conversion rate, in industry patois. ComScore attributed that improvement to several factors, including better site design and marketing.
Still, many e-tailers' sites "have some troubling flaws," Mr. Manning said, adding: "The single biggest problem is they don't show customers a broad array of product categories early on. There may be something totally important to the customer, but he'll have no clue it exists."
That flaw is precisely what executives at Dell hoped to eliminate earlier this month with a new Web site design -- quite possibly the most ambitious e-commerce site upgrade of the season. Dell.com includes eight distinct subsections, for consumers, corporations, government workers, educational institutions and the like, with variations available in 28 languages.
The site was doing brisk business even before Dell executives decided 18 months ago to pursue the upgrade. Last year, one area of Dell.com, the United States consumer section, sold about $2.8 billion worth of computer hardware, as well as services like wireless home network installations.
But not enough consumers were even aware that Dell sold services, said Michael A. George, the company's chief marketing officer. And with Dell's evolution into consumer electronics, the site's computer focus seemed an even bigger obstacle to future sales growth. 
"We were so PC-centric," Mr. George said. "The site didn't fit with the business we were building." 
As a result, Dell reorganized the home pages for each of the eight sales categories to show a broader array of offerings, then redesigned the paths to each product so prospective customers could get to the goods more quickly. The number of clicks saved varies from two to six, depending on the product. For customers comparing printers for a particular computer, for example, Dell has cut the number of clicks to three, from nine.
Dell tested the new design, which included numerous other digital nips and tucks, using groups of customers for each type of product. Mr. George would not disclose the cost of the effort, but he said the project had relied on 30 to 40 people working "in a full-time or close to full-time capacity" during the 18-month period. 
After any redesign, Mr. George said, companies typically see a drop in conversion rates as consumers become familiar with the new setup. "But in the week and a half we've been live with the new site, we're not seeing that," he said. "And we're absolutely getting more interest and traffic to key areas we were trying to emphasize" -- like the home wireless installations -- "and the conversion in those parts has increased noticeably."
Besides using its internal technical staff, Dell relied on Critical Mass, a technology consulting firm in Calgary, Alberta, to help direct the redesign. Neil Clemmons, a senior vice president at Critical Mass, said that online merchants were mindful that most visitors to their sites come not to explore but to complete a specific task, like buying an item or checking shipping status.
"In the past, e-tailers were more focused on the emotional elements of online shopping -- the message that this is a great place to do business," Mr. Clemmons said. "Now it's, 'How exactly can we help you?"'
Technology is also helping the merchant understand how to improve a site's design. Mr. Clemmons and other Internet executives say software that tracks customer behavior on a site has improved significantly in the last two years. Before, retail executives checking for site weaknesses were forced to pore over numerical data to learn which pages were most frequently viewed and which pages tended to make consumers jump to other sites. 
Now, with software from companies like Omniture, WebTrends, ClickFox and Datanautics, executives can scan graphical displays showing, at a glance, frequent bail-out points for online customers and other vital statistics.
Dell's decision to overhaul the entire site is unusual for online merchants, which typically only tinker with existing design elements and features. The Lands' End site of Sears, Roebuck & Company is a case in point. Last week, LandsEnd.com introduced new technology that compresses its pages' software code, doubling the speed at which dial-up users can download pages on the site. In the coming weeks, LandsEnd.com will also tweak its search engine, so that users can browse a greater range of products from the search results page.
Internet consultants say that one reason for the steady progress of "usability" online is the willingness of many companies to devote a team of internal staff members to the task, rather than relegate the responsibility to a single Web site designer or technology executive. But this team approach also has other benefits, as Staples, the office supply retailer, has found.
According to J.B. Lyon, Staples's vice president for business development and delivery operations, the company developed a "usability team" three and a half years ago, primarily to improve Staples.com. But before long, managers from different offline divisions in the company began asking for help, too, with everything from sign-making to designing store maps for sales clerks. 
"The demand has grown incredibly, as the team's impact has become known," Mr. Lyon said.
The online impact has also been significant. Relying on customer surveys, the usability team devised a new online feature called "easy re-order," which allows customers to view a page of past purchases and click on items they would like to buy again. The feature was introduced in August, and Mr. Lyon said he expected it to quickly eclipse an old, similar feature that required customers to build a list of favorite items.
Big companies are not the only ones to invest in user-friendly Web site designs, said Jakob Nielsen, a principal of the Nielsen Norman Group, a technology consulting company in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Nielsen said his company had seen steadily increasing demand from smaller Web sites.
"There's more appreciation among these smaller sites that they have to have simpler pages and all those things we talked about years ago that the big sites have adopted," Mr. Nielsen said.
The implications of that improvement are important, especially as the industry enters the holiday shopping season, he said.
"There's a lot of things the big sites do well, but a lot of the smaller sites are better at inspiration, since they have such an enthusiasm for what they sell," Mr. Nielsen said. With improved e-tail stores of all types and a better selection of potential gift items, he added, "it could increase the total amount of shopping people do online."

HEADLINE: A.T. Kearney Names a Vice President as Chief Executive 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Officers of the consulting firm A.T. Kearney have selected H.L. Henner Klein, a vice president based in Brussels, as their new chief executive.
 Mr. Klein, whose election is expected to be announced today, will have to wrestle with the problem of running a firm that wants to be an independent strategic consulting business but is a subsidiary of a huge public corporation -- the 138,000-employee E.D.S., which bought A.T. Kearney in 1995. 
 "Our first priority is that A.T. Kearney wants to be the trusted adviser and has to be neutral and has to do what is in the interest of its client," Mr. Klein said in a telephone interview from the firm's office in Brussels on Friday. 
The same challenge confronted Mr. Klein's predecessor, Dietmar Ostermann, whose three-year term expires at the end of November. Mr. Klein's term begins Dec. 1. Mr. Ostermann was pressed by Richard H. Brown, then the chief executive of E.D.S., to make A.T. Kearney much more a component of its parent corporation and to run it more like a company than like a partnership.
One result was the withholding of bonuses to Kearney's officers, the equivalent of its partners, as a result of the failure of the firm to meet E.D.S. sales goals, for all three years of Mr. Ostermann's tenure. That was bad for morale. Several Kearney officers left the firm in that period. Kearney now employs slightly more than 4,000 people. 
"What does not work and what I think was the wrong strategic direction is to set up A.T. Kearney as a line of business integrated into E.D.S.," Mr. Klein said. That approach, he said, eroded the perceived independence that is critical to consultants at Kearney, which sells management and technology advisory services. In contrast E.D.S., an information technology company, is a major player in the business of operating computer operations for other companies. 
Mr. Klein said that Michael H. Jordan, E.D.S.'s new chief executive and a former McKinsey & Company consultant, had a good understanding of the importance of autonomy to Kearney. 
The problem for Kearney consultants as employees of E.D.S. arises clearly when recommending products or services to clients, said Tom Rodenhauser, president of Consulting Information Services, a company in Keene, N.H., that tracks the consulting industry. Consultants generally say they want to recommend the most appropriate products regardless of who sells them. As employees of E.D.S., though, they also have an incentive to sell products and services of their parent company.
"The tricky part that Kearney's going to have to deal with is, what is really independence under the E.D.S. umbrella," Mr. Rodenhauser said.
Complicating A.T. Kearney's efforts to assert an appropriate degree of autonomy has been the uncertain economy, which has also led E.D.S. to announce at least 2,700 layoffs. Mr. Klein expressed some optimism that conditions would improve, initially in the United States, and that demand for the kind of high level strategic advice that A.T. Kearney offers would increase.
"I believe we will have modest, single-digit growth probably as of next year," he said.
Mr. Klein is something of a throwback for Kearney. He joined the firm in 1982, before the acquisition by E.D.S., and his election sends a message that the firm is trying to return to those days of greater independence, Mr. Rodenhauser said.
"Dietmar Ostermann was a partner after the acquisition," Mr. Rodenhauser said. Mr. Klein, he continued, "represents the old Kearney."
Just how independent A.T. Kearney will be will depend on details that have probably not yet been worked out between the firm and E.D.S., Mr. Rodenhauser said. On paper, the governance structure at Kearney, which is based in Chicago, is relatively simple: Mr. Klein will belong to a board of which Mr. Jordan, the E.D.S. chief, will be chairman. Other directors will be E.D.S. executives or representatives elected by A.T. Kearney officers or chosen by Mr. Klein.
But much will depend on how active the board is, Mr. Rodenhauser said. "They are still working that out," he said.

HEADLINE: In Bronx, a Sudden Discount on Pinstripes 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
It was a sodden, quiet morning outside Yankee Stadium, a day seemingly tailor-made for hangovers, breakups and hometown World Series losses.
 A small clot of Yankees fans stood under the dishwater-gray sky yesterday morning, pinioned behind a security gate as players' cars rolled up. The fans beseeched players for autographs, but most of them demurred and headed into the stadium. The players wore expressions like pupils on the way to the principal's office. 
 The 2-0 loss to the Florida Marlins on Saturday night left the Yankees without a World Series title for a third straight year. It was the first time since 1981 that the team lost the Series finale at home. So yesterday in the Bronx, fans argued about what went wrong. (The pitching! No, the hitting!) Vendors selling Yankees merchandise cut their prices and turned away fans looking for Marlins T-shirts. Children played baseball. In the corona of businesses, apartments and ballfields surrounding Yankee Stadium, life ground on.
At Macombs Dam Park, in the shadow of the stadium, two teams of Bronx teenagers, the Astros and Reds, were facing off to determine who would advance to their league's World Series. The field squished like a wet sponge, and the pitcher's mound had been excavated by so many cleats that it resembled a trough.
Dionny Mejia, 15, of the Astros had just pitched a game that ended in a 14-2 loss to the Reds, and visions of Josh Beckett, the Marlins pitcher who was the most valuable player of the World Series, were dancing through his head.
"I'm too tired," Dionny said, showing off the calluses on his fingers.
"My E.R.A. is like 9.00."
Dionny had been up late the night before watching the Yankees, and went to a school-sponsored party after Mr. Beckett tagged Jorge Posada for the last out. Dionny said he needed to get out of his house and forget about the game. "My eyes got watery," he said, sitting on the bench. "To see their faces -- it's sad."
But his friends at the party were mostly Red Sox fans, and they gloated over the Yankees' loss, all night teasing Dionny with reminders of Mr. Beckett's performance.
The Red Sox, conversely, were not far from the lips of Yankees fans yesterday. Michael and Anne Theocharides, New Jersey residents in the Bronx buying souvenirs, saw New York's victory over Boston shored against the ruin of the World Series.
"At least we beat the Red Sox," Ms. Theocharides said. "Look how they are to us. They come down to our stadium and our town, and fill it up and act like animals. I was O.K. to lose, as long as we beat the Red Sox."
Some fans were even able to capitalize on the Yankees' loss. At Stadium Souvenirs on River Avenue in the Bronx, Brian Neraine was looking for a stuffed monkey. Mr. Neraine, a custodian and opportunist, had seen the pinstripe-clad plush animal selling for $20 before the World Series and stopped by yesterday looking for a deal. "I got it for $12," Mr. Neraine said, holding the doll. "I want to put it up in the back of my truck."
But most Yankee fans, like Vinny Caraccio, remained in mourning. The Yankees' loss means there will be no downtown victory parade, and that means that Mr. Caraccio will not be driving his pinstriped Rolls Royce through confetti and cheers.
Mr. Caraccio said he had driven the car, which bears signatures on the exterior from 150 Yankees including Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio, in three tickertape parades. He said he would probably drive over to the stadium today and see if any of the players would sign the car.
"I'm laying in bed today," Mr. Caraccio said in a telephone interview yesterday. "I'm depressed. In my heart I thought they were going to win last night, in my very heart. It's like my dog got run over by a car."
Around Yankee Stadium yesterday, the prevailing sentiment was not heartbreak, but deflation.
Yankees fans said that losing the Series always seemed like a real, if remote, possibility, like an October blizzard. Some said they grew frustrated with the Yankees' pitching, or the way the team seemed to strand runners on base again and again.
Louis Vega, 46, said he felt a malaise settle over the team and fans after the climactic pennant race against the Red Sox. Somehow, he said, the World Series itself felt like an afterthought. "All that energy after the Boston series, the intensity, was lacking," said Mr. Vega, a Bronx resident. "Everyone was just hanging on by a thread."
Back at Macombs Dam Park, Joseph Escobar, 16, an infielder for the Reds, surveyed the clouds, the traffic and the silent stadium. He and other players said there was often an electricity to the place, when thousands of fans walk by and cheers from Yankee Stadium pour onto the field below. 
Not today, though, Joseph said. "It seems dead."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Couple Held in Abuse; One Son, 19, Weighed 45 Pounds 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN and ROBERT F. WORTH; Jason George reported for this article from Collingswood, N.J. 

DATELINE: COLLINGSWOOD, N.J., Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The parents of four boys adopted from New Jersey's troubled foster care system were arrested Friday, two weeks after the police found that the children, ages 9 to 19, had been starved to the point that none of them weighed more than 50 pounds, according to the Camden County prosecutor. 
 The boys were so badly malnourished that their shriveled bodies gave no hint of their ages, investigators said. At 19, the oldest was 4 feet tall and weighed 45 pounds. The police initially thought he was just 10 years old. The boys' condition was discovered when a neighbor called the police because the 19-year-old, Bruce, was looking for food in the neighbor's trash at 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 10, according to the county prosecutor, Vincent P. Sarubbi. The boys were removed from the home later that day. 
 The boys had been locked out of the kitchen of the house in this blue-collar Philadelphia suburb and were fed a diet of pancake batter, peanut butter and breakfast cereal. They ate wallboard and insulation to sate their hunger, investigators said. 
A caseworker from the Division of Youth and Family Services, the state agency that oversees the foster care system, had visited the house at 318 White Horse Pike 38 times in the past 2 years, investigators said. The parents, Raymond Jackson, 50, and his wife, Vanessa, 48, rented the house, which passed a safety assessment by the caseworker and her supervisor in June. 
"This is the most horrible case we have ever encountered in our child abuse unit," said Mr. Sarubbi, who charged the parents with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of their children. "It has been impossible for me to rationalize how parents could treat children this way." Mr. Sarubbi announced the arrests at a news conference on Saturday. 
The case is the latest in a series of discoveries revealing the collapse of New Jersey's child welfare system, which left the youngsters it was charged with protecting vulnerable to abuse and neglect in troubled homes with little oversight.
To settle a lawsuit over the failures of its foster care system, the state agreed in June to hand oversight of the agency to a five-member panel of child welfare experts. Last month, Gov. James E. McGreevey appointed an independent child advocate to protect the rights of children. 
The advocate, Kevin M. Ryan, said Sunday that this latest case revealed the magnitude of the agency's problems. "The question that has to be penetrated is, how did 38 visits over 2 years not rescue these children from slow torture and starvation?" Mr. Ryan said in an interview. "I am completely baffled at this point at how a failure of this magnitude could happen."
He contrasted this case with the one that ultimately led to the call for major reform of the social service agency, the death of a 7-year-old boy in Newark named Faheem Williams, who was found hidden in the basement of a duplex where his cousin was supposed to be taking care of him. An investigation later revealed that Faheem's case had been closed prematurely despite serious allegations of abuse. 
Of the Jackson case, Mr. Ryan said, "Here we had a caseworker who was going into this house and seeing these children," adding "It was not a failure of interaction."
The caseworker, whom officials would not identify, resigned from the agency as the conditions at the Jackson home came to light, said Gwendolyn L. Harris, the commissioner of the state Department of Human Services, which oversees the Division of Youth and Family Services. Agency officials described her as experienced, and Ms. Harris said the agency would review other cases she handled. 
At least 8 and as many as 10 employees of the Division of Youth and Family Services, including managers and supervisors, face suspension and some could be fired depending on the outcome of the department's investigation into the Jackson case, she said. 
Also living in the Jackson house were two girls, ages 5 and 12, whom the couple had also adopted from the foster care system; a foster daughter, 10, whom they were planning to adopt; and two of the couple's adult biological children -- a son and a daughter, Mr. Sarubbi said. None of the children other than the four boys appeared to be malnourished, Mr. Sarubbi said. The family had received a total of as much as $28,000 a year from the state to take care of the adopted children and their foster daughter, investigators said. That stipend was reduced when the oldest boy turned 18.
The caseworker, with her supervisor, had completed an inspection of the home in early June, an investigator said. The inspection was one of more than 14,000 completed in the last six months in response to repeated problems in the foster care system. The assessments were intended to root out problems similar to the Faheem Williams case and others that troubled the agency in recent years, and were preceded by training courses for all the employees sent to perform them, officials at the Division of Youth and Family Services said. 
Mr. Ryan said he had begun an investigation of the operations of the division's office that dealt with the family, the Southern Adoption Resource Center. The center handles foster children who are likely to be candidates for adoption. Each child who came into the Jackson home through the foster care system was overseen by the Southern Adoption Resource Center, investigators said, adding that the caseworker was assigned to the family to look after the 10-year-old girl whom the Jackson were planning to adopt.
Once a child is adopted, officials said, the child is no longer assigned a caseworker.
Mr. Sarubbi said the adopted boys lived in a state of constant want. They had lice, and their teeth were rotting because they had not seen a dentist or doctor for at least five years, investigators said. They were home-schooled by the adults and were not permitted to leave home often, investigators said.
In marked contrast to the four boys, the three girls were well fed, went to medical appointments and took vacations with their parents to Willamsburg, Va., where the family had a time-share apartment. The girls were permitted to order Chinese takeout while their brothers starved, Mr. Sarubbi said. 
Yet the boys seemed unaware of their plight, he said. 
"The parents had essentially brainwashed the children into believing they had eating disorders," the prosecutor said, adding, "The saddest part is I don't think the children even knew how bad off they were."
The family had financial trouble, Mr. Sarubbi said. They were $8,000 behind on their rent and had defaulted on loans on their vacation time shares in Virginia and the Poconos, he said. Neighbors said Mr. Jackson worked as a mortgage broker and wore tailored suits, but investigators said he was now unemployed. The electricity had been turned off recently for four months, Mr. Sarubbi said, and the gas was off for a month. 
Neighbors said that they noticed that the boys were small and thin, but that Mr. and Mrs. Jackson had told them they had medical conditions that kept them from growing properly. 
Pete DiMattia, who lives next door to the family, said he never thought to call the police or a child welfare agency because he often saw a state car parked outside the house and assumed that the family was being supervised. 
"I thought the kids had medical problems," Mr. DiMattia said. He said the boys were polite and respectful, referring to him as "Mr. Pete."
The evangelical church attended by the Jacksons, who are born-again Christians, is in Medford, about 20 miles away. Congregation members said they could not imagine that the Jacksons had starved their sons. 
"There is no way on God's green earth that this happened," said Frank Jacobs, 50, a member of the Medford congregation, the Come Alive New Testament Church, who said he has known the family for 15 years. He said the children were lively and active members of the church, attending Sunday school, acting in pageants and singing. 
Medical examinations of the boys ruled out any natural cause for their small stature, Mr. Sarubbi said. One boy, a 14-year-old identified only by his initials, K. J., weighed 38 pounds when the Jacksons adopted him in 1996. When he was removed from their home on Oct. 10, he was 4 feet tall and weighed just 40 pounds, Mr. Sarubbi said. After 13 days in a hospital, K. J. had gained seven pounds, he said. 
"To look at the children, it was just gut-wrenching," Mr. Sarubbi said. "They had distended stomachs. You could see their ribs. Their shoulder blades protruded from the skin. The boys' faces were gaunt."
He said it seemed impossible that anyone, particularly someone charged with looking out for the welfare of children, would fail to notice the boys' condition. He said he would examine how the Division of Youth and Family Services handled the Jackson case, but he would not say if anyone from the agency would face criminal charges. 
The three younger boys have been released from hospitals and are in foster homes, Mr. Sarubbi said. Bruce, the oldest, remains hospitalized; doctors are monitoring a possible heart problem. The girls living in the house have also been placed in foster homes. 
Marcia Robinson Lowry, executive director of Children's Rights, a Manhattan-based child advocacy group that sued New Jersey over its foster care system, said the Jackson case was a stunning reminder of just how difficult it will be to right the troubled system. It was particularly distressing, she said, that the very process that was intended to find problem homes -- the inspection of all homes with foster children -- failed to help the Jackson children. 
"I think we have got to immediately start talking about redoing a large number of these assessments because I don't know how many of them have been done and how many of them done appropriately," Ms. Lowry said. "It is clear that this system can't be fixed quickly."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DAMAGE; 
U.S. Case For Helping Iraq Suffers A Setback

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
In purely military terms, the rocket attack Sunday morning on a hotel being used by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense and a leading architect of the war against Saddam Hussein, meant little. 
 But the strike is a serious setback for the Bush administration as it tries to persuade the world to focus on the positives of the American occupation, on falling crime and new schools, on cleaner streets and freer speech. 
 Instead, it is a reminder that after easily toppling Mr. Hussein, the United States is struggling against a continuing guerrilla resistance, and struggling even though the guerrillas are badly trained and ill equipped. 
But the guerrillas have two great advantages. First, the United States has been reluctant to use its full might against them, for fear of turning civilians against the occupation and inflaming public opinion worldwide. 
Second, the guerrillas can win merely by creating chaos. As long as they are killing soldiers and Iraqi civilians, the Bush administration will have a difficult time convincing Americans that Iraq is becoming more stable -- and in winning the foreign investment that Iraq's economy needs. 
By that score, the attack on Sunday, which killed an American colonel and wounded 16 other people, was especially damaging. Mr. Wolfowitz came to Iraq hoping to underscore the progress the administration has made, and to persuade investors to come and help Iraq rebuild. He did not back away even after he and his rattled aides were evacuated from the smoking floors of their hotel.
But the attack sent the opposite message, by underscoring the vulnerability of even the best-protected part of the capital. 
There are many Iraqis whose confidence can make a real difference in the immediate future -- like entrepreneurs considering new investments, wealthy merchants wondering whether to keep their families here and ordinary Iraqis wondering whether they can safely enter political life. For them, the American military's inability to assure the safety of one of its most senior officials is a frightening sign.
The United States is doing everything it can to fight their fears. All over the city, the occupying authorities have put up large billboards featuring bucolic scenes of date palms arched over a river bank. Inspirational messages are splashed over the pretty pictures. "Baghdad is getting better," says one.
That message still holds, Brig. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who as commander of the First Armored Division is in charge of security in Baghdad, said at a news conference after Sunday's blast. 
Ordinary Iraqis seem to agree that security is improving. Though reliable statistics are hard to come by, crime appears to have fallen since summer. On Sunday, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, allied forces lifted the overnight curfew in Baghdad for the first time since April.
But the security gains may be fragile. In the absence of an effective Iraqi police force, American troops must patrol the streets and try to contain both criminals and guerrillas. That makes the American troops both vulnerable and essential to maintaining the improvement that the occupation boasts of. 
So 150,000 American and other allied troops continue to be on the front lines of the streets of Iraq, facing a low-level war that is not going well.
After dropping in September, American troop deaths have risen this month, and the number of ambushes on the troops has climbed steadily. Iraqi police officers and government officials, who are viewed by the guerrillas as collaborators with occupation forces, are often attacked. Little is really known about the guerrillas, who can operate in very small groups but seem to have enough organization to direct the choice and timing of attacks. 
Some outside military experts, like James Dobbins of the RAND Corporation, have said more American troops would deter attacks. But more troops are unlikely over all.
For now, American military strategists appear to have decided that the best way to overcome the guerrilla resistance is to pour more troops into the Sunni Triangle, the region west and north of Baghdad where support for Mr. Hussein is greatest. Their plan is to draw out the guerrillas to destroy them, a strategy that risks civilian casualties.
Even if the strategy is effective, it may take months to make a major difference. In the meantime, the residents of Baghdad may find themselves bracing for more attacks.

HEADLINE: Arrest of Oil Chief Could Roil Russian Stock Market 

BYLINE:  By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND and NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the head of Yukos, the largest oil company in Russia, and the country's richest man, is bound to unnerve even the most stolid of investors in Russia, bankers and market observers say. 
 "Two words," predicted one investment banker in Moscow, when asked how he thought investors would react. "Capital flight." 
 Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested by special forces, who took him off his private jet and straight to court. He was charged with fraud, forgery and tax evasion, and could be held for up to two months before prosecutors decide whether to pursue a trial. 
Lawyers for Mr. Khodorkovsky said they would file an appeal this week.
If Mr. Khodorkovsky remains in jail, some analysts estimate that the Russian stock market could drop 5 to 10 percent on Monday, and that oil stocks would remain under pressure for months. A drop of that amount would mean the Russian stock market will have sold off roughly 20 percent from highs set earlier this month. 
Even the United States ambassador to Russia, Alexander Vershbow, said on Sunday that the arrest of the Yukos chief "could negatively affect Russia's investment climate" and "raise new doubts among both foreign companies and potential investors." 
The arrest escalated a government investigation that began last summer into Yukos, an inquiry that company and analysts have said was politically motivated. Mr. Khodorkovsky, one of the Russian "oligarchs" -- a class of powerful, self-made businessmen who emerged in the mid-1990's -- apparently fell out of favor with President Vladimir V. Putin, who wants the oligarchs to steer clear of politics. Others who have inspired the wrath of Mr. Putin, like Vladimir Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky, two media tycoons, live in self-imposed exile.
Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest comes after a charm offensive begun by the Russian government to woo foreign investors into Russia's oil sector. For more than a year, the Russians have portrayed themselves as a more stable supplier of oil than the Middle East, and the government and private companies both have shown a greater willingness to cooperate with foreigners.
Earlier this year, BP, the oil company, announced that it planned to invest more than $6 billion in a venture with the Russian company TNK. 
The Russians sponsored an oil industry conference in September in Mr. Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg, where he met executives from the world's largest oil companies. Moreover, it has been reported that Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded company, has been negotiating with Yukos to buy a sizable stake. Yukos had indicated its willingness to sell up to 40 percent of the company to a foreign oil giant, a stake that at current prices would be worth about $25 billion.
It remains unclear what the arrest would mean for Exxon Mobil's interest in Yukos, and a spokesman at the American company declined to comment on the negotiations and the arrest. But experts of Russian oil expect the arrest to have a chilling effect on foreign interest in the sector as a whole. 
"The government probably wants to send the ultimate message with the arrest of Khodorkovsky: that foreign companies are not welcome," said Julia Nanay, an expert on the Russian oil business and a senior director at PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. "It is saying, 'It's too difficult for you all to be here."'
As long as Russia has experimented with free markets, its citizens and its leaders have shown profound ambivalence about foreigners investing in the economy, especially the oil and gas industry many Russians consider their patrimony. The detention of Mr. Khodorkovsky seemed to become a greater possibility, one that he himself discussed publicly, as the news of foreign companies negotiating to buy part of Yukos became more credible. 
"I believe there is no more significant indicator of the dangers facing foreign investors than the Khodorkovsky case itself, because the state procuracy has shown its willingness to depart from rule of law," said Robert R. Amsterdam, with the Toronto law firm Amsterdam and Peroff, who represents two of Mr. Khodorkovsky's Yukos colleagues who were arrested earlier this year. "This is the signal that politics has trumped even the appearance of rule of law."
Not only would the sale of a slice of Yukos put control of some of Russia's oil wealth in foreign hands, Ms. Nanay noted, it would also legitimize the wealth that many Russians feel that Mr. Khodorkovsky and others amassed unfairly through the insider deals that had shaped Russian privatization in the mid-1990's.
Until now, the Russian oil companies have very ably revived production in fields where output plummeted with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all without significant foreign investment. "To develop new fields and more difficult fields, if Russia really wants to increase production and export more oil, it would make sense for foreign companies to come in and develop them," Ms. Nanay said. "But I don't know if the Russian government has made up its mind that wants to increase production from where it is."
Russia's business elite fretted that Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest signaled a broader attack on them, rather than the conventional wisdom, that the oil baron was a rival to the Kremlin's power. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, an organization similar to the Business Roundtable in the United States, organized an emergency meeting on Saturday to parse out a reaction. And their answer, said Anatoly Chubais, the head of UES, Russia's largest electric utility, was unequivocal. 
"Mistrust. Russian business -- not only oligarchs -- but also medium and small businesses mistrust the political leaders in Russia," he told a weekend television program. "I want business to understand if it has a future, or if its future is similar to Khodorkovsky's fate." 
But those fears may be overstated. "The big picture is about getting this place strong economically and embedded with the West," said Alasdair P.M. Breach, chief economist at Brunswick UBS in Moscow. "The arrest of Khodorkovsky is a logical follow-through of this buildup of conflict between him and the president," he added, explaining that "If another oligarch had beenarrested, it would actually have been worse." 
Strategists said that investing in Russia is still predicated on politics. "People forget that this is an emerging economy," said Chris J. Weafer, chief strategist at Aton. "The question for investors is: are you investing in a bigger Venezuela or something that turns out like Malaysia?" 
As majority owner of Yukos, Mr. Khodorkovsky's net worth totals roughly $8 billion, according to Forbes magazine. In 2002, Forbes listed 17 billionaires from Russia, up from none in 2000. 
Now the fate of Yukos may ultimately rest in Mr. Putin's hands. "It may be that Exxon Mobil or another company still comes in as a white knight to buy Yukos. The question," says Mr. Breach of Brunswick UBS, "is whether Putin wants that to happen."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
I.B.M. and Microsoft have different ideas for planning the future of the Internet.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
Building the Web as a tool for transactions. ONE year ago, almost to the day, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive of I.B.M., delivered a speech in New York that sketched his company's vision of the future of computing, which he called "on-demand computing." 
 Today in Los Angeles, Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, will present his company's notion of where things are headed, which the software maker calls "seamless computing." 
 Behind the marketing shorthand is a kind of war of ideas over what can be thought of as "the Internet, Act II," a technological evolution that has been gathering speed. The next-generation development of the Internet has been helped by the continuing and remarkable progress in hardware. But probably more important has been the embrace of a set of software standards -- rendered in a nerdy alphabet soup of acronyms, like XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI and so on -- that open the door to widespread machine-to-machine communication across the Internet. 
Over the last couple of years, I.B.M. and Microsoft have cooperated closely to reach agreement on the software standards, known as Web services, necessary for this next step. The two companies, however, agree on little else.
The Internet Act I was mainly about e-mail programs and downloading digital information to look at or listen to -- Web pages, animations, video and music. Act II should bring all kinds of automated transactions among businesses and individuals. And those transactions will be able to include a hint of computer-aided intelligence. 
An example could be arranging an appointment with your dentist. Your calendar information, with stated time preferences and availability, exchanges data with your dentist's calendar to automatically set up an appointment. Similarly, companies should someday be able to conduct computer-automated auctions with suppliers. The next-generation Internet can be thought of as the beginning of what researchers have said might be possible with software agents, or bots, performing as human assistants.
To be sure, many companies, including the Hewlett-Packard Company, the Oracle Corporation and Sun Microsystems, have strategies and marketing campaigns for pursuing this next stage of computing. Still, I.B.M. and Microsoft are the two with the greatest influence. 
The Microsoft vision centers on the individual and technology tools, foreseeing a kind of rerun of the personal computer revolution in the Internet era. I.B.M. sees the computing evolution as helping to free companies from the previous constraints of technology, so they can focus more on using technology to streamline business processes and seek new markets than on the hardware and software itself. One implication, I.B.M. says, is that companies need not have so much internal technology. Instead, they can buy computing and technology services from outside suppliers like I.B.M., almost as if a utility, paying only for what they use, on demand.
Their separate paths provide plenty of grist for debate. Microsoft portrays the I.B.M. strategy as trying to exploit a post-bubble loss of enthusiasm for technology and persuade companies to hand over their computing chores to I.B.M. But when technology goes out the door, Microsoft insists, so do opportunities.
"I.B.M. is talking about taking all the things we do now and outsourcing it," Mr. Gates said last week in an interview. "The utility model suggests that it is not about empowerment." 
Microsoft executives compare the first stage of the Internet to the mainframe era, with the Web server computer the equivalent of the mainframe and the browser as the equivalent of the simple, "dumb" terminal of the mainframe days. The personal computer, they say, brought an explosion of creativity and opportunity as millions of people began using computers and programming themselves. Some were professionals, they note, but many others were ordinary people using the simple programming tools in a spreadsheet, for example, to simulate and test new ideas for a business.
The next stage of computing, employing the Web services software standards, will do the same thing for the Internet, Microsoft executives say. "The Internet will be programmable," Microsoft's chief technical officer, Craig Mundie, said. "And there's no reason why the bulk of humanity won't be able to apply the tools we're talking about to this new world."
Some 7,000 people have registered toattend Microsoft's professional developers conference, which begins today in Los Angeles. The turnout is a record, Microsoft says. The computer professionals will be shown glimpses of Microsoft's next version of Windows, named Longhorn, which will be built using Web services standards. Microsoft has not said when Longhorn will be ready, but it is not expected to be shipped until late 1995 or 1996. 
Microsoft will not announce a shipment date at the conference. "This is a technology-driven release, not a date-driven release," Mr. Gates said.
At the conference, Microsoft will show the professional programmers a set of development tools, called Indigo, intended to allow a programmer to write a Web services application once that can then run on several devices -- a PC, a hand-held device, a cellphone or whatever. This is Microsoft's notion of seamless computing. The devices need not be running Microsoft software, in the same way that e-mail messages can be sent and received by people using different e-mail programs.
But, of course, the Microsoft message is that the preferred technology for building and experiencing the next generation of the Internet is Windows.
The Windows-centric strategy, I.B.M. executives say, is increasingly out of step in a computing world moving toward technical diversity and open standards not owned by any one company.
"Microsoft today reminds me of I.B.M. in the years from 1988 to 1990," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, vice president for technology and strategy at I.B.M. "We were doing lots of things but the No.1 thing was to protect the mainframe franchise."
"Windows will continue to be a superb legacy business, just as the mainframe is for us," Mr. Wladawsky-Berger said. "It's just that the dynamics change."
The essence of on-demand computing, he said, is to "finally liberate business from the shackles of technology." Using open computing standards as building blocks, he explained, complex technological tasks can be broken down and solved in new ways, almost automatically. For example, he said, cars covered with sensors, all connected to the Internet, could automatically summon software to remedy a mechanical problem before the car malfunctions, reducing warranty costs and perhaps accidents.
I.B.M. clashes with Microsoft not least because I.B.M. is the leading corporate backer of the free Linux operating system, a direct challenge to Microsoft. I.B.M. regards the spread of Linux as part of the inevitable market of open technology standards.
"I regard it almost as a law of nature that anytime an Internet-based standard is good enough, it will take over the volume business from the proprietary standard," Mr. Wladawsky-Berger said. He sees Linux as that kind of Internet-based standard. 
Windows is perhaps the most lucrative "volume business" ever.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 28, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The New Economy column in Business Day yesterday about the competing visions of I.B.M. and Microsoft for the future of the Internet misstated the expected shipping date for Microsoft's next version of the Windows operating system, code-named Longhorn. It is late 2005 or 2006. (The reference to 1995 or 1996 was inadvertent.)

HEADLINE: Testing the Senate's Mettle 

 BODY:
There is a good test of senatorial courage coming this week. For the first time, senators will be asked whether they are prepared to do something serious about global warming. The question comes in the form of a bill by John McCain and Joseph Lieberman that would impose mandatory caps on industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases thought to be heavily responsible for warming the earth's atmosphere. The bill is a long shot. But it will provide the first true test of the sincerity of senators who say they care about the problem and have faulted President Bush for not doing enough. 
 More broadly, it will also tell us whether the politics of global warming are finally beginning to catch up to the science of global warming. The science seems clear enough, and surveys suggest that the public and many local politicians are worried. But Washington hangs back, fearful of asking the country to make the investments in cleaner fuels, cars and power plants needed to start bringing emissions down. 
 This fear has been engendered in part by Mr. Bush, who remains stubbornly positioned at the rear of a parade he ought to be leading. Warning of job losses, he has opposed not only the 1997 Kyoto Protocol but even the mildest variations on that agreement. Instead, he offers research into technological fixes (fine, as far as they go) as well as a voluntary program that will allow industrial emissions to grow as long as they increase more slowly than the economy itself, which of course misses the point. The carbon in the atmosphere, already dangerously high, is likely to stay there for a long time. Thus the name of the game is to stabilize and reduce emissions, not merely to slow their growth.
Senators McCain and Lieberman have it right. Their plan would require energy, transportation and manufacturing companies to cut their emissions to 2000 levels by 2010. That isn't asking a lot. According to two reputable studies, the cost would be less than $20 per family per year, and there would be no negative impact on employment. Indeed, the investments in new technologies necessary to achieve the reductions, as well as the money saved on gasoline from more efficient cars, could actually boost the economy. The bill also offers a range of clever economic incentives -- chiefly a market-based system of emissions trading, patterned after the highly successful acid rain program in the 1990 Clean Air Act -- to help industries keep the costs of compliance low.
Three hours of debate will be allowed for the McCain-Lieberman forces, three for the opposition. The point will undoubtedly be made that America is under no obligation to act as long as developing countries like China increase their emissions. The truth is just the reverse: One cannot expect developing nations to do anything until the United States, the biggest polluter, takes the lead. McCain-Lieberman is a splendid chance to do so.

Stick or Automatic? Who Can Tell?

BYLINE:  By DON SHERMAN

 BODY:
AFTER decades of unheralded service in the darkest recesses of the automobile, the transmission is moving into the spotlight. Carmakers are competing to develop more efficient ways of channeling engine power to the wheels and are introducing creative new ways to shift gears.
 Mercedes-Benz now has a seven-speed automatic transmission, trumping archrivals like Audi, BMW and Jaguar that make do with only six forward gear ratios. 
 Ferrari, Maserati and other automakers are supplanting the time-honored floor shifter with fast levers mounted on or behind the steering wheel, the better to entertain Walter Mitty types who want to transform their daily commutes into a fantasy Grand Prix. 
For those interested in a less-frenzied pace, the continuously variable transmission, available in an increasing number of models, provides passing performance smoother than an elevator ride.
The boldest move is the introduction of a transmission that straddles the divide between automatics and stick shifts. Audi's six-speed Direct Shift Gearbox, which is standard equipment on the 2004 TT 3.2 quattro, has no clutch pedal and can shift gears by itself, but calling it an automatic transmission would be a gross understatement of its talents. To complicate matters further, the Direct Shift Gearbox is filled with exactly the type of gears, shafts and synchronizers found in a conventional stick-shift transmission.
Audi is the first to market the concept -- one that engineers have considered for many years -- and in doing so leapfrogs technology available from carmakers like Ferrari and BMW. The idea is to use two clutches to feed power to two separate geartrains in the transmission case. The benefit of the dual-clutch approach lies in its ability to shift from one ratio to the next without disconnecting the engine from the drive wheels, which normally takes place when a driver has to lift off the throttle and depress the clutch pedal.
The French automaker Citroen failed to make this work in the 1934 Traction Avant, an early success among front-wheel-drive cars. Porsche picked up the concept in the late 1960's with hopes of perfecting it for use in the 911 sports car. That plan did not succeed either, but the Porsche racing department recognized the advantage of shifting gears without letting off the gas, an action that causes a momentary loss of the turbocharger's boost. After an extensive development program, the Porsche double-clutch gearbox was installed in the factory's 962C endurance racers, scoring victories in the German Super Cup Series in 1986 and 1987. Audi fitted a similar transmission to the Sport quattro S1 rally car, logging a victory in the 1985 Pikes Peak Hill Climb in Colorado.
In the United States, BorgWarner began studying the dual-clutch concept in the 1980's. The company's motivation was not winning races, but building transmissions appropriate for use in Europe, where automatic transmissions have been slow to gain acceptance because of cost and concerns about fuel economy. Replacing the torque converter, a fluid coupling device used in conventional automatics, with two automated clutches can potentially improve mileage. The dual-clutch automated manual transmission can improve fuel efficiency by 13 to 15 percent, BorgWarner says.
Also in favor of this design is the use of conventional meshed gears, like those in manual transmissions, instead of the planetary gear sets typical of automatics. This appeals to European carmakers because the parts can be made without major retooling, and the finished assembly is more compact than a conventional automatic transmission. Three European transmission specialists -- LuK, Valeo and ZF Sachs -- are working on dual-clutch designs.
Deep within the gumdrop-shaped Audi TT 3.2 quattro, the Direct Shift Gearbox is a dense package of computer-controlled thingamabobs. The two multiplate clutches, which are immersed in the same fluid that lubricates the transmission, are nestled one within the other for compactness. When engaged, the outer clutch delivers torque to odd-numbered gears while the inner clutch feeds the even-numbered ratios. In both cases, the torque is transmitted by a central input shaft to the appropriate gear-carrying shaft, then to a final-drive differential. Hydraulic actuators commanded by the control computer engage the clutches and the gears as needed.
The driving sequence begins with a tap of the throttle. One clutch engages, routing power through first gear to accelerate the TT. Meanwhile, the electronic controller has second gear selected and ready. When the driver decides it is time for an upshift (using the floor shifter or steering-wheel paddles) , the first clutch releases and the second one takes hold. The passing of the baton is a smooth, seamless process that lasts just two-tenths of a second, BorgWarner says.
Gears can be changed only in numerical order; it is not possible to upshift from first to third or downshift from fourth to second. The TT also lets the driver choose conventional automatic operation, as well as an automatic mode with a sport setting for upshifts at higher engine speeds.
Part of the beauty of the direct-shift approach is that performance characteristics can be altered by recalibrating the control software. The Volkswagen Group (which includes Audi) has about 20 versions of the system tailored for sporting, family sedan and diesel-power applications. Bugatti, also owned by VW, will use a seven-speed Direct Shift Gearbox transmission on its Veyron EB 16-4 supercar, which is to produce 987 horsepower and cost $1.2 million.

Jobless: Survival Tips for the Short Term and the Long

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
LAID off. Downsized. Fired. 
 You may have seen it coming for months. Or it might have come out of the blue. Whatever it is called, and whatever the circumstances, losing a job is an awful experience. 
 All that advice about what you should have done, like setting aside enough money for six months, is not going to help. The worst part is not knowing if you will be unemployed for two weeks, two months or -- a really scary thought -- two years. 
For many people out of work, being unemployed is a new experience. Of those without a job for more than six months, when state unemployment benefits usually run out, about half are managerial, professional and technical workers, an indication of who lost out in the collapse of the Internet bubble.
In 2002, Congress voted an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for many workers. Despite this, the number of people out of work for 40 weeks or more nearly doubled to 1.3 million in the March-to-June period, from 700,000 a year earlier, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington.
So, if you suddenly find yourself outside, seemingly on the edge of a financial abyss, you may take some small comfort knowing that you are not alone. But there are bills to pay and decisions to make.
What do you do? 
Getting through a stretch of unemployment with minimal economic and emotional damage requires a strategy. It also requires recognizing that a job is just that, a job. Yours may be gone for reasons beyond your control: a slow economy, a change in customer tastes, bad management. Maintaining your sense of worth, and some objectivity, is important to how you will fare.

Be Cool When It Happens
First, keep your head when the bad news hits, said Michael B. Laskoff, whose own bouts of joblessness show that having a Harvard M.B.A. is no guarantee of steady work. Mr. Laskoff, a Manhattan resident and author of "Landing on the Right Side of Your Ass: A Survival Guide For the Recently Unemployed" to be published in January, says quick thinking can put more money in your pocket.
"While you are sitting in that meeting getting fired, ask for more," he said. "The person firing you is not happy about having to fire you. Even if they wanted to fire you, it is unpleasant, so generally speaking he will do anything required to get you out of that office."
Katherine Meredith, a financial planner in Pittsburgh who has worked with laid-off employees, advises clients to make sure they ask questions until they fully understand what is in their severance package. 
"Then the first place to go," Ms. Meredith said, "is the state employment office to apply for benefits." 

Take Inventory and Prioritize
Next comes the job search. "The most important thing is to take a few days to absorb and decompress," said Ms. Applegate, the author of "The Entrepreneur's Desk Reference." "Then take a really honest inventory of your skills." 
She recommendsthinking about moving your life and career in a new direction, changing occupations or starting a business.
"Everyone who has a job should always keep a little dream list of business ideas and opportunities that appeal to them," Ms. Applegate said. Losing your job is a time to rethink that dream, she said, doing what you want to do. 
Feeling good about yourself, hard as that may seem, is critical because it affects how prospective employers perceive you. And how you handle your reduced finances play into your attitude.
Mr. Laskoff says part of your self-evaluation is identifying unnecessary expenses and cutting back, but not necessarily eliminating them right away.
"Most people will say, Cut immediately back to barest minimum you can handle," Mr. Laskoff said. "I don't advise that. I always remind people doing job searches that their state of mind has a lot to do with their salability. If you cut too much, then you become miserable and depressed and that makes it difficult to your being hired."
Nancy Weil Brown, a career coach in Chatsworth, Calif., who has been laid off from several sales and marketing jobs, agreed. "Start making the minimum payment on everything," she said. "Cut back on spending, but don't go into such austerity that you have denied yourself everything because you'll become discouraged."
She suggested cutting back on eating out, for example, and "if you go to a movie, skip the popcorn." As time passes, you can cut more, she said, and "look for things to do that are fun and free, like a walk on a nature trail."
As bills stack up, the National Consumer Law Center in Boston offers 16 rules for prioritizing and lowering some expenses in its "Guide to Surviving Debt," edition 2002. 
Housing and feeding the family come first, the center says; by law, child-support payments must be made. It recommends contacting electric, gas, water and other utility companies about paying the minimum amount to keep your service. Make car payments if the car is essential.
You must also pay your income taxes. Congress taxes your jobless benefits, but does not withhold taxes from the checks. Even if you cannot pay taxes that were not withheld, be sure to file your federal and state tax returns and attach a note explaining that you are unemployed.
The law center advises giving low priority to loans that are not backed by collateral. Credit-card debts and bills from lawyers, doctors and other service providers merit low priority because "there is rarely anything that these creditors can do to hurt you in the short term."
The center also advises giving low priority to debts that are secured only by your household goods, which are rarely seized for nonpayment. A mistake, the center says, is paying a debtor low on your list because of threats to sue or assertions that your credit rating will be ruined. Such suits are rare and time-consuming; besides, much of your property may by law be exempt from seizure while "nonpayment of rent, mortgage and car debts may result immediate loss of your home or car."
Not paying student loans can result in seizure of tax refunds and wage garnishments, but the center says the loans should be treated as medium priority. 
Refinancing, the center warns, is rarely a good idea. 

For the Long Haul, Tough Choices
Taking time to devise a plan for what to do if you are without work for an extended period will mean making well-thought-out choices, ones not made in panic or while depressed. Deciding whether to sell an heirloom -- an antique music box, grandma's silver service -- or taking a bottom-of-the-barrel job is a choice better made when heads are clear. 
As time passes, there may be no choice but to turn assets into cash. Taking money out of retirement plans generally involves a 10 percent federal tax penalty if you are under age 59 1/2. Cashing in life insurance may mean much higher costs for a new policy, if you can obtain one, when you do find work. You may also get relief by going to a credit counseling agency. The endgame may be filing for bankruptcy protection.
One other mistake, often made after a long period without work, is chasing after any job, Ms. Meredith said. 
"I have seen a number of people," she said, "run to a job out of state, sell their house, uproot the family, all move there and no sooner do they move than they get laid off again or they find they hate it." 
If you take a job in another location, she advises, "It is much better in most cases to send one family member there for the job, see how it goes for a few months, and then decide whether to move."

And Consider Health Insurance
Another issue for people out of work, said Rebecca Derby, a senior policy analyst at Health Care for All, an advocacy group in Boston, is whether they should drop health insurance. Many, she said, reason that if they become seriously ill, they will be covered under the welfare medical system.
"You may eventually get coverage," Ms. Derby said, "but by then it may be too late."
Medicaid, the basic welfare medical program, typically becomes available once a person becomes disabled. By then, Ms. Derby said, what may have been a curable disease may be fatal.
Employers with 20 or more workers who offer health insurance are covered by a 1985 law known as Cobra, for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
If you quit or are laid off (other than for extreme misconduct like theft) or your hours are reduced, you can pay for continued coverage for yourself, your spouse and dependent children for 18 months. A spouse or child is also entitled separately, if this family member exercises the right before you end your coverage, an important consideration if someone is sick. 
Many states also require coverage of people who work for small businesses. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the laws cover workers at companies with 2 to 19 employees, giving them the right to continue coverage for 12 months in New Jersey and for 18 months, and sometimes longer, in New York and Connecticut. A chart with these state rights is available at www.healthinsuranceinfo.net/, a site maintained by Georgetown University.
Trudy Lieberman, a health insurance expert at Consumers Union, said that the cost of continuing coverage under Cobra was high, 102 percent of what the employer paid, which is often more than $500 a month.
Unless you opt for Cobra coverage when leaving a job, Ms. Lieberman says, you are not automatically eligible to buy individual health insurance later. And if you exhaust your Cobra benefits, you must apply for new coverage within 63 days to be eligible for a policy regardless of existing health problems.

To Get Back in the Game, Be Ready for a Switch in Positions

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
LIKE many of the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in the last few years, Charlie Hardiman found looking for work to be slow and laborious. But about nine months after being laid off from his job as the director for operations management at Walt Disney World in Florida, he recently found a new job. In fact, after 27 years in the hotel field, he has found a new career in a related industry, president of the Pennsylvania Culinary Institute, a cordon bleu school in Pittsburgh. 
 How did he do it? Of course, not everyone looking for work has his credentials or aims as high. But the steps Mr. Hardiman took are what experts recommend for job seekers in a variety of circumstances. 
 Mr. Hardiman revised his resume and networked extensively. Assisted by DBM, a human resources consulting firm whose services were provided by Disney World, he looked for work in industries that were growing and not shrinking, even though he had not worked in them before.
"I focused on my quantitative accomplishments," Mr. Hardiman said. "And I realized that my leadership skills were transferable."
In other words, experts say, the first step is to look where the jobs are.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only some fields -- accommodation and food services and education and health services, among them -- are experiencing consistent job growth. Others, including many manufacturing jobs, are lagging -- and are going to continue to lag, said Carl E. Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. "People are just not going to be called back to the firms that laid them off the way they used to be," Mr. Van Horn said.
But John A. Challenger, the president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago, said that did not mean there were not "a lot of jobs out there." Because of another trend -- the tendency for people to be less loyal to employers today than in the past -- there is often a lot of turnover. "People are moving in and out of companies all the time," Mr. Challenger said.
Positions in fields that are growing, Mr. Challenger said, involve direct contact with consumers -- from home health care aide to substance abuse counselor to security guard, among many others -- which offer some of the best opportunities because they have to be done locally and "are not going to go global." 
Christopher Jones, a columnist for HotJobs, the Web site, said other industries worth a look include accounting and finance, sales, retailing and some categories of information technology.
Dr. Kay Brawley, the president of the National Employment Counseling Association, whose members include people who work at state employment offices, said that computer-security jobs and jobs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries were also plentiful.
In its most recent survey of employers' hiring intentions, Manpower, the temporary employment company, found that the strongest sectors are finance, insurance and real estate, said Barbara J. Beck, the executive vice president for United States and Canadian operations.
So how does one look for work in these areas?
First, write an appropriate resume. That is not as simple as it may sound, said Myrna Webb, a certified career counselor who works for the New York State Department of Labor in Endicott. Many employers now use software that sifts through resumes and discards those that do not contain key words and phrases they want to see, long before a human even gives the applications a glance. A company like Lockheed Martin, for example, may be looking for assemblers, and so may scan for such words as "bench assembly" and "power tools," Ms. Webb said. 
"You must know your audience when you prepare your resume," she said. "Don't worry about what it looks like, worry about what it says." 
Second, know what you want in the marketplace. "Regardless of what titles you held or what you did in the past, you may have to reinvent yourself," Ms. Webb said.
State employment offices or one-stop career centers have numerous services to help job seekers redo their resumes and perform self-assessments. They can also help research where applicants should send a resume and for what kinds of positions. 
There is also the Internet. Many employers maintain Web sites that list job openings, and applicants can send their resumes directly. The big online job listing services, like HotJobs.com and Monster.com, contain information about issues like compensation and job availability, as well as listings of openings that employers have placed. These Web sites also maintain databases of job seekers' resumes, and their services are generally free for people seeking employment. For people who are employed, posting one's resume online can be risky, given that one's employer can stumble on it.
Employers certainly seem to like using the Internet for job recruiting. In a a 2002 survey by staffing.org, a nonprofit group that studies hiring practices, employer-respondents identified Web postings as the most effective way of filling jobs, 3.23 on a scale of 5.
Still, many experts scoff at the Internet. Mr. Van Horn of the Heldrich Center called it "a good research tool, but not necessarily a great way to get a job."
Mr. Challenger was even more blunt and dismissive. "The Internet," he said, "is the worst thing that could have happened to a lot of job seekers."
That is because Internet job postings frequently generate so many applications that the likelihood of getting a response can be akin to winning the lottery. And while the Internet actually provides its own networking opportunities, with chat rooms and message boards, that sense of openness often deceives people into thinking they are doing enough by staying home and surfing the Web. According to Mr. Van Horn, Mr. Challenger and other employment experts, the most important thing in finding work is still human contact.
The tactic worked for Mr. Hardiman. He knew someone who knew someone else at the Career Education Corporation, which owns the Pittsburgh Culinary Institute. It was through these connections that Mr. Hardiman got his interview and, ultimately, a job offer. "In the end," he said, "friends care about friends, and they help."

Class of 2003: What They Wanted, What They Got

BYLINE:  Interviews by Laura Randall.

 BODY:
Nadeim Massa, 26, Westchester, Calif.
Bachelor's degree in finance, California State
University, Northridge. Management trainee, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Hawthorne, Calif.
 THERE was a time when I was spending a third of my day on the computer, checking all the job sites like Monster.com and submitting my resume online. I got tired of doing that. I knew I wanted to do something in automotive research. I applied to J. D. Power & Associates and another firm that specializes in that, but they said I didn't have the experience they were looking for. 
 Then I heard about an entry-level job opening at Nissan. I tried to contact the human resources department about it, but I couldn't get through to the right person. 
Finally, I drove to their U.S. headquarters in Gardena, Calif. with my resume. The security guards wouldn't let me in, so I waited around in the parking lot until I found someone who worked in marketing and sales. I explained what I was doingthere, and he took me up and introduced me to someone in H.R. I handed her my resume and she was nice about it, but I didn't get the job. That kind of broke my heart.
After that, I sent my resume to Enterprise. It was out of desperation. I didn't think I'd want to work there, but a friend from school knew someone who had just been hired. A representative from the company had also spoken to the Student Finance Association at school, so I was aware of them. 
I submitted a resume online, and was hired after two interviews. I started on July 21. I had a week of training and orientation, then I was assigned to a branch office. There were 11 or 12 people in my training group. They weren't all new grads either. Pretty much everyone starts as a trainee, then you move up. 
Eventually I'd like to get promoted to a managerial position, maybe in charge of a region someday. You can make good money there; we begin in the low 30's. I put in an average of 50 to 55 hours a week and work every other Saturday. Basically, I do everything: type tickets, settle accounts, answer the phones. Sometimes, we've got to wash the cars.

HEADLINE: REACHING OUT; 
Staying Focused On Diversity Goals In Harder Times

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW

 BODY:
IN the summer of 2000, with Wall Street starting to squirm in the softening economy, Subha Barry walked into the Merrill Lynch branch in Princeton, N.J., with an idea about diversity. Ms. Barry wanted to market the firm's services to fellow South Asians in the region. She was nervous.
 When she had joined the securities firm as a financial adviser 11 years earlier, she had been the first nonwhite adviser in her branch. During the flush years that followed, she had felt encouraged as the firm set, and largely met, goals that wove a spectrum of faces and ages and ethnic backgrounds into its 72,000-member work force. Merrill Lynch seemed willing to try anything to woo new clients. 
 But then the stock market dropped in early 2001, and with it, profits at Merrill Lynch. Scandals followed, involving Enron and Martha Stewart. The firm cut its budget and eventually shed a third of its employees, more than 23,000 jobs. Earnings are up now, but more staff reductions are still possible. 
So, where did that leave Ms. Barry and her program?
"We got it, but it was made painfully clear to me that money was tight and success had to come quickly," she said. "We had to treat the program like a small business. We watched our money like that. We took the company van or the train, not a car service. We flew coach."
When the economy soured and unemployment soared two years ago, watchdog groups and human resource managers nationwide wondered whether the hunt for diversity, a goal that only recently had gained popular momentum, would privately come to a standstill. For the most part, experts say the answer is no.
Some small businesses and manufacturers have shelved long-term searches for diverse staffs and shares of the global market in favor of short-term financial survival. A few larger companies in the financial services sector have put their diversity programs into a proverbial holding pattern, cutting little but adding just as much in the way of recruiting and training. 
Interviews with nearly two dozen diversity experts and Fortune 500 companies reveal, however, that well-established corporations have grown increasingly sophisticated in defining and managing diversity, allowing most businesses to promote it quietly even in lean times. They say anything else would hurt business, not to mention reputations.
This evolution can seem jarring when it is measured against the recent recession. As of September, the unemployment rate of African-Americans is still more than twice the rate of whites, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half a million Hispanics, about 3.5 percent of their working population, had lost jobs and were unable to find work because of the unsteady economy, compared with 2.5 percent of the general population, according to a recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center, a research organization in Washington.
Yet the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which handles cases of workplace discrimination nationwide, has not seen a spike in the number of race- or sex-related complaints, even after the onslaught of last year's layoffs. Race-related complaints actually dropped 2 percent from 1999 to 2002, the last year for which the commission had figures. Age-related complaints, however, rose 5 percent during the same period.
"I'm encouraged because we're a mirror of what's going on in the workplace, and when anything goes wrong there, it usually shows up here," the commission's chairwoman, Cari M. Dominguez, said. 
"But employers are catching on," she said. "They're still looking for a level of uniqueness, and I think they're really beginning to embrace a definition of diversity that is much broader than the dictates of the law. How important is it now to keep a diverse staff to meet the needs of the company? That answer is always changing."
Many companies still operate by the last-hired, first-fired principle of job cuts, but the sting of discrimination is increasingly rare in industries where women and minority employees are spread evenly in the ranks, said Michael Hyter, the president of Novations/J. Howard & Associates, a consulting business in Brighton, Mass., that offers diversity training to businesses. 
Mr. Hyter said that companies have recently learned the value of diversity councils, in the eyes of both their clients and employees. Merrill Lynch recently installed such a board, staffed by senior managers of its biggest clients, to advise on hirings and dismissals.
Companies still grapple with diversity, however, and it is the smallest companies that have struggled the most since the economy has faltered.
Since 2001, for example, the number of full-time employees at ServiceWare Technologies, a software manufacturer in Oakmont, Pa., has dropped to 56 from 200. The company, which has clients like H&R Block and Cingular Wireless, lost $14.5 million in 2000 and another $12.6 million in early 2001. That is when its new president, Kent Heyman, decided to make severe staff cuts. Since then, the company has posted a small profit. 
But in the name of financial survival, Mr. Heyman said he had overlooked diversity considerations when he made the cuts, even though most of his staff members are white. He said that his employees, no matter what their sex or color, blamed the economy, not discrimination, for the layoffs.
"There is so much more risk of a disparate class in a big company's downsizing," he said. "Here, every person counts, because when you ask your managers to curtail capacity, someone has to pick up the slack. So you absolutely have to keep the right people. Maybe someday we can make a social effort to be better, but right now our shareholders want the company to survive."
Even larger companies with strong diversity records, like TIAA-CREF and Lucent Technologies, have been reeling in recent months from layoffs and tight budgets. For now, both have expanded only a little, and instead have placed their diversity hopes in long-established programs, albeit on a smaller scale.
Stephanie Cohen Glass, a spokeswoman for TIAA-CREF, said, "We have not backed off our affirmative action goals, but the opportunity to achieve them has slowed, mostly related to not having positions to fill."
At Lucent, the changes have been subtle. Since it was spun off from the AT&T Corporation in 1996, Lucent, a telecommunications company, has sponsored science scholarships as well as networking groups made up of people of various ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations. Though Lucent continues to sponsor these programs, the networking groups now hold cheaper, regional meetings rather than the lavish, $50,000 national conferences they offered in the past. In 2000, Lucent hired 70 high school and college students from Inroads, a nonprofit organization in St. Louis that places minority youths in various industries. Last summer, the company hired 20 Inroads scholars, said Pam Kimmet, the senior vice president for human resources at Lucent.
Perhaps the most accurate reading of the economy's effect on diversity in the workplace comes from the workers themselves.
In late 2001, Laurence F. Pulgram and other managing partners at Fenwick & West, a law firm in Mountain View, Calif., decided to formalize plans for increasing diversity at the firm. Not only did Fenwick & West want to recruit more women and minority applicants, it was also forced by the economy to scrutinize its high turnover rates, especially among minority employees. While it attracted high numbers of minority workers, it did not have the managerial support to keep them long term. And it put the cost of replacing a departing worker at $200,000.
Dorian Cartwright, a junior associate specializing in patent law at Fenwick & West, was warily optimistic about the plan. He joined the firm as a summer associate in 2000, when the workload was excessive and no one had time for corporate self-reflection. He had little time himself for it, either, but felt the burden of being a new lawyer and an African-American. In both regards, he recalled, he sometimes felt as if he had to prove something extra to feel equal at the firm. 
But as the diversity initiatives were quietly rolled out, Mr. Cartwright spoke with the firm's new diversity consultant. He joined a committee evaluating how work assignments were divided up. He was assigned three mentors. And almost imperceptibly, he felt his burden lift a bit. Last month, he joined the firm's chairman at a job fair at a historically black college.
"If the diversity thing had been unveiled as a stiff announcement, it wouldn't have worked, especially in tough times," Mr. Cartwright said. "But they built some consensus among the associates, so we saw it as having to do with understanding, not catering."
As for Subha Barry, the Merrill Lynch adviser hoping to woo South Asian clients, she has performed so well that her staff of 3 recently grew to 10 -- 2 South Asians, 3 Hispanics, one African-American and 4 white women.
"We just need a token white man now," she said, chuckling. "Only I can get away with saying that, right?"

Bright Spot: Why These Factories Are Bustling

BYLINE:  By BARNABY FEDER

 BODY:
LEE DIMOND, a 55-year-old resident of Tilton, N.H., who has spent 30 years working in a variety of manufacturing jobs, has been scrambling for his paychecks in recent years. In 1999, the owner of a factory in nearby Laconia, where Mr. Dimond was supervising production of spikes for golf shoes, relocated the business to China. 
 Mr. Dimond moved down the street and the manufacturing heirarchy, taking a job planning production schedules for an aircraft component factory owned by Lewis & Saunders. But when the military contract that the plant was working on finished last year, so did the job. 
 Mr. Dimond recently got his third job in the same industrial park, this time at MedSource Technologies, a company based in Minneapolis, that designs and manufactures medical equipment components as well as finished devices sold under other manufacturers' names. He has moved even farther down the job chain, as an assembler, but this time he is optimistic that the job will be around as long as he wants it and there will be plenty of opportunities to move into more challenging work. 
"My future here is unlimited," Mr. Dimond said.
Here, in this case, is one of 11 factories owned by MedSource, which has not only been hiring in Laconia, where it employs about 135 people, but also adding on to its factory there, in anticipation of more growth.
"When you see one factory adding on and everybody else cutting back, it's hard not to notice," Mr. Dimond added.
While MedSource is a small employer compared with the flagships of the industrial economy like cars, steel and chemicals, medical-equipment makers as a whole are a segment that is expanding employment as well as production.
Medical equipment makers offer clues as to what factors provide strength in manufacturing, the economy's weakest area. These include a broad demographic trend driving demand, rapid innovation that puts a premium on skilled labor and flexibility and government regulations that add to the burden of possibly moving abroad, experts say. 
"With the aging population and the products and services we provide, I don't see how we can't continue to grow," said Joan Sullivan, 57, a longtime employee in the highly cyclical electronics industry who was hired this summer to procure packaging and materials for Linvatec, a subsidiary of Conmed, in Largo, Fla. Linvatec makes power tools for surgery and implants, imaging equipment and implantable screws, pins and other devices for orthopedic surgery.
True, the job growth in medical equipment has been uneven and modest. From 1991 to 2001, the total employment for the sector rose to 313,000 from 280,000. A brief recession in that period led to a loss of 8,000 jobs, but in the last year nearly 5,000 jobs have been added back, said Rakesh Shankar, an economist who covers the health-care sector for Economy.com, a market-research company in West Chester, Pa. 
"Much like the pharmaceutical industry, a lot of growth is coming from small companies," Mr. Shankar said. "Small firms are what drive the industry."
Such fragmentation has set the stage for a constant wave of small-business failures and consolidations that eliminate jobs even as the industry grows. Last May, for example, the CooperSurgical subsidiary of Cooper Companies bought Prism Enterprises in San Antonio, to add Prism's products to the line of obstetrical equipment that Cooper sells, immediately announcing plans to move production to other Cooper factories by early next year. That cost Texas 113 jobs.
Analysts say, as Ms. Sullivan observed, that the relatively bright employment outlook for the industry assumes there will be a growing demand as the baby boomer generation ages. 
"All of our big orthopedics manufacturers are expanding," said Joy McCarthy-Sessing, the president of the Warsaw-Kosciusko County Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw, Ind., which is home to some of the nation's largest orthopedics manufacturers, including Zimmer, Biomet Orthopedics and DePuy. The local unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent in August from 4.9 percent in August 2002, Ms. McCarthy-Sessing said.
The medical-equipment sector is also riding a wave of innovation driven by advances in electronics, miniaturization and the design of novel or purer materials. "We're constantly redoing our products," said Mark Snyder, a vice president for manufacturing at Linvatec. Mr. Snyder said about 60 percent of the company's product line had changed in the last three years, which was one reason Linvatec's work force in Largo, Fla., is more than 1,000 and increasing.
"We are a very high-mix, low-volume business that is not conducive to automation," Mr. Snyder said. 
"We used to use a lot of temps," Mr. Snyder said, "but now we have more permanent workers because more skills are required in work cells."
Higher volume products that are regarded as commodities, like gloves and tubing, are increasingly made overseas. But medical-equipment companies are not as quick to move overseas as other makers of consumer goods because many medical products can only be made in factories approved by the Federal Drug Administration. Although industry giants like Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Baxter International have huge worldwide operations, the industry continues to export more than it imports. 
One big lift is coming from China, which imported $1.25 billion in medical equipment last year. The Chinese market is growing at double-digit rates, and American manufacturers claim 34 percent, far ahead of second-ranked Germany at 21 percent.

HEADLINE: REACHING OUT; 
When Networking, Think Wider

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
WHEN Bernard Ussher lost his job about six months ago, he dutifully joined a networking group -- called Wind, for Wednesday Is Networking Day -- and spent one day each week exchanging advice and leads with other out-of-work executives. 
 But his latest job interview came through a different connection, a woman he knew from a folk-dancing group, whose name he had put on an e-mail list for a personal newsletter he had been sending to friends and professional acquaintances, updating them with news about his life and his job search. 
 "While that was fresh in her mind, she ran into these people with a job," Mr. Ussher said, adding that the job she told him about was what he had been looking for. 
Experts in the job-seeking field say that Mr. Ussher's experience underscores an important truth about networking: that although people in the same unemployed boat may help you shape and prepare your job search, it is people with jobs who are more likely to hear about opportunities. When building networks, these experts advise, it is also important to break out of the usual molds.
"I think in a tough market people really have to go and scratch much deeper," said May Ann Lee, a longtime career counselor with Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, which provides job-related services to its vast alumni network. "I always advise people if you belong to one profession, never just network there -- go a little bit out of your comfort zone."
Richard Kraft, 47, who was a director for corporate financial reporting at the J. M. Huber Corporation, a mining and manufacturing company in Edison, N.J., for 16 years before being laid off, said that at first, the idea of going outside the traditional network was pretty foreign.
"When I had to look for a job before, you just checked with a few headhunters and advertisements and between the two of them you got something," he said. "This time around, I talked to friends, I talked to friends of friends."
Mr. Kraft said that sometimes he mentioned he was looking for a job and sometimes he simply tried to find information about companies he was interested in working for.
He became a member of the Financial Executives Networking Group, or Feng, an international organization that holds meetings and sends out an online newsletter with job-search tips and employment opportunities. 
Mr. Kraft also reached back to Villanova University, where he earned his undergraduate degree, and to Fairleigh Dickinson University, where he got his M.B.A., registering on both universities' alumni Web sites. He also contacted the online job-search network of a previous employer, Ernst & Young, and connected with people he knew at the accounting firm KPMG through his old job. In addition, he got in touch with numerous professional organizations.
"It's a little awkward at first," he said, "but I also feel awkward without a job."
Pam Lassiter, the author of "The New Job Security," suggests that people looking for work develop nontraditional approaches to networking, like getting involved in a community project or a nonprofit group. 
"You are more likely to get better leads from people you don't know well," Ms. Lassiter said. "The people you know well -- you probably know most of their networks."
Other experts stress that networking works best if the relationship feels mutually beneficial. "When you call somebody and ask them for a job lead, you've put the monkey on their back, and who has time to deal with that?" said Nick Corcodilos, the host of Ask the Headhunter, a Web site, and the author of the same-named book. 
That is why Van Smick, who was an unemployed marketing professional in Boston, tried to help himself by helping others. He decided to put his knowledge of product branding to work by speaking at networking seminars on how job seekers could market themselves better.
Ideally, experts say, networking is not to be reserved for the crisis of joblessness but should be pursued by people who already have jobs. That is why Mr. Smick will continue offering his job-seeking seminars even though he has landed a sales position with a Canadian telecommunications company. "Networking is part of my fabric these days," he said.
Mr. Kraft has been working as the director for external reporting and compliance at the Polymer Group, a manufacturer of hygiene and medical products, since August. He did not get his job through networking. Yet, he said, he would still cultivate those contacts because they might be handy if he ever became unemployed again.
"In my planner, usually each week or every other week, I make a couple of networking calls," Mr. Kraft said, both to keep the network alive and to help others. "The reality of being employed today is, you can't just exist in your own little bubble," he said. "You do that and you're going to end up getting burned."

HEADLINE: OPPORTUNITIES; 
Finding Shelter From the Storm In Real Estate

BYLINE:  By KAREN ALEXANDER

 BODY:
TWO kinds of people seem to know everybody in town: politicians and real estate agents. Because of the recession, Christina Shea went from one to the other.
 As a city councilwoman and formerly a two-time mayor of Irvine, Calif., Ms. Shea devoted the last decade to her political career, which paid as much as a part-time job but consumed most of her waking hours. But as her savings dwindled, she retired temporarily from politics at the end of 2000 to earn more money. (Last year, she was re-elected as councilwoman.) She started a consulting business in government relations, which faltered badly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
 So she went into real estate. She studied for the realtors' license exam for six weeks through a correspondence course, passed the test and began selling residential and commercial properties for a Century 21 broker in Irvine last fall. 
Ms. Shea is hardly alone in making the switch to the real estate industry. As other sectors of the economy have fizzled, hundreds of thousands of professionals have migrated to the real-estate field, drawn by the flexibility and independence of a career selling properties, and by the relative ease with which a person can enter the business, which happens to be booming.
Membership in the National Association of Realtors, the world's largest trade association, surged almost 18 percent in the last two years, to more than 950,000 agents and brokers (brokers are senior to agents). According to the association's most recent statistics, newcomers accounted for 75 percent of the organization's new members this year. An additional 48,000 members have been in the business less than two years.
Fueled by low interest rates and easy access to credit, the market for homes has been on the upswing since 1996, setting records for single-family-home sales every year, except 2000. Moreover, many investors view real estate as a relatively safe haven for their savings after the stock market bubble burst. By the end of this year, the number of transactions is expected to show another surge, with more than six million new and used homes trading hands.
The realtors association reported that the majority of people who entered the business switched from another line of work. Only 7 percent of realtors surveyed in 2001 said that selling homes had been their first career; 15 percent came from management positions, 14 percent from sales, 7 percent from education, and 6 percent had been homemakers.
The home-inspection business is also a popular second career, said Mallory Anderson, the executive director of the National Association of Home Inspectors, a nonprofit trade group in Minneapolis. "Most of the people coming into this were contractors or carpenters or worked construction," she said. "Their backs are tired and they want to do something else. They want to be their own boss." 
Matthew Cameron, a 35-year-old with a law degree, found his way into real estate after he lost his job as a high-tech consultant and spent a year seeking work. Mr. Cameron, who lives in San Francisco, never imagined himself selling houses, but after looking around, he realized that real estate seemed to be the only Bay Area industry that was doing well after the dot-com collapse that devastated the region's economy.
For all the flexibility and potential profits a career in real estate offers, it does not always translate into quick profits. After a year in the business, Mr. Cameron and Ms. Shea both say that although they enjoy the work, they have found it more difficult than they thought to make money.
Despite the considerable network Ms. Shea has developed in Irvine, she said that it took her a year to hit her stride. To get started, she spent about $3,000 on licensing fees, local and national association dues and signs and supplies. She spends nearly $400 a month on advertising, a sum she would like to increase when she can. 
"It's difficult to retool when you're 50 years old and haveto start thinking of a whole new career," she said.
Because of her city council duties, Ms. Shea works about 20 hours a week on real estate. She has cut back on the number of political events she attends so she can focus on business. "It just doesn't make any money," Ms. Shea said of the reception-and-dinner circuit she left behind. She also keeps up her consulting business and is a notary. 
Unlike Ms. Shea, Mr. Cameron began his real estate career without access to a wide range of acquaintances in the region. In fact, Mr. Cameron, who was laid off from his consulting job with Deloitte & Touche in October of 2001, had just moved to San Francisco to live with his partner. He knew the real estate business would not be easy. "I braced myself," he said, adding, "I've been surprised by how tough it can be."
It took Mr. Cameron nine months to close his first deal. "I was getting extremely worried," he said. "I was starting to get pressure at home. We really needed another income."
Searching for ways to attract customers, Mr. Cameron arranged a home-buying seminar at the campus of the University of California, San Francisco, where his partner is a medical resident. But barely any of the 26 people who attended the presentation could afford to buy a home in the region. "Unless you can get into the mid-$300,000 range, you are extremely limited here," Mr. Cameron said. "A lot of the people that came, unfortunately, couldn't afford to go into that price range."
Although he is working with two clients now, and trying to stay optimistic, there are no guarantees that either client will strike a deal. "The main problem with real estate is, you don't ever know when your next paycheck is coming in," he said. "I have been second-guessing myself, and I still have feelers out there for a more regular job. If a decent, more permanent position came up that would pay me well, I'd consider it."
Real estate experts say that moving out of the field is almost as common as moving into it. "A lot of people enter the business, and a lot of people leave the business," said Kenneth Rosen, the chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. While it is relatively easy to enter real estate, "it does involve a lot of skill," he said. 
"It is very hard to make money in real estate, even in a good market," Mr. Rosen added. "There's a lot of substance to it, and it's a much more professional activity than one would think."
Like the stock-market bubble, the real estate boom will eventually experience a slowdown, Mr. Rosen said. Although he does not foresee a drastic fall in real estate prices, he predicts that activity will drop as much as 20 percent over the next several years. 
"Interest rates will go up, and lending will be tightened," Mr. Rosen said. And the backlog of people who were waiting to buy houses, he added, "has pretty much been eliminated" in this current boom. Even though first-time home buyers are always entering the market, the frenzied pace of transactions is bound to slow down.
According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of existing homes will decline 7 percent next year, and new-home sales will fall 10.4 percent. If those predictions are realized, 2004 will still be the third best year for home sales on record.
Mr. Cameron said he was learning on the job. For his next presentation at the University of California, San Francisco, which he is planning for early next month, Mr. Cameron said he would aim the publicity more toward the doctors and medical residents who can afford the market. And he recently left a nationally affiliated brokerage to work for a smaller, more locally focused firm, which agreed to let him keep 65 percent of his earnings. At the larger brokerage company, he had to split his commissions 50-50.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GENERATION; 
Class of 2003: What They Wanted, What They Got

BYLINE:  Interviews by Laura Randall.

 BODY:
Chanda J. Davis, 22, Cincinnati
Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, Northwestern University. Engineer, package development, the Procter & Gamble Company, Cincinnati.
 THE economy got really bad the year before I graduated, so we all knew what we were going to be faced with. I started the summer before, looking at job postings on my own. By the time I got to school my senior year, I knew the elements of the job I wanted. I wanted to be in a position where I was going to be around people, and it had to be engineering-related. I had already spent four years in college with mechanical engineering and, by God, I was going to use something that I learned. 
 Getting started early was the key. I interviewed with two companies in the fall of my senior year, P. & G. being one of them. I went in for my second interview during Christmas break and was offered a position on the spot. The salary exceeded my expectations, and I think that's from the downturn happening when we were juniors and we had already lowered our expectations. When everybody started getting frantic about jobs, I already had something lined up. I kept it to myself. I wouldn't talk about my position or the offer unless someone asked about it because I knew that lots of folks didn't have jobs. There was a lot of confusion and nervousness in the air.
I feel blessed because I found a job that I actually like, and then you have someone who scored really high on his G.M.A.T.'s and he's driving a paint truck because he doesn't have any work experience. That's a real example.
I wasn't sure about moving to Cincinnati at first. People would ask, "Where do you want to go?" and being a recent grad, you want to go to the places where there's lots of young people, lots of things to do, so you automatically think Chicago or New York. When I got the offer, I had to think about it a bit, because Ohio was not the place I wanted to go. Now I'm opening up to the city.
I started a week after graduation. At the beginning, it was overwhelming. I talked to people here and they said, you're going to be lost for about a year. I started with responsibilities on Day 1. It's a drawn-out process being comfortable with the 40-plus-hour workweek and being comfortable with being an adult. I would come home for the first two weeks and go right to sleep and wonder where my day went.

HEADLINE: THE NEW GENERATION; 
Youthful Attitudes, Sobering Realities

BYLINE:  By JULIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
PATRICK KEYES, a senior partner and director for business development at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, the advertising agency in New York, enjoys acting as a mentor to his young staff members. Mr. Keyes, 40, says it is a powerful substitute when he cannot agree to their demands for raises or bonuses. 
 "After we complete a pitch for new business," he said, "there are always opportunities to tell them what they did right, or explain how they might have done it better." 
 Mr. Keyes's coaching can be quite specific, particularly when young people are too casual in communicating with senior executives. "I had to explain," he said, "that it wasn't the best idea for a junior person to conclude an e-mail to the president of Ogilvy with, 'Thoughts?' " 
In many ways, his comments capture the attitudes of America's newest labor force, 30-something workers -- the so-called Generation X -- and their 20-something counterparts, Generation Y, who are old enough to be starting careers. This group, ages 20 to 34, makes up roughly a third of the working population, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
These younger workers are often viewed as demanding, self-absorbed and presumptuous, but also as ambitious, free-thinking and eager to learn. They form "a dramatically different labor market that is changing not just the way people are hired and fired, but also how they view their jobs, their employers and their careers," said Peter Cappelli, the author of "The New Deal at Work: Managing the Market-Driven Workforce" and a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Because of an unsettled economy and an employment market that has not been kind to these workers, they think there is no reward for loyalty and are reluctant to make long-term commitments. Though they have been called disloyal and unwilling to pay their dues, the reality is that they are adapting to a workplace in which "corporations broke the old arrangement unilaterally," Professor Cappelli said. "They've seen what's gone on with their parents' generation, and a lack of trust in the corporation is a perfectly rational response to that."
This lack of trust is giving rise to another phenomenon, a sense of free agency among young workers who expect to create lifetime careers not with one or two companies, but as independent contractors, selling their services on a project basis to many employers. Each new job is a new negotiation -- for pay, obviously, but also for control of the working environment, balance between work and private life and training for the next job. 
According to Bruce Tulgan, the founder of RainmakerThinking, a consulting firm in New Haven that studies young workers: "Free agency has swept across the entire work force. Skilled workers of all ages are trading stability for mobility."
The strain is most developed in the 30-something workers who have never known a stable workplace and grew up mainly as self-reliant latchkey children. "As a result," Mr. Tulgan, 36, said, "X'ers are used to facing problems on our own and have great confidence in our ability to fend for ourselves." 
That may explain why young workers seem to be self-centered in their approach. "The things they ask us about are benefits, rewards and career opportunities -- the things that impact 'me' -- rather than where are we going to be as a company in 10 to 15 years," said John Lankford, the director for management education and leadership development at Oakwood Healthcare in Dearborn, Mich., who recruits young workers. 
Mr. Tulgan views this as a sophisticated response to a workplace that operates without the myth of job security. In the last two decades, businesses have embraced large layoffs in the name of cost cutting while reducing benefits for those employees who somehow escaped the scythe. "They don't want to be suckers," he said of younger workers. "They look around and say: 'Don't tell me about the long-term. Do you think I'm a fool?' "
The current economy is putting the concept of free agency to the test. Unemployment is higher among younger workers than in the general population. As of September 2003, the national unemployment rate was 6.1 percent, but it was 10.9 percent for those 20 to 24 and 6.3 percent for those 25 to 34, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Jeff Taylor, the chairman and founder of the Internet bulletin board Monster.com, said that "of the college class of 2003, 93 percent are still looking for full-time employment." Monster.com, which is aimed at workers of all ages, is popular with young people. On Oct. 21, an online poll of 4,570 visitors to the site revealed that when finding a job, 71 percent planned to stay put, 14 percent expected to move on within two months and 14 percent planned to leave within six months.
These numbers, while reflecting the state of the job market, also highlight the mixed message that many young workers send out: though leery of company loyalty, they long for a stable and comfortable work environment. 
Though a better economy might encourage David Wallsh to start looking around, he plans to stay in his current job. At 25, he is a customer- care consultant for LendingTree.com, an Internet lending service in Charlotte, N.C. He was hired in July 2001, and it is his fourth job since he graduated from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa. A psychology major who wanted to go into human resources, Mr. Wallsh received no job offers after he graduated, so he took jobs as a desk clerk in two hotels and then answered phones at a bank's call center. 
He found out about LendingTree at a job fair, and his first position was working the night shift answering e-mail messages from customers. It took him more than six months to be hired permanently, but now he has been promoted and is working days.
At this point, he said: "My seniority is more important than a paycheck. I might want to become a loan officer."
ANOTHER young person who finds herself driven by the economy into doing work she never expected to do is Keeley Canning Luhnow, 28. She graduated from Wake Forest University School of Law in Winston-Salem, N.C. in May 2002, expecting to practice hospitality law. Though her husband had a job in San Diego, she was willing to relocate for an opportunity to join a big law firm. But she received no offers from firms in any of the cities she and her husband were willing to move to, so she accepted a position as an associate in a one-person firm in La Mesa, Calif., specializing in elder law. 
"I wasn't very keen on elder law when I took the job," she said, "but I've grown to like it. My future depends on what happens with the job market, but my employer hopes I'll inherit her practice."
Experts predict that although young workers are glad to have jobs now, they will grow restless once the economy improves. And when employers start vying for these young workers again, experts say, they will have to make an effort to overcome the young people's cynicism and deal with their contradictory behavior. 
"These young people have moved a lot and they come from broken marriages," said Chris Widener, the president of Made for Success, a leadership consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash. "They look for stability, community, security in the workplace, and if they don't get it they'll move on to another employer." 
Regina Richardson, 26, a senior sales manager at the Millennium Hotel in Cincinnati, has been with the company for four years. What keeps her there, she said, is a boss who "pushes me to achieve what is seemingly unattainable, so I can move ahead with my career." Plus, she said: "It's a friendly place. We all know each other's kids' names and dogs' names."
Even so, Ms. Richardson is not sure she will stay with the company for the long haul. She was raised by a single mother, whom she is proud of and who has worked in the registrar's office at Pennsylvania State University for nearly 18 years. "She's very happy where she is," Ms. Richardson said. "But where the older generation considers it stability, I consider it being stuck." 
Christian Reyes, 28, a senior quality assurance engineer at Electronic Arts, an entertainment software developer in Redwood City, Calif., is equally wary. "We all have these hopes that there will be opportunities for us to build loyalty to the job, though we're cynical," he said. Mr. Reyes has had three jobs since graduating from college. Most of his friends, he said, did the dot-com hopscotch, and most have settled for pay cuts and temporary jobs in the aftermath of the Internet bust.
Complicating life for many employers is that with Gen X'ers, everything is apparentlyopen for negotiation. "This is a generation that is used to asserting itself," said Jeff Chambers, the vice president for human resources at SAS, a software company in Cary, N.C. "They know they are mobile; they know they have opportunities." 
Judith Gerberg, the director of Gerberg & Company, a career counseling service in New York, said that many young workers were used to negotiating with their parents "and they bring this behavior into the office."
Mr. Lankford, the health care recruiter, said that young workers often challenged company policies on matters like tuition reimbursement. "Their attitude is, 'Why won't you pay for this?' " he said. "Instead of accepting that these are our policies, they'll say: 'Let's talk about making an exception.' Or, 'Let's change the policies.' " 
Mr. Lankford, 52, said he was inclined to extend himself not only because the health care industry is in a ferocious bidding war for talent but also because "these people think out of the box." 
A frequent point of negotiation is the work-life balance. "No matter how bad the economy gets, these workers won't work in an environment they don't like," said Ann A. Fishman, president of Generational Targeted Marketing, a research company in New Orleans. "They are willing to give up salaries to have quality of life in the workplace."
Young workers are turned off by having to put in "face time." For instance, they think, why can't we tote our laptops to the wireless cafe and log in from there? 
"The old 40-hour workweek just doesn't apply," said Conrad Sam, 29, director for sales and marketing at Smashing Ideas, a Web site developer in Seattle. "The average age here is 27 or 28, and people come in when they want. If there's work to be done, you'll stay and do it. No one I know would ever work for anyone where there's a premium on face time." 
Education and training are other negotiating matters: free agents quickly discover that survival depends on keeping their skills current. "They want to learn constantly because once they stop learning, they stop being viable," said Heather Neely, a consultant at RainmakerThinking. 
Ultimately, many experts think that negotiation as a model is unsustainable because it causes each employee to focus on his or her own needs instead of the task at hand. "But what does work is giving people latitude around their working conditions," said Rebecca Ryan, the founder of Next Generation Consulting, a company in Jackson, Wis., that advises businesses on how to attract young talent.
Managing younger workers can be challenging. Bosses sometimes complain about these employees' short attention spans and habits like talking to friends via cellphone or by instant messaging or downloading music while engaged in job-related tasks. 
"Multitasking is a myth," said Jennifer B. Kahnweiler, the founder of About You, a career counseling company in Dunwoody, Ga. "I watch my daughters talking on the phone while instant-messaging someone else, watching television and reading a book. You can't transfer that to the business environment. It won't work -- you lose something important if you don't pay attention." 
Yet the appeal of young workers springs from many of the traits that drive their bosses crazy, especially their independence and belief that they should be given special projects, rather than dues-paying chores.
"They are willing to take on tasks they have no knowledge about and they fearlessly march ahead," Mr. Keyes said. "I like that."

HEADLINE: A U.S. Rebirth for Mexico's Comic Legend 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
As Mexico's greatest comic actor before his death at 81 a decade ago, Cantinflas was so revered in the Spanish-speaking world that the verb "cantinflear" entered the Spanish language to describe using as many words as possible to say almost nothing of substance.
 Until recently, the impact Cantinflas had in the United States was thought to be limited to his role as Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's devoted valet in the 1956 film "Around the World in 80 Days." Less was known about Cantinflas's long sojourns in the United States, which produced few films but lasting impressions and one unforgettable romantic relationship. 
 As part of a wider rediscovery of the work of Cantinflas (pronounced cahn-TEEN-flas; his real name was Mario Moreno Reyes), a new play has begun to jar memories of the actor. The play, called "Cantinflas!" and written and performed largely by the actor Herbert Siguenza of the Los Angeles-based comedy trio Culture Clash, opens in Los Angeles on Wednesday after playing to good crowds here. 
The production comes amid a broader recognition of his importance to Latino artists in the United States like the Puerto Rican author Victor Hernandez Cruz, who described Cantinflas as "the poet exiled from the dictionary." Although Cantinflas is still seen as somewhat of a negative stereotype by some Mexican intellectuals, he is a symbol of Hispanic creativity in this country, said Ilan Stavans, a professor of Latino studies at Amherst College.
"The process of rehabilitating Cantinflas from someone ghettoized in pop culture into an icon of empowerment is not surprising," said Mr. Stavans, the author of a scholarly essay on the actor, "The Riddle of Cantinflas." "There's something satisfying in delving into the complex character who so easily touched the lives of Mexicans everywhere."
Acted 70 percent in Spanish and 30 percent in English, "Cantinflas!" explores the actor's start as a performer in a tent show in the gritty border city of Ciudad Juarez, then follows his career as he became an icon of Mexican cinema and took the stage name of Cantinflas, a play on words referring to talking big or drinking heavily in a barroom. 
The decision to perform the play mostly in Spanish was Mr. Siguenza's. Mr. Siguenza, a child of Salvadoran immigrants who bears an uncanny stage resemblance to Cantinflas, reproduces passages from the actor's films.
"You can't easily translate Cantinflas into English for the same reason you can't easily do Groucho Marx in Chinese," Mr. Siguenza said in an interview. "It's a challenge to do Cantinflas in the original, but there's no other way."
Audiences at Houston's Alley Theater reacted enthusiastically. Cantinflas lived in the city in the 1970's and 80's.
"Mario came to Houston and liked it here first and foremost because it was my town," said Joyce Jett, a former appliance store manager who shared her life with Cantinflas for more than 20 years. Their relationship ended in a legal battle in 1991 that recognized her as his common-law wife and initially awarded her a divorce settlement of about $26 million; later the two settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.
Cantinflas, who accumulated an estimated $100 million after making 49 films in a 50-year career, met Ms. Jett while shopping for lighting fixtures in Houston for a home he was building in Mexico. His first wife, a Russian-born actress named Valentina, died in 1966.
Ms. Jett, who attended the opening of "Cantinflas!," was so overcome with emotion by the end of the play that she gave Mr. Siguenza a pair of Cantinflas's sunglasses with the name "Cantinflas" etched into them.
"I was skeptical that someone could master the details of Mario's performances so well," she said in an interview. "The play brought back a lot of different emotions." 
Others who knew Cantinflas had similar reactions. Al Zarzana, the former owner of a chain of Spanish-language movie theaters in Texas, said the play made him remember the efforts Cantinflas made to find anonymity away from fans. They rarely worked. "Wherever we went there would be a native Spanish speaker who would recognize Mario and want to talk to him and embrace him," Mr. Zarzana said.
In Houston, the recent interest in Cantinflas was fueled not just by his status as a Latino icon, but also by economics. The bankruptcy filing two years ago of one of the Alley Theater's largest donors, the Enron Corporation, left the theater struggling; for the Alley, where just 3 percent of the subscribers are Latino, "Cantinflas!" was a way to tap into the city's growing Latino population. Latinos account for about a third of metropolitan Houston's population.
With the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, the Alley commissioned Mr. Siguenza to write and star in "Cantinflas!," which had its first run last year in San Francisco. Preliminary figures showed that the Alley was at more than 75 percent capacity for the play. Mostly the audiences appeared to be Latino, with many people at the Alley for the first time, Mr. Siguenza said.
Although "Cantinflas!" will run through Nov. 2 at the Cerritos Center and there is talk of taking the play to New York, Mr. Siguenza said he had no plans to play Cantinflas in Mexico.
Dr. Kerry Bloom, the actor's dentist here, remembered that Cantinflas was more than merely funny. "Mario was a very charming and generous man," he said. "He had that ability to light up everyone in a room, which is one of the attributes that made him great."

HEADLINE: COUNCIL CONTESTS: 19th District, Northeastern Queens; 
Queens Democrat's Fiscal Policy Assailed

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Two years ago, Tony Avella became the first Democrat elected in his northeastern Queens district in a decade. And since then, Mr. Avella has sought to establish himself as a public official in touch with the moderate-to-conservative sensitivities of his district.
 But now his opponent is assailing his record in one of the few New York City races in next week's general election that is seen as competitive. The candidate, Phil Ragusa, an accountant, is a vice chairman of the Queens Republican Party and has a long history of involvement in civic organizations in the district. He has sought to portray the councilman as a fiscally liberal official out of sync in the district. 
 The 19th Council District, in the far reaches of northeastern Queens, stretches along the Long Island Sound from College Point to Little Neck and Douglaston along the Nassau County border. It is a district with a suburban feel, its streets lined with one- and two-family houses.
Specifically, Mr. Ragusa, who is also running on the Conservative Party line, has made the issue of taxes the hallmark of his campaign, saying that his Democratic opponent has been quick to agree to tax increases.
"He has voted for nearly every tax increase that has been put before him," said Mr. Ragusa, 64, over the clamor in his campaign headquarters. "He voted for nearly every tax and every other spending program. He voted to increase the real estate tax, the sales tax and income tax."
But Mr. Avella, 52, is quick to point out that he was one of three council members to vote against the 18.5 percent increase in property taxes passed by the Council and signed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. That vote, he points out, earned him the rebuke of the Council speaker and made him persona non grata in the Bloomberg administration.
And so far as supporting some tax increases, Mr. Avella said, there was little choice.
"I don't think raising taxes is the solution to fiscal problems," Mr. Avella said. "But we asked the state and federal government for assistance with the city's budget problems. And with their response, we really didn't have another choice. We would have had to lay off police officers and to close senior centers. So I didn't see a way out of raising those taxes." Mr. Avella said he was proud that as chairman of the council's Committee on Zoning and Franchises, he has begun the process of closing what he calls loopholes in zoning laws. Too much of this residential swath of Queens, he said, has become overrun by development, with large, multifamily dwellings creeping into areas of single-family homes.
Development has also been an issue, with Mr. Ragusa criticizing Mr. Avella for accepting campaign contributions from developers who, he insists, are adding to the congestion of the district.
"As the chairman of the Committee on Zoning and Franchises, I think it's terrible that he has fund-raisers with that title on the invitations, and that he accepts money from developers," Mr. Ragusa said. "What's he saying to the people of this district?"
Mr. Avella argued that accepting contributions from developers or anyone else did not translate into additional access. "Because someone contributes to me doesn't mean that I will give them any more consideration than anyone else in this district," he said.
He dismisses his Republican opponent as one whose campaign strategy is reliant on attacks.
"I have been working over the last two years on the issues that are of concern to the people of this district, like overdevelopment and improving the schools," Mr. Avella said. "All he does is to go negative on me."
The lines of the 19th District have been redrawn since Mr. Avella's 2001 victory to include more of the eastern Queens neighborhood of Little Neck. That redrawing has enabled the district to maintain its Democratic enrollment at about 50 percent of the electorate (the rest are split evenly between registered Republicans and those who are unaffiliated or enrolled in minor parties).
In addition, Mr. Ragusa has been endorsed by a host of Republican notables, including former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, State Senators Serphin R. Maltese and Frank Padavan and Mr. Avella's predecessor in the council, Mike Abel.
Still, this is a district with an advantage in Democratic registration and an incumbent councilman. And Mr. Avella has a large fund-raising advantage, raising $113,000 and receiving an additional $70,000 in public matching funds. Mr. Ragusa has raised $38,000 and received $82,500 in public matching funds.
Mr. Avella, who has several labor endorsements but said he had not sought any from politicians, discounts any characterization of himself as the front-runner. "I don't take anything for granted," he said.

PERSON: Garrett Hardin 

HEADLINE: Garrett Hardin, 88, Ecologist Who Warned About Excesses 

BYLINE:  By STUART LAVIETES 

 BODY:
Garrett Hardin, an ecologist and author who warned of the dangers of overpopulation and whose concept of the "tragedy of the commons" brought attention to the damage that innocent actions by individuals can inflict on the environment, died at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif., on Sept. 14. He was 88.
 He and his wife, Jane, 81, committed suicide, said their son David. 
 Dr. Hardin, who suffered from a heart disorder, and his wife, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, were members of End-of-Life Choices, formerly known as the Hemlock Society.
An emeritus professor of biology and environmental studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Dr. Hardin introduced "the tragedy of the commons" in an essay published in 1968 in Science magazine. Examining the overgrazing of 19th-century community pastures, or commons, the article showed how depletion of a vital resource was brought about by those who continually increased the size of their herds out of self-interest.
Dr. Hardin presented this case as a cautionary tale for a modern society that was abusing the environment. He also argued that human society had an inherently destructive relationship to nature and naturally overexploited common resources.
His commons theory is frequently cited to support the notion of sustainable development, meshing economic growth and environmental protection, and has had an effect on numerous current issues, including the debate over global warming.
Dr. Hardin confounded many of his supporters with many of his prescriptions for solving the problem of overpopulation.
In a 1974 essay in BioScience magazine, "Living on a Lifeboat," he argued against aid to famine victims in Ethiopia, explaining that sending food would only contribute to overpopulation, which he saw as the cause of the country's problems.
Born in Dallas, Garrett James Hardin received a bachelor's degree in zoology from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in microbiology from Stanford. He joined the faculty of the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1946 and retired in 1978.
The author of 27 books and more than 350 articles, he continued writing until recently, receiving the 1997 Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award from the University of California for his continued scholarly productivity. 
He is survived by two daughters, Hyla Fetler of Santa Barbara and Sharon Clausen of Laytonville, Calif.; two sons, Peter, of Pine Grove, Calif., and David, of Santa Barbara; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Dr. Hardin, who contracted polio as a child and walked with the aid of crutches, saw his harsh message on overpopulation as a form of tough love. "There's nothing more dangerous than a shallow-thinking compassionate person," he said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times. "God, he can cause a lot of trouble."

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Jr. Throws His Support to Dean 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. said Monday that he would soon endorse Howard Dean for the Democratic presidential nomination, telling a mostly black audience on the South Side of Chicago that Dr. Dean had "the best chance to be the next president of the United States."
 "I'm not wasting my time with any more non-straight-talking candidates," Mr. Jackson said in introducing Dr. Dean, a former governor of Vermont, to a group of about 150 people at Chicago State University. 
 "I've seen him stand up for health care," he said. "I've seen him stand up for students. I've seen him stand up for ordinary Americans. I'm asking you to stand up for Howard Dean."
The support of Mr. Jackson, the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has been coveted by several presidential contenders in part because he carries some of theimprimatur of his father. He said after Dr. Dean's 45-minute question-and-answer session that he would "make it official in the next 7 to 14 days."
Dr. Dean, who governed a nearly all-white state, has been fighting to show that he can appeal to a wider swath of voters than the highly educated white liberals whom polls show rallying to his side.
Mr. Jackson joins his brother, Jonathan Jackson, a Chicago businessman and civil rights advocate, and Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn as better-known black leaders backing Dr. Dean.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, another prominent African-American in Congress, escorted Dr. Dean to two black churches in Detroit on Sunday. Two other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick of Detroit and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, have expressed interest in Dr. Dean, his aides said.
"Congressman Jackson has been one of the major new up-and-coming African-American leaders in this country, and he has been enormously helpful already," Dr. Dean said in an interview on Monday.
As for Mr. Jackson's father, he said, "We've spent a lot of time on the phone with him," adding, "He is probably the pre-eminent spokesman for civil rights and economic justice, so he's enormously important to a candidate like me."
Mr. Jackson, who earlier this month traveled with Dr. Dean from Washington to Charleston, S.C., said he had invited him home to his district, alone among the presidential candidates, because "I believe he is a man with great integrity."
In the rotunda of the Chicago State student union, Dr. Dean altered his standard stump speech to focus more on issues like discrimination in health care, support for historically black colleges, and affirmative action in the medical profession. In response to questions, he said he would seek a federal law allowing felons to vote.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: PENTAGON TRAVELER; 
Wolfowitz, a Planner of War, Sees It Up Close

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
The day had begun violently with a rocket attack on the Rashid Hotel, where he was staying, but Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, betrayed no sign of frustration or pessimism as his Air Force jet headed back to Washington late Sunday night.
 "We have witnessed or heard about hundreds of individual acts of courage by Iraqis and by Americans and by the other coalition partners who are working together to build a new and free Iraq," Mr. Wolfowitz told reporters invited into the Airstream trailer that served as his office inside the cargo plane. 
 He said he was moved by a town hall meeting in Hilla, near the ruins of ancient Babylon. He complimented "those remarkable women, including very traditional-looking Muslim women, who are nevertheless courageous enough to stand up for women's rights," and he saluted a first generation of advocates for "organizing a center for human rights in a country where human rights have been trampled on for 35 years so brutally." 
Mr. Wolfowitz landed in Washington on Monday, a day when suicide bombings in Baghdad killed about three dozen people and wounded more than 200. The affirmations of progress in the face of the continuing violence seemed to reflect both the Bush administration's determination to maintain a positive outlook on Iraq and his own personal investment in Washington's policy.
What Mr. Wolfowitz saw during his visit to Iraq illustrated the difficulties the administration faces in trying to pacify the country without establishing a new police state, a clash between promoting a nascent democracy and halting the violence. The trip, his second since the end of major combat in Iraq, also offered abundant evidence of how hard it may be to realize the goal of a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Iraq that Mr. Wolfowitz embraces and helped to place at the center of President Bush's foreign policy.
As the Bush administration's most cerebral advocate of unleashing the American military to oust Saddam Hussein, and one who has argued the case long before being appointed deputy defense secretary, Mr. Wolfowitz has a huge personal stake in success.
Certainly, the scene outside his room at the Rashid early Sunday morning was not one Mr. Wolfowitz had hoped to witness in a visit intended to spotlight the achievements of the American occupation of Iraq. 
It was a minute or two past 6 a.m., in the pastel light of a new day. Mr. Wolfowitz was already dressed in khakis and military desert boots, preparing for his first meeting, a 6:30 session with the Corps of Engineers to discuss electrical needs.
Suddenly the early-morning calm was broken by a series of muted thuds in the distance, and then the hotel shook as missiles drilled into the side of the building, one killing an American officer in a room one floor below Mr. Wolfowitz.
As screams for help echoed through hallways filling with smoke, Mr. Wolfowitz, according to his aides, ordered up a casualty count and asked for a security assessment. He spoke with the wounded gathering in the lobby, and inspected the damage. His flight surgeon treated one man whose feet were badly lacerated when he sought to escape over a path of broken glass.
Rejecting suggestions that he cut short his trip, Mr. Wolfowitz spent the rest of the day attending to his scheduled appointments, a walking symbol of the administration's determination to impose a reality in Iraq that violent events like the Sunday morning attack -- and the subsequent bombings on Monday -- have made more difficult to achieve. 
During the next 14 hours, Mr. Wolfowitz met with Muslim clerics, town council members and business leaders. He went out on patrol with members of the First Armored Division and inspected the rocket launcher seized after the attack on his hotel. He visited wounded from the Rashid at an Army combat support hospital.
Mr. Wolfowitz swears that his practical judgment is not clouded by optimism and faith, and each stop on his whirlwind trip was meant as a data point for his argument.
When he was asked whether the administration's plan to restore the Iraqi economy is stuck in first gear, he quoted the Polish commander, Maj. Gen. Andrzej Tyszkiewicz, who was the host at a lunch at the multinational division's headquarters at Hilla. The general said Poland had been free of Communist rule for almost a decade and a half, and still unemployment ran at 18 percent.
Mr. Wolfowitz stopped at a police station in Baghdad to greet Ahmed Ibrahim, a senior deputy minister of the interior, who was shot in the leg for his alliance with the American administration, and is back to work.
Inside the freshly painted police headquarters, Mr. Ibrahim showed Mr. Wolfowitz a newspaper article put out by supporters of a radical Shiite cleric who has discussed plans to set up his own government of Iraq. The article "targets him in an ugly and vicious way, and he said, 'I'm proud of this,' " Mr. Wolfowitz said. "It's just a wonderful spirit."
Security was a constant theme and a constant concern. Mr. Wolfowitz traveled from Baghdad to Hilla to Tikrit to Kirkuk by Black Hawk helicopter, its blades beating out the rapid metronome that sets the tempo for military operations in Iraq today. Gunners had their sights up and in the locked position from takeoff to landing.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA FIRES: BUSINESSES; 
Impact on Economy Could Be Short-Lived

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
At the Arrowhead Credit Union in San Bernardino, a handful of employees showed up for work on Monday in T-shirts and jeans. That was all the clothing they had left after losing their homes to California's raging wildfires. 
 "They have the clothes on their back right now," said Larry Sharp, chief executive of the credit union, which has 22 branches including one, in Crestline, that was evacuated and might have burned. "I don't have a clue right now if we have a branch in Crestline," Mr. Sharp said. 
 Still, the credit union was open, offering quick $3,000 loans to members to help them get back on their feet. That could be a symbol of how quickly business and the economy in California might rebound from the state's latest disaster. 
Economists and businesspeople say it is too early to estimate the property damage and economic impact from the wildfires, in part because they continue to burn. The damages will certainly be hundreds of millions of dollars because more than 900 homes have already been destroyed. But the damages could go much higher because thousands more homes are threatened. 
Still, while the fire is causing great personal distress, economists say that the $700 billion Southern California economy should be able to absorb the damage and that, judging from previous wildfires and earthquakes, the overall impact on the economy will be short-lived. 
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, in Palo Alto, said strikes involving grocery workers and Los Angeles transit workers now under way in Southern California were likely to have bigger impacts on the economy than the fires. 
Indeed, after the damage from the fires has been sustained, there can be a lift to the economy as people rebuild their homes and restock them with clothing and furniture. 
"There's kind of a perverse stimulative effect," said Michael Bazdarich, director of the forecasting center at the University of California at Riverside. "As a society, we're worse off because of the fire," Dr. Bazdarich said. But economic statistics look at output, he added, and that "records an uptick" because of rebuilding. 
Even that uptick, he said, may be small, if the number of houses that must be rebuilt stays at about 1,100. There are roughly 70,000 homes being built in Southern California this year, Dr. Bazdarich said. 
One thing that has mitigated the business impact of the fires, so far at least, is that the destruction has been mainly of homes, not businesses. That is because many of the fires are in foothills where there are few businesses. 
The Tamco steel factory in Rancho Cucamonga, east of Los Angeles, is two miles from where one of the largest fires started. But it has operated round the clock with little disruption other than that some employees have had trouble getting to work because of road closings, Jack Stutz, the chief executive, said. 
"It's more a story of personal calamity than it is impacting business," Mr. Stutz said of the fire. 
To be sure, there have been major business disruptions. Hundreds of flights into and out of Southern California have been canceled or delayed because a major air traffic control center near San Diego was evacuated on Sunday as a fire neared. 
"All the airports in Southern California are running at about 50 percent capacity," said Donn Walker, a spokesman here for the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr. Walker said he did not know when the control center would reopen, but that it would take several days after that for air traffic to return to normal. 
Tens of thousands of homes and businesses have lost electric power and utility officials said there was a danger of more widespread failures. 
But some transportation was moving smoothly. The Port of Los Angeles, one of the nation's busiest container ports, said it had not received any reports of interruptions from the trucks and railroads that take goods to and from the docks. "Everything seems to be going through," said Rachel Campbell, a spokeswoman. 
In San Diego County, many businesses were closed on Monday at the request of public officials. Still, it is not clear how many businesses have been damaged by the fire. 
San Diego has one of the nation's largest clusters of biotechnology companies, but those companies are concentrated along the coast in La Jolla, away from the fires, said Joseph Panetta, president of Biocom, a trade group representing the local biotech industry. Some operations may be impeded, however, because employees live throughout the county and may have been affected by the fires, Mr. Panetta said. 
Candysse Miller, executive director of the Insurance Information Network of California, a trade group representing insurers, said it was too early to estimate the payments insurance companies would have to make, but provided some guideposts. A fire in Laguna Beach 10 years ago destroyed 441 buildings, mostly homes, causing $350 million in insured losses, while one in the Malibu area that same year destroyed 323 structures and caused $375 million in insured losses. 
"We look at Laguna and Malibu and say those were catastrophes, they were tragedies," Ms. Miller said. "This is double that." 
The most damaging fire in the state, in the Oakland hills in 1991, destroyed 2,900 homes and caused about $1.7 billion in insured losses, she said. 
The fires come while California is struggling economically to some extent and faces a huge budget deficit. Those factors contributed to the recall this month of Gov. Gray Davis and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace him. 
The economic impact and the costs of fighting the fire could put further strain on the state budget and on local government budgets, which are also under strain. 
"It depends on whether the federal government steps in and helps us with this burden," said Phil Angelides, the state treasurer. 
The California Department of Finance estimates that it will cost the state $90 million to $100 million to put out the fires, said Anita Gore, a spokeswoman. She said the state expected to be reimbursed by the federal government for half of that. If that happens, she said, the state will not exceed the $70 million the current budget has allocated for emergency fire suppression.

HEADLINE: A Surge in Money Sent Home by Mexicans 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Nearly one Mexican in five regularly gets money from relatives employed in the United States, making this country the largest repository of such remittances in the world, according to a poll sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank.
 The pollster, Sergio Bendixen, estimates that the payments helped feed, house and educate at least a quarter of Mexico's 100 million people. 
 The poll was part of a report on Monday by the bank, which said money sent home by Mexican emigrants will soar to $14.5 billion this year, exceeding tourism and direct foreign investment to become this country's second most important source of income. Oil remains No. 1. 
Mr. Bendixen said the poll offered forceful evidence that remittances not only sustained the rural poor but have also become important to urban working-class households.
Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, estimated that annual remittances to Mexico and Central America could reach $25 billion by the end of the decade, a vast sum made of countless tiny payments by America's lowest-paid workers.
"This is not necessarily something to celebrate," said Don Terry, manager of the Multilateral Investment Fund. "It means that the Mexican economy is not expanding and so people have had to leave."
Indeed, in addition to showing a significant jump in remittances, the report opened a window onto the shifts in illegal immigration to the United States since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
In the wake of the attacks, the United States almost immediately dispatched more people and machinery to bolster law enforcement operations on its border with Mexico, and it was believed that the heightened security would discourage immigrants from their illegal crossings.
With fewer immigrants heading north, experts on both sides of the border predicted, remittances to Latin America would sharply decline. And the shrinking American economy was expected to force immigrants out of work, leaving them less money to send to relatives back home.
Those forecasts, according to the Inter-American Development Bank and immigration experts, have proved wrong.
Despite the increased risks of crossing the border, United States population estimates show that the northward flow continued to surge, and experts said the immigrant laborers had proved themselves resistant to a stormy economic climate.
Mexican immigration experts, including Rodolfo Garcia Zamora of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas, estimated that some 450,000 Mexicans entered the United States illegally last year. Mr. Suro said other evidence indicated that the American population grew last year by nearly one million people from Latin America. More than half, he estimated, had no legal status.
"For most Mexicans, the increased risks of crossing the border have had no impact on their willingness to migrate," Mr. Suro said. He recalled a focus group interview in which he asked a conference room full of Mexican men and women how many of them were considering migrating to the United States. They all raised their hands, he said.
The $14.5 billion in remittances reported by the bank marked a significant increase over the estimated $9 billion that emigrants reportedly sent home three years ago. The Mexican government estimated that remittances this year would reach $12 billion, but authorities at the bank said they had adjusted their figures to include money that had come into Mexico through informal channels.
Most of the money is spent on food, clothing and housing. But Mr. Suro said a growing portion was invested in small business or helped to pay for high school and college educations. 
Across much of central Mexico, where men and women have migrated to the United States for so many decades that crossing the border has become more a rite of passage than an escape from poverty, remittances exceed state public works budgets and pay to build roads, schools, water systems and baseball stadiums.
In recent years the United States and Mexico carried out reforms aimed at making it easier and more affordable for migrants to transfer money home. Companies like Western Union cut the fees they charged for wire transfers, halving the cost of transferring money, and American banks have begun allowing illegal immigrants to open accounts so relatives at home can withdraw funds from automatic teller machines.
Those changes have begun to ease the negative attitudes that Mexicans have long held toward financial institutions. Some 45 percent of people polled by the bank said they received their remittances from a bank or other credit institution, compared with only 7 percent in Guatemala and 17 percent in Ecuador.
The opening of more formal channels has made it easier to measure the cash flow, Mr. Terry said. And he said at least a part of the significant jump in remittances could be attributed to better accounting.
The figures have been the focus of an emerging debate among Mexican experts. At a conference last weekend in Zacatecas, several charged that the Mexican government had inflated remittance figures to help brighten an otherwise dreary economic report.

I.R.S. Is Expected to Retain Credits for Fuel Producers
The Internal Revenue Service appears to have signaled that it will not rescind billions of dollars' worth of tax credits for producers of coal-based synthetic fuel, consultants and lawyers say.
 Such an indication, they say, came in aletter the I.R.S. sent a big synthetic fuel producer saying that it plans this month to resume its consideration of new applications to produce the fuel. Producers have relied on the I.R.S. to issue what are known as private letter rulings as quasi-official confirmation that they qualify for credits. Page C3.

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: THE IMPACT; 
Fleet Customers Looking for Easier Transition

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
FleetBoston customers know about acquisitions. The company has bought more than 50 other banks over the last two decades, growing its assets to $196 billion from $39.5 billion in 1993. 
 Consumers' complaints in the wake of some of those acquisitions mirror those that have accompanied other bank mergers, which have proliferated in the last few years. In addition to higher fees, a phenomenon confirmed by the Federal Reserve and others, customers have cited customer service problems, inferior rates and the inconvenience of new account numbers. They also object to receiving sales pitches from the other branches of the acquiring bank. 
 But with Fleet as the bank being acquired this time, customers may be in for an easier transition. Bank of America has one of the better reputations among the larger banks for customer service. As a provider of home mortgages, it ranks as "better than most," said J.D. Power and Associates, and services like Gomez.com have also highly ranked its Web site.
 According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which is affiliated with the University of Michigan Business School, consumers' approval of Bank of America has risen steadily each of the last three year, although that level of customer satisfaction is 5 percent below the index's rating of commercial banks overall.
 "I had done business with some of the other big banks, and I was really surprised that Bank of America's customer service seemed to be quite good," said David Karmol of Great Falls, Va., who has a Bank of America credit card and has also refinanced his mortgage with the company. 
 "Not only did they have one of the most competitive deals, they made it really easy to do," said Mr. Karmol, 50, who is vice president for public policy at the American National Standards Institute.
 That would be welcome news for people like Laurie Brunner, an administrative assistant from Somerville, Mass., who became a Fleet customer after it acquired Shawmut National. She says that in the months after that merger Fleet failed repeatedly to update her mailing address, changed her checking account number without telling her, and recorded her ATM card as lost so that it was seized the next time she attempted to use it.
 "It was such a mess," Ms. Brunner, 33, said. "They've swallowed up numerous banks over the last decade, so you'd think they'd have it down to a science."
 She has since switched to a local bank with only eight branches. "I was sick of large banks," she said.
 Bank of America and Fleet are already working to reassure retail customers. They say the combination of the two banks, which have very little geographic overlap, will create what the two companies bill as the nation's most extensive banking network for consumers, with 5,700 branches and 16,500 ATM's.
 "We can make the case that the Fleet Boston customer gets access to unparalleled convenience and a broad overlay of products," said Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's chairman and chief executive. "We're not really worried about attrition."
 Tracey Mills, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, says that consolidation can improve customer service, and encourage other banks to do the same. "Competition really heats up around a merger," she said, particularly competition from community banks. "Community banks can jump on the opportunity to make changes."
 Commerce Bancorp, a regional bank based in Cherry Hill, N.J., has courted customers after other banks' acquisitions, particularly Fleet's. "It's hard to get people to switch banks, but when their bank is sold, that gives them a reason," said Vernon Hill II, Commerce's chairman. "Every one of these major mergers has caused major disruptions to the customers."
 In a Gallup poll sponsored by the American Banker, a trade publication, 54 percent of consumers surveyed in 2001 said that they were displeased with the service they received after their banks merged with other banks.
 The Federal Reserve's most recent annual report on banks' consumer fees suggested at least one reason for this. "As in previous years, many of the fees charged by multistate banks were found to be significantly higher than those charged by single-state banks," the Fed report said.
 Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said his organization had consistently found the same thing. "Bigger banks charge bigger fees," he said.
 "If you don't have competition and choice, then the powerful companies remaining don't have to do as good a job," he said, predicting that "further consolidation of the banking system is going to result in higher fees, less competition and I think poorer service in the long run."
 Fleet's acquisition of Bank Boston in 1999 was especially plagued with problems and analysts said the bank lost many customers. Jason P. Brinton of Cambridge, Mass., was a customer of Bank Boston for two years before Fleet bought it. After returning from a year of studying abroad, he said he was surprised to find that his terms had worsened: "I had opened an account that did not involve monthly fees, and came back to an account that did." Mr. Brinton, a medical student at Harvard, switched to Wells Fargo. 
 Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, said, "Something that may be worth noting is that banks have learned a lot of lessons from mergers, and one of them is not to rush things." 
 "I think both Bank of America and Fleet have been through enough mergers to have learned that particular lesson," he said.
 Christine and David Hogan of Rio Rancho, N.M., were customers of Sunwest in Albuquerque, N.M. , a community bank, but eventually became Bank of America customers in 1998 through a series of acquisitions. "I liked Sunwest," said Ms. Hogan, who is 41 and a manufacturing technician for Intel. "It was more accessible, more friendly."
 She added that Bank of America has mixed up payments they sent to pay off two loans. At one point, it issued their teenage son an ATM card that deducted money from someone else's account.
 Analysts point to Bank of America's buildup in bank branches as a sign of its commitment to serving consumers. It is adding 550 branches nationwide in the next three years and said yesterday that it planned to go ahead with that expansion.
 It is also trying to make the new branches more inviting than traditional banks. Rather than sitting behind desks, employees greet customers at the door or chat with them on the floor. Customers can help themselves to free coffee and read or watch financial news in a seating area. In addition, all of the branches' fixtures can be cleared to make floor space for after-hours homebuyer seminars or financial classes.

HEADLINE: Miami Caught in Free Trade Quandary 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
This city seems uniquely qualified to be selected as the diplomatic headquarters of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the long-awaited agreement on lowering tariffs throughout the hemisphere. What other place can boast of superior air connections, physical proximity, cultural and linguistic ties and a history of strong commercial relations with Latin America?
 Unfortunately for Miami, the selection process that was supposed to make it a shoo-in for the headquarters, a prize worth an anticipated $500 million a year in economic activity and an estimated 15,000 jobs for diplomats, trade negotiators, lawyers, bankers and other white-collar professionals, has become fraught with uncertainty. 
 There is, to begin with, the concern that the trade agreement might not even materialize, or be diminished in scope because of quarreling between negotiators from the United States and the hemisphere's second-largest economy, Brazil.
 The two countries are at odds over import tariffs the United States imposes to protect two industries that are important to Florida, citrus and sugar. That puts Miami in the sticky position of competing to become the headquarters of free trade in the Western Hemisphere at the same time that Florida is lobbying to protect tariffs that inhibit free trade. 
 Compounding Miami's anxiety is increased competition with Atlanta, which has started a well-financed and sophisticated campaign to present itself as an alternate gateway to the region. As Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University, put it: "We've woken up from the slumber we were in for the last few years to realize our chances of getting this thing are really in jeopardy. Imagine the shock if the best candidate for the secretariat walks away with nothing."
 Few states have their destinies more dependent on the outcome of the trade agreement than Florida, so such sentiment explains the obsession here with scrutinizing efforts to convince 34 nations in the Western Hemisphere that Miami should be chosen as the headquarters of the trading area, which is scheduled to take effect in January 2005. 
 Studies show the headquarters could create substantial economic benefits for Miami and surrounding areas in South Florida, but the state's large citrus and sugar industries are leading efforts to water down the agreement by supporting existing tariffs on imported oranges and sugar from Brazil, the nation that is already Florida's largest international trading partner. 
 Although the tariffs are among the main obstacles to smoother negotiations with Brazil, Florida's agricultural companies appear to be unyielding in their resistance to the agreement. A group of Florida citrus growers even started television ads this month showing Jon Gruden, the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team, speaking in support of a 28.7 cents-per-gallon tariff on imported orange juice from Brazil.
 "Losing the tariff would devastate Florida's orange juice industry and thousands of family businesses throughout the state," Mr. Gruden says in the ads. "It that happens, we all lose." 
 The state's competing interests have put Gov. Jeb Bush in a difficult situation. Mr. Bush, who speaks Spanish fluently, has repeatedly said that he wants Miami to win the headquarters and is expected to play an active role in building support in Latin America for the bid. But Mr. Bush also supports the citrus industry's policies, and that support does not sit well with Brazil. 
 "I am afraid, Mr. Governor, that you have apparently been seriously misinformed by your staff on this issue," Rubens A. Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador in Washington, wrote in an unusually contentious letter to Mr. Bush in September. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Barbosa called Florida's tariffs illegal, discriminatory and protectionist. 
 Within this context, it is no surprise that those involved in preparing for next month's trade negotiations in Miami, an event considered by many a trial-run for the city's headquarters bid, are somewhat tense. Security officials are girding for the antiglobalization protests that accompany such events. Other officials are quietly bemoaning the tension between American and Brazilian negotiators since the breakdown of World Trade Organization talks in Cancun, Mexico, last month largely because of different views on agricultural subsidies.
 Brazil's position on these issues appears to have remained unyielding since Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, recently signaled that the United States could pursue a series of free trade agreements that would leave Brazil on the margins of an Americas-wide agreement. Some diplomats and analysts question whether a headquarters would even be necessary if the trade agreement is watered down. 
 "The competition for a headquarters is not even on our radar screen," said Marcos Troyjo, a diplomat on leave from Brazil's foreign affairs ministry and professor of business diplomacy at the University of Sao Paulo. "People in Brazil are a little fed up with the inconsistencies on free trade coming from the United States."
 If such blustery sentiments were not enough, Miami is also grappling with competition from Atlanta, which has a well-organized campaign reminiscent of its effort to get the Olympics in 1996, as well as several cities outside the United States, including Panama City; Puebla, Mexico; and Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. Other cities, including Houston, New Orleans, and Cancun, Mexico, have not yet said they will compete but have signaled they may do so.
 Hence the growing focus on Miami's chief lobbyist for building support for its bid, Jorge Arrizurieta, a former business associate of H. Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster, former owner of the Florida Marlins baseball team and Bush administration appointee at the Inter-American Development Bank. Mr. Arrizurieta's lobbying efforts are intensifying ahead of talks scheduled next month in Miami, on Nov. 20 and 21, among trade ministers from every country in the hemisphere except Cuba, which is not participating in the accord. Cities are required to submit their bids for the headquarters before those talks begin.
 Since July, Mr. Arrizurieta, 37, a Florida-born Cuban-American, has traveled to 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. He recently returned from Port-of-Spain with an editorial from that country's leading newspaper bemoaning a recent increase in kidnappings of business executives. "That's not the kind of publicity you want," he said.
 Still, if its seems like Mr. Arrizurieta (pronounced ah-REE-zuh-ree-ay-tah) is maintaining a busy traveling schedule, his counterpart in Atlanta, Jose Ignacio Gonzalez, is just as frenzied. Mr. Gonzalez, a Colombian emigre and president of Hemisphere Inc., a nonprofit group that is lobbying for Atlanta, has already met with heads of state and trade ministers in every country in South America, including relatively small nations like Guyana and Suriname.
 Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Arrizurieta crossed paths as they met with the president of Uruguay, Jorge Batlle, and other government representatives on the same day in late August in Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital. Though they did not see each other, they heard of each other's movements from the officials they were meeting with, both men said.
 (Mr. Batlle later endorsed Miami's bid, becoming the first government leader in the region to publicly side with any city, even though it is ultimately the Uruguayan trade minister who will put forward his position in a consensus process involving negotiators from throughout the region.)
 Mr. Gonzalez, the Atlanta envoy, has taken a different approach from Mr. Arrizurieta's by declining to discuss the negative attributes of his competitors in favor of promoting Atlanta's advantages. "Initially," he said in an interview, "Atlanta might not seem like the most obvious choice but we bring the most to the table economically, culturally and historically."
 Atlanta, buoyed by support from local and state political leaders, appears to be doing fairly well in increasing visibility for its bid. Earlier this month, for example, ministers from five Andean countries -- Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela -- met in Atlanta to discuss preparations for next month's talks in Miami. While in Georgia, they dined with former President Jimmy Carter and met with executives from large Atlanta companies.
 In promoting Atlanta, Mr. Gonzalez emphasizes the roster of companies that are based in the city and have extensive operations in Latin America, including Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, BellSouth and CNN, a unit of Time Warner. He also cites demographic figures showing that Atlanta has the fastest-growing Latino community in the nation in the last two years.
Georgia's overall Latino population grows by about 102 people a day, Mr. Gonzalez said, making Atlanta and the rest of the state a more important player in Latin American affairs. Hearing Atlanta position itself in such a way has irritated many in Miami, including Mr. Arrizurieta.
 "We're the indisputable gateway to the Americas," Mr. Arrizurieta said, adding that he bristled upon seeing that exact phrase, "Gateway to the Americas," as part of an extensive advertising insert purchased by Atlanta recently in the magazine Latin Trade to win support for its bid. "That really got to me," Mr. Arrizurieta said, speaking in clear English occasionally punctuated by expressions in rapid-fire, Cuban-accented Spanish.
 If negotiators find a way to surmount their differences on agricultural tariffs, Miami will have many supporters for its bid, including at least one prominent company based in Atlanta, United Parcel Service, which publicly sided with Miami after investing $30 million to make the city the center of its cargo shipping operations in Latin America. 
 Several diplomats from Latin American countries also quietly acknowledged they would prefer to have the headquarters in a familiar city in the United States, like Miami, if only because it would be easy to get there and because they would be paid in a relatively stable currency, the dollar. Miami's status as an offshore banking location and magnet for real-estate investments for wealthy Latin Americans add to its allure.
 Miami also remains a leading destination for former heads of state in Latin America, such as Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who moved here this month after resigning as president of Bolivia amid growing protests there over natural gas exporting policies.
 "Everyone knows why it makes sense to choose Miami," Mr. Arrizurieta said. "It's a matter of not letting our strengths get lost in the fog of a complicated and sometimes contentious process."

 William Safire (column, Oct. 27) discusses how to reverse the pressure to import our own medicines, which are sold more cheaply in Canada and overseas. 
Increasing export prices or decreasing supply to these places makes sense. 
 But we should not assume that the cost of research and development is the engine that drives price inflation. Many medications in a given class are duplicates of each other, and millions of dollars of drug research money are spent creating new competing chemicals only slightly different from already effective medicines.
These products become new billion-dollar drugs with the help of lavish advertising campaigns. In fact, direct-to-consumer ads are permitted in only the United States and New Zealand.

HEADLINE: Tax Changes May Slow Export Tide From China 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BUCKLEY 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
China's juggernaut export growth has continued to defy a chorus of complaints from American manufacturers and politicians, but perhaps changes coming in China's tax rules will take a bit of the momentum away.
 The changes, which take effect on Jan. 1, cut the rebates on tax payments that businesses can claim for goods sold abroad and may raise the price of many Chinese-made consumer goods, including clothes, toys and electrical appliances. 
 No one thinks that the cuts will halt China's prodigious trade growth, but many economists foresee a palpable slowing of that growth, especially among low-end manufactured goods. Export businesses in fiercely competitive industries said that the cuts might erase already thin profit margins and imperil smaller manufacturers that are short of cash. 
 This, it seems, is the price China's government is willing to pay to defuse financial and international political strains unleashed by the country's trade boom.
 "The export rebate cuts in effect amount to a revaluation of the yuan," China's currency, said Zhang Shuguang, director of the Unirule Institute, a private economics research center in Beijing. "It will raise the price of exports without a formal revaluation. By how much is a difficult question, but there's sure to be ramifications."
 For Shen Chaohui, a manager of Galanz Electronics in Guangdong province, the potential consequences were clear as soon as he began calling customers in Europe, Latin America and the United States to say the price of the company's microwave ovens may rise by 4 percent.
 "It's going to have a big impact on us," he said in a telephone interview. "The microwave market is extremely price-sensitive, and any rise in our prices is going to be a plus to our foreign competitors, like LG," he added, referring to the South Korean electronics manufacturer.
 The export tax rebate for microwave ovens, Galanz's mainstay, as well as other domestic appliances like irons and air-conditioners, will fall from 17 percent to 13 percent of the declared value of goods from the start of next year.
 "We're asking customers to get ready for the price hike, but about 90 percent of the ones I've contacted so far can't understand it," Mr. Shen said. "I'm worried orders may start going to other manufacturers." He explained that most of Galanz's overseas orders are what is known as O.E.M. -- original equipment manufacturer -- deals involving Galanz filling orders that are sold under another electronics company's brand name.
 Galanz's difficulties may be repeated across several other industries where export rebates have underwritten China's exports in fiercely contested international markets. Rebates for garments and textiles will also fall by four percentage points; and rebates for metals, raw chemicals, plastics, toys, shoes, watches, ceramics, nylon and rubber products, sporting goods, leather shoes, and travel goods and bags will fall by two percentage points. Tax rebates on crude oil and oil products except gasoline were removed altogether.
 In some manufacturing sectors where government wants to encourage exports, like car parts, the level of rebates remains unchanged.
 The cuts seem small, but may make a significant difference in industries where profit margins are also small. "Most of our import partners have very tight profit margins," Mr. Shen said. "But we can't absorb the rise on our own because our gross profit on exports might not be that high."
 Galanz had set itself a target of raising its exports of microwave ovens to the United States to 3 million next year from 2 million this year, Mr. Shen said. But now the company will reduce its growth target by several hundred thousand, he added.
 Economists and businesses are uncertain how much China's trade growth would be clipped by the tax rebate adjustment. Long Guoqiang, who studies trade issues for the government's Research Development Center, calculated that every one percentage point drop in rebates would lead to a proportional drop in trade in the industry affected. His estimate is supported by government estimates cited in the Chinese press and by several other professional economists.
 Part of the drop in rebates could be absorbed by exporters' domestic suppliers, economists and managers said. But in sectors where profits are squeezed by competition and production overcapacity, exporters may have little choice but to pass on the costs to buyers, which may diminish China's competitiveness.
 "Much of China's export sector is huge volume, but low profitability," said Andy Xie, who analyzes China's economy for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. "China's exporters don't have much power. They're O.E.M. manufacturers, and they're highly exposed."
 He added that he expected the rebate cuts to have "serious effects" for China's export performance, contributing to a fall in export growth from this year's 30 percent to about 15 percent next year.
 The export rebate program is a victim of China's soaring trade success. In recent years, as China's exports have boomed, the government has found itself short of cash to pay for a growing mountain of rebate claims -- another possible reason for the reduction in rebates. By the end of last year, the government owed $30 billion in unpaid claims, and with exports set to grow by a third this year, the government may owe another $6 billion by the end of this year.
 For many enterprises, the logjam of unpaid claims has become a major headache.
 "In the past few years, unpaid claims have piled up," said Mr. Xuan, a representative from the Guangdong Textile Manufacturers Association, who declined to give his full name. "It's become a real serious pressure on our business."
 Mr. Xuan, however, said he believed that China's textile exports to the United States and other major buyers would not be drastically cut.
 "Even with the rebate cut, China's cheapness is still a strong advantage," he said. "Some smaller businesses may be in difficulty, but China's overall advantage still exists."

HEADLINE: Drug Profits and the Free Market 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Doughnut's Hole," by William Safire (column, Oct. 27): 
 It is not the free market that causes drug prices to be high in the United States, it is patent protection -- a government-granted monopoly. 
While research and innovation must be financed somehow, there is no evidence that patent monopolies are an efficient mechanism for this purpose. 
Nearly half of all biomedical research is currently financed by the government and the nonprofit sector. My research suggests that it would be far more efficient if the government simply picked up the tab for the rest and stopped trying to enforce patent monopolies.
With all drugs then sold in a free market, there would be enormous gains for everyone, except the pharmaceutical industry.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Declined in September 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes edged down in September, the Commerce Department reported on Monday, but they nevertheless registered the third-highest level on record.
 A separate report from a trade group showed that sales of previously owned homes again had their best month -- fresh evidence that the housing market continues to help spur economic recovery. 
 The Commerce Department put new-home sales at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.145 million in September, a 0.2 percent dip from the previous month. Even with that, sales were stronger than the 1.125 million pace that analysts were forecasting. New-home sales posted their best month ever in June, at a pace of 1.2 million units, and their second-best month in August, at an annual pace of 1.147 million.
 In the other report, the National Association of Realtors said that existing-home sales rose 3.6 percent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.69 million units,the third consecutive record month.
 By region, new-home sales in September soared by 26 percent in the Northeast, to an annual pace of 97,000, and in the West they rose 12.4 percent, to a pace of 335,000. But in the Midwest, sales fell 18 percent, to a pace of 209,000, and in the South, they dipped 2.5 percent, to a 504,000-unit pace.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Move Up Amid Acquisitions in Banking and Health

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as companies announced $62.9 billion worth of takeovers, persuading investors that share prices are inexpensive even after a 29 percent surge in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since mid-March.
 FleetBoston Financial soared after agreeing to be bought by Bank of America, while the health insurers WellPoint Health Networks and Mid Atlantic Medical Services jumped after announcing plans to sell themselves. 
 The acquirers "feel they are buying them at attractive enough prices today that they will still be able to make money longer term," said Martha Pomerantz, who helps oversee $5 billion at Lowry Hill Investment Advisors in Minneapolis. "It is a huge positive." Lowry Hill's clients own shares of Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group, which acquired Mid Atlantic Medical. 
 The S.&P. 500 increased 2.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,031.13. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.70 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,608.16. The Nasdaq composite index added 17.32 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,882.91, for its first increase in four days.
 The S.&P. 500 has jumped since this year's low on March 11 amid speculation that cost cuts and an improving economy will accelerate corporate profit growth.
 Two stocks rose for every one that fell yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.36 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 3.2 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 FleetBoston rallied $7.40, to $39.20, for the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. Bank of America fell $8.29, to $73.57, for the steepest drop. The $43.6 billion purchase would be the largest banking takeover ever.
 Regional bank shares gained on speculation that there will be more acquisitions. The S.&P. 500 Regional Banks Index rose 2.2 percent, led by SunTrust Banks, which advanced $3.72, to $67.22. PNC Financial Services Group, Pennsylvania's biggest bank, climbed $1.96, to $52.75. KeyCorp added 80 cents, to $27.69. Sovereign Bancorp jumped $1.04, to $20.07. Comerica rose $3.25, to $50.17.
 Investment banks and brokerage firms also rose amid optimism that mergers would help lift profit. The S.&P. 500 investment banking and brokerage index climbed 1.3 percent. The Goldman Sachs Group added $2.37, to $88.19, and Morgan Stanley advanced 34 cents, to $51.78. Merrill Lynch gained 67 cents, to $56.15.
 WellPoint rallied $7.16, to $91.09, for the second-biggest increase in the S.&P. 500. The company agreed to sell itself to Anthem for $16.4 billion to create the country's largest health insurer. Anthem fell $6.21, to $71.05.
 Mid Atlantic Medical rose $5.74, to $59.62 after the company agreed to sell itself to the UnitedHealth Group for $2.9 billion. The transaction values Mid Atlantic at $60.97, 13 percent more than Friday's price. UnitedHealth fell $1.85, to $52.40.
 "We used to talk about merger Mondays, back when the market was in its glory days," said Eric Thorne, who helps oversee $1.7 billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. "It hasn't happened in a while, but I wouldn't be surprised so see more. They tend to feed on themselves."
 In bond trading, Treasuries fell in New York yesterday on speculation that Federal Reserve policy makers will acknowledge the economy is improving at a meeting today, bringing them closer to raising their benchmark interest rate. 
 Signs that growth may be strengthening, including reports yesterday showing gains in home sales, come as the government needs to sell more debt to finance a record budget deficit. A sale of $26 billion of two-year notes tomorrow may add to the rise in Treasury yields, which move opposite of price.
 By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note lost 7/32, dropping to a price of 99 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 4.26 percent from 4.23 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results from yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.762	99.484	High Rate	0.940	1.020	Investment Rate	0.960	1.043	Low Rate	0.910	0.990	Median Rate	0.930	1.005	Total appliedfor	39,957,705	36,557,331	Accepted	22,960,885	22,997,352	Noncompetitive	1,470,976	921,002	

Both issues are dated Oct. 30 2003. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 29 2004, and the six-month bills mature on April, 29 2004.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Creating the Spirit of Carnival in a Tent

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
LET there be light. (Raffaele De Ritis is striding through sawdust and shouting "Lights!") Let there be music. (Now he's shouting "Rob," and Rob Slowik is the musical director.) Let there be action. (Not just from 27 performers, but also 4 camels, 6 horses, 8 dogs and one llama.)
 During this rehearsal under the little top of the Big Apple Circus, Mr. De Ritis rules man and beast. A 36-year-old Italian director, he has created circuses, festivals, operas and magic shows in Europe, and was imported to take charge of Big Apple's new production, "Carnevale!" It opens to the public tonight in the clowny blue one-ring tent in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center. 
 Not that this is Mr. De Ritis's first one-ring show in Manhattan. In December 2000, the high-end, $10 million Barnum's Kaleidoscape arrived in Bryant Park, right during the traditional holiday run of the spunky, Manhattan-born Big Apple. Working in Sarasota, Fla., Mr. De Ritis had been Kaleidoscape's highly praised creator. 
If Kaleidoscape subsequently folded its tent for good, Big Apple is still going strong -- and now it has Mr. De Ritis. "I'm not gloating," said Paul Binder, founder and artistic director of Big Apple, "because in this business you can never get a big head. It's a humbling trade. We're just proud to be here for our 26th year."
The show -- billed as a celebration of the carnival spirit of Venice, Rio de Janeiro, Trinidad, Cuba, New Orleans and Jamaica -- is, Mr. Binder said, "the most fast-paced and energetic show we've ever done."
Mr. Binder invited Mr. De Ritis in "for his fresh eye, his immersion in the European milieu and for his depth of knowledge about circus," Mr. Binder said.
Mr. De Ritis reveres the very idea of carnival "because, I think, it is my first memory of any performance, even before circus," he recalled. About that first circus: he was age 3 in his hometown, Pescara, in Abruzzi. "My parents never suspected the course they were setting me on," he said. "People don't realize that the first live paid entertainment that most kids will see, anywhere in the world, is a circus." 
If he is an authoritative director, Mr. De Ritis also shows deference to the cast. "Lots of performers know me since I was a kid," he explains. That is because, even at age 10, he would hang out with circus folk whenever one of the many traveling one-ring Italian shows came to town. At age 12 he was doing publicity and ringside work during school holidays for touring circuses; at 17 he began writing for Italian circus magazines, a practice he continues.
By 18 he had become a circus talent scout in France, Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Not long after, he became the unpaid assistant to the director Jerome Savary in Paris at the Theatre National de Chaillot. (Mr. De Ritis made ends meet by doing Italian-circus publicity and helping a crocodile-hypnotist at the Moulin Rouge load up his circus truck.)
In his mid-20's, he started staging European circus festivals ("45 acts thrown together in four days," he remembered). He is a fierce networker, and his resume is a name-dropper's list of circus greats with whom he has studied or collaborated in Italy, Paris, Moscow and Montreal. 
In 1999, Gian Carlo Menotti asked him to create a magic show for the Spoleto Festival in Italy; ditto for Prince Rainier in Monte Carlo. Now he is at the leading edge of a new wave of naturalistic circus directors in France and Italy. 
AFTER "Carnevale!" Mr. De Ritis will rest for a bit at his house in Pescara, "where I have my circus archive," he said in his precise, slightly accented English, one of three languages he ordinarily uses (Italian and French are the others). "I also work in German, Spanish and Russian, not to mention the animal languages," he said, deadpan.
In Pescara, he will tackle two books: an Italian history of magic and entertainment, and a social history of world circus. He is also writing magic and circus specials for Italian television. 
Erudite and often academic in conversation, the aerialist-thin Mr. De Ritis strolls the practice ring with erect carriage and noble bearing, a clear contrast to the pratfally casualness of the cast and crew. 
In fact, his name has descended from noble origins, but the director is hardly to the manner born. "I live from project to project," he said, "and I try not to think about paying the bills. It is, after all, a gift to love what you do."
Unlike many of the performers he is working with, he does not derive from a multigenerational circus family; his father, Domenica, is a government specialist in pension economics. 
Inevitably, any Italian director must refer to Federico Fellini, and Mr. De Ritis does not disappoint, terming him "an inspirational figure." Mr. De Ritis met Mr. Fellini, the director of "La Dolce Vita," the year before his death, over espresso in Rome. " 'You are lucky, I am not,' " Mr. Fellini told him, Mr. De Ritis recalled. " 'You direct circus, I direct movies. In movies, I lie. But in circus, you tell the truth.' " 
In describing his working aesthetic, Mr. De Ritis resorts to quotation. "Picasso said, 'Je ne cherche pas, je trouve' " ("I don't look for things, I find them"). "That seems right. In circus, I don't look for things. They just emerge from under the sawdust."

HEADLINE: A Willful Ignorance 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
According to The New York Times, President Bush was genuinely surprised to learn from moderate Islamic leaders that they had become deeply distrustful of American intentions. The report on the "perception gap" suggests that the leader of the war on terror has no idea how badly that war -- which must, ultimately, be a war for hearts and minds -- is going.
 Mr. Bush's ignorance may reflect his lack of curiosity: "The best way to get the news," he says, "is from objective sources. And the most objective sources I have are people on my staff." Two words: emperor, clothes. 
 But there's something broader going on: a sort of willful ignorance, supposedly driven by moral concerns but actually reflecting domestic politics. Surely it's important to understand how others see us, but a new, post 9/11 version of political correctness has made it difficult even to discuss their points of view. Any American who tries to go beyond "America good, terrorists evil," who tries to understand -- not condone -- the growing world backlash against the United States, faces furious attacks delivered in a tone of high moral indignation. The attackers claim to be standing up for moral clarity, and some of them may even believe it. But they are really being used in a domestic political struggle.
Last week I found myself caught up in that struggle. I wrote about why Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister -- a clever if loathsome man who adjusts the volume of his anti-Semitism depending on circumstances -- chose to include an anti-Jewish diatribe in his speech to an Islamic conference. Sure enough, I was accused in various places not just of "tolerance for anti-Semitism" (yes, I'm Jewish) but of being in Mr. Mahathir's pay. Smear tactics aside, the thrust of the attacks was that because anti-Semitism is evil, anyone who tries to understand why politicians foment anti-Semitism -- and looks for ways other than military force to combat the disease -- is an apologist for anti-Semitism and is complicit in evil.
Yet that moral punctiliousness is curiously selective. Last year the Bush administration, in return for a military base in Uzbekistan, gave $500 million to a government that, according to the State Department, uses torture "as a routine investigation technique," and whose president has killed opponents with boiling water. The moral clarity police were notably quiet.
Why is aiding a brutal dictator O.K., while trying to understand why others don't trust us -- and doing something to create that trust -- isn't? Why won't the administration mollify Muslims by firing Lt. Gen. William Boykin, whose anti-Islamic remarks have created vast ill will, from his counterterrorism position? Why won't it give moderate Muslims a better argument against the radicals by opposing Ariel Sharon's settlement policy, when a majority of Israelis think that some settlements should be abandoned, and even Israeli military officers have become bitterly critical of Mr. Sharon?
The answer is that in these cases politics takes priority over the war on terror. Moderate Muslims would have more faith in America's good intentions if there were at least the appearance of a distinction between the U.S. and the Sharon government -- but the administration seeks votes from those who think that supporting Israel means supporting whatever Mr. Sharon does. It's sheer folly to keep General Boykin in his present position, but as Howard Fineman writes in a Newsweek Web-exclusive column, the administration doesn't want "to make a martyr of a man who depicts himself as a Christian Soldier, marching off to war."
Muslims are completely wrong to think that the U.S. is engaged in a war against Islam. But that misperception flourishes in part because the domestic political strategy of the Bush administration -- no longer able to claim the Iraq war was a triumph, and with little but red ink to show for its economic plans -- looks more and more like a crusade. "Election Boils Down to a Culture War" was the title of Mr. Fineman's column. But the analysis was all about abortion and euthanasia, and now we hear that opposition to gay marriage will be a major campaign theme. This isn't a culture war -- it's a religious war. 
Which brings me back to my starting point: we'll lose the fight against terror if we don't make an effort to understand how others think. Yet because of a domestic political struggle that seems ever more centered on religion, such attempts at understanding are shouted down.

HEADLINE: Tom Ford and the Showdown at the Gucci Corral 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Tom Ford is that rare designer whose collections for Gucci are monitored by both fashion mavens and Wall Street analysts. In just 10 years, he and Gucci's chief executive, Domenico De Sole, turned a moribund label with revenues of $200 million into a $3 billion luxury conglomerate, making investors rich and the tirelessly chic happy.
 But in a drama that has riveted the attention of fashion followers from Madison Avenue to the trading desks of New York and London, Mr. Ford, 42, and Mr. De Sole, 59, now find themselves in a battle with Gucci's biggest shareholder over who should control the company. Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which owns 68 percent of Gucci and has pledged to buy the rest by next spring, insists on exerting management control. 
 Mr. De Sole and Mr. Ford say that is not acceptable and might force them to leave. It is the main sticking point in their contract-renewal negotiations with P.P.R., which have entered an end game. A resolution is expected within weeks. 
In an interview last week in New York, Mr. De Sole declined to comment on the negotiations, but he indicated that he and Mr. Ford, after all they have done for Gucci, should retain managerial independence from P.P.R., which is based in Paris and controlled by the French tycoon Francois Pinault. Mr. De Sole noted that following the release on Oct. 15 of strong fall sales figures by Gucci and its Yves Saint Laurent subsidiary, Gucci Group's share price had rallied in heavy trading in Europe. More than one million shares were traded daily at the end of that week, about five times the average volume. 
"It's rekindled a lot of interest in investors to come back to the company," Mr. De Sole said. "They made a lot of money with Tom and I. They trust us."
A spokesman for P.P.R., Thomas Kamm, declined to comment on the contract negotiations or on several analyst reports that said Gucci shares are undervalued.
If Mr. De Sole and Mr. Ford decide to leave Gucci when their contracts expire next March and next June -- and there is little chance that one would stay without the other, given their loyalties -- it will send reverberations throughout the fashion industry. Among those likely to be affected are Gucci's struggling subsidiary brands, including Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney.
"It would be a catastrophe," said Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, who during the most recent round of shows in Paris met with both men as well as with Mr. Pinault. Though magazines like Vogue depend on Gucci advertising dollars, the loss of Mr. Ford would also rob editors of the star power they need to whip up reader interest. Michael Roberts, the fashion editor of The New Yorker, said: "He means a huge amount in terms of presenting an image of fashion to the public. You take him out of the equation and you're left with a big hole."
Indeed, the drama at Gucci points up a serious shortcoming in the fashion world: a dearth of creative talent that can excite consumers. In the last three years, houses like Givenchy, Jil Sander and Bill Blass have struggled to find a new identity by replacing designers -- only to discover, after losing money and credibility, thatthe missing factor was a real talent. Calvin Klein is the latest brand to set off down this road, replacing Mr. Klein with a former assistant, whose first collection in September received mixed reviews from retailers.
And executives at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus worry about who will one day replace older stars like Giorgio Armani, 69, and Oscar de la Renta, 71, who generate significant revenues.
"This goes way beyond Tom Ford," said the chief executive of an American department store. "Believe me, if Tom decides to leave and retire to his ranch, Gucci will go on. Because the brand is much greater than the man. But who's going to replace him?"
Mr. Pinault, a self-made businessman who parlayed a sawmill into a conglomerate, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that he would like Mr. De Sole and Mr. Ford to stay, but that Gucci "shouldn't shake in its boots" at the thought of them leaving. At the end of Mr. Ford's Saint Laurent show on Oct. 12, Mr. Pinault, accompanied by Bernadette Chirac, the wife of France's president, made a symbolic gesture of planting two kisses on the designer's cheeks.
Both Mr. Ford and Mr. De Sole let it be known to close associates in the days before the Saint Laurent show that contract talks had hit a rough patch, fueling speculation among journalists and retailers at the spring 2004 collections that a defection by the pair looked more and more possible. Yet on the morning of Oct. 12, when Mr. De Sole was observed having breakfast with Ms. Wintour at the Ritz Hotel, he seemed again hopeful, saying that he had received a late-night phone call from P.P.R. summoning him to a round of discussions that afternoon.
What may further complicate negotiations is Gucci's recent stock gains, and Mr. De Sole's forecast of more robust earnings for the second half of the year. Two years ago, when Mr. Pinault emerged as the white knight in a nasty battle with rival LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton for control of Gucci, he agreed to buy out minority shareholders for $101.50 a share by next April. That guarantee, a put option, was cut to $85.52 earlier this year when the Gucci Group paid its shareholders a $1.58 billion dividend. Thanks to recent gains of Gucci stock, its shares now sell above the put price, meaning investors will not have reason to trade in their shares. If Gucci remains a public company with independent directors, Mr. Ford's and Mr. De Sole's hand would be strengthened.
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the global luxury industry faced a pernicious downturn. The confluence of a weak economy, a drop in worldwide tourism and fear of SARS effectively spiked the phenomenal profits that luxury brands saw in the 1990's, when free-spending consumers indulged themselves with $600 must-have bags and even pricier clothing. 
While companies like LVMH showed signs of a turnaround earlier this year, Gucci seemed to stall -- in part, Mr. De Sole acknowledged, because of a poorly received fall 2002 Gucci collection and problems related to new brands, including Saint Laurent, one of nine labels the company acquired in 2001.
In its first quarter of 2003, Gucci's net profit plunged 97 percent, followed by a drop of 47 percent for the second quarter that ended July 31. However, Mr. De Sole was able to offer some good news with the bad, reporting that since Aug. 1, retail sales for the Gucci label were up as much as 20 percent and that its Bottega Veneta division had seen a 42 percent increase. The results led Claire Kent, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in London, to issue a report in which she asserted that the $85.52 put option "greatly underestimates Gucci's true value" -- provided, she added, that current management stays in place.
"The intrinsic value of Gucci is difficult to evaluate if the current management leave," the report said.
Andrew Gowen, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, also expressed confidence in Mr. De Sole and Mr. Ford. "I would perceive it as a negative if they leave," he said. "They're a good management team. If it's not broken, why try to fix it?"
There is ample personal wealth on both sides of this latest battle for Gucci to suggest that money alone is not a motivation for going to the mattresses. Having spent $3 billion to help thwart a bid from LVMH, Mr. Pinault may feel more than justified in his desire to gain control of Gucci. Mr. De Sole, who had planned to retire last year, has run the company as if it were his own, and would probably like to finish his career on top.
Mr. Ford received more than $6 million in compensation last year, and in May earned nearly $38 million by cashing in stock options. This is in addition to the $144 million he made from options over the past three years. "He's such a well-known figure that he could find the money to start his own venture," said Christian Oddono, director of research at Actinvest, an equity research firm in London. 
Yet this scenario seems unlikely, and Mr. Ford's threat to leave Gucci may be only a way to gain leverage with Mr. Pinault. He has long said that he wants to spend more time within Gucci building a stable of young brands than designing collections. "Tom's game plan has been to move into a different role at Gucci," Ms. Wintour said. "I don't think he's wedded to being the design director. He could bring in someone else to design Gucci or Saint Laurent." So having his own label may not square with his broader ambitions.
Not everyone is convinced that Gucci and Mr. Ford are inseparable. One New York retailing executive, noting that Mr. Ford has presided over Gucci for more than a decade, said a fresh point of view would not be so bad.
And for now, his 90's formula of sex and swank seems a bit out of sync with the more soulful femininity being offered by designers like Miuccia Prada and Marc Jacobs. Though, like everything else in fashion, it is subject to change.
As Mr. Roberts said, "After one season of milkmaids and Daisy Buchanans, you can bet your bottom dollar that sex will be whizzing back. It's very difficult to sell lots of clothes without a sex quotient."

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANTS: THE OVERVIEW; 
BANK OF AMERICA AND FLEETBOSTON AGREE TO MERGER

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial announced yesterday that they would combine to create a consumer banking giant with branches from Maine to California.
 Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., but has a strong California franchise, will pay an estimated $48 billion in stock for FleetBoston's robust presence in the Northeast and for access to some of the wealthiest households in the country. Combined, the institution would be the nation's second-largest bank in assets and would control nearly 10 percent of the nation's deposits, the maximum that can be gained by acquisition. All told, it would have 5,700 branches in 29 states. 
 The announcement comes as Bank of America is being investigated for its role in a widening examination of improper trading in mutual fund shares. The bank recently fired several top executives, and one former broker faces criminal charges by the New York attorney general. The head of its asset management business with oversight of mutual funds was left without a job in the new organization. Page C1. 
For FleetBoston, itself the product of dozens of acquisitions, the deal ends an institution with roots in 18th-century New England and removes another corporate titan from Boston. The bank has been described as a takeover candidate since it incurred heavy losses after the merger of Fleet Financial and BankBoston in 1999. For customers of Fleet and its predecessors -- who have already changed hands many times -- the combination is sure to produce some anxiety about changes in fees, accounts and service.
 Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said yesterday that the addition of Fleet would make Bank of America "truly a national bank." 
 Still, the bank's stock fell sharply yesterday, as analysts questioned the cost of the deal.
 The acquisition, announced on the same day as other big deals in health care and tobacco, may suggest that corporations are beginning to take a more offensive posture after a quiet period for mergers amid corporate scandals and economic torpor. Mr. Lewis predicted that his acquisition would put pressure on other banks to combine, and stocks of several banks viewed as takeover candidates rose yesterday.
 The combination, which was reported yesterday in The Boston Globe, will bring together banks that are products of a dizzying list of deals. Each bank struggled to overcome unexpected losses after its last round of mergers -- Bank of America's approximately $60 billion merger with NationsBank in 1998, and Fleet Financial's combination with BankBoston for $16 billion.
 Bank of America, under the leadership of Mr. Lewis, reduced its exposure to corporate lending and shed risky businesses like subprime lending and auto leasing. FleetBoston, under it chief executive, Charles K. Gifford, also shifted its emphasis to consumer banking, reducing its exposure to Latin America and slashing the corporate loans on its books -- but not before suffering heavy losses in both areas.
 The combined institution will retain the Bank of America name and its headquarters in Charlotte, the former home of NationsBank. Mr. Lewis, 56, will be the new chief executive, and Mr. Gifford, 60, will become chairman and remain in Boston.
 Bank of America will control 12 of the 19 seats on the new board. Because the banks do not have much geographic overlap, regulatory and antitrust issues are not expected to pose significant problems.
 Mr. Gifford's tenure at FleetBoston was marred by losses. He became chief executive in 2001, having earlier been chief executive of BankBoston. From the beginning, he battled rumors that he was about to sell FleetBoston, as the promised turnaround was slow to materialize. "It is not our intention to sell the company," he said in an interview in March.
 Yesterday, he said that the lure of Bank of America was too hard to resist, although he admitted to feeling "a lot of emotion" about FleetBoston giving up its independence.
 The generous purchase price swayed his decision, according to people briefed on the negotiations. Under the terms of the deal, each FleetBoston share will be exchanged for 0.55 share of Bank of America. Based on Friday's closing prices, each Fleet share is worth $45 -- 40 percent more than before the deal was announced. That premium is the biggest among the top 20 bank deals of the last decade, according to SNL Financial.
 "We had no need whatsoever" to do a deal, said Eugene M. McQuade, president of FleetBoston, in an interview yesterday. FleetBoston's management would not have sold "unless shareholders had a substantial premium," he said.
 Mr. Lewis and Mr. Gifford first sat down a year and a half ago, according to executives briefed on the negotiations. Their talks about a merger began this spring, these executives said, and accelerated in late summer. Their No.2 executives, Mr. McQuade and James H. Hance Jr. of Bank of America, have summer homes near each other on Cape Cod and helped move discussions along. 
 FleetBoston was approached by other potential partners, Mr. Gifford said yesterday, although he declined to name them. Executives briefed on the conversations, though, said that the group included Citigroup, Wachovia and Bank One. Representatives of the banks declined to comment on their talks with FleetBoston.
 Bank of America already has a dominant position in consumer banking in the United States, and will gain specifically in the credit card and wealth management businesses. It will also gain a slight share in corporate banking. The combined institution will have relationships with 95 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500, up from 92 percent before the merger.
 Though the loss of FleetBoston's headquarters is a blow to Boston, Mr. Gifford said he was pleased that certain businesses -- including wealth management, Latin American lending, small-business lending and leasing -- would continue to be based there. He declined to comment on layoffs resulting from the merger. The banks have not yet identified the number of staff reductions, a FleetBoston spokesman said.
 The bank is projecting $1.1 billion in annual cost savings, or 6 percent of the expenses of the combined banks.
 Some stock analysts worried that the combination meant that Bank of America, an institution once known for its voracious appetite for big deals, was returning to that role. The last big one -- Bank of America and Nationsbank -- proved initially difficult because of unexpected trading losses and heavy write-downs ofcorporate loans.
 "Shareholders are angry, and feel that they have been betrayed," said Nancy Bush, an independent bank analyst based in Annandale, N.J. "There is rightly a lot of skepticism," given the high price, she said.
 For the near term, Mr. Lewis will be prohibited by law from doing another big banking deal. Assuming the merger with FleetBoston is completed, the bank will control 9.8 percent of the nation's deposits. Under United States banking law, banks cannot exceed 10 percent of deposits by acquisition, although they can gain share by attracting new customers.
One adviser to banks who insisted on anonymity said that the deal reflected Mr. Lewis's "driving ambition to be the equal of Citigroup," the nation's largest financial services company. The deal would edge Bank of America closer to Citigroup in size, with $933 billion in assets compared with $1.2 trillion for Citigroup. But it does little to enhance Bank of America's presence in areas like asset management and investment banking where Citigroup is far stronger.
 Bank of America's stock fell $8.29 a share yesterday, or about 10 percent, to $73.57, while FleetBoston's share price jumped $7.40, or 23 percent to $39.20. Based on those stock prices, the value of the deal had fallen yesterday to about $43 billion.
 Stock analysts debated whether the latest combination would lead to more bank deals. Stocks of banks with leading market shares in their regions -- including SunTrust of Atlanta, PNC Financial of Pittsburgh and National City of Cleveland -- rose yesterday. For those considered possible acquirers -- including Citigroup, Wachovia and Wells Fargo -- stocks fell as investors apparently fretted that those institutions might be tempted to spend too much to compete with the new Bank of America.
 An adviser to banks urged shareholders of those big institutions not to worry. "Nobody else would pay that much money," he said of the rich premium paid for FleetBoston.

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: THE CHIEF; 
Salesmanship Crucial for Executive as Critics Speak Out

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Kenneth D. Lewis, the chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, has spent most of his working life selling things. Even so, after orchestrating his company's $48 billion purchase of FleetBoston Financial, he may be looking at the biggest sales job of his career -- persuading Wall Street and investors that the deal makes economic and strategic sense. 
 As a 12-year-old in Columbus, Ga., Mr. Lewis delivered newspapers. In high school he was a star salesman at Butler's shoe store in Columbus. And he logged some time as a fire insurance underwriter and an airline reservations agent when he was in college at Georgia State University in the late 1960's. 
 But the concept Mr. Lewis, 56, is now trying to peddle could be a tough sell, in large part because a megamerger like the FleetBoston deal is something Wall Street had assumed he was unlikely to do. 
 For one thing, it had looked as if it might take the balance of Mr. Lewis's career just to successfully integrate all the banks his immediate predecessor -- the larger-than-life Hugh L. McColl Jr. -- spent the better part of two decades accumulating. And it was an impression Mr. Lewis, who succeeded Mr. McColl in April 2001, did little to dispel.
 "We've stopped talking about how big we are," he told the newspaper American Banker last year. "We don't have to do that anymore." 
 Mr. McColl's string of deals transformed what was once the NCNB Corporation, a midsized North Carolina bank, into the super-regional NationsBank and finally into Bank of America, the nation's third-largest. 
 Over the last two years, Mr. Lewis has concentrated on tidying up the place, in part by cutting the bank's holdings of corporate loans in half and withdrawing from other volatile businesses, like subprime mortgages and auto leasing. He has expanded in areas with more predictable earnings, like consumer banking. 
 All the while, he has talked about generating what he called "organic" growth, meaning growth from within, not through acquisitions.
 Investors liked what they saw. 
 From a low of $36 in 2000, Bank of America's stock slowly but steadily moved higher. By the end of last week it was trading at just over $80 a share -- an impressive comeback, although still below the $89 price that the stock of what was then NationsBank hit just before Mr. McColl engineered the $61 billion purchase of Bank of America in April 1998. 
 On word of the FleetBoston deal yesterday, the stock posted its biggest one-day drop in almost five years, falling $8.29, or just over 10 percent, to $73.57. 
 At a news conference, Mr. Lewis played down the stock market's verdict.
 "I don't think anybody could do a deal at any price that investors would like in the short term," he said. "They are going to like this deal over time." 
 But analysts were plainly skeptical. 
 "This deal is about size and scale and all those things" that used to be associated with Mr. McColl, said Nancy A. Bush, who heads her own stock research firm in Annandale, N.J. "One of the reasons the stock is down 10 percent is because the world thought the model had changed. There is shock and dismay at work, and rightly so. He is going to have some proving to do." 
 Analysts say it is unlikely that Mr. Lewis -- who joined NCNB as a credit analyst out of Georgia State University in 1969 and has been with the company ever since -- is looking at the FleetBoston deal as a way to put himself in the same league as Mr. McColl. 
 "He is a very pragmatic guy," said Denis Laplante, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
 As an example of that pragmatism, Mr. Laplante pointed to the way Mr. Lewis has reacted to the New York attorney general's investigation of the mutual fund industry, which could lead to the filing of criminal and civil charges against some of its executives. 
 The announcement yesterday that Richard M. DeMartini, the head of Bank of America's asset management unit, would leave after the FleetBoston merger, means that all four Bank of America executives named in the investigation will have resigned since the scandal broke.
 "I have to give Ken Lewis credit for dealing with the problems forthrightly and bringing in people to try and deal with this," Mr. Laplante said. 
 But for now the FleetBoston deal appears to have undone a lot of the good will Mr. Lewis had been building up. Whether the ill will lasts may depend on his salesmanship.
 "Wall Street feels betrayed," Ms. Bush said. "But the memory of Wall Street is notoriously short. If this deal works out, nobody will remember that everybody dumped all over it when it was announced."

HEADLINE: Acquisition Would Create Nation's Largest Health Insurer 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
In a marriage of Blue Cross giants, Anthem Inc. agreed yesterday to buy WellPoint Health Networks for $16.4 billion in stock and cash, creating a company that would be the nation's largest health insurer, with 26 million health plan members in 13 states.
 Anthem and WellPoint were pioneers in converting Blue Cross plans into for-profit companies, but lately had met with resistance from state authorities who argued that such deals led to higher costs and thinner insurance coverage. Together, the companies account for more than 30 percent of the 84 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield members nationwide. 
 The combined company, to be called WellPoint Inc. and with headquarters in Indianapolis, would overtake UnitedHealth Group in size. Yesterday UnitedHealth announced a deal of its own, agreeing to buy Mid Atlantic Medical Services for $2.95 billion, also in cash and stock. That deal will add 2 million members on the East Coast to UnitedHealth's 18.3 million total. 
 The Anthem-WellPoint combination will go head-to-head with United for the business of big national employers, analysts said. The combined company will also pursue small businesses and uninsured people by offering lower-cost policies that shift a bigger share of the growing tab for health care to patients, analysts said. 
 Anthem, WellPoint and UnitedHealth became Wall Street favorites over the last few years by raising premiums faster than the inflation rate for hospital and doctor services. A traditional turnin the cycle, to lower insurance company profits, has taken longer than usual, said Joy Grossman, an economist at Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research center in Washington. 
 In trading Monday, WellPoint gained $7.16, or 8.5 percent, to close at $91.09. Anthem shares dropped $6.21, or 8 percent, to $71.05. The transaction values WellPoint at $101.60 per share, or 20 percent above Friday's closing stock price. WellPoint holders would trade their shares for one share each of Anthem plus $23.80 in cash.
 WellPoint's chief executive, Leonard D. Schaeffer, who created the company on the foundation of a successful turnaround of Blue Cross of California, will hand the reins to Larry Glasscock, Anthem's chief executive. Mr. Glasscock, 55, will be president and chief executive of the new company, and Mr. Schaeffer, 58, a former government health care official, will be chairman. 
 Mr. Schaeffer's WellPoint holdings -- 3.3 million shares, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month -- jumped in value by more than $70 million yesterday, to over $300 million. He would also receive $27.5 million under a change-of-control clause in his contract and about $10 million more in executive retirement benefits, according to the WellPoint proxy and other filings.
 Mr. Glasscock is a former banker who has engineered a string of acquisitions since he joined Anthem as chief executive in 1999. He said the WellPoint deal would close in mid-2004, assuming approvals by shareholders, federal antitrust officials and state insurance departments as well as the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The companies said they did not expect to encounter antitrust concerns, because they generally do not compete against each other.
 Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, president of the American Medical Association, said the two merger announcements raised concerns that "the country is headed toward a health care system dominated by a few publicly traded companies that operate primarily in the interest of shareholders."
 On a conference call, Mr. Glasscock noted that the new WellPoint "will have No.1 market share in 12 states." He added that Anthem and WellPoint both "have substantial experience in making acquisitions work."
 Anthem and WellPoint may have agreed to combine because efforts to convert Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans to for-profit status have stalled, analysts said. An attempt by Anthem to merge with the Blues in Kansas was blocked by state authorities, as were WellPoint deals in Maryland and Washington. "The pipeline of nonprofit conversions has dried up," Scott Fidel, a health care analyst at J.P. Morgan, said. WellChoice Inc., the parent of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York, is the only other for-profit company in the Blues system. 
 Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst and managing director at the Carlyle Group, said: "WellChoice could be a merger target for the new WellPoint, but I would be very surprised if that happened soon." 
 Credit analysts expressed some concerns about the new WellPoint. "We view the ultimate company as being enhanced from an operating company perspective and being a little bit weaker from the holding company debt perspective," said Shellie Stoddard, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency.
 The acquisitions of Anthem and WellPoint added $3 billion of goodwill to the books of each company, and the merger will pile another $11 billion of goodwill onto the combined company, she said. WellPoint has added plans in Georgia, Missouri and Wisconsin to its California base. Anthem, from a core in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, expanded by acquiring plans in Connecticut, New Hampshire, Colorado, Maine, Nevada and Virginia.
 Mr. Glasscock said the deal would bring $50 million in savings next year, rising to $250 million in 2006, mainly from administrative and technology costs, and rebates through joint buying from drug makers. 
Mr. Schaeffer said WellPoint had adopted computer systems that incorporate new software for tasks like data analysis without disrupting older systems used in customer service. In the past, computer glitches have caused big problems for a number of growing insurers, notably Oxford Health Plans and the the Cigna Corporation.
 Douglas Sherlock, an independent consultant to a number of Blue Cross plans, said the main savings from the merger would come from using the new WellPoint's Blue Cross credentials to woo insurance brokers. 
 In the UnitedHealth deal, Mid Atlantic investors will receive $18 a share in cash and .82 United Health share for each Mid Atlantic share. In trading Monday, UnitedHealth shares fell $1.85, or 3.41 percent, to close at $52.40. Mid Atlantic shares rose $5.74, or 10.65 percent, to $59.62.
 Mid Atlantic's customers are in Washington, Virginia, Delaware, West Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Another Visit to China, Another Warning From a U.S. Official 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans plans to give China its toughest warning so far that the administration is growing impatient with Beijing's refusal to fully open its markets to American goods and services.
 Mr. Evans will deliver that message in a speech in Beijing on Tuesday, ratcheting up pressure that has been steadily building since September by a parade of top administration visitors, according to an advance copy of the speech. 
 In a blunt critique, Mr. Evans will accuse China of failing to keep the promises it made when it joined the World Trade Organization. They included reforming its markets, lowering its trade barriers and ridding itself of protectionism by the government and by its industries.
 "China is moving far too slowly in its transition to an open, market-based economy," Mr. Evans will say in the speech. "We have been patient, but our patience is wearing thin." 
 Frustration over the weak economy and joblessness has focused increasingly on China and has become a campaign issue for Republicans and Democrats alike. 
 The United States imports five times more than it exports to China, leading to a trade deficit that could reach $130 billion this year.
 Mr. Evans will warn of this growing tide of resentment toward China, repeatedly saying "we are already seeing signs of rising protectionist sentiments."
 American manufacturers, some of whom are large donors to President Bush's campaign, have insisted that the imbalance is because of the artificially low value of the Chinese currency. They want the Chinese to float their currency on the open market, which would weaken the dollar and lower the price of American goods abroad while making Chinese imports more expensive in the American market.
 Democratic and Republican lawmakers, responding to the closing of manufacturing plants in their districts, have introduced legislation that would impose a 27 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States if Beijing fails to embark on a market-based currency. 
 While saying that the administration opposes these measures, Mr. Evans plans to say that the "U.S. market will not remain open forever under unfair terms."
 These themes will sound familiar to Chinese officials who heard similar, if more diplomatic, complaints from Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, when he was in Beijing last week. Mr. Zoellick told the Chinese that the United States needed a two-way street, to try to expand U.S. exports to China.
 In September, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow had pushed China to raise the value of its currency. In response, the Chinese said they would take "interim steps" to loosen restrictions on the country's tightly controlled financial system. 
 The speech by Mr. Evans will pointedly say that is not enough.
 "Time is running out," he will say. "We need to see results. There is friction and the slow pace of reform in the Chinese market is the source of the friction."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: OCCUPATION; 
Iraq Paradox: Cracking Down While Promoting Freedom

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
At one of the first meetings of the White House's new Iraq Stabilization Group, days before the series of attacks on Monday that left at least 34 dead, President Bush's aides debated the trade-off between locking down Baghdad and demonstrating to Iraqis that they now live in an open society, where they are free to shop, go to work or even protest the American-led occupation.
 "It wasn't much of a discussion," one of Mr. Bush's senior aides reported. "We couldn't turn the place into a police state for long, even if we wanted to. And if we did, it would be a Pyrrhic victory." 
 Now that question is more urgent than ever.
Even with the number and sophistication of the daily attacks accelerating, Mr. Bush's response to questions about how the United States should respond has become almost automatic: The United States is slowly winning hearts and minds, and making Saddam Hussein's loyalists "more desperate" each day. 
The situation will improve, he argues, as Iraqis themselves take more and more authority over the security scene.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's aides and Pentagon officials describe what is going on as a war of attrition, against enemies whose resources are being depleted, suggesting they will eventually run out of steam.
But when speaking on background, some senior administration officials acknowledge that some of those answers are beginning to ring hollow. Retraining the Iraqi Army, as Mr. Bush was reminded again on Monday in an Oval Office meeting with L. Paul Bremer III, the chief of the American authority in Iraq, is a slow business -- far too slow for the urgency of the problems facing the occupation forces. 
While the mixture of loyalists to Saddam Hussein, foreign infiltrators and released criminals may not be able to build momentum over the long term, they have certainly built some in the past few weeks -- as demonstrated by the attack on the Rashid Hotel on Sunday and the apparently coordinated attacks on the Red Cross and police stations on Monday. 
Targets like those could be cordoned off with new bomb barriers, new walls, new restrictions on movement.
But then, said one senior official, "you would have Beirut, without the ocean view." 
So the decision for now is to avoid a crackdown, especially one so disruptive of everyday life that Arabs could seize upon it as evidence that Iraqis have simply traded one kind of repression for another. 
The first test has already descended on the administration: Ramadan. Only a few hours after the bombing on Monday, Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commander of the Fourth Infantry Division, was telling reporters how his troops had been told to keep their distance during the most sacred month on the Muslim calendar. He said they should "not really be patrolling or be around those areas when they are in their time of -- when they're conducting their prayers."
In other words, in the name of a light touch and religious freedom, General Odierno's troops are creating another buffer zone -- one where Iraqis can observe the holy month, and where holdovers of the old government and their foreign allies can plan and try to carry out terror attacks.
It is not clear that there are any other choices. The attack on the Rashid Hotel on Sunday, during the visit of the deputy secretary of defense, Paul D. Wolfowitz, underscores the nature of the problem. The hotel is well within a security buffer, and it is surrounded by a wall. 
Its attackers had to fire their rockets from hundreds of yards away, with a makeshift launcher hidden in a portable electric generator. A wider security perimeter would probably have halted the attack, and saved the life of the one American, an Army colonel, who was killed in his hotel room.
But it also would have required closing down an entire Baghdad neighborhood, one filled with Iraqis who, for the most part, have welcomed Mr. Hussein's ouster from power.
"Locking down Baghdad would take enormous manpower and resources, more than the administration has been willing to provide," said Michele A. Flournoy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here, and a former Pentagon official in the Clinton administration. 
Even were such a lockdown possible, she said, "It would be at a great cost -- perhaps at the cost of turning the Baghdad population against us, decisively."
That would be risky at any moment, she said, but particularly now, "at a tipping point where we must keep the Baghdad population with us, or at least not against us.
"If we make their life difficult," Ms. Flournoy said, "we may lose their support."
That is the kind of problem that Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, had in mind when she created the Iraq Stabilization Group, the coordinating committee inside the White House that is supposed to hone Mr. Bush's message, keep the Iraqi economy growing, and balance good military practice and good politics.
It is a balancing act, one senior administration official said during Mr. Bush's trip to Asia, that is being made all the more difficult by the absence of vocal support from the rest of the Arab world.
There has been no outcry, he noted, from "neighboring states -- our allies -- as the attacks on Americans have mounted. No outcry at all. Which has got to embolden the terror groups."
Mr. Bush is also increasingly concerned about the infiltration of foreign fighters from the Iranian and Syrian borders. Measuring their numbers is nearly impossible, American officials say. But the concern is that they are a source of continuing funds, technology and strength for the pro-Hussein forces.
The White House strategy, one senior official noted, depends heavily on choking off those funds, guns and explosives so that the Hussein loyalists are gradually starved of resources. "To look at the plan," the senior official said, "the starvation effect should have started a few months ago. It didn't -- and that's something to worry about."

HEADLINE: BANKING GIANT: THE HOMETOWN; 
Fear of Losing Name With Roots in Colonial Boston

BYLINE:  By KATIE ZEZIMA 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
Through mergers and acquisitions over the years, FleetBoston Financial has become the foremost banking institution in New England. But with Bank of America's announcement on Monday that it will acquire Fleet in a $48 billion deal, the Fleet name may soon disappear from the cityscape it now dominates. 
 The merger with Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., was greeted here with mixed reactions. Public officials cautioned that the deal could hurt the Boston economy. But some financial analysts said that it could lead to improved banking services in New England. 
 Fleet's roots in Boston go back to 1784, when, as Massachusetts Bank, it was the first federally chartered bank in the United States. Fleet has branches throughout the city. FleetCenter is the home of Boston's basketball and hockey teams. FleetBoston Pavilion is a popular outdoor concert center on Boston Harbor. The bank has a prominent presence in Providence, R.I., with the Fleet Skating Center, and it has large regional headquarters in Portland, Me., and Manchester, N.H. 
 "Now the control is moving out," said William F. Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. "This is now a loss of control outside the region, and nothing can be clearer than that the offices are in North Carolina and not here. They're in the same time zone, but not the same economic zone."
 Mr. Galvin said he might conduct a regulatory review of the two companies if they decide to consolidate their mutual fund divisions. 
 While Fleet has merged before, most recently when it acquired BankBoston in 1999, Mr. Galvin said this deal was different because the institution would no longer be headquartered in Boston. Although Charles K. Gifford, chief executive of Fleet, said staffing levels at the bank would remain the same, Mr. Galvin worries that will not be true for long. 
 "History shows that these assurances are short-lived," he said.
 The Fleet deal comes after the announcement last month of the acquisition of John Hancock Financial Services, based in Boston, by Manulife Financial of Canada for $11 billion in stock. Gillette, Fidelity Investments, Liberty Mutual, Putnam Investments and the State Street Corporation are the city's remaining large companies.
 Gerard S. Cassidy, the managing director for equity research at the Portland, Me., office of RBC Capital Markets, said the Fleet deal would affect the psyche of New Englanders accustomed to having a major bank based in their region. But he said that over a 5- to 10-year period, the merger would benefit the region. 
 "Fleet Bank recognized it was becoming increasingly difficult to remain competitive in the large banking arena. In the near term, Fleet's decision was a major win for its shareholders," Mr. Cassidy said. "It means the region is now serviced by a very large bank with a significant presence in the U.S.," he noted, with significant capital "to lend into the New England market."
 Mr. Cassidy said that while the 1999 consolidation of Fleet and BankBoston caused widespread layoffs and customer complaints, that should not happen with the new deal because Fleet and Bank of America are not competitors in the local market. The Fleet acquisition will, for the first time, give Bank of America a presence in New England. As for job losses, Mr. Cassidy said he thought any layoffs at the corporate headquarters would be made up with jobs created at new branches.
 Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston said there were still "a lot of questions to be answered" about the merger, including how it would affect several thousand Fleet jobs in the state and the bank's substantial community-giving program. 
 But Mayor David N. Cicilline of Providence said he had received assurances from Mr. Gifford that the 3,900 Fleet employees in Rhode Island would keep their jobs and that more jobs might be created. Mr. Cicilline said he thought that Fleet's philanthropic activities would go on. "He reassured me of the bank's continuing contribution to Providence," Mr. Cicilline said. 
 Some Fleet customers also said they were concerned that the merger would eliminate jobs and weaken the economy. Jason Dalrymple, 27, a consultant from Quincy, Mass., has been a Fleet customer for nine years. "I'm a little skeptical and I think even though we will see some layoffs," he said, "I hope the customer service doesn't change." 
 Many Fleet employees who were questioned outside the bank's headquarters and in its branches would not discuss the merger. But one employee at a branch in downtown Boston, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not fear for his job. "I don't think it's going to change anything at all," he said. "I'm not worried because Bank of America has nothing in the Northeast." 
 As for the name of FleetCenter, an arena spokeswoman, Courtney McIlhenny, said whether that would change was "up in the air" because of a contract provision.
 But at a news conference, Kenneth D. Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, said, "I'd love for it to be the Bank of America Center," the Associated Press reported. 
 A Fleet spokesman did not return numerous telephone calls for comment.

HEADLINE: Zillions Of Universes? Or Did Ours Get Lucky? 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
Cosmology used to be a heartless science, all about dark matter lost in mind-bending abysses and exploding stars. But whenever physicists and astronomers gather, the subject that roils lunch, coffee breaks or renegade cigarette breaks tends to be not dark matter or the fate of the universe. Rather it is about the role and meaning of life in the cosmos.
 Cosmologists held an unusual debate on the question during a recent conference, "The Future of Cosmology," at Case Western Reserve University here. 
 According to a controversial notion known as the anthropic principle, certain otherwise baffling features of the universe can only be understood by including ourselves in the equation. The universe must be suitable for life, otherwise we would not be here to wonder about it. 
The features in question are mysterious numbers in the equations of physics and cosmology, denoting, say, the amount of matter in the universe or the number of dimensions, which don't seem predictable by any known theory -- yet. They are like the knobs on God's control console, and they seem almost miraculously tuned to allow life.
A slight tweak one way or another from the present settings could cause all stars to collapse into black holes or atoms to evaporate, negating the possibility of biology.
If there were only one universe, theorists would have their hands full trying to explain why it is such a lucky one.
But supporters of the anthropic principle argue that there could be zillions of possible universes, many different possible settings ruled by chance. Their view has been bolstered in recent years by a theory of the Big Bang, known as inflation, which implies that our universe is only one bubble in an endless chain of them, and by string theory -- the so-called theory of everything -- whose equations seem to have an almost uncountable number of solutions, each representing a different possible universe.
Only a few of these will be conducive to life, the anthropic argument goes, but it is no more surprise to find ourselves in one of them than it is to find ourselves on the moist warm Earth rather than on Pluto.
In short we live where we can live, but those can be fighting words.
Scientists agree that the name "anthropic principle," is pretentious, but that's all they agree on. Some of them regard the idea as more philosophy than science. Others regard it as a betrayal of the Einsteinian dream of predicting everything about the universe.
Dr. David Gross regards it as a virus. "Once you get the bug you can't get rid of it," he complained at the conference.
Dr. Gross, director of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., had agreed to lead a panel discussion on the notorious principle. Often found puffing on a cigar, he is not known to be shy about expressing his opinion.
"I was chosen because I hate the anthropic principle," he said.
But playing a central role in defending the need for what he called "anthropic reasoning" was Dr. Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate from the University of Texas. Like Dr. Gross, Dr. Weinberg is a particle physicist who is known for being a hard-core reductionist in his approach to science, but he evinces a gloomy streak in his writings and his talks. He is still famous for writing in his 1977 book, "The First Three Minutes," "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless."
Dr. Weinberg is among the most prominent of theorists who have reluctantly accepted, at least provisionally, the anthropic principle as a kind of tragic necessity in order to explain the gnarliest knob of all.
Called the cosmological constant, it is a number that measures the amount of cosmic repulsion caused by the energy in empty space. That empty space should be boiling with such energy is predicted by quantum theory, and astronomers in the last few years have discovered that some cosmic repulsion seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe. But theoretical attempts to calculate this constant, also known as lambda, result in numbers 1060 times as high as those astronomers have measured. 
So despairing are physicists of understanding the cosmological constant that Dr. Weinberg joked earlier at the meeting that he would no longer read papers about it.
Back in 1989, before any cosmological constant had been discovered, Dr. Weinberg used the anthropic principle to set limits on the value of the constant. Suppose instead of being fixed by theory, it was random from universe to universe. In that case the value of the cosmological constant in our universe may just be an "environmental effect," he explained, and we shouldn't expect to be able to predict it exactly any more than you can calculate how much rain will fall in Seattle this Christmas.
In his paper, Dr. Weinberg argued that lambda in our universe could not be too big or the repulsive force would have prevented the formation of galaxies, stars and us. Since we are here, the constant should be small.
The recently discovered "dark energy" causing the cosmic acceleration fits comfortably inside Dr. Weinberg's limits, vindicating in a way the anthropic approach.
In his talk, Dr. Weinberg described the anthropic principle as "the sort of historical realization scientists have been forced to make from time to time."
"Our hope was to explain everything," he said. "Part of progress is we learn what we can explain on fundamental grounds and what we cannot."
Other panelists, including Dr. Alex Vilenkin, a physicist from Tufts University, suggested that the anthropic reasoning was a logical attempt to apply probabilities to cosmology, using all the data, including the fact of our own existence. Dr. John Peacock, a cosmologist at the University of Edinburgh, argued that the anthropic principle was not a retreat from physics, but an advance. The existence of an ensemble of universes with different properties, he explained, implies a mechanism to produce variation, a kind of cosmic genetic code, the way that evolution implies the existence of genes.
"You gain new physics," Dr. Peacock said.
But when his own turn came, Dr. Gross questioned whether the rules of the anthropic game were precise enough. What were the parameters that could vary from universe to universe? How many could vary at once? What was the probability distribution of their values, and what was necessary for "life"?
Anthropic calculations are inherently vague and imprecise, he said. As a result, the principle could not be disproved. But he was only getting warmed up. His real objection, he said, was "totally emotional." 
Ascribing the parameters of physics to mere chance or vagaries of cosmic weather is defeatist, discouraging people from undertaking the difficult calculations that would actually explain why things are they way they are. Moreover, it is also dangerous, he declared to ringing applause.
"It smells of religion and intelligent design," he said, referring to a variety of creationism that argues that the universe is too complex to have evolved by chance.
Dr. Lawrence Krauss, the astrophysicist from Case Western who had organized the conference and recruited the panel, characterized the anthropic principle as "a way of killing time" when physicists didn't have a better idea. Dr. Krauss, who has battled creationists over biology instruction in the public schools in Ohio, said he had encountered anthropic arguments as an argument for fine-tuning, the idea that God had fixed the universe just for us.
Dr. Weinberg replied that the anthropic principle was not really a part of science, but rather "a guess about the future shape of science."
"If we didn't have things in our universe that seem peculiar, like the value of the cosmological constant, we wouldn't worry about it," he said.
Dr. Weinberg compared the situation to a person who is dealt a royal flush in a poker tournament. It may be chance, he said, but there is another explanation: "Namely, is the organizer of the tournament our friend?"
"But that leads to the argument about religion," he said to much laughter.
In fact, Dr. Weinberg said, the anthropic principle was "a nice nontheistic explanation of why things are as nice as they are."
By then the audience was squirming to get in on the action. Hands were waving as Dr. Gross called the session to an end. "Clearly there is a diversity of opinion," he intoned. "Some people find the small value of cosmological constant so bizarre that only the anthropic principle will pick it out." 
Nobody who adheres to the anthropic principle, he said, would hold on if there were "an honest old-fashioned calculation," that explained the cosmological constant.
Given the floor for the last word, Dr. Weinberg agreed that it was too soon to give up hope for such a breakthrough. "I'm prepared to go on hoping that one will be found," he said. "But after the passage of time one begins to entertain other possibilities, and the anthropic explanation is another possibility."
Applying that mode of reasoning, he said, could help make the cosmological constant less peculiar, 
"But we don't know if that's the help that we really deserve to get," he concluded.
And it was time for lunch.
Dr. Gross reported later that younger physicists had thanked him for his stand.
Dr. Weinberg said the panel had generated more fuss than the subject deserved.
"Those who favor taking the anthropic principle seriously don't really like it," he said, "and those who argue against it recognize that it may be unavoidable."

HEADLINE: For Aging Runners, a Formula Makes Time Stand Still 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For hundreds of runners, the New York Marathon on Sunday will bring the same dispiriting experience. Setting out to beat a personal best established when their legs were years younger, they will fall short and become convinced that they simply did not run a good enough race.
 Dr. Ray C. Fair knows the agony, and he has a soothing explanation. 
 Dr. Fair is a professor of economics at Yale best known for devising a mostly accurateformula to predict winners of presidential elections. He is also the finisher of 17 marathons and counting, and he has turned his social scientist's eye to a question that many a serious runner has considered: how can you keep racing against yourself long after you can no longer catch yourself? 
His answer comes in the form of the most enjoyable research paper he has written, he said, and a chapter in his recent book, "Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things" (Stanford University Press, 2002). Studying world records for runners all the way up to 92 years old, Dr. Fair has developed tables that try to track the body's physical deterioration and set an ever-moving target.
If a 50-year-old finishes the race on Sunday in four hours, 10 years after having run it in 3 hours 45 minutes, for instance, she can know that she is aging no more quickly than the world's fleetest runners. 
"I'm right now at the age where things are getting worse in a bigger way," said Dr. Fair, 61, using colloquial language to describe the increase in second derivatives on his chart. "But there's always something to shoot for. It keeps you young, psychologically, even when you're not up there in the front anymore."
Having been published in The Review of Economics and Statistics, Dr. Fair's work has an academic credibility rare in matters of sport. But his tables are also part of a growing effort to help runners track their times over a lifetime.
In 2001, the New York Road Runners Club began posting on its Web site (www.nyrrc.org) "age graded" times that it calculates for all racers. Finishers in the marathon on Sunday will be able to look up the equivalent of their time for somebody at the peak running ages of the 20's and 30's. A five-hour finish, after all, is much more impressive for a 70-year-old than for a 30-year-old.
The New York Marathon's adjustments come from World Masters Athletics, the governing body for many adult track meets. The group made an early effort at adjusting times when it published a set of tables in the late 1980's. It plans to release a second revision of the tables in the next year, said Norman M. Green Jr., chairman of the Masters Long Distance Running Committee of USA Track & Field. 
The new tables will include adjustments for women that are based on their times, rather than on men's, as is the case with the current tables. 
Dr. Fair became interested in the topic in the 1980's, when he realized that the national circuit of masters races, open to men older than 40 and women older than 35 and divided into age divisions, had created enough data for him to perform the calculations. He studied the tables published by the masters group and decided to approach the problem with the same rigorous technique, known as regression analysis, that is at the heart of much economic research, he said. 
A few years earlier, in 1987, he broke three hours in a marathon for the first time, 2:58:45 in Philadelphia, and he wanted to know his chances of doing so again. 
"I was combining my statistical knowledge with the fact that I was getting older and running slower," Dr. Fair said.
The answer, he found, was that he had a surprisingly good chance to do so. The masters records showed that the world's best runners lost just a minute or so a year in their 40's.
Two years after Philadelphia, however, he strayed slightly from his predicted path, finishing the New York Marathon in 3:01:45, and he has remained off the pace since then. 
"After I finish a race," he said, "all my friends ask me, 'Are you on your regression line?' And I'm not quite on my regression line."
But he said he thought that the reason might have more to do with his weaknesses as a runner, as well as a chronic thigh injury, than his weaknesses as an economist. Other athletes who have used the tables have been able to keep up with their predictions.
John Pistel, a fund-raiser for Amherst College, had not competed in the long-jump in more than 30 years when he decided to take up the sport again in 2000. As an undergraduate at the college in the late 1960's, Mr. Pistel set the school record, which still stands, of about 24 feet.
An Amherst economist who knows Dr. Fair gave Mr. Pistel a version of the tables for the event. His best effort as a 52-year-old was seven feet shy of his Amherst record but almost precisely what Dr. Fair's table for the event predicted.
The reasons the body slows down are as numerous as they are obvious. The heart can no longer pump blood at the same rate, and the lungs cannot put oxygen into blood at the same pace, noted Dr. Edward G. Lakatta, chief of the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science at the National Institute on Aging. Tissues cannot extract oxygen from blood as efficiently, and cells are not as good at using oxygen after they receive it. Bones and joints deteriorate as well, Dr. Lakatta said.
For marathoners, the process often begins to affect results shortly after 30. It continues at a steady pace through the 50's, and accelerates after that.
"There is a point," Dr. Green said, "when there is a sudden decline." 
Dr. Fair found it to be the age of 60, which is roughly consistent with a long line of medical research. From 60 to 70, marathoners lose almost as much time as they did in the 25 years from 35 to 60. Middle-distance runners deteriorate faster at first, but they do not slow down as much as marathoners in their 60's and 70's, he said. 
Underlying all the research, of course, is an assumption that ordinary people -- or at least ordinary marathon runners -- age at the same rate as elite athletes. 
If that is not the case, Dr. Fair's tables and the masters tables would be setting the bar at the wrong place for most people.
Scientists have yet to agree on an answer, however. 
"This is something people have argued a lot about over the years," said Dr. Roy J. Shepard, an emeritus professor of applied physiology at the University of Toronto who has written widely on aging and exercise. "My own view is that very top people do age a little less rapidly."
Those athletes, Dr. Shepard said, are more likely to keep themselves in peak physical condition and less likely to become injured performing a given activity.
Dr. Lakatta at the National Institute on Aging comes from the opposite camp. The gap between cardiovascular systems of top athletes and other people in their 20's is greater than the gap when the two groups reach their 80's, he said.
Either way, though, the age-adjusted tables offer a simple test for athletes who would otherwise have little way to compare their results over decades: are they keeping up with the very best performers in their event?
For Dr. Fair, the standard has switched, from 3 hours to 3 hours 20 minutes, according to his tables. He will have his next crack at it on Nov. 23, at the Philadelphia Marathon.

F4) Chart: "Running the Numbers"These tables, developed by the economist Dr. Ray C. Fair, allow runners to continue racing against themselves even as they age and slow down. Using the fastest marathon times ever run by people of a given age, Mr. Fair calculated an age factor for every age after 35, which is the last time many people are able to set a personal best. If a 50-year-old woman ran a marathon in 4 hours when she was 35, she multiplies: 4 HOURS x 1.098 = 4.392 HOURSTo convert to minutes: .392 x 60 = 23.52.So her goal is 4:23:30. If she beats that time at age 50, she is actually running a better race than she did 15 years earlier. Because the body appears to slow down at a different pace for shorter distances, Mr. Fair created a separate table for the middle distances, those from 400 to 10,000 meters.

 BODY:
WHY AMERICA SLEPT
The Failure to Prevent 9/11
By Gerald Posner
241 pages. Random House. $24.95.
 Success, it is said, has a thousand fathers, while failure is an orphan. Gerald Posner's "Why American Slept: The Failure to Prevent 9/11" goes far to prove the opposite: the C.I.A., the F.B.I., Congress, the State Department, the media, the White House, the foreign policy establishment and the general climate of public opinion all contributed to the failure to prevent the devastating mass terror attacks of 2001. 
 It is very hard for outsiders to judge the reliability of books that claim to give the inside story of secret and dramatic events. Mr. Posner apparently relies heavily on James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, for much of his information; other sources would no doubt have given a very different spin to the story. The F.B.I. and the C.I.A. come under heavy criticism; both agencies emerge looking more like the Keystone Kops than elite organizations, but on balance Mr. Posner seems to blame the F.B.I. more.
He writes that some of the C.I.A.'s most serious breaches involved failing to hand over information to the F.B.I. in a timely way. Bureaucratic rivalry was part of the reason, but so, too, was what seemed at times to have been a well-founded fear that the F.B.I. would not use information effectively and might compromise it. Mr. Posner argues convincingly that the F.B.I.'s orientation toward solving crimes rather than preventing them is a major cultural obstacle that will have to be overcome if the F.B.I. is to become more effective in what looks more and more like intelligence and less and less like conventionalpolice work.
Mr. Posner faults what he calls excessive concerns over civil liberties for tying the hands (or intimidating the agents) of law enforcement agencies. It is hard to evaluate these claims fully, but he makes a strong case that whatever happened after 9/11, the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of controlling and limiting the activities of law enforcement and intelligence activities before the attacks. The lesson for civil libertarians here may be that giving law enforcement a little more authority in peacetime will help avoid the sharp pendulum shifts that come after events like the September attacks.
"Why America Slept" closes with a riveting and disquieting account of the interrogation by American agents of the captured Al Qaeda leader and Osama bin Laden confidant Abu Zubaydah. Winning the wounded Mr. Zubaydah's cooperation by alternately giving and withholding pain medication, the agents succeeded in extracting limited amounts of information. 
The trickle turned to a torrent when Mr. Zubaydah was deceived into thinking he was being interrogated by Saudis. He acted like a man delivered into a safe haven and started babbling the names of high-ranking Saudis who he believed would protect him. Once American officials shared this information with the Saudis, the people on the list rapidly began dying under mysterious circumstances before Americans could interrogate them.
The book's greatest defect is its failure to answer the question posed by the title. This is really the story of how America slept: how one agency after another missed obvious clues, concealed information, ignored danger signs. Why we allowed such a culture of failure and mediocrity to grow through so many bureaucracies is another question, and Mr. Posner doesn't really address it.
The answer may have something to do with the widespread American optimism after the fall of the Berlin Wall that history was over, and that the United States had won. Our economic system and our values were triumphant; nobody anywhere on the planet could threaten our security or challenge our ideas. As a result our diplomats, our intelligence agencies and our political leaders grew lax. We could afford to be "fault tolerant"; we could afford to indulge in pleasant fantasies about the kind of world we lived in.
Mr. Posner calls his book infuriating, and he is right. The level of sheer incompetence repeatedly demonstrated by everyone from senior officials to operatives on the ground makes a dismal story. On the brighter side, the message of "Why America Slept" is on balance a hopeful one. Incompetence in our security establishment is something we can address. If such a spectacular and long-running series of failures was necessary to provide the opening the terrorists used on 9/11, then it's not unreasonable to hope that we can defend ourselves much more effectively in the future.

To the Editor:
Re "Rosier Picture, but for Those Who Saw Pink, Pain Lingers" (Working section, Oct. 28):
 A labor market that permanently loses manufacturing jobs during a recovery, only to have some of them appear in the service sector, must be discouraging not only for those losing jobs but for union leaders as well. 
 It means that the labor movement will continue to shrink (14 percent of manufacturing workers are now in unions, compared with 32 percent in 1980) and many ex-union members will be finding work where unions are weakest (there is only 6 percent unionization in the service sector).
If unions are to grow as the economy recovers, they must find ways to continue to represent workers who move to lower-paying jobs. Otherwise, unions will fight for their relevancy, and workers who need union protection the most will remain without it.

HEADLINE: As Contract Witching Hour Nears, Restaurant Workers Talk Strike 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
ABOUT 250 waiters, cooks, busboys, bartenders and dishwashers marched across Midtown Manhattan yesterday afternoon, calling for contract settlements that would avoid strikes at some of New York's top restaurants.
 Contracts at 25 restaurants, including high-profile spots like the Four Seasons, the "21" Club, Elaine's, La Cote Basque, La Caravelle, Cafe des Artistes and the Oyster Bar at Grand Central Terminal expire on Friday at midnight. Last Saturday, members of Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union voted overwhelmingly to authorize their leaders to call a strike if agreements are not reached. 
 At 3 p.m., about 100 workers gathered at the Four Seasons, on 52nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, where State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, spoke to them. Walking and chanting down 52nd Street, they picked up about 100 more supporters at Il Menestrello and La Grenouille before pausing at "21." The march ended about an hour later across the street from Gallagher's Steak House, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, where 50 more workers joined them. 
"I'm part of the union, I want to support our brothers and sisters and I want a fair contract," said one of the marchers, Keith Boswell, 37, who has cooked at the Old Homestead for three years. 
As in many recent labor disputes, the major issues are health and pension benefits. The union is asking for a wage increase of 50 cents an hour and no change in health and pension plans. Most of the restaurants have separate contracts with the union, and want the workers to pay a greater share of costs for medical care and some want to stop contributing to pension plans. A few restaurants have said they would not agree to a wage increase unless the workers accepted the health and pension demands.
"This is sad," said another marcher, Marianne Demaree, 56, a waitress at the Four Seasons for 26 years. "I love the Four Seasons. I've been there all my life but I just don't want my health benefits lowered."
Though nine of the restaurants are being represented as a group, most of the contracts are with individual restaurants and the terms vary slightly.
If there is a strike, New Yorkers who want to go out for dinner will not necessarily face a picket line. Fewer than 50 restaurants in New York have workers in the union, which once had a presence in most of New York's better dining rooms. The 25 involved in the labor dispute have about 800 workers. Most of the union's 5,000 members work in cafeterias, sports arenas and country clubs.
The restaurants are expressing less solidarity than the union.
Marc Sherry, an owner of the Old Homestead in the meatpacking district, and Adi Giovanetti, the owner of Il Nido in Midtown, said they are prepared to accept the workers' demands and to sign the new contract. 
"The contract is not a financial issue for us," Mr. Sherry said, "but I've heard that some other restaurants are serious about taking a strike."
Mr. Giovanetti said, "I have people who have been here for 20 years, and I can't cut them. I pay $160,000 to $180,000 a year in health and pension for them, but I don't have the guts to cut their benefits. The problem isn't the union, it's the competition from all the Italian restaurants around here that have opened without union contracts. How can we compete?"
But at Cafe des Artistes, Jenifer Lang, an owner, said she would replace the workers if they went on strike. "We have to stay open," Ms. Lang said. "We've lost serious amounts of money in the last few years, especially since we have the union and we have higher labor costs than our nonunion competition in the neighborhood."
Robert Demand, the head negotiator for Local 100, said: "If restaurants hire replacements they'll be cutting their own throats. I don't believe that customers will patronize a restaurant with a waiter or captain they know out on the street asking them not to go in. They may not identify with the union but they do identify with the bartender."
Other restaurateurs say they refuse to believe they will be affected, and have left the negotiations to their lawyers. 
"I don't think there will be a strike, I haven't been told anything and my lawyer is taking care of it," said Elaine Kaufman, the owner of Elaine's on the Upper East Side. "If there is a strike I'll think about it then."
Alex von Bidder, an owner of the Four Seasons, would not discuss the issues, the negotiations or any contingency plans the restaurant might have. 
Despite Mr. Giovanetti and Mr. Sherry's conciliatory words, Brooks Bitterman, the research director for the union, said he knew of no restaurants that were willing to settle. He also said he had never seen such solidarity in the union, which voted 443 to 26 on Saturday to authorize a strike. 
"A dishwasher gets only $7 or $8 and a prep cook is making $10 to $12," Mr. Bitterman said. "These people stick around in these jobs, they've given so much to the restaurants to make them work. They're furious at management and don't see the need for givebacks on pensions and health care. They sense that the restaurants are A.O.K., in fine shape. It's crazy that some of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country want givebacks. There's an absurd amount of money pouring into these places and management has misjudged the worker's anger."
While some restaurants have yet to recover from the effects of Sept. 11, the economic downturn, the decrease in tourism and higher expenses, Chuck Hunt, the executive vice president of the Greater New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said overall, the industry is regaining its health.
"Right now the restaurants are doing all right," Mr. Hunt said, "they're coming back, improving."
Mr. Sherry said the Old Homestead is doing well.
The owners of La Caravelle, Rita and Andre Jammet, paint a less glowing picture. "Business has been up and down and maybe it's near last year's levels," Mrs. Jammet said. "Our food costs have gone up a good 15 percent, especially for beef. Insurance went way up after Sept. 11, and real estate taxes are up. And this is not a good time to raise prices." Mr. Jammet added that if there is a strike he and his wife will "try to run the show" themselves.
Mr. Demand, the union negotiator, said he thought the talks slowed when the owners called in federal mediators on Monday.
Richard Wilsker, a partner at McGuire Woods, the law firm which represents 17 of the restaurants, including the nine bargaining jointly, said he thought that move would make things go more smoothly.
Mr. Wilsker said the union had made substantial concessions on wages and health benefits, but Mr. Demand denied that.
The union has extended the negotiation period until mid-November for the Oyster Bar and Gallagher's. "The employees are aware of the difficult times these restaurants are having," Mr. Wilsker said. "They know that a union house pays two to three times nonunion. It's sad, because so many of these old places are threatened." 
Bill Granfield, the president of the union local, said while marching down 52nd Street that he was encouraged by some of the negotiations with the restaurants in the last few days. 
But when asked if he thought there was going to be a strike, he answered, "Yes."

PERSON: John James Fay Jr. 

HEADLINE: John J. Fay Jr., 76, Ombudsman For the Elderly of New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
John J. Fay Jr., the New Jersey lawmaker who wrote legislation creating the post of ombudsman to monitor care of the elderly in institutions and then became the first to fill the job, died on Monday at his home in Metuchen, N.J. He was 76.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Carol Brown, said. 
 Mr. Fay was a friend and close adviser to Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, helping him in his successful race for mayor of Woodbridge in 1991 and then in his victorious run for the State Senate two years later. 
John James Fay Jr. was born in Elizabeth, N.J., on June 8, 1927. The son of a fire chief, he enlisted in the Navy immediately after his graduation from St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, serving on an underwater demolition team. He then received bachelor's and master's degrees in political science and history from Seton Hall University. He taught world and United States history and economics at Linden High School in Linden, N.J., from 1958 until 1978.
He was elected a councilman in Woodbridge in 1963 and served until 1966, when he was elected a Middlesex County freeholder. He won a seat in the State Assembly in 1968 and was elected a state senator in 1974.
He was defeated in 1978 after his opponent branded him "the father of the state income tax."
Described by The New York Times in 1977 as "a man of sardonic wit and considerable erudition," Senator Fay sponsored legislation from campaign finance reform to protecting farmland from development.
He was best known for his activism after a fire killed 23 people, mostly elderly, at the Brinley Inn in Bradley Beach. Senator Fay helped write two laws to clear up the tangle of regulations that governed the boarding and rooming houses where many disabled people, especially those discharged from mental institutions, were living. He also helped write a law creating the new Office of the Ombudsman for the Institutionalized Elderly.
"But even if we strive to make these places safe, the existence of these people is hellish at best," Mr. Fay said in an interview with The Times in 1981. "It is not enough to come by and sing Christmas carols to them once a year."
Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed Mr. Fay as ombudsman after his defeat. He held the post from 1978 until 1984. From 1984 until 1989, he was executive director of the State Commission on Cancer Research, a state agency.
Mr. Fay is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1992, and his brothers, Eugene, of Cranford, N.J., and Frank, of Elizabeth.

HEADLINE: The Warming Is Global but the Legislating, in the U.S., Is All Local 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Motivated by environmental and economic concerns, states have become the driving force in efforts to combat global warming even as mandatory programs on the federal level have largely stalled.
 At least half of the states are addressing global warming, whether through legislation, lawsuits against the Bush administration or programs initiated by governors. 
 In the last three years, state legislatures have passed at least 29 bills, usually with bipartisan support. The most contentious is California's 2002 law to set strict limits for new cars on emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that scientists say has the greatest role in global warming.
While few of the state laws will have as much impact as California's, they are not merely symbolic. In addition to caps on emissions of gases like carbon dioxide that can cause the atmosphere to heat up like a greenhouse, they include registries to track such emissions, efforts to diversify fuel sources and the use of crops to capture carbon dioxide by taking it out of the atmosphere and into the ground. 
Aside from their practical effects, supporters say, these efforts will put pressure on Congress and the administration to enact federal legislation, if only to bring order to a patchwork of state laws. 
States are moving ahead in large part to fill the vacuum that has been left by the federal government, said David Danner, the energy adviser for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington.
"We hope to see the problem addressed at the federal level," Mr. Danner said, "but we're not waiting around." 
There are some initiatives in Congress, but for the moment even their backers acknowledge that they are doomed, given strong opposition from industry, the Bush administration -- which favors voluntary controls -- and most Congressional Republicans. 
This week, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a proposal to create a national regulatory structure for carbon dioxide. This would be the first vote for either house on a measure to restrict the gas. 
The proposal's primary sponsors, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, see it mainly as a way to force senators to take a position on the issue, given the measure's slim prospects. 
States are acting partly because of predictions that global warming could damage local economies by harming agriculture, eroding shorelines and hurting tourism.
"We're already seeing things which may be linked to global warming here in the state," Mr. Danner said. "We have low snowpack, increased forest fire danger."
Environmental groups and officials in state governments say that energy initiatives are easier to move forward on the local level because they span constituencies -- industrial and service sectors, Democrat and Republican, urban and rural.
While the coal, oil and automobile industries have big lobbies in Washington, the industry presence is diluted on the state level. Environmental groups say this was crucial to winning a legislative battle over automobile emissions in California, where the automobile industry did not have a long history of large campaign donations and instead had to rely on a six-month advertising campaign to make its case.
Local businesses are also interested in policy decisions because of concerns about long-term energy costs, said Christopher James, director of air planning and standards for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. As a result, environmental groups are shifting their efforts to focus outside Washington.
Five years ago the assumption was that the climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol was the only effort in town, said Rhys Roth, the executive director of Climate Solutions, which works on global warming issues in the Pacific Northwest states. But since President Bush rejected the Kyoto pact in 2001, local groups have been emerging on the regional, state and municipal levels.
The Climate Action Network, a worldwide conglomeration of nongovernment organizations working on global warming, doubled its membership of state and local groups in the last two years.
The burst of activity is not limited to the states with a traditional environmental bent.
At least 15 states, including Texas and Nevada, are forcing their state electric utilities to diversify beyond coal and oil to energy sources like wind and solar power. 
Even rural states are linking their agricultural practices to global warming. Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wyoming have all passed initiatives in anticipation of future greenhouse-gas emission trading, hoping they can capitalize on their forests and crops to capture carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. 
Cities are also adopting new energy policies. San Franciscans approved a $100 million bond initiative in 2001 to pay for solar panels for municipal buildings, including the San Francisco convention center.
The rising level of state activity is causing concern among those who oppose carbon dioxide regulation.
"I believe the states are being used to force a federal mandate," said Sandy Liddy Bourne, who does research on global warming for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group contending that carbon dioxide should not be regulated because it is not a pollutant. "Rarely do you see so many bills in one subject area introduced across the country."
The council started tracking state legislation, which they call son-of-Kyoto bills, weekly after they noticed a significant rise in greenhouse-gas-related legislation two years ago. This year, the council says, 24 states have introduced 90 bills that would build frameworks for regulating carbon dioxide. Sixty-six such bills were introduced in all of 2001 and 2002. 
Some of the activity has graduated to a regional level. Last summer, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York invited 10 Northeastern states to set up a regional trading network where power plants could buy and sell carbon dioxide credits in an effort to lower overall emissions. In 2001, six New England states entered into an agreement with Canadian provinces to cap overall emissions by 2010. Last month, California, Washington and Oregon announced that they would start looking at shared strategies to address global warming.
To be sure, some states have decided not to embrace policies to combat global warming. Six -- Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming -- have explicitly passed laws against any mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
"My concern," said Ms. Bourne, "is that members of industry and environment groups will go to the federal government to say: 'There is a patchwork quilt of greenhouse-gas regulations across the country. We cannot deal with the 50 monkeys. We must have one 800-pound gorilla. Please give us a federal mandate.' " Indeed, some environmentalists say this is precisely their strategy. 
States developed their own air toxics pollution programs in the 1980's, which resulted in different regulations and standards across the country. Industry groups, including the American Chemistry Council, eventually lobbied Congress for federal standards, which were incorporated into the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.
A number of states are trying to compel the federal government to move sooner rather than later. On Thursday, 12 states, including New York, with its Republican governor, and three cities sued the Environmental Protection Agency for its recent decision not to regulate greenhouse-gas pollutants under the Clean Air Act, a reversal of the agency's previous stance under the Clinton administration.
"Global warming cannot be solely addressed at the state level," said Tom Reilly, the Massachusetts attorney general. "It's a problem that requires a federal approach."

HEADLINE: Punishing the Pell Grant Program 

 BODY:
The maximum award of the federal Pell Grant program, created to encourage low- and middle-income students to attend college, covered more than 80 percent of public-college tuition a quarter-century ago but covers only about 40 percent today. Faced with high tuition, up to 25 percent of the low-income students with grades and scores that make them prime college material no longer even apply. 
 Given the importance of a college education for upward mobility, Congress should be rushing to bring this important program up to strength. Instead, the federal Education Department is pushing a process that could cause 85,000 students to lose their Pell grants entirely and hundreds of thousands of others to receive less federal aid. 
 The problem is a pending change in the federal formula that determines how much Pell aid families get, based on their incomes and the state taxes they pay. The formula was supposed to be revised yearly, but went untouched for a decade. Then suddenly, the Education Department revised the formula -- but used state tax data from 2000, before the recession that has sent state taxes rising again.
The Education Department blames the Treasury Department for the delay in updating the formula, saying the I.R.S. produced the needed data only recently. It seems more likely that the government simply backed off the revisions in the 1990's so as not to cause harm at a time when the Pell grants' value was eroding and tuition was rising sharply.
Why is the Bush administration suddenly pushing for a revision based on outdated numbers at a time when the unemployed are having trouble keeping their children in school? The members of Congress who say the revisions should be put off until the government gathers more current tax data are right. But tinkering with the awards formula will do nothing for the tens of thousands of poor and working-class families who are being priced out of college. To deal with that problem, Congress will need to finance the Pell programs so the grants come closer to the real cost of higher education.

HEADLINE: Make Way for Buffalo 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: RAWSON, N.D. 

 BODY:
This forlorn farm town Rawson, population 6 -- is a fine place to contemplate the boldest idea in America today: rescuing the rural Great Plains by returning much of it to a vast "Buffalo Commons."
 The result would be the world's largest nature park, drawing tourists from all over the world to see parts of 10 states alive again with buffalo, elk, grizzlies and wolves. Restoring a large chunk of the plains -- which cover nearly one-fifth of the lower 48 states -- to their original state may also be the best way to revive local economies and keep hamlets like Rawson from becoming ghost towns. 
 Rawson used to be a bustling town with a railroad depot, two stores, a hotel, a bank, a post office, a gas station, a Lutheran church, a lumber yard, a grain elevator and a school. It had its own newspaper, The Rawson Tribune, and its slogan was "Rawson, where opportunity awaits you." 
It has been downhill ever since. Two years ago, after the election for mayor ended in an exact tie (one vote for Nels Heggen and one vote for Garvin Gullickson), after the four adult residents tired of taxing themselves to pay for seven streetlights, they dissolved the city and turned it into an unincorporated village.
"My children won't come back here to live," admitted Mr. Heggen, whose grandfather ran the hotel in town. "There isn't much to do here. Right around here, it's kind of desolate." (Some journalists reach judgments about a place after interviewing just a few inhabitants; I boast that I talked to half the town.)
It sounds cruel to say so, but towns like Rawson are a reminder that the oversettlement of the Great Plains has turned out to be a 150-year-long mistake, one of the longest-running and most costly errors in American history. Families struggled for generations to survive droughts and blizzards, then finally gave up and moved on. You can buy a home out here for $3,000, and you can sometimes rent one for nothing at all if you promise to mow the lawn and keep up the house.
The rural parts of the Great Plains are emptying, and in some cases reverting to wilderness. 
It's immensely sad to travel through the Dakotas' ghost towns or Nebraska's cattle country -- where Loup is the poorest county in America -- because they are full of warm, hard-working, honest farmers and ranchers who are having their hearts broken. How can one not admire the people of Sentinel Butte, N.D., where there is no attendant at the gasoline station but the townspeople all have keys and pay on the honor system?
Yet honesty and sweat aren't enough to make farming and ranching successful in marginal lands. The farms produce plenty of grain and beef, but they will never make much money, even with billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies. The economic model will be even less viable as underground aquifers run out in the next two or three decades. Much plains farming relies on the vast Ogallala aquifer, which is dropping at a rate of four feet per year.
So it's time to reach for something bold, like the Buffalo Commons idea, proposed in 1987 by Frank and Deborah Popper, two New Jersey social scientists. This would be the biggest step to redefine America since the Alaska purchase. Pushing it would give the environmental movement a chance to be known mainly by what it's for instead of for what it's against. But it would take close cooperation with the people with the most at stake: struggling farmers and ranchers, who for now are irritated by East Coast city slickers trying to turn their land into a buffalo playground.
"Why not let us manage our own affairs, just as people in New York would want to manage their own affairs?" asked Keith Winter, a veteran rancher, during a break from working with his calves.
It's a fair question, and a Buffalo Commons can be achieved only if it benefits North Dakotans more than New Yorkers. That should be possible, for states like Colorado, Utah and Idaho have boomed by branching out from their traditional economic base to embrace tourism and recreation, and Buffalo Commons would become one of the world's wonders.
If Buffalo Commons comes about, perhaps a hotel can reopen in Rawlins, and Mr. Winter's ranch could draw German tourists who would pay to herd cattle. If the thunder of buffalo hooves is again heard on the open plains, that will not be the death knell for towns like Rawlins -- it will be their last, best hope.

Putnam Investments Accused of Fraud
Federal and state regulators filed civil lawsuits against Putnam Investments and two of its former managers, accusing them of fraud. They are the first such accusations against a mutual fund company and some of its executives in a widening investigation into the trading of fund shares.
 The case against Putnam involves its practice of allowing investors to trade rapidly in and out of shares, even though its policy was to prohibit such trades, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in the suit. Regulators also contend that Putnam engaged in securities fraud by failing to disclose to shareholders or to its board a series of personal trades by its managers that harmed shareholders. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Car Sticker Prices Mask Some Big Bargains 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
There is an adage in the auto industry that says if you want the best deal on a car, you wait until the last month of the model year. But last month, the end of the 2003 model year, there were bargains beyond belief.
 In September, the average car buyer went home with record discounts of more than $5,000 off the sticker price of a 2003 model vehicle, according to figures to be released Wednesday by Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers buying advice to consumers. 
 The difference between the sticker price and the net transaction price -- what a buyer paid after rebates, other incentives and old-fashioned haggling -- was 18.6 percent, knocking the price of a $29,000 vehicle down to $23,600, according to Edmunds, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 But some vehicles commanded far bigger discounts. Among the most dramatic examples cited by Edmunds was the Lincoln Navigator, a luxury S.U.V. that Ford updated last year. Its sticker price approached $58,000, but a typical Navigator went out the door for $45,000. That meant savings of about $13,000 -- roughly the price of a Ford Focus.
 Similar discounts could be found on the Cadillac DeVille. Its sticker price is $48,000, but it actually sold for just under $35,000, Edmunds said.
 While the sticker price of the Jaguar XJ sedan topped $60,000, the car generally could be had for at least $10,000 less. To be sure, Jaguar, which is owned by Ford, just introduced a new version of the XJ for the 2004 model year, and it is customary for car companies to offer more generous discounts on retired versions to clear them off showroom lots.
 Nonetheless, the deals make it easy to see why General Motors and Chrysler managed only minuscule profits per vehicle during the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30. G.M. netted only $15 per vehicle sold, on average, while Ford lost money on every car and truck it sold in the United States. Such deep discounts may lead some car buyers to ask why automakers do not just charge less to begin with. Jesse Toprak, a senior analyst at Edmunds, said there were several reasons.
 First, he said, cars are defined by their price, and luxury vehicles these days start at a minimum of $35,000. The actual sales price of the DeVille drops it into the mass market category, but its sticker price (not to mention its brand heritage) puts it safely in the range of luxury cars.
 Second, customers are accustomed to wheeling and dealing: cut the price too much and there would be no room to bargain, increasing the risk that buyers would walk away, Mr. Toprak said.
 "Oh, never, never," Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said about the idea of offering price cuts instead of discounts. "The fabric of retailing in the United States incorporates the concept of discounts, and autos aren't any different."
 Lately, auto companies have been reassuring Wall Street that incentives will shrink throughout the fall, as they bring out 2004 models.
 DaimlerChrysler's chief financial officer, Manfred Gentz, told analysts last week that the company was counting on shrinking incentives to help Chrysler post a small profit for the entire year; after sizable losses earlier this year, Chrysler needs to earn about $750 million in the fourth quarter to do so. "Nobody can afford that any more," Mr. Gentz said of the current discount levels.
 Mr. Toprak said there was some reason to expect incentives to drop. In September, the average incentive on vehicles from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler fell for the first time all year, by 1.9 percent to $3,618 from August, because some 2004 models were already available ahead of the new model year in October. 
 Industrywide, automakers last month still paid out an average of $2,622 in incentives on 2003 and 2004 vehicles. And incentives are already popping up on 2004 vehicles, like the Chrysler Pacifica, which carries a $3,000 rebate although it has been on the market only since spring.
 While Mr. Toprak said he expected discounts to shrink in the next couple of months, he warned that they might not keep dropping through December.
 That is because of another auto industry custom: the year-end closeout sale. Last year, incentives dropped in October and November, but rebounded by more than $300 a vehicle in December, as automakers tried to rustle up every sale they could claim for 2002.
 "If one of the companies comes out with a surprise move at the end of the year, the others have to follow suit," Mr. Toprak said.
 Even with the big discounts, auto companies mark down their products far less than electronics makers or department stores. That $13,000 discount on a Navigator amounts to 22 percent off. Mr. Toprak said he did not envision anything like the 50 percent markdowns that beckon shoppers in other areas of the economy around the holidays.
 "There's no vehicle that's that much off," he said. "We're not there yet."

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rose in September 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Durable goods orders rose in September for a fourth month in five, the Commerce Department said yesterday. And the Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said consumers grew more confident in October as their job prospects improved.
 Orders for items made to last at least three years increased 0.8 percent, to $176.3 billion, during September, the Commerce Department said. The increase was led by corporate spending on equipment that is broadening the economic recovery. 
 "There's enough underlying strength in the economy to carry us through at 4 percent growth or so for a while," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economics professor and former Federal Reserve vice chairman. 
 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 81.1 in October from 77 in September, reflecting increases in present conditions and expectations. Economists had forecast a reading of 79.3 for October.
 The confidence report showed a rise in plans to buy autos and appliances. Some 19.7 percent of consumers indicated in October that they expected more jobs to become available within the next six months, the most since June of last year. The number that said jobs were currently plentiful rose to 11.8 percent, the highest since May, from 9.9 percent.
 Excluding transportation equipment, durable goods orders jumped 1.2 percent, the fifth consecutive increase, after rising 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department said.
 Bookings for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for future business investment, rose 3.9 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent in August. Orders waiting to be filled for such equipment rose 1.2 percent, suggesting factories with few goods in stock will need to ramp up production in coming months, economists said.
 Economists had expected durable goods orders to rise 1 percent, to $174.9 billion. Orders excluding transportation equipment were expected to rise 1.1 percent after a previously reported decline of 0.6 percent in August.
Inventories of durable goods dropped 0.7 percent last month, the 31st decline in the last 32 months. Shipments rose 2.5 percent after falling 2.6 percent. The ratio of stockpiles of durables relative to sales dropped to 1.44 months worth in September, the lowest on record.
 Orders for transportation equipment decreased 0.1 percent after falling 1.9 percent in August.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Growth Spurt Accelerates In Wal-Mart's Backyard

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark. 

 BODY:
Rising steps away from Wal-Mart's warehouse-style world headquarters is Bentonville Plaza, a nine-story brick-and-concrete building that will offer an amenity that has not been seen before in this mostly rural but fast-growing corner of northwest Arkansas: a concierge.
 The mention of a concierge in the leasing brochure for the 256,000-square foot building has proved a little ticklish for the people seeking tenants among companies that sell goods to Wal-Mart, whose own offices are famously spartan. 
 The leasing agent for Bentonville Plaza, Tommy L. Van Zandt, hastened to explain that the concierge would not be "someone to get you dinner reservations" but rather someone to coordinate shipments and deliveries. "The need in this area is not for opulence," said Mr. Van Zandt, a managing director of Irwin & Saviers, a real estate services company based in Little Rock. "The need is for usability" 
 But upscale trappings are perhaps inevitable in a region experiencing a construction boom. Bentonville Plaza, where annual asking rents have set a record -- as much as $27 a square foot without utilities -- will also have a gym for its tenants. Pinnacle Point, an office park in neighboring Rogers, has a popular market that carries sushi, paella and artisan bread.
 Since 1990, the population in this metropolitan area, which extends from Rogers south to Fayetteville, has mushroomed from about 211,000 people to more than 330,000, much of it fueled by Wal-Mart's eagerness to have its suppliers close at hand. Although grazing cows and poultry houses remain a common sight along the two-lane roads and also Interstate 540, the major north-south artery, the rural landscape is now punctuated by office buildings.
 With a median annual family income of about $44,000 and fewer than 3,000 families earning over $150,000 a year, this is far from a wealthy region. But Rogers now boasts two gated communities with golf courses and some million-dollar homes. The Milken Institute, a nonprofit research organization, recently named Fayetteville the nation's top-performing metropolitan area based on job, wage and technology growth. 
 Jeff Collins, the director of the University of Arkansas Center for Business and Economic Research, projects that the region's population will double by 2025. In addition to Wal-Mart, several other major corporations are based in the area, including Tyson Foods, the world's largest meat producer, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, the giant trucking company.
 Procter & Gamble, Wal-Mart's largest supplier, has had offices in Fayetteville, where the University of Arkansas is situated, since the 1980's. But much of the recent growth has been about 30 miles to the north, especially in Bentonville and Rogers, where the streets are lined with hundreds of low-slung buildings, many of them developed by home builders in the mid-1990's, with brand-name tenants like Hallmark, Hershey and Coors. Typically, these corporate offices are equipped with retail displays so that Wal-Mart buyers can see how new products will look on store shelves.
 Of the area's 2.1 million square feet of higher-grade office space, 365,000 has been completed since the beginning of last year, according to David Erstine, a market researcher for Reed & Associates, an appraisal company. The new space actually represents a higher proportion of the Class A space, the most modern and best-equipped offices, Mr. Erstine said, because his company plans to downgrade many of the older buildings.
 Aside from Bentonville Plaza, a joint venture between Pitcairn Properties of Philadelphia and FBE Ltd. of New York, which is expected to be completed in July, most of the new office space lies along I-540 in Rogers. It includes Pinnacle Point, two five-story buildings with a total of 50,000 square feet each and 50,000 square feet of retail; Barrington Center, two four-story buildings with 65,000 square feet each, developed by a local company, Cooper Realty Investments; and the six-story J.B. Hunt Parkway Towers, with 100,000 square feet. 
 Pinnacle Point and Parkway Towers are owned by the Pinnacle Group, a partnership led by Mr. Hunt, the trucking company's 77-year-old founder, who has an 8,000-square-foot apartment in the building.
 As many hotels across the country struggle with vacancies, a 245-room Embassy Suites Hotel that opened near the Parkway Towers in May was fully occupied one night in the middle of this month. The hotel's developer, John Q. Hammons of Springfield, Mo., has announced plans for a 100,000-square-foot convention center and a 250-room Marriott hotel.
 Opened just three years ago with only a 12-screen movie theater, the Scottsdale Center in Rogers now has two dozen restaurants and stores, including big-box retailers like Barnes & Noble, Kohls and Lowes.
 And much more development is planned. In 2005, Wal-Mart expects to open a 203,000- square-foot superstore in Rogers, its third in Benton County. The store will be part of Pleasant Crossing, a mixed-use project that a local developer, Charles Reaves, expects to build eventually on 343 acres of land east of I-540.
 Mr. Hunt's Pinnacle Group, which also manages the offices and retail space at Pinnacle Point, recently unveiled plans to build two additional 16-story office and condominium towers with 325,000 square feet each near Parkway Towers and a 500,000-square-foot outdoor shopping center that would be similar to those in affluent suburbs. 
 One of Mr. Hunt's partners, Bill W. Schwyhart said that many retailers still thought of the area as a Southern backwater. "Arkansas is not on anybody's radar screen," he said. "We have to show them that this is where they need to be."
 One selling point, according to John J. Schupp, a senior vice president of the real estate services company Jones Lang LaSalle, which has been advising the Pinnacle Group, is that Arkansas is underserved in retailing, with only 11 square feet per capita, compared with a national average of 21. Northwest Mall in Fayetteville is the area's only regional shopping center.
 Local real estate specialists agreed that additional retailing space would be welcome. At the same time, some say that the office market may already be overbuilt. Dewitt H. Smith, the president of Cooper Realty Investments, said that two years after his 130,000-square-foot Barrington Center project opened, about 25,000 square feet remained vacant. "We've been aggressively pursuing deals, but the market is just soft," he said. "The scale of overbuilding in relation to the size of our market seems to me to be excessive." 
 Two floors with 30,000 square feet remain vacant at the J.B. Hunt Parkway Towers. As of June, the Class A office vacancy rate in Rogers was nearly 18 percent, according to the semiannual report by Reed, the appraisal company.
 Raising another issue, Ramsay Ball, the co-owner of Lane Real Estate Services of Rogers, said the Wal-Mart suppliers that he represented wanted their offices to fit in with Wal-Mart's thrifty image. "The direction of the market is functional single-story space," Mr. Ball said. "Most vendors I've talked to are worried about taking glitzy space."
 But Mr. Schwyhart said that most companies realized that they needed to upgrade their offices to attract employees from other states. "You've got to give them a good environment to work out of, comparable to the environment they had," he said.
 Mr. Hunt, a sharecropper's son who started his company in 1969 with five trucks and seven trailers, said he was prepared to use his own money to get the office buildings and some of the retail projects started. 
 "Around here," he said, "things are going so fast that if you don't bring the check today, someone else will, and you'll be out in the cold."

 The Nasdaq composite notched its best gain in nearly four months, while the Standard & Poor's 500 had its strongest advance in a month. 
 The Fed's inaction was expected, but investors were pleased that policy makers indicated rates would probably remain at current low levels for some time. The news was particularly welcome after a strong consumer confidence report earlier in the day. 
 "The Fed statement appeased pretty much everyone," said Keith Keenan, vice president for institutional trading at Wall Street Access, a New York-based brokerage firm. "They hit all the right notes."
 The Dow closed up 140.15 points, or 1.5 percent, at 9,748.31, having gained 25.70 points the previous session. It was the best one-day point gain since Oct. 1, when the blue-chip average rose 194.14 points.
 The broader market also moved sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 49.35 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,932.26. It was the biggest gain since July 7, when the technology-focused index rose 57.25 points.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.66 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,046.79. It was the best advance since Oct. 1, when the index gained 22.25 points.
 Stocks already were trading higher before the Fed decision on an upbeat economic report. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 81.1 this month from 77 in September. The group said consumers were encouraged by signs of a stronger job market.
 The Commerce Department said new orders for big-ticket goods rose 0.8 percent in September after a 0.1 percent decline in the previous month. September's reading was slightly lower than forecasts; however, the August number was revised upward yesterday from the 1.1 percent drop initially reported.
 Analysts cautioned, though, that the market's advance would probably be limited in the weeks ahead. With the earnings season drawing to an end, Wall Street will need another catalyst to inspire more strong buying.
 "It's going to take a lot to move from here," said John Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments. "But a break from the big move is a healthy thing for the market. I'm not opposed to listlessness or some pullback given the sprint we've been in."
 Twenty-nine of the 30 stocks comprising the Dow Jones industrial average finished higher, led by Home Depot, which climbed $1.50, to $37.50. Boeing finished unchanged.
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco jumped $5.72, to $48.97, after it agreed to buy the Brown & Williamson Tobacco unit of British American Tobacco in a $2.6 billion deal.
 Lockheed Martin fell 78 cents, to $45.51, after it reported a drop in third-quarter profit that nevertheless came in higher than Wall Street's expectations.
 Verizon Communications fell 15 cents, to $33.08, after reporting third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates by a penny a share.
 Advancing issues were ahead of decliners 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy.
 Bond prices rose after the Fed said it would leave rates unchanged. By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note gained 20/32, to 100 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 4.19 percent from 4.26 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Fed Statement on Economy 

 BODY:
The statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday is nearly identical to its statements after monetary policy meetings in September and August. The only difference is its description of the labor market, which was "weakening" in September and appeared "mixed" in August, but now "appears to be stabilizing." 
Following is the text of yesterday's statement:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. 
 The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Artist's Journey From Billboards to Supersize Art

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
WE are looking at the big picture here.
 Humongous, really. 
 "The Swimmer in the Econo-mist," a high point of the James Rosenquist retrospective now at the Guggenheim Museum, is really three panels filling a huge gallery. It has melting lipstick, a reference to Picasso's "Guernica," a hair dryer like a helmet, broken industrial drill bits and a sunrise in the red, yellow and black of the German flag for the museum's Berlin branch. 
It "poignantly registers social and political concerns while reflecting on the dynamics of modern capitalist culture," according to the museum guide.
Just how big is this thing?
"Ninety feet by eleven and a half," said the artist with evident satisfaction, describing the main panel, and adding that the other two panels are 40 by 11 1/2 and 20 by 11 1/2.
Try hanging that over your mantelpiece.
But then scale has always been a hallmark of Mr. Rosenquist's work. After all, before becoming one of the icons of the Pop Art movement in the 1960's, he honed his skills painting gigantic movie billboards above Times Square and a Hebrew National sign in Brooklyn.
Mr. Rosenquist was born in November 1933 in Grand Forks, N.D. His parents moved about the Midwest, ending up in Minneapolis. He attended the University of Minnesota for about three years and worked as a sign painter, painting oil-company emblems on three-story gas tanks and Davy Crockett coonskin hats eight feet wide.
In 1955, he arrived in New York with $350 in his pocket and a one-year scholarship to the Art Students League. He gravitated immediately to the Cedar Tavern in the Village, the gathering place for painters and poets.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah; I just heard that was the place to go," he recalled fondly. "There was Bill de Kooning, Franz Kline. The Cedar bar was a nondescript bar with Audubon prints on the walls, a neighborhood bar.
"We also had a Friday night club where we would pay 50 cents to listen to people who were big underground heroes at the time, but could only get about a thousand bucks for their biggest and best works. The first one I stumbled into was a memorial for Jackson Pollock. It was incredible."
He joined the Amalgamated Sign and Pictoral Painters Union of America, Local 230, and worked mostly for the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which painted some of the largest billboards in the world.
"Much of the aesthetic of my work comes from doing commercial art," Mr. Rosenquist said. "I painted pieces of bread, Arrow shirts, movie stars. It was very interesting. Before I came to New York I wanted to paint the Sistine Chapel. I thought this is where the school of mural painting exists. You were painting things up close, like big chocolate cakes. In Brooklyn, I painted Schenley whiskey bottles two stories high, 147 of them over every candy store." 
By 1960, spurred partly by the deaths of two colleagues who fell from signs for S. Klein and Budweiser, he rented a loft at 5 Coenties Slip, way downtown, where his neighbors included Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns. There, he began working out a style breaking with the Abstract Expressionism then in vogue.
"I wanted to make a mysterious painting," he said, sitting in a loft building on Chambers Street he bought in 1977 for $120,000, where some of his works, like "The Worker Ant Inherits the Asteroid," are on display. (Loft living, he noted, was once illegal, "but the bottom line is artists find nice places to live, and real estate follows and chases the artists out.")
"All previous painting was like looking out a huge window. It didn't come forward and knock you in the nose," he said, describing a method in which various images -- many clipped from magazine advertisements and stapled into preliminary collages -- were juxtaposed in a deliberately disorienting manner.
The work that brought him fame, "F-111," is on display at the retrospective. Not much larger than an average Manhattan apartment, it wraps around four walls, forming essentially a room lined with images of an F-111 bomber then being developed for the Vietnam War, a child topped with a hair-dryer, a Firestone tire and canned spaghetti, a Rosenquist standby. Hailed in some quarters as a powerful antiwar statement, it was panned in 1968 by John Canaday in The New York Times as "fustian," which is pretty nasty.
"I began to think of the military-industrial complex, which promised people life in the suburbs, with a home and two and a half children and two and a half cars. And these weapons, what a waste," he recalled. Protesting the war, he was arrested with Dr. Benjamin Spock (who cautioned him to keep his arms close to his body so he couldn't be kicked in the ribs) and other notables. He found himself in the cell next to the sculptor Robert Morris. They also shared a dealer, Leo Castelli.
THESE days, Mr. Rosenquist spends much of his time in Florida, where he has built two studios "like airplane hangers." He also keeps a house in Bedford, N.Y., with his second wife and teenage daughter. His son, John, from his first marriage, lives in the Chambers Street loft, where much of the work for the retrospective was assembled.
"We lived like kings in New York in those days on very little money," Mr. Rosenquist said. "The younger artists today think they have to turn their fine art into cash to pay the rent. Now what happens is they show too early and the critics say they stink and they think they stink.
"I was working once on top of the Latin Quarter, painting a 'Join the Navy' sign, a Wave with two sailors. An ensign calls me down and pulls out a little black and white coin-booth picture and says, 'Make her the Wave. She just won a Miss Wave contest on Staten Island.' Her head was 15 feet high. I made her beautiful; I hope it looked like her. That kind of experience is just not available today."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Democrats Campaign Without Mentioning McGreevey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: BORDENTOWN, N.J. Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Listening to many of the Democrats campaigning for New Jersey's Legislature this fall, it would be easy to get the impression that the state is now governed by a governor with no name.
 The current officeholder, a Democrat named James E. McGreevey, has been battling to improve his dismal approval ratings in many polls, and Republicans have tried to capitalize on his troubles by branding Democratic legislative candidates as "the McGreevey Yes Team." 
 Mr. McGreevey has appeared with Democratic contenders in a few districts to promote his most popular programs, but has spent much of the past month a safe distance from Democratic candidates in closely contested districts. 
In South Jersey, Democratic candidates have run ads distancing themselves from Mr. McGreevey's budget and tax proposals, while others mention the varied accomplishments of "the governor," without actually stating who he is.
During a news conference this week in the State House, the Democratic state chairwoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, attacked Republicans for opposing the governor's plan to close the budget gap by raising taxes on corporations. When a reporter asked why she hadn't mentioned Mr. McGreevey's name, she gave an artful reply.
"I stand by our governor," she said. "And I think that once members of the public understand the governor's record, they will appreciate what a great job the governor has done." Her response continued, mentioning the word governor two additional times, but omitting the words Jim and McGreevey.
The jousting over the governor's record has been one of the most intriguing aspects of a legislative campaign that has been both bitter and expensive. The stakes are exceedingly high -- the State Senate is divided 20 to 20, and Democrats hold a 41-to-38 edge in the General Assembly, so Republicans have used a time-tested strategy of trying to make the race a referendum on an unpopular incumbent.
That turnaround is remarkable considering that just two years ago Mr. McGreevey's comfortable victory in the governor's race also helped Democrats win control of the General Assembly and regain parity in the State Senate.
Yet during the final week of this fall's campaign, Republicans will conduct a "Stop Jim McGreevey" bus tour through South Jersey, where Mr. McGreevey's polls numbers are weakest. Larry Weitzner, a Republican strategist, said the party hoped to tap into the general sense of discontent about state government by reminding voters of the property tax increases they have faced since he took office.
"We're trying to treat him like New Jersey's Gray Davis," Mr. Weitzner said. "We want voters who are upset to come to the conclusion that a vote for Republican legislators is a vote for change."
But political analysts say it is unclear whether that strategy will sway voters, because Mr. McGreevey's low approval ratings seem to be based on a variety of missteps rather than any one overwhelmingly unpopular policy.
"Here's this guy who's so unpopular but for reasons no one quite understands," said Peter J. Woolley, executive director of the Public Mind Poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University. "So Republicans can link voters to McGreevey, but it will be interesting to see exactly which of their complaints about McGreevey they are willing to blame on legislative candidates."
Mr. McGreevey remains convinced that his approval ratings will rebound when the economy does, and aides say he decided over the summer not to let the Republican onslaught go unchallenged. So he has kept a relatively high profile this fall, helping to raise millions for Democratic candidates and reminding voters of his stances on populist issues like the fight to control suburban sprawl and to preserve open space.
He has also made a limited number of public appearances with Democratic legislative candidates.
In North Jersey, where his approval ratings are better than in other parts of the state, Mr. McGreevey appeared recently with Democratic Senator Joseph Coniglio of Bergen County to announce that the state would pay for a study on noise pollution near Teterboro Airport.
"We were happy to have him," said Julie Roginsky, a Democratic consultant to Senator Coniglio. "When legislators appealed to him on an issue important to the district, he responded immediately and he delivered."
But that kind of warm welcome has hardly been commonplace this fall.
When his face appears in campaign ads, it is almost always in Republican mailers or television ads, some of which feature Mr. McGreevey as a cartoon character taking junkets at taxpayer expense.
In Gloucester County, Democratic Senator Stephen M. Sweeney has run a television ad boasting that he fought against Mr. McGreevey's tax plans.
In most tight races, however, Democrats have sought to have it both ways -- reminding voters that the party in power can deliver the political spoils, but politely distancing themselves from Mr. McGreevey's negative associations.
So last week, when the governor stopped at a diner in Bordentown to announce that his auto insurance initiatives had led one company to reduce rates by 5 percent -- the type of positive news most candidates would love to be associated with -- he did so alone.
No legislative candidates were invited, none asked to attend, and Mr. McGreevey did not appear to miss the glare of the campaign spotlight.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Syracuse: Carrier Rejects Jobs Plan 

BYLINE:  By Lydia Polgreen (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
 The Carrier Corporation yesterday rejected a $210 million package of state, federal and union assistance intended to keep Carrier from moving 1,200 manufacturing jobs out of the state and overseas. 
The package included wage cuts and other savings offered by one of its unions. Carrier officials said the aid package did not deal with the company's economic realities. On Oct. 6, Carrier said it would close the two plants at its East Syracuse site and move them to Georgia, Singapore and China. About 1,600 Carrier jobs remain in the area. Lydia Polgreen (NYT)

A Bright Addition to the Curry Hill Buffet

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
I HAVE never cared much for the custom in Indian restaurants of serving a buffet at lunch. 
 It is cheap, yes, but after the food has been sitting in a warming pan for a couple of hours, the flavor and life are usually all wrung out. So I was disappointed to find a buffet at Chennai Garden, a kosher vegetarian Indian restaurant that opened about a year ago on East 27th Street. 
 I could have ordered off the regular menu, but the room was crowded and everybody else was lining up at the all-you-can-eat buffet, so I joined them. Not too long after, I got in line again, and again after that. The selection was small, but the food was fresh and lively, and at $5.95, it was definitely cheap. 
The buffet included yellow rice dotted with tiny black mustard seeds, with a few slender chili peppers thrown in. It was a delicious complement to a mellow, creamy dal, made with yellow and green lentils and flavored subtly with ginger and garlic and cumin, which softened the light spice of the chili and the light pungence of the mustard seeds. The rice went well, too, with an equally creamy spinach curry. The paratha bread was light-bodied, yet substantial, and the chutneys were cooling and spicy, sweet and sour, just as they ought to be.
Later I found out that Chennai Garden was owned by Pradeep Shinde and Eugene Constance, who used to own Madras Mahal, one of the early Indian restaurants in New York City to be certified as kosher. They closed Madras a few years ago and moved to Miami Beach, but when the tourist economy slowed after 9/11, they returned to New York and opened Chennai Garden, a bright, boxy restaurant done in bold colors. Niches along one wall hold traditional Indian dolls, while another wall has pastel portraits of young Indian women.
With fond memories of the lunch buffet at Chennai Garden, I went back for dinner. By night, the menu emphasizes South Indian specialties, like dosas, huge crepes rolled into cylinders around fillings like potatoes mashed with onions, and utthappam, smaller pancakes studded with onions and topped with vegetable mixtures. It also offers vegetarian specialties from Gujarat, on the western end of India's midsection, and the Punjab, to the north.
South Indian snacks, like idli, steamed cakes of rice and lentil flour ($3.45), and medu vadai ($3.45), crisp rice and lentil doughnuts, are excellent, either dipped into mild coconut chutney or a spicy lentil broth. Bhel poori ($3.95), a pan-India street food, is superb, a mix of puffed rice, onions, tomato and crisp little Chinese noodles with lots of cilantro; it is tangy, sweet, cooland lightly spicy all at the same time.
Both chana chat ($3.95), a chickpea snack with onions and cilantro, and its potato counterpart, alu chat ($3.95), have the bracing, cooling quality that comes only from black salt, which is actually pink and does not taste salty but has an unusual mineral flavor.
Chennai Garden offers several kinds of dosas. The default selection seems to be the paper dosas, impossibly thin, crisp and delicate and just right with the traditional potato-onion mixture ($6.95). Unusual variations include the mysore sada dosas ($5.95), stained almost red with peppers and very spicy, and the rava dosas ($7.45), a more pliable crepe made with wheat and rice flour and cilantro. Utthappam ($5.95) are less successful, doughy rather than light.
I had mixed reactions to two Gujarati curries. Whole moong ($8.95), or green lentils, was extremely bland. On first bite I feared the same problem with kala chana ($8.95), a blend of black chickpeas and onions, but kept eating. Slowly, in my mouth, a subtle transformation took place, as the flavors began to extend and spread. Encouraged, I became aware of how beautifully aromatic the dish was, smelling of toasted spices and curry leaves, but quietly, not in a big or crude way. 
This was a sensation I would never expect at a lunch buffet. As pleasing as those dishes were, at most restaurants the gorgeous complexities of Indian cooking come out only after dark.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE OUTLOOK; 
Bush's Urgent Task: To Calm Public's Growing Impatience

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Early on Tuesday morning, as many Americans were scanning newspaper headlines about the latest wave of deadly bombings in Iraq, President Bush met with his press secretary and his communications director in the Oval Office. He told them, aides said, that he wanted to hold a full-scale news conference a few hours later.
 The idea had been under consideration for several weeks, but it was only after the attacks in Baghdad on Monday that Mr. Bush decided to take his message directly to the voters and the world. 
 For weeks, while opinion polls showed diminished support for his postwar leadership, he had accused the press of filtering out good news from Iraq and overplaying the bad.
The decision reflects how urgent it is for the White House to keep public opinion about Iraq from deteriorating to the point that it could limit the president's policy choices and threaten his chances for re-election.
With Election Day just over a year away, Mr. Bush will come under increasing pressure to start showing results in Iraq and bringing troops home. But, faced with an evolving threat that will require military flexibility, he also may be counting on an electorate patient enough to deal with what Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld now calls a "long, hard slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The president will be called on to show results for the $87 billion that Congress is close to granting him for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As long as Iraq remains Topic A, Mr. Bush may have to struggle to focus public attention on an issue that might otherwise dominate the political landscape: the rapidly improving economy, a subject on which he got not a single question at the news conference. 
And despite his efforts to remain above the partisan fray, he will inevitably have to begin responding to the increasingly unified Democratic attacks on his handling of postwar Iraq.
White House officials said Mr. Bush was not just speaking to voters at home. They said he was also addressing Iraqis who might wonder about the American commitment to ensuring them a chance for a peaceful future, and governments weighing whether it was worthwhile to support the United States in Iraq with money and military forces.
"At these moments of testing, where the terrorists try to create chaos and fear, where they want America to blink, it's very important for the American public and the Iraqi people to hear that we are resolved to see this through," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director.
"He was more inclined to do it after the events of the last 48 hours," Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bush's decision after the bombings to call a news conference. "When there are significant events like this, both good and bad, tough days as well as good days, it's important, it's the role of the president, to put it into context."
Mr. Bush, who returned on Friday from a grueling weeklong trip through Asia, seemed tired throughout the 48-minute question and answer session in the Rose Garden, and his responses often sounded more dutiful than passionate. He stumbled over his lines at times, and his usual good-natured jousting with reporters occasionally turned snippy.
Despite his longstanding attempts to cast his foreign policy as conducted without regard to polls or domestic politics, he was drawn into rare comments about the electoral implications of a drawn-out conflict in Iraq. 
Mr. Bush said he expected the American people to be patient because they were "able to differentiate between politics and reality," suggesting that he would cast criticism of his leadership as partisan and unfounded.
On Monday, Mr. Bush suggested that the latest violence in Iraq was a sign of progress, saying that "the more successful we are on the ground, the more these killers will react." 
That formulation left even some Republicans wincing, and he recalibrated it on Tuesday, saying terrorists "are targeting the very success and freedom we're providing to the Iraqi people."
But the president made it clear that he saw his strategy as slowly but surely proving successful, and said he was looking forward to defending it "right in the mix" of election-year politics.
"I'll say that the world is more peaceful and more free under my leadership, and America is more secure," Mr. Bush said, describing how he will run on his record. "That will be how I'll begin describing our foreign policy."
Democrats scoffed.
"This president appears to lack the leadership skills required to do what is necessary to successfully stabilize and reconstruct Iraq before the window of opportunity closes," Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement. 
"Instead," Mr. Dean said, "President Bush seems content to pursue the current flawed plan, unwilling to do what is necessary to encourage our friends and allies to assist, incapable of taking the steps necessary to expedite the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, and content to direct billions of dollars to special interests like Halliburton."
White House officials said Mr. Bush's slide in the polls appeared to have stabilized, although no survey results have yet been made public that would gauge American opinion since the most recent spate of attacks in Baghdad.
Mr. Bartlett said the White House was comfortable with the state of public opinion about Iraq "considering the climate we're in."
The question, now, is whether Mr. Bush can improve the climate.

HEADLINE: The Pollyanna Conspiracy 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A giggling gaggle of cockeyed economic optimists who operate under cover as "the Pollyanna Conspiracy" are threatening to seize control of American public opinion.
 The first sign of P.C.'s nefarious plot came two weeks ago, when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was forced to downwardly depart from its ever-higher projections of deficits. It dropped the $401 billion red-ink estimate for the fiscal year ending last month down to $374 billion. The White House Budget Office agreed, reducing its estimate of the 2003 deficit from $455 to $380 billion. 
 Horrified at the healthy trend, the Schopenhauer Left came up with excuses for the failure of the deficit to keep deepening: corporate tax revenue may have come in early, federal spending was slopping over to next year, and don't forget next year's expense of Iraq. But the fact ignored by most eye-can-seers was that the deficit trend was decelerating.
Yesterday, the Pollyanna Conspiracy noted with muffled glee that the Fed -- with nearly rock-bottom interest rates stimulating the economy -- did nothing to raise rates.
Why do the conspirators treat this hyperactive inaction by Greenspan & Co. as such good news? Because the Fed knows in advance what Thursday's announcement of the increase in gross domestic product will be. The conspirators guess that the figure for the rate of America's economic growth will be a whopper: it is likely to be over 6 percent for the quarter, which is double the good growth in the previous quarter. The jump would stand in sharp contrast with the three quarters of post-bubble decline in 2001 inherited from Bill Clinton. 
So how come the Fed did not slam on the brakes this week, raising interest rates to slow the expected surge in growth that usually leads to inflation?
Aha! say the Pollyanna Conspirators: the reason the Fed can safely continue to stimulate is in another figure -- the powerful growth of output per worker, the productivity that subtracts from inflation and protects those, like the elderly, who live on fixed incomes and savings. 
Years ago, the gloomy Schopenhauer Left came up with the famed "misery index" -- the rate of inflation plus the rate of unemployment -- which now adds up to 8.4 percent, neither good nor bad. It was not so much an economic measurement as an indicator of the political impact of the state of the economy. 
To provide the cheery Pollyanna crowd with a newsworthy benchmark, I have invented the "ecstasy index." That's the quarterly rate of economic growth added to the same quarter's rate of increase in productivity.
As we shall see tomorrow, the ecstasy index is soaring over 12 percent. Such a peak of prosperity is impossible to enjoy for any length of time, as even Eleanor Hodgman Porter, author of the 1913 children's book about the happy little girl who played the "glad game," would have to concede.
But what about the Schopies' mantra, "Bush has caused a loss of three million jobs, a greater loss than any president since Hoover"? Are the incipient good times to be a "jobless recovery," with companies getting leaner and meaner, needing fewer workers, and outsourcing future labor needs to China and India?
We conspirators -- I admit to membership in the confidence cabal -- along with Saddam-hunters and Cubs fans say, "Wait'll next year." Come 2004, with economic growth steadying near a brisk 4 percent -- and, sustained by the low interest rates justified by productivity's suppression of inflation -- the current 6.1 percent unemployment rate should begin to trend downward. And it is the trend, more than the level, that makes news and affects elections.
That's why the conspiracy's Pollyanna-in-chief could say in his news conference yesterday to a press corps that had not a single question about the economy: "America is starting to add new jobs, retail sales are strong, business profits are increasing, the stock market has been advancing, housing construction is surging, and manufacturing production is rising." 
Mr. Bush proposes to spend more on defense and Medicare while resisting Democratic attempts to raise taxes. As the noninflationary recovery proceeds, the Fed will be able to hang loose in its stimulative mode. Tax revenues from increased profits should shrink the deficit and bring about budget balance in our time.
Join the Pollyanna Conspiracy. To self-fulfill its prophecy, bring along my old friend, Rosy Scenario.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Office Seeks More Retail Space at Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
After many months of playing a backstage role in planning the new World Trade Center, the Bloomberg administration stepped forward yesterday and declared that the master plan would have to include far more streetfront retail space and one more full-fledged street than it now calls for.
 "The site must have a retail district that will be a regional destination while being respectful of the memorial," Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said in a letter to state officials that was released by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's press office. "In that district, people will find an exciting on-the-street shopping experience and unique anchor stores that do not exist elsewhere -- prompting them to spend time throughout Lower Manhattan." 
 City Hall wants almost two-thirds more ground-level retail space -- nearly 187,000 square feet -- than is now shown in the plan, Mr. Doctoroff wrote. It wants Cortlandt Street restored as a thoroughfare between Church and Greenwich Streets, which would require the elimination of a concourse planned between Liberty Street and the future PATH terminal, parallel to Church Street. 
Tomorrow, Gov. George E. Pataki is to give a speech on the future of Lower Manhattan. So the timing of the release of an Oct. 17 letter from Mr. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, seemed intended as a reassertion of the city's role in planning the site.
But Mr. Doctoroff said in a telephone interview that the timing was coincidental. The point of the letter, he said, was to "crystallize in written form where we think we have to go from here."
"The key thing that hasn't been addressed in detail -- and it needs to be -- is how this plan integrates with the rest of Lower Manhattan," Mr. Doctoroff said. "It's time to begin calling the question and reaching final conclusions about the issue of how people experience the plan on the streets."
The 16-point letter was sent to Joseph J. Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. A copy went to Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is planning the site with the Port Authority.
On Sept. 17, the authority and the development corporation presented a "refined" version of the plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind, which they had adopted in broad outline in February.
It divides the old trade center superblock into four unequal quadrants along Greenwich and Fulton Streets. The memorial would occupy much of the southwest quarter, where the twin towers stood. The tallest new building, the Freedom Tower, would be in the northwest quarter. More office towers and a new PATH terminal would run along Church Street, on the eastern half of the site.
None of the points raised by Mr. Doctoroff were rejected out of hand yesterday by state officials, though it is not clear if the city's conditions, taken together, would yield a substantively different plan.
"The letter raises some important points and the Port Authority looks forward to continuing our positive discussions with the city," said Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the authority.
Andrew Winters, the vice president of the development corporation and its director of planning, design and development, said: "The refined plan did not stop evolving on the day we released it. We're going to continue to strive to improve it every day throughout the process."
Even as the master plan is changing, so is the design of the Freedom Tower. An impasse last week between Mr. Libeskind and David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architects for the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, threatened to disrupt what will be a very tight construction schedule.
At a meeting with both architects yesterday, Mr. Silverstein underscored the urgency of arriving at a collaborative -- and practical -- design for the tower, one that would hew to a number of principles laid out by Mr. Libeskind, according to an executive who attended.
The developer extracted from both architects a renewed commitment to work in partnership on the project.
Mr. Doctoroff said little in his letter about the proposed 1,776-foot tower. Instead, he addressed the future of streets, sidewalks, shopping and public spaces. He proposed third-floor "sky lobbies" in the office towers along Church Street, to free up large blocks of space for retailers.
He commended the decision to expand the development site to include two blocks on the south side of Liberty Street, but he urged state officials to work with the city in devising a strategy for acquiring those properties soon.
Acknowledging that the plan will take years to build, he wrote: "The first phase must leave no voids on any of the site's parcels. There should be contiguous retail along the street walls of the site and these should accommodate a later phase when commercial towers can be built."
He also said that "no plan can be approved without detailed estimates of how much it will cost, who will pay for its components, and when each component will be built."
Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of the Lower Manhattan community board, said, "The Port Authority should not just consult with the city, but be open to suggestions about how it's going to affect life outside the 16-plus acres."

HEADLINE: After Blackout, a Call for a 911 Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration released a report yesterday recommending an overhaul of the 911 emergency phone system to strengthen its technology and streamline the way calls are handled.
 In the report, ordered by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to examine how the city operated and responded to the Aug. 14 power failure, officials noted that the 911 system failed in several ways. The high volume of calls overloaded the system at points, so some calls could not get through. Then backup generators at some Verizon offices did not work, city officials said, knocking out the Fire Department's and Emergency Medical Service's 911 dispatching three times for periods of between 7 and 14 minutes. 
 The task force that prepared the report made several recommendations to address the problems in the 911 system, and suggested that the city improve transportation, communications and other city functions.
The task force was made up of Bloomberg administration officials and experts from the private sector. They had been asked by the mayor to evaluate the city's performance during the blackout.
The move was unusual, from a political point of view. Mayor Bloomberg was widely praised after the blackout for the city's performance, and his poll ratings rose, with voters saying their assessment of him had improved because of the way he handled things during the crisis. Nonetheless, he ordered a warts-and-all review of what had worked and what had not, and made it public.
The 24-page report catalogs all kinds of failures, and highlights them in bold-faced type. They include: "lack of consistent and coordinated agency response plans," "lack of emergency dispatch efficiency," "communications problems" and "inadequate emergency supplies on hand."
"You've got to be careful not to be unwilling to show people exactly what happened," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at City Hall, where much more attention was paid to his appointment of Jennifer Lopez to a city commission than to the blackout study. "And hopefully they won't criticize, but they'll take it in the manner that the study was done: We did a great job, can we do better?"
Among the report's 35 recommendations are suggestions for the city to draft emergency evacuation plans to make some streets open only to pedestrians and others only to outbound vehicles; to build a private communications system in the event that public telephone and wireless systems fail; and to consider either alternative sources of power for traffic lights or deputizing civilians to help direct traffic.
But administration officials said that some of its most important recommendations involved the city's 911 system. In addition to calling on the city to strengthen the technology that powers the system, to make it less vulnerable to power failures, the report calls for making the system "more effective, efficient, and centralized." 
Right now people who call 911 are connected to police operators. If they are reporting crimes, the police operators take down the information and send officers. If they are reporting fires, the calls are transferred to fire dispatchers, who take down the information and send firefighters. If they report injuries, the police operators take down some information and transfer the calls to Emergency Medical Service dispatchers, who can assist callers with first aid advice until ambulances arrive.
The report suggests having one set of operators answer all kinds of emergency calls and dispatch whatever help is needed. It calls on the city to change the system so that callers will only have to "provide 911 with emergency information once" and in a way that "provides a seamless method of reporting on 911 incidents across the Police Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service."
It added that with new technology, the city could pinpoint the location of its emergency vehicles to help dispatchers figure out which unit to send to each call.
The report did not estimate how much its recommendations would cost, or how practical it would be to put them into effect.
"This is really sort of setting out a road map of things to look at in more depth," said Andrew Alper, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation and a co-chairman of the task force.
New York City has a history of trying to devise better backups for its 911 systems, and previous plans to integrate the calling centers have met with resistance from the various uniformed services involved. The mayor said yesterday that there would be "no turf battle" involved now, and that all agencies would cooperate.
But the recommendation met with opposition from some union leaders. "It's drastically flawed," said David Rosenzweig, the president of the Uniformed Fire Alarm Dispatchers Benevolent Association. "It doesn't take into consideration the tremendous risks of putting all three agencies into one facility, and the possibility that all of these services could collapse at once."
The report also published the results of a survey of city residents about the blackout; 3,730 wrote or sent e-mail responses to the mayor's request for their observations. The biggest problems people reported were the lack of communication (40 percent of respondents) followed by transportation (35 percent).
"I think that the city and the city administration performed -- superbly is not an overstatement -- during the blackout," the mayor said. "But that's not to say that you couldn't do better."

HEADLINE: After Long Delay, Senate Confirms Utah Governor as Head of E.P.A. 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah was confirmed on Tuesday as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and will take over next week at the agency, which is the scene of major environmental battles. 
 Mr. Leavitt, who was confirmed, 88 to 8, will contend with suits by states that challenge the Bush administration decision not to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and easing rules for coal-burning power plants. He also has to determine how to deal with mercury that coal-burning plants emit. The administration has said it wants to set draft regulations for those emissions by Dec. 15. Rules have to be in place by 2007. 
 Some agency watchers raised concerns about how Mr. Leavitt would handle occasionally tense relations with the White House. 
"The tests begin to become when he has a tough regulatory decision to make and the White House starts leaning on him to go one way or another," Russell E. Train, environmental administrator under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, said. "He is going to have to make a decision which will tell us how he will run the agency, whether he will maintain his independence of the White House or subject himself to the influence of the White House." 
"I accept this responsibility knowing that the president is committed to substantially more environmental progress and doing it in a way that does not compromise our place in the world competitively," Mr. Leavitt said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The confirmation vote ended a 56-day process that included a boycott by Democrats and partisan debate on the administration's environmental record. The three previous administrators won approval within two weeks of their nominations. 
The confirmation of Mr. Leavitt, a three-term governor with strong ties to many senators, headed for a quick ending this week after it became clear that the Republicans had enough votes to override the six Senate Democrats who had placed holds on his confirmation. Minutes before a critical vote on Monday night, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said she had reached an accord with the White House to re-examine the air quality of Lower Manhattan and would drop her opposition. 
"There was no way we were going to get the votes to stop the vote from occurring," Mrs. Clinton, who ultimately voted for Mr. Leavitt, said in an interview. "A lot of people know him. They are impressed with his getting things done. There were members of the Democratic Caucus who have personal longstanding relationships with him."
When asked in a briefing about Mrs. Clinton and the confirmation process, he said, "I've had no unhappy personal moments related to the confirmation."
In the debate, Democrats focused on the administration, with a handful attacking Mr. Leavitt's record in Utah. 
"This vote should not be seen as an endorsement of the Bush administration environmental policy, but a vote in support of a fine and honorable man who has an extremely difficult job ahead," said Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, placed a hold on Mr. Leavitt because of his record in Utah. Mr. Lautenberg criticized Mr. Leavitt for placing "economic gain of regulated industries above protecting the long-term health of the public." 
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, criticized enforcement on clean water and toxic dumping in Utah. 
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Leavitt and said environmental activists were misleading the Democrats. 
"I might as well point out that Utah is also in complete compliance with E.P.A.'s air quality standard," Mr. Hatch said. "This is rare among states, and it wasn't the case when Governor Leavitt took office."
Of the six senators who placed holds, three are Democratic presidential hopefuls who not only did not speak in the debate, but were also absent from the vote. They were John Edwards of North Carolina, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, also was absent. 
Along with Mr. Lautenberg, the others opposing the confirmation were Barbara Boxer of California, Jon Corzine of New Jersey, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, Mr. Durbin, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Charles E. Schumer of New York.

HEADLINE: China Is Told Again to Open Markets 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
China's relatively unfettered access to markets in the United States may be jeopardized if it fails to move more swiftly to open its markets to American goods and services, United States Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans warned on Tuesday.
 Speaking in Beijing during a six-day visit to China, Mr. Evans used unusually pointed language to chide China for failing to live up to its World Trade Organization commitments to open its markets, and he warned that China's exports might be threatened by hardening protectionist sentiment in the United States. 
 "China is moving far too slowly in its transition to an open, market-based economy," Mr. Evans told an audience of American businesspeople in Beijing. "Time is running out. We need to see results." 
 Mr. Evans is the latest in a stream of senior Bush administration officials to urge China to give the United States greater access to its markets and ease the growing trade imbalance between the two countries.
 But his comments were markedly more blunt and more expansive than previous administration remarks. They come at a time when China's trade policies are the target of intensifying criticism in the United States, with manufacturing groups and members of Congress accusing China of unfairly holding down the value of its currency and dumping goods on American markets.
 "We have been patient, but our patience is wearing thin," Mr. Evans said on Tuesday. "The American market will not remain open to Chinese exports indefinitely, if the Chinese market is not equally opened to U.S. companies and American workers."
 China's failure to enforce copyright protection for films, software and domestic goods was a focus of Mr. Evans' remarks. During his morning speech and in an afternoon meeting with the premier, Wen Jiabao, Mr. Evans brandished a bootleg copy of "Kill Bill, Volume 1" a film that recently opened in movie theaters in the United States but is already available in Beijing in bootleg digital copies selling for $1 apiece.
 Mr. Evans said the Chinese government must use criminal punishments, not just fines, to crack down on pirate manufacturers."Enforcement so far is not working," he said.
 He also called for American companies to be given expanded powers to establish sales and distribution networks in China, and for foreign businesses to be given transparent and equal treatment under business regulations. And he echoed previous calls by President Bush and Treasury Secretary John W. Snow for China to revalue its currency to make Chinese imports more expensive in the United States, and American imports to China cheaper.
 His complaints about China's observance of copyright rules and market openness are shared by many American businesses in China. In its last month's report on American business in China, the American Chamber of Commerce for mainland China said the Chinese government's commitment to enforcing many W.T.O. rules had flagged.
 "In an unacceptably high number of instances, the government has failed to take the specific, timely and concrete steps needed to open markets to competition," the report said.
 The chairman of the chamber, Christian Murck, said in an interview that many members were less optimistic about China's progress than they were a year ago. He cited impediments to American businesses establishing trade and distribution networks in China, and widespread flouting of copyright laws.
 "When it comes to intellectual property right protection," Mr. Evans said, "all observers would say they are not there."
 During a visit to Beijing last week Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, also said he was disappointed at the lack of progress in protecting copyrights.
 Unlike other American economic officials who have recently met with Chinese officials, Mr. Evans expanded his criticisms to cover several potentially sensitive domestic Chinese reforms.
 "It's our impression that the momentum of reform has slowed down," he said, adding that the grudging progress was stoking protectionism in the United States.
 In particular, he said the flow of loans from Chinese government-run banks to support otherwise insolvent government-owned businesses amounted to a trade subsidy that harmed American business. 
 In August, the United States trade deficit with China reached a monthly record of $11.7 billion, and last week several members of Congress, including Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois and chairman of the House committee on international relations, said China's trade and currency policies might threaten China's access to American markets.
 The United States government may take action against China under the W.T.O. rules, Mr. Evans said, and the Commerce Department would also establish a task force to attack unfair trade practices by China and other countries.
 Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Institute for International Economics, said the increasingly loud criticisms of China's trade policies from American government officials indicated that Chinese-American trade ties were entering a risky period.
 "They're treading a very fine line," he said in a phone interview. "On the one hand, they want to appear to be tough to push forward the Chinese government and hold back Congress; but on the other hand, they want to avoid protectionism."

HEADLINE: Optimistic on Jobs, Fed Keeps Interest Low 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, and suggested that it would continue to do so until at least sometime next year.
 In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed was optimistic for the first time this year about job creation and employment, saying, "The labor market appears to be stabilizing." 
 But the Fed did not mention that economic growth appears to have accelerated to a blistering annual pace of 6 percent in recent months, or refer to a raft of data showing that business spending and investor confidence has climbed sharply.
 Instead, it reiterated its view of the last several months that there is more risk that inflation will be too low rather than too high, and it repeated its intention to continue its policy of rock-bottom interest rates for "a considerable period." 
 That was a signal that the Fed is not ready even to warn about rate increases and even less ready to raise rates.
 Though not entirely unexpected, the statement helped push up a stock market that was already climbing in anticipation of more giant mergers like the one announced on Monday between FleetBoston Financial and Bank of America.
 Some economists warned that the Fed is waiting too long to prepare financial markets for a retightening of monetary policy.
 "The upcoming data will soon enough force the Fed to change its stance," wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "Otherwise it will begin to look ridiculous."
 On Thursday, the Commerce Department is expected to report that economic growth in the third quarter was the fastest since late 1999. Most forecasters think the economy grew at an annual rate of 6 percent, and some think it climbed even faster.
 Shortly before the Fed announced its decision, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- expensive products with an expected lifetime of three years or more -- climbed 0.8 percent in September. Excluding orders for transportation goods, which are volatile, orders climbed 1.2 percent. 
 "Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted," the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee said. "On balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future." 
 Tuesday's decision appeared to reflect a lingering concern on the part of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the recent increase in spending could be short-lived.
 Mr. Greenspan won praise during the 1990's for adjusting monetary policy in advance of changes in the economy. But this time around, Mr. Greenspan appears to want more concrete verification that unemployment is about to decline below its current level of 6.1 percent and that consumer prices will not sink into a downward spiral of deflation.
 Minutes from the Fed's August meeting make it clear that Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials are paying particularly close attention to companies' limited ability to raise prices.
 Excluding food and energy, which are always volatile, consumer prices are climbing at an annual rate of about 1 percent, and prices for many manufactured goods are not increasing at all. 
 But investors are already starting to bet on rising inflation over the longer term. Long-term interest rates have climbed significantly since mid-June, even though the Federal Reserve has kept its overnight rates extremely low.
 The growing divergence between low short-term rates and higher long-term rates, including rates for home mortgages, reflects a growing tension between what the Federal Reserve is doing and what investors think the Fed will do.
 In its statement on Tuesday, the Fed repeated previous formulations that "spending is firming." But John Vail, an economist at Mizuho Securities, said a more accurate description would be that spending is booming.
 The big question is when and how Fed officials will signal a shift in policy. Mr. Greenspan came in for intense criticism from financial investors last summer, who had become convinced the Fed was about to push down long-term interest rates as well as the Federal Funds rate for overnight loans. When Mr. Greenspan subsequently let it be known that he did not see a need for such action, long-term rates suddenly jumped and bond investors lost billions.
 Now, analysts and investors are fixated on the Fed's assurances that monetary policy will remain easy "for a considerable period." Any retreat from that language could jolt the markets, but most analysts believe a rate increase is inevitable.
 Robert DiClemente, senior United States economist at Citigroup, said it was still too early to expect a shift. "This language is not window-dressing, and jettisoning it is not a housecleaning matter," he wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. "It is most needed in the present situation when business confidence has just begun to take root."

HEADLINE: An Unlikely Leader Emerges As Europe's Economy Mends 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Europe's bruised economies are more firmly on the mend, according to several new surveys, with the Continent's recovery now being led by perhaps its least likely candidate: Germany.
 Business confidence in Germany rose in October for the sixth consecutive month, according to a survey released on Tuesday by the Ifo economics research institute. Even more important, German executives reported a marked improvement in the current economic climate. 
 That rise, the first significant jump since September 2001, indicates that German businesses feel better about today, not just hopeful about tomorrow. And it reassured economists, who have worried that Europe's latest recovery was vulnerable to drying up the way it did in early 2002. 
 "This time, the whole thing feels more like a real recovery," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. "It certainly looks more real than it did only a few months ago."
 The good news is not spread evenly across the Continent. While surveys showed an improved climate in the Netherlands and Belgium, business confidence in Italy fell by more than analysts expected.
 Economists are now waiting for the latest temperature-reading in France, expected on Thursday, when the French national statistics office releases its survey. France has not rebounded as quickly as Germany in recent months -- a rare change for Germany, which has become accustomed to playing the role of Europe's sick man during the global downturn of the last few years.
 "We seem to have changed horses in the eurozone," Mr. Mayer said.
 Part of Germany's improvement, of course, is because of its very low starting point, having endured back-to-back recessions and one of the slowest growth rates among the 12 countries that use the euro.
 But economists and business leaders are giving ample credit to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder for pushing through reforms of Germany's labor market and health care system. Mr. Schroder also seems likely to win the Parliament's approval for a plan to accelerate a tax cut to next year, from 2005.
 Corporate executives are especially enthusiastic about the tax reduction because they think it will revive the one constituency of the German economy that still seems moribund: consumers.
 "Next year will be the first year in a long time that the German consumer has more money in his pocket," said Bruno E. Salzer, the chairman of Hugo Boss, the men's apparel maker. "There has always been lots of money around Germany, but people have opted not to spend it."
 Mr. Salzer said Hugo Boss would eke out the same sales in 2003 as last year. But he projects a substantial sales increase next year, based on the revival of its two largest markets, Germany and the United States.
 France, the company's third-largest market, would grow less robustly, Mr. Salzer said. In part, he attributes his weaker expectations to France's relatively slower timetable for economic reform.
 The Ifo index, based on interviews with hundreds of German companies, rose to 94.2 from 92 in September. That is its highest level since February 2001. The current conditions measurement, which had stagnated for more than two years, rose 1.9 points, to 81.1, still well below the overall index.
 Economists remain guarded about Germany's long-term prospects, with most forecasting economic growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent next year. But Gernot Nerb, a senior economist at the Ifo Institute, said these latest results might prompt people to rethink their caution.
 "We could really see a self-reinforcing upturn," he said. "Improved consumption could lead to growth even ahead of forecast."
 While these monthly surveys invite comparison between countries -- Why is Italy weaker than Belgium? -- some economists note that a stronger-than-expected revival in Germany would lift all its neighbors.
 "If you have a pickup in one country, it is quickly felt in other countries," said Nicholas Sobczak, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Paris. "The economies are so intermingled." 
 Mr. Sobczak said that he expected confidence in France to show an unexpectedly big jump in the forthcoming Insee survey.
 While France and Germany wait for the economic tides to lift them, they are linking arms to fend off efforts by the European Commission to impose stricter fiscal discipline on them.
 Mr. Schroder said on Tuesday that he supported the French government in its refusal to accede to demands by the commission that it make deep cuts in its budget to bring down its deficit. After meeting the French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, in the western French city of Poitiers, Mr. Schroder said, "France and Germany have a responsibility in terms of growth."
 France and Germany are in violation of a European regulation that limits their deficits to 3 percent of their gross domestic product. Each argues that the rule should be relaxed until its economy rebounds.
 With the evidence of such a recovery mounting, some economists note that France and Germany may not be able to use this alibi much longer.

HEADLINE: Jackson's Neutrality Hindering Sharpton Campaign 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL SLACKMAN 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson is again on the campaign trail. He was in California stumping against the recall of Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat. He was in Connecticut marching with Yale employees working without a contract. He has been attacking a Texas plan to redraw Congressional election districts.
 What he is not doing is hitting the campaign trail for any of the nine Democratic presidential contenders. "I made the choice not to run, and at this point not to be involved in any single candidate's race," Mr. Jackson said in an interview. 
 Mr. Jackson's neutrality is no surprise to Democratic Party officials, who say they would not expect him to squander his leverage this early in the campaign season. But it is a setback to the two black candidates, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Carol Moseley Braun, who could benefit most from his support, analysts say. 
His silence, combined with the decision of his son, Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, to support Howard Dean, has exacerbated tensions between him and Mr. Sharpton, people close to them say. Mr. Sharpton, after all, is casting himself as the new Jesse Jackson.
But Mr. Jackson, who ran for president in 1984 and 1988, says that the United States is a far different place than it was when he sought the White House and that blacks are now rising to real positions of political power through conventional routes. 
"The fact is we have grown as a civil rights community enormously in the last 20 years," Mr. Jackson said in an interview.
"You look at the number of mayors," he said, "you look at the number of legislators, you look at the number of Congress people, the number of blacks and browns on boards, the number of blacks and browns in college, the number of blacks and browns with M.B.A.'s. There is a steady growth curve."
Moreover, some of those close to him say Mr. Jackson does not believe it is a year to squander a chance to defeat President Bush by backing any candidate with little chance to win.
"I don't want to speak for Jesse," said Bill Lynch, a political consultant who was deputy mayor of New York under David N. Dinkins. "I think his real goal here is to have a Democrat in the White House, and he wants to do everything to make that happen."
Intentionally or not, Mr. Jackson's stance undermines one of the main rationales Mr. Sharpton uses to sell his candidacy to black voters as he tries -- as Mr. Jackson did nearly two decades ago -- to start a movement that will propel his candidacy. 
"We won more with Jesse losing than with other folks winning," Mr. Sharpton said at a recent church appearance in Washington, telling how Mr. Jackson helped register voters and elect blacks to higher office.
But then he said: "Since Jesse stopped running, we lost the governors. We are going backwards."
Mr. Jackson disagrees, rattling off the names of young campaign volunteers who are now elected officials in states all over the nation. He also points to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice.
"Now when one says we are going backwards," he said, "with real representation and more registered voters we are having more of an impact on domestic and foreign policy, that is going forward."
Ms. Braun, who like Mr. Jackson is based in Chicago, declined to discuss Mr. Jackson's decision. "Reverend Jackson will do what he sees best," she said through a spokesman, Kevin Lampe. Aides said she had not asked for Mr. Jackson's endorsement.
Nor explicitly has Mr. Sharpton. But in his camp, there is a sense that Mr. Sharpton would benefit from Mr. Jackson's support.
Mr. Jackson said that aides to Mr. Sharpton had called for advice and that Mr. Sharpton used some of Representative Jackson's ideas for constitutional amendments as the foundation of his own platform.
Mr. Sharpton was incensed this month when he heard that Representative Jackson was going on a South Carolina campaign trip with Dr. Dean. "I know I am being set up, sabotaged, they ain't got to say it," he said, at a church appearance, in oblique reference to that trip. 
Mr. Sharpton reacted yesterday to Representative Jackson's backing of Dr. Dean by denouncing both men and "any so-called African-American leader that would endorse Dean despite his anti-black record."
Representative Jackson shot back that he did not understand Mr. Sharpton's "attempt to introduce 'race' into the campaign by using such rhetoric as anti-black' with respect to Governor Dean."
Even before Mr. Sharpton decided to run, there was tension between him and the elder Mr. Jackson. That has grown worse, say people close to both men, some of whom say they see an effort by Mr. Jackson to hold onto his leadership status.
As a young man, Mr. Sharpton worked for Mr. Jackson, and now as a candidate he is, to a large degree, trying to replace him. Mr. Sharpton almost always tells black voters that Mr. Jackson's legacy is fading, and that it is up to Mr. Sharpton to get the civil rights movement going again.
In his book, "Al on America" he portrays himself as an insurgent and Mr. Jackson as an insider. "My criticism of guys like Jesse is that you can't be in and out," he wrote. "If you decide to go in, stay in and let those of us who are still out do our jobs."
Kevin Gray, who worked for Mr. Jackson's presidential campaign and advises Mr. Sharpton, said Mr. Jackson was unlikely to step aside for Mr. Sharpton. "Jesse has always said that you don't give up leadership, people have to take it," he said. "So Jesse is not going to hand over leadership of the black community to Al without a struggle." 
Mr. Jackson dismisses the notion that there is now tension with Mr. Sharpton. He volunteers that his Chicago-based civil rights organization has received thousands of letters asking him to support Dr. Dean for president. 
Both men object to being defined as black leaders, accusing the news media of pigeonholing them. Mr. Sharpton says it is because of racism that he is seen as a black candidate. But Mr. Jackson's presidential races, like Mr. Sharpton's current run, relied on galvanizing black voters.
Based on polls of voters after casting ballots in primary states in 1984, blacks made up 18 percent of Democratic primary voters, 77 percent of whom voted for Mr. Jackson (5 percent of whites voted for Mr. Jackson that year). In 1988, blacks made up 21 percent of Democratic primary voters, with 92 percent voting for Mr. Jackson (he garnered 12 percent of the white vote that year).
When Mr. Jackson ran for president, he was an insurgent, challenging the Democratic Party, forcing party members to take up issues of concern to black Americans. But over time, he became a party insider, and a confidant of President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Jackson says he believes, as do most other Democrats, that Mr. Bush is vulnerable in 2004. He says voters who supported him in 1988 can be galvanized behind a Democrat this year if that candidate focuses on the economy and foreign policy.
And who is doing the best job of hitting those themes? The first name Mr. Jackson mentioned was Dr. Dean. "I think because Dean was out there on it first, unequivocally, he picked up early traction on this."
Of Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Braun, he said their main value was keeping the other candidates honest. "There is a dynamic afoot and I think the value of Al and Carol on the ticket is those on the list are less able to make these right-wing deals and overtures without being challenged on the stage," he said.
Mr. Sharpton dismisses any notion that his candidacy is undermined by his inability to win Mr. Jackson's support, and he has at times expressed frustration at even being compared to Mr. Jackson. 
"Let's not confuse whatever his personal decision is," Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. Assessing his support in the black community, he added:"I think I have more support than anybody since him. I can't think of anybody that has been able to get all of those to support them, not one."

HEADLINE: DRUG TESTING; 
Acting Quickly, U.S. Bans Newfound Steroid

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration banned the sale and use of a newly detected steroid yesterday and said it would help prosecute any companies making or selling it.
 The new steroid, tetrahydrogestrinone, or THG, is not a dietary supplement, the federal agency said, but a "purely synthetic designer steroid" derived from another banned drug. 
 Although its safety is untested, it is so closely related to known steroids that the F.D.A. "believes that its use may pose considerable risk to health."
The F.D.A.'s move to ban THG was surprisingly quick, experts said. Dr. Don H. Catlin, head of the Olympic drug testing lab at U.C.L.A., which decoded the drug this summer, called the F.D.A. action "wonderful." 
"They understood, they got the message," he said, "and that's really very, very nice."
The chemical, which does not show up on routine urine tests, is at the center of a doping scandal in which dozens of top Olympic and professional athletes, including Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi and Marion Jones, have been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. The British sprinter Dwain Chambers has admitted taking it.
Not all sports bodies test for steroid use, but many of those that do, including the National Football League and those for track and field, swimming and rugby, have announced that they will re-examine stored urine samples to see if they contain THG. Any athlete whose urine sample tests positive would then be subject to the doping policies of his or her sport, including possible suspension.
John M. Taylor, associate commissioner of food and drugs for regulatory affairs, testified before Congress yesterday that tetrahydrogestrinone is derived from gestrinone, a drug banned by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. It is used in Europe to treat endometriosis, a painful condition in which uterine tissue grows in the abdomen. THG is structurally close to trenbolone, a steroid used by American cattle ranchers to bulk up their herds. Trenbolone is classified as a controlled substance, like morphine and amphetamines, chemicals that have medical uses but are harder to dispense legally than routine prescription drugs.
Tetrahydrogestrinone is made by the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, a Burlingame, Calif., company owned by Victor Conte, a former track athlete who was a bassist known as Walkin' Fish with Tower of Power before he started Balco to offer "nutritional testing and counseling" to athletes. 
Phone calls to Balco were not returned yesterday. Conte, who is also being investigated on tax charges, has issued statements through his lawyers proclaiming his innocence. They issued no immediate statement yesterday.
THG became widely known only since this summer, when an anonymous track coach sent a syringe of it to the anti-doping agency. Catlin's lab spent weeks breaking down its chemistry and realized that users evaded detection because the chemicals and heat used in standard urine tests caused it to disintegrate.
A spokeswoman for the World Anti-Doping Agency commended the F.D.A. action.
"These products can really harm people, and there is no scientific data on this thing," said Farnaz Khadem, the spokeswoman. "The more quickly they moved, the better."
Regulation of anabolic steroids is confused and inconsistent. Other testosterone precursors, like androstenedione and DHEA, which have the same body-building properties and the same dangerous side effects, are classified as food supplements and sold in health-food stores. Government efforts to ban or restrict other chemicals taken by athletes, like ephedra, have dragged on for years.
Dr. Mark B. McClellan, a doctor and economist who became commissioner of food and drugs a year ago, is seen as more aggressive than his predecessors, and his political clout is cemented by the fact that his brother, Scott McClellan, is President Bush's press spokesman. 
Asked yesterday if the F.D.A. was being more aggressive, an agency spokeswoman agreed that it had moved quickly, but she refused to be drawn into comparisons to its past actions on ephedra or other drugs. She did say there was "no political pressure" this time.
Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a New York University professor of medicine and expert on performance-enhancing drugs, welcomed the ban, saying THG had "flown under the radar screen of detection."
He ridiculed the current regulatory situation, under which, he pointed out, "an athlete can ingest a dietary supplement and urinate out a controlled substance."
Anabolic steroids can help build muscles quickly but can also stunt growth, damage kidneys, harden arteries and raise blood pressure. They may masculinize women by increasing the growth of hair and genitals, and they may cause infertility or impotence in men by shutting down testosterone production.
The agency declared THG an unapproved new drug that "cannot be legally marketed without F.D.A. approval under the agency's rigorous approval standards."
Under federal law, new drugs must be proved safe and effective through clinical trials that may take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Makers of supplements may bring them to market with virtually no testing but may not claim to cure disease. If users of supplements complain, it is up to the F.D.A. to prove them unsafe.
Recently, McClellan, the F.D.A. commissioner, moved to toughen diet supplement rules so that manufacturers may be punished if their pills contain impurities like lead, or the wrong levels of active ingredient. They are still not required to prove that the active ingredients work or are safe.
The Senate is considering legislation to bring anabolic steroids, including THG, under the F.D.A.'s purview as controlled substances. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Sports articles on Tuesday and Wednesday about the National Football League's plans to discipline players found to be using a newly detected steroid known as THG misstated the progress of the investigation into the identity of the steroid's manufacturer. While one American antidoping official said he was "fairly certain" THG came from the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative of Burlingame, Calif., federal investigators have not yet determined the source.

HEADLINE: Met's Concerns Threaten A Lincoln Center Plan 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The redevelopment of 65th Street was supposed to be the easy part. 
 For all the uncertainty about Lincoln Center's ambitious rebuilding project, the work on 65th Street, at least, had an actual schedule -- a June start date. And after a tempestuous time in which the New York Philharmonic flirted with leaving for Carnegie Hall, City Opera cast its eye on ground zero and a poorly performing economy crimped the redevelopment plan in general, the 65th Street project is the one thing Lincoln Center has been able to point to as progress and the one thing that all the constituent groups affected -- the Juilliard School and the Film Society among them -- could agree on. 
 But now there appears to be a potential wrench in the works: the Metropolitan Opera. The dispute ostensibly revolves around parking and the convenience of the paying public. But it also resonates with the longstanding objections of the Met's general manager, Joseph Volpe, to the overall redevelopment project. From the start, Mr. Volpe has been opposed to making major structural changes to the campus. He spoke out against a glass enclosure of the plaza designed by Frank Gehry and against building a new home for City Opera in Damrosch Park, a position Beverly Sills ultimately supported when she was chairwoman of Lincoln Center. Both ideas were successfully squashed. 
Even if the differences are ultimately resolved, Mr. Volpe's objections threaten to delay the process.
The preliminary plans for West 65th Street, as conceived by the design firm Diller & Scofidio, include reconfiguring Lincoln Center's underground concourse and garage, to make the area -- on the north side of the campus -- more accessible and inviting.
Mr. Volpe declined to comment yesterday, but those familiar with his views said he would not accept the plans as they stand. Bruce Crawford, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said that talks were continuing and that he was optimistic the current differences could be settled.
"We've resolved part of it and have to address the rest of the questions," he said. " We've got a lot of agreement, but we've got to get everybody into the boat."
Most of the constituents involved are enthusiastic about the plans and say Mr. Volpe's concerns were not surprising. "For us, we might say he's being obstructionist," said Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society, "but for him, he's serving the interests of his constituency."
Other people involved predict that this time, Mr. Volpe will ultimately get on board -- either because a compromise is reached or because Mr. Crawford insists on it. 
"I have no doubt whatsoever that things are going to be resolved in a way that's mutually satisfactory," said Martin Segal, a chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center.
Ms. Sills, now chairwoman of the Met, played down the issue. "I do agree that it will inconvenience Met patrons," she said. "But these things can be solved. Everything's fine."
If history is any measure, the Met can be a formidable obstacle to the redevelopment. In January 2001 the opera pulled out of the project, saying that it had notbeen adequately consulted about the plans (it rejoined four months later). It was the difficulties with the Met over the redevelopment that drove Marshall Rose, the real estate developer, to resign early as chairman of the project in October 2001.
Moreover, the redevelopment requires a 100 percent consensus among the constituents on any material matter, meaning that the Met could potentially hijack the process.
That would make life difficult for Lincoln Center, which is eager to have something to show for the redevelopment to help fund-raising and to satisfy the city, which has committed $240 million to the project and wants to see progress.
Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, said she was updated on the plans about a week ago by Lincoln Center and the designers. 
A similar presentation was made to Lincoln Center's executive committee at the home of Bruce Kovner, chairman of the Juilliard School and a Lincoln Center board member who has committed between $10 million and $15 million to the project. 
"The plans, as we understand them, are totally preliminary," Ms. Levin said. "In so far as they represent progress towards the overall goals of the redevelopment, we're happy to see them and look forward to working with Lincoln Center to refine them."
Mr. Crawford played down the Met's objections. "These are technical things," he said. "I think we'll get it fixed one way or another."

HEADLINE: Crime and Punishment For Capitalists 

BYLINE:  By Leon Aron; Leon Aron, director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is author of "Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the predawn Siberian darkness five days ago, agents of the Russian security agency stormed the private jet of Russia's richest man. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the chief executive and principal owner of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, was arrested and charged with tax evasion, fraud, forgery and embezzlement.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky now awaits his fate in a Moscow prison, where prosecutors can hold him for up to two months while they decide whether to pursue a trial. But his arrest has already raised profound questions for post-Soviet Russia. It has exposed the complex and deep divisions within the elite and the public alike about the nature of state control over the economy, the role of big business in politics and the influence of personal wealth in what still is a poor society. 
 As regards the charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky: it is likely that in the 1990's he broke some laws. But in the chaotic Russian economy of the time, when the state was privatizing its assets on a grand scale, no large business in Russia was "clean" -- and the larger the company, the greater the chance it committed violations. For example, full payment of corporate taxes amounted to well more than 100 percent of most businesses' profits. Tax evasion was the only strategy that allowed an entrepreneur to pay salaries and invest in his business. 
Yet the choice of Yukos, among dozens of equally unsavory candidates, as the scapegoat for the misdeeds of the 1990's makes little sense. In the past five years Yukos has traveled the furthest of any post-Soviet industrial giant from the mores and practices of the previous decade. In 1999 Yukos became the first major Russian oil company to release its quarterly results in accordance with international accounting standards. Independent directors are a majority on the company's board.
When Mr. Khodorkovsky took over the company in 1996, Yukos suffered from the same problems that were hobbling the rest of Russia's energy sector: with costs mounting and oil output declining, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy. Yet by last year, Yukos accounted for 18 percent of Russia's total oil production, pumping an average of 1.4 million barrels a day. Helped by higher oil prices, the company had enough cash to become the first Russian oil company to pay dividends to its nearly 60,000 shareholders.
This generosity has extended to the public as well. Yukos's and Mr. Khodorkovsky's personal donations are beyond parallel in post-Soviet history. Yukos gave $45 million to charity in 2002. When the billionaire investor and speculator George Soros decided last year to end a decade of charitable giving in Russia, Yukos contributed $1.15 million to the Eurasia Foundation for the support of small-business and community development.
In March 2000, Yukos started a nationwide program called "Pokolenie.ru" (or "Generation.ru") to provide Internet access to Russian high school teachers and students. Pokolenie.ru equips centers where teachers can acquire Internet skills to pass on to their students. Their travel, room, and board are paid by Yukos. By last spring, 56,600 Russian educators had completed the course.
This hard work has increased Yukos's profits and Mr. Khodorkovsky's enormous personal fortune. But it profits Russia as well. Alas, Yukos has adapted too fast for the slowly changing system. Born out of decaying Soviet socialism and with corrupt party functionaries as its midwives, Russian capitalism continues to be bound to the state by the myriad of "deals," outdated regulations and nefarious connections between businessmen and government officials.
The idea persists: private business must still and always remain in the government's good graces. After three-quarters of a century of limitless power, many in the largely Soviet-era Russian senior bureaucracy are incapable of accepting an economic system in which property and wealth are not directly conferred, withdrawn or at least controlled by the state.
"If we don't like you, how can you be rich?" That is the message that the state bureaucracy intends to send with Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest. Other oligarchs, as well as hundreds of thousands of owners of smaller businesses, must take heed.
Among other "transgressions," Yukos broke a cardinal rule of the bureaucratic game: it openly contributed to the main opposition political parties to advance its interests and shape the laws. (The accepted practice would have been to ignore the laws and bribe those who write and enforce them.) In a country where long-term planning -- economic, financial, and political -- has been all but eliminated by 400 years of brutal authoritarianism and totalitarian ownership of the economy, Yukos dared to plan for decades ahead without consulting state ministers and committee chairmen.
Thus the Yukos affair is not simply a law enforcement matter, as President Vladimir Putin has insisted. It is a major battle between two economic cultures: what Russian analysts have labeled "great-power statist" versus the "liberal-oligarchic."
Although hardly perfect, in the last five years the liberal-oligarchic system has nevertheless proved more adaptable. It has fostered fiscal discipline, low inflation, lower corporate and income taxes, the extension of private property rights, a decline of bureaucratic interference, the continuing privatization of state assets, and improvements in corporate governance and transparency.
By contrast, the great power-statist culture, which is most prominent among federal and local elected authorities and bureaucrats, seeks to increase the government's control over the economy and, inevitably, civil society. Added to this constituency in the last three years have been many retired and active secret service officers who under Mr. Putin came to occupy an unprecedented number of executive positions in government.
The statists need a decisive victory over not just a giant private conglomerate but a symbol of a more open, rapidly modernizing Russian capitalism. As the best known Russian company inside and outside the country, Yukos fits the bill.
No one knows how far they will take their campaign against economic vitality. They are likely to stop short of wholesale renationalization of firms. But new policies may include a "redistribution" of the privatized economy, with key industrial sectors and the most profitable large companies reverting to state control or being taken away from the current owners and given to more "loyal" entrepreneurs.
Conversely, the defeat of the statists may encourage the further emergence of the economy and civil society from under the state's shadow; a judiciary more willing to stand up to the Kremlin; the swift passage of key structural liberal reforms; and the establishment of a statute of limitations on charges arising from the privatizations of the 1990's. If passed, such a law will put an end to bureaucratic blackmail.
Finally confident in their property rights, Russian entrepreneurs would be encouraged to spend less on bribing elected and government officials and more on investments in their enterprises and charitable projects. New laws on lobbying, campaign finance and charitable contributions would permit Russian business to advance openly its interests in Russian politics.
Mr. Putin cannot long avoid making a choice between these two visions of Russia. He may not be swayed by the surprisingly vigorous criticism in the Russian press of Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest. But perhaps the reported resignation in protest of his chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin, will give Mr. Putin pause.
As in any country, the interests of Russia's industrial leaders may not always and in every instance coincide with society's. But by winning the right to promote those interests, the oligarchs can help to advance the cause of Russian democracy.

HEADLINE: Iran Demands Concessions From U.S. in Return for Cooperation 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Iran said Wednesday that it would not share intelligence with the United States on operatives of Al Qaeda or hand over Qaeda suspects in Iranian detention and would resume dialogue only after the United States undertakes what it termed measures to build confidence. 
 It was not clear whether the United States would first have to restore diplomatic relations broken after the storming of the American Embassy in Tehran in the fall of 1979. 
 "You cannot threaten from one side and freeze assets from the other side; level accusations from one side and then request dialogue from the other side; we need to see America's practical steps," the government spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, told reporters. 
"They have leveled too many false accusations against us and they should stop that," he said. "They should also unfreeze our assets and lift the sanctions." 
Mr. Ramezanzadeh was responding to comments made Tuesday by Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, who signaled American willingness to hold limited talks with Iran. Mr. Armitage, striking a conciliatory tone, also said that the Bush administration did not favor "regime change" in Iran. 
By contrast, President Bush in his 2002 State of the Union address grouped Iran with Iraq and North Korea as an "axis of evil." 
The United States severed talks with Iran after a series of bombings in Saudi Arabia in May which the United States said were linked to groups based in Iran. Iran has denied the assertion. 
The United States had also asked Iran to turn over detained senior members of Al Qaeda. Mr. Ramezanzadeh said Wednesday that Iran had no security agreement with the United States to turn over the detainees. He said Iran had returned some detainees to nations with whom it had such security agreements and said the rest would be dealt with according to Iranian laws. 
Iran announced this week that it had given to the United Nations the names of 225 Qaeda members it had arrested. It said that nearly 78 of them had been returned to their nations of origin. 
"We believe that all countries should deal with terrorism and terrorist groups indiscriminately," Mr. Ramezanzadeh said. "We have also taken necessary measures against terrorism according to international regulations and do not need other countries to interfere in our affairs." 
The government of President Mohammad Khatami has come under increasing pressure from hard-liners since last week, when the government reached an agreement with the foreign secretaries of Britain, Germany and France to allow more intrusive inspections of its nuclear sites and to suspend enrichment of uranium. 
Hard-line militants, who oppose any restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, have accused the government and influential clerics who have sided with the government of undermining the nation's security. 
"We are worried about the kind of guarantees that our negotiators have received over our national security and sovereignty," a group of militant students wrote in a letter, the Jomhouri Islamic daily reported today. 
"How do we know that because of the nuclear agency's financial dependence on America, Iraq's experience would not repeat in Iran and American spies would not come under the guise of inspectors?" the letter asked. 
The agreement needs to be approved by Parliament before it can be enforced.

Corporate Tax Changes Offer Something for All
As lawmakers in the House pushed ahead this week with the biggest overhaul of corporate taxes in two decades, they seemed to be giving something to almost everybody.
 The bill in the House will have to be reconciled with a similar but more modest bill moving through the Senate. The Senate measure aims to pay for itself, by offsetting the cost of $70 billion in new tax breaks with money from repealing the old export subsidy and other measures. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Countries Rated by Cost Of Doing Business 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Stretched by the rising cost of fighting terrorism and its large budget deficit, the United States dropped to second from first in the annual ranking of global economic competitiveness.
 The cost of fighting terrorism and the war in Iraq and its effect on American economic competitiveness were measured by the survey in everything from delays caused by security checkpoints in buildings and airports to the longer-term effect of discouraging foreign students from earning graduate degrees here. 
 The United States' ranking also suffered for failing to comply with international agreements, inefficient public spending and allowing political donations to affect policy decisions.
But the biggest problem is the budget deficit caused in part by the costs of the war and new domestic security, said Augusto Lopez-Claros, chief economist and the author of the report for the World Economic Forum. 
"The war in Iraq and on terrorism will have a large financial impact, showing up in the deficits and the costs of doing business in the United States, especially more red tape and reduced efficiency," Mr. Lopez-Claros said in an interview from London.
In contrast, European and Asian nations were the bright spots in the survey. 
The survey is based on interviews with business leaders and entrepreneurs in 102 countries as well as publicly available economic data. The World Economic Forum, a global assembly of officials from boardrooms and governments best known for its gatherings at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, conducts the survey to determine why some countries are competitive year after year while others stumble.
Finland headed the list as the most competitive nation, scoring at the top across the board, from enrollment rates in universities to the ability of companies to absorb new technology.
The countries in Eastern and Central European that are joining the European Union next year showed significant progress, according to the survey. Simply by fulfilling the requirements for membership in the European Union, these countries made the changes necessary to jump up the competitive ladder.
"The tough demands for membership have paid off even before they join," Mr. Lopez-Claros said.
With this year's solid performance, Asian countries seemed to have put the financial crisis of the mid-1990's behind them.
In the survey, Taiwan ranked fifth and Singapore sixth, showings that reflected how the high-performing nations of Asia had not only recovered from the financial crisis, but surged ahead. Taiwan and Singapore both moved up one spot from last year. 
Korea is a stark example. Five years ago, amid talk of a depression in Asia, South Korea underwent an austerity program dictated in large part by Washington and the International Monetary Fund in return for rescue packages. South Korea was struggling to replenish its dwindling foreign currency accounts and workers were striking against proposed layoffs.
Today the country is ranked 18th, an improvement by three positions from last year's competitive list, with high rates of university enrollment, top-quality Internet service providers as well as improvements in public institutions and public expenditures.
"Korea is a very classic example of the importance of consistent reforms," Mr. Lopez-Claros said.
For similar reasons, Chile emerged as the most competitive nation in Latin America, Botswana in Africa and Jordan in the Middle East.
For the United States, the world's biggest economy, several signs were troubling even though it ranks as the second most competitive.
The American government's refusal to comply with some international agreements is working against American businesses, according to the survey, which listed agreements covering global warming, the prosecution of war criminals and international trade.
"If you're working in an international economy," Mr. Lopez-Claros said, "but in one of your markets a government is choosy in terms of which international agreements it will comply with, it will make you hesitant to do business there."
In the survey, he said, inefficient public spending in the United States referred in large part to the $19 billion in annual agricultural subsidies provided by the government. Japan and several European nations were also criticized for the large share of public money spent on agricultural subsidies.
American business leaders also said they were concerned about the undue influence of legal political donations on important policy decisions.
"There seems to be a sense there is too much influence there, that they are asked to contribute a lot of money," Mr. Lopez-Claros said. "In other countries, like Denmark, there isn't a problem like this."

HEADLINE: Dollar Dips, Then Recovers Against Yen 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar stabilized against the yen yesterday, recovering from three-year lows hit during the trading session as markets braced for today's release of United States growth data and a report from the Treasury on currencies.
 The Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, is to deliver a report on international economic and exchange rate policy to the Senate Banking Committee today. 
 Analysts said Mr. Snow might criticize Japan and China for holding down their currencies to gain an export advantage.
Thomas Molloy, a trader at Bank Leumi in New York, said: "The jury is out as to when the next leg lower in the dollar is going to start. Markets are looking at Snow's testimony this week."
Robust Japanese data and continued gains in Tokyo stocks overnight reinforced the market's bullish outlook on Japan's economy, bolstering the yen against the dollar.
The Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to hold interest rates steady propelled high-yielding currencies, in particular the British pound and the New Zealand and Australian dollars, higher at the dollar's expense. 
"People see the U.K. has really made the turn in the economy," said Cyrus Whitney, the head dealer with Commerzbank in New York.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
A big merger in health care arouses suspicions that insurers may soon cease to be masters of pricing.

BYLINE:  By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
SOME executives and analysts in the health care industry see a simple message in the announcement this week that Leonard D. Schaeffer, one of the most successful chief executives in health care, is selling WellPoint Health Networks to Anthem Inc. -- that the glory days are fading for health insurers.
 The merger, for $16.4 billion in stock and cash, jolted the overlapping worlds of Blue Cross and commercial insurers as executives and analysts tried to fathom what had motivated Mr. Schaeffer, a hard-charging 58-year-old who has run WellPoint for 18 years. Between them, Anthem and WellPoint operate Blue Cross plans in 13 states from Maine to California. 
 By one account, Mr. Schaeffer is stepping down at a time when the health insurance business is about to turn a corner after its most prosperous year in a decade.
"The cycle has already turned," said Howard Phanstiel, a former WellPoint executive vice president, who is now president and chief executive of PacifiCare Health Systems. "Some insurance companies are pricing below what we believe the medical cost trend is, as people compete to improve their top-line revenues in the face of a sagging economy." 
Jeff Goldsmith, president of Health Futures, an industry consultant, sees a direct link between Mr. Schaeffer's move and the changing outlook. "The insurance industry is running out of the ability to charge 12 to 15 percent premium increases," he said. "I think we're at the top of the underwriting cycle. This is a real good top-of-the market signal. We actually are going to see some price competition."
Larry Feinberg, president of Oracle Partners, a health care investment fund, said: "There are going to be price wars in competitive markets. The winners will be either big national guys with great computer systems and cost controls, or the guys with strong proprietary positions in regional markets. But the smaller ones may all get gobbled up." 
How the cooling of prices would affect insurance company profits is disputed. "Margins will go down," said Jim Callanan, chief executive of the Impart Group, a health care consulting firm in Boston. 
That may be true at some companies but not at WellPoint, Mr. Schaeffer insisted. WellPoint, he said, raises premiums just enough to stay ahead of the annual increases it faces in its payments to doctors and hospitals -- something known in the business as the medical trend.
"This year, " Mr. Schaeffer said, "the increase in the medical trend actually plateaued, and in the third quarter we've seen it go down 100 basis points," or 1 percent.
WellPoint premium increases will also probably slow, though they will not go down, he said, as long as medical cost increases can be limited.
So why is he handing the chief executive's baton of the combined company to Larry C. Glasscock, the Anthem chief executive? Mr. Schaeffer will be chairman of the new company, to be called WellPoint Inc. even though Anthem people will outnumber WellPoint alumni, 3 to 2 , on the new board.
After 18 years as chief executive, he said: "It was time for me to look at other opportunities. I'm interested in the whole health care system." 
WellPoint Inc., if approved by regulators and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, would have 26 million members, potentially the largest comprehensive health care database outside the government.
He sees an opening to "gather enough information to manipulate and analyze so we can give people guidance about the effectiveness of health care procedures, the effectiveness of individual practitioners, of this option and that option."
"As the baby boomers age," he said, "that's what they will demand," adding that they will not settle for "doctor knows best."
Mr. Schaeffer brushed aside suggestions that selling to Anthem was a convenient solution to a lack of potential successors to him as chief executive.
At least three former WellPoint senior officials are now senior executives of other big managed-care companies. Besides Mr. Phanstiel of PacifiCare, Ronald A. Williams is president of Aetna, and Marvin P. Rich is executive vice president of Health Net.
"I'm 58, I could keep going," Mr. Schaeffer said, adding that WellPoint's executive succession plans were "not a matter for public discussion." His employment contract has three years to run, according to a person outside the company close to the situation.
A union of WellPoint and Anthem would have far-reaching implications in the industry. Both have had a strategy of buying Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, which typically have exclusive franchises and dominant positions in a state. WellPoint and Anthem have at least 30 percent of the market in most of their 13 states and "in the 40's" in Virginia, Mr. Schaeffer said. 
But their takeover plans were blocked recently by state authorities in Maryland and Kansas, in response to consumer groups' objections that nonprofit health plans charged less for better benefits. 
Analysts expect WellPoint and Anthem to be busy making their deal work for two years or so before returning to the pursuit of acquisitions.
Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Glasscock said the new company would compete with national companies like Aetna, Cigna and the UnitedHealth Group for contracts with the biggest employers. "The national insurance companies are 50 states wide and an inch deep," Mr. Schaeffer said. "This company will be No.1 in 12 states." 
Mr. Phanstiel regards the WellPoint-Anthem deal as a business opportunity. "This is a good time for us to introduce some new products that can compete with them," he said, "while this acquisition consumes their time and energy."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares End Slightly Higher On Positive Earnings News

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street closed a quiet session modestly higher yesterday as companies reported generally positive earnings news, but some investors were disappointed by faltering merger talks between BellSouth and AT&T.
 The market seemed to be taking a rest after the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged and ahead of the government's gross domestic product report on Thursday, said Peter Cardillo, president and chief strategist of Global Partner Securities. 
 The break gives traders and investors "time to position themselves," he said.
"I think the market has gone up in a rather vivacious way the last couple of days and what we're seeing here is a bit of hesitancy on the part of investors and traders to commit money ahead of key numbers," Mr. Cardillo said. "The upside today was limited." 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 26.22 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 9,774.53. The Nasdaq composite index was up 4.30 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,936.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,048.11.
BellSouth rose 67 cents, to close at $26, after reports it had called off its latest round of merger discussions with AT&T. 
AT&T fell 87 cents, to close at $19.07. 
"It's the third time we've danced this dance, so we're in an 'I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it' situation," Tim Smalls, a managing director and trader at SG Cowen Securities, said. "I don't think the market was taken by surprise that it didn't happen this time."
Merger news can have a powerful effect on the market. The major indexes surged earlier this week when Bank of America announced a $48 billion deal to acquire FleetBoston Financial. Those gains were extended Tuesday after the Fed said it would leave rates unchanged.
A pickup in merger activity, combined with good economic data, strong earnings and promising fourth-quarter forecasts, could easily start a longer rally, said Peter Dunay, chief market and options strategist at Wall Street Access, a brokerage firm in New York. "If we can break through the old highs, that will help get a leg up, too," Mr. Dunay said. 
Investors were betting on old-fashioned industrial stocks yesterday, including several defense contractors that reported solid earnings growth. Boeing announced a 31 percent drop in quarterly earnings because of heavy costs of shutting down production of the 757 jet, but solid results from its growing defense business helped it beat Wall Street's expectations. Boeing rose $2.46, or 6.8 percent, to $38.50.
Northrop Grumman swung to a profit in the third quarter and raised its full-year estimates on strong sales of its ships and unmanned surveillance vehicles. The results easily beat analysts' estimates, and it gained $2.86, to $90.36.
Halliburton also got a revenue boost from government contracts, including work in Iraq, but its earnings missed analyst forecasts, partly because of a proposed asbestos settlement. The company dropped 56 cents, to $23.52.
High fuel prices helped ConocoPhillips beat analysts' expectations by a wide margin. The company declined in early trading, but ended the day unchanged at $56.97.
Among the decliners was Johnson & Johnson, which lost $1.06, to close at $49.48, after the Food and Drug Administration warned doctors that it had received reports of clotting in patients implanted with a stent made by the company.

Treasury Prices Decline
By Reuters
Treasury prices slid yesterday as bond investors worried that coming data on jobs and growth would confirm the economy was expanding briskly.
The 10-year Treasury note declined 28/32, to a price of 99 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.3 percent from 4.19 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32, to 102 29/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.18 percent from 5.09 percent.
Results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Big Sales of Cut-Rate Drugs From Canada 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Canada's fast-growing online pharmacies may rile some American politicians, but in the prairie province Manitoba they are seen in a different light, providing a useful lift to the local economy.
 Of the estimated 140 online pharmacies operating from Canada, 62 are registered in Manitoba, where they are seen as a valuable source of jobs and tax revenue. The provincial government "has been supportive of this as a developing industry," said Marcia Thomson, an assistant deputy minister for health in Manitoba. 
 Some say the rapid growth of the industry is responsible for a shortage of pharmacists in the province. Jeff Poston, executive director of the Canadian Pharmacists Association in Ottawa, said that the online drugstores had "sucked out" almost a quarter of Manitoba's pharmacists from the health care system. 
However, one Manitoba government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the shortage of pharmacists was caused mainly by Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers expanding into the prescription drug business.
Canada's online pharmacies have had little trouble finding customers since they began filling prescriptions for Americans at bargain prices. Finding supplies to fill those prescriptions, however, has become a growing challenge.
As the debate intensifies over Americans' access to imported drugs, at least five brand-name manufacturers -- Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Wyeth, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca -- have moved to protect the American market by trying to halt or at least limit supplies to Canadian online drugstores.
"They're having a substantial impact, squeezing supply lines," said Andy Troszok, vice president of the Canadian International Pharmacy Association, based in Calgary, Alberta, which represents about 20 online drugstores.
Mr. Troszok said that some Internet businesses have recently had to turn away orders for popular drugs like Paxil, the anti-depressant made by GlaxoSmithKline; Lipitor, the Pfizer anti-cholesterol medication; and Premarin, a hormone replacement therapy made by Wyeth.
Prices for brand-name drugs are lower in Canada than in the United States, by as much as 50 percent, mainly because of government-imposed price controls.
Importing drugs into the United States is illegal. However, the Food and Drug Administration has decided not to enforce the law against individuals who carry limited supplies across the border or who order a few prescriptions online.
Canadian pharmacies began filling mail-order prescriptions from the United States in the 1990's, but the cross-border traffic has ballooned as the Internet has spread.
The online drugstores estimate that they now serve a total of about a million American customers. Billy Shawn, president of the Canadian Drugstore, which operates from an unmarked building in an industrial park in Toronto, said that his company handled 1,000 to 2,000 calls and e-mail messages a day. He said the revenue was likely to reach 55 million Canadian dollars ($42 million) this year.
The online pharmacies have been able to raise their profit margins by charging more than local Canadian drugstores -- there is no government-imposed limit on retail prices -- knowing that the prices will still be attractive to customers across the border. For instance, the Web site of RxNorth.com, based in Minnedosa, Manitoba, was charging roughly 200 Canadian dollars for 90 Lipitor tablets this week. A pharmacy in a Toronto residential neighborhood was selling the same tablets for 185 Canadian dollars.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and traditional retailers in the United States and Canada have become increasingly concerned about the threat from the online retailers. Summarizing the industry's concerns, GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement this year that "the export of Canadian medicines to the United States presents serious issues for Canada's health care system, puts a strain on supply of medicines for Canadians and poses a safety risk for United States patients accessing unregulated Canadian medicines."
Though Merck Frosst Canada, Merck's Canadian unit, has not yet clamped down on supplies to Canada, Vincent Lamoureux, a company spokesman, said: "This is something we're monitoring on a constant basis. We certainly don't support the business of Internet pharmacies."
Canada's health department, known as Health Canada, entered the fray this week with a warning that the spurt in cross-border sales could cause domestic drug shortages. "Health Canada regards this as a very serious matter due to the inherent risk to Canadians' health," a senior official wrote in a letter to medical and pharmacy groups.
The online drugstores say their critics are less concerned about the health of Americans and Canadians than about the drug manufacturers' profits. According to Mr. Troszok, "over one million patients are getting their life-saving medicines from Canada, and there's not a single incident of a patient being harmed." Dr. Poston of the pharmacists' association said he had heard of one or two complaints, but could not provide details. 
Ms. Thomson, the Manitoba health official, said that "nobody wants to jeopardize" the safety of the Canadian health care system. "We don't see anything that's threatening this." The real threat to health care on both sides of the border, say the online drugstore executives and their sympathizers, are the manufacturers' blacklists and boycotts.
Diane Duston, an analyst at Prudential Financial in Arlington, Va., wrote in a report this month that with drug supplies more difficult to come by "it appears that Internet pharmacies are increasingly obtaining their product for shipment into the United States from countries such as Bulgaria, Singapore, Argentina, South Africa, Pakistan and other sources." Ms. Duston cited particularly large increases in Canadian imports from Bulgaria and Pakistan.
According to Ms. Duston, "until they can create effective tracking systems, neither the Food and Drug Administration nor American consumers will really be able to discern the true origins of imported products coming from Canada." She added that while transshipment of drugs through Canada made it more difficult for the drug companies to curb the online operators, it also raised the risk that Americans might receive defective medication. 
Mr. Shawn said that while the Canadian Drug Store continued to fill prescriptions without delays, "We've had to spend more time getting supply."
Mr. Shawn said his company had substantially increased its inventories, and that some traditional pharmacies were willing to divert some orders to his business. According to Dr. Poston, every director of his association who runs a drugstore has received letters from online pharmacies recently offering a 5 percent to 10 percent premium for supplies.
Mr. Shawn said his company, which celebrated its third anniversary last week, was intended to cater to a cross-section of Americans who could not afford drugs at regular prices because they are uninsured or underinsured.
"I never set up this business to be in competition with the corner pharmacy in the United States," he said. The big manufacturers should accept that, he said, rather than "spend all their resources creating a drug police force."

HEADLINE: Medicare Bill Won't Include A Co-Payment for Home Care 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
After intense lobbying by Medicare beneficiaries and by former Senator Bob Dole, Congress has discarded the idea of imposing a co-payment on home health care services provided to the elderly and the disabled, lawmakers said on Wednesday.
 In addition, House and Senate negotiators said they were close to an agreement expanding access to low-cost generic drugs, and they have decided to impose new financial penalties on hospitalsthat refuse to disclose data on the quality of care. 
 The actions came as Congress tried to complete work on a bill revamping Medicare and offering prescription drug coverage to 40 million beneficiaries, at a cost of $400 billion over 10 years.
Asserting that "Congress is on the verge of Medicare reform," President Bush said elderly people should put pressure on Congress to finish the job. 
"The time to improve our Medicare system has come," Mr. Bush said at a White House event on Wednesday. "Now is the time. I urge America's seniors to speak up, to call and write your representatives to urge them to work out a final bill."
Mr. Bush reiterated his plea for Congress to give private health plans a larger role in Medicare, saying they could offer "better coverage at more affordable prices." 
The president said he had been assured that employers would not eliminate drug benefits for retirees if Medicare offered such coverage. 
"Corporations have no intention to what they call 'dump' retirees into a system they don't want to be dumped into," Mr. Bush said, citing assurances from Richard P. Lavin, a vice president of Caterpillar Inc.
Many retirees and labor unions have become alarmed that they will lose health benefits provided by former employers if Medicare offers similar but more limited drug benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that four million retirees could lose drug coverage offered by former employers.
The fight over home care was one of many disputes swirling around the Medicare legislation. The House bill would impose a co-payment of $40 to $50 for each 60-day period in which a beneficiary receives home care.
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, and Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, supported the payment as a way to discourage overuse of home care. 
Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, both Republicans, led the opposition. "The co-payment would have forced many of the most frail seniors to turn down care they really need, and it would have been a particular hardship for people with low incomes," Ms. Collins said. 
Like many Republicans, Ms. Collins said she was "reserving judgment" on the overall Medicare bill.
Home care agencies and advocates for the elderly criticized the co-payment as a "sick tax." Mr. Dole, the former Kansas senator, conveyed their concerns to lawmakers.
While abandoning the co-payment, Congressional negotiators have decided to extract savings from providers of home care by reducing the annual update in their Medicare payments. The update reflects inflation in the cost of goods and services.
The conference committee has also decided to revise a provision of the House bill that would have cut $12 billion from Medicare payments to hospitals over the next decade. Hospitals could avoid the cuts if they disclosed information on the quality of care they provided, using standards specified by the government.
Bush administration officials said such data would help consumers identify the best and worst hospitals. The officials said they had been frustrated in efforts to persuade hospitals to release such data voluntarily.
The emerging agreement on generic drugs would make it more difficult for manufacturers of brand-name medicines to delay federal approval of competing generic products. Brand-name manufacturers would be allowed only a single 30-month stay, while a court tries to resolve patent disputes. In the absence of a lawsuit by a brand-name company, the maker of a competing generic drug could ask a courtto clarify its right to market it.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said this arrangement would benefit consumers by allowing makers of generic drugs to know in advance whether they can sell copies of a particular drug without infringing its patents.
The first manufacturer of generic drugs to get federal approval for a low-cost copy of a brand-name product would have an exclusive right to market it for 180 days. If the company did not begin marketing in 75 days, it could forfeit exclusivity.

HEADLINE: Eyes Wide Shut 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the thick of the war with Iraq, President Bush used to pop out of meetings to catch the Iraqi information minister slipcovering grim reality with willful, idiotic optimism.
 "He's my man," Mr. Bush laughingly told Tom Brokaw about the entertaining contortions of Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, a k a "Comical Ali" and "Baghdad Bob," who assured reporters, even as American tanks rumbled in, "There are no American infidels in Baghdad. Never!" and, "We are winning this war, and we will win the war. . . . This is for sure." 
 Now Crawford George has morphed into Baghdad Bob.
Speaking to reporters this week, Mr. Bush made the bizarre argument that the worse things get in Iraq, the better news it is. "The more successful we are on the ground, the more these killers will react," he said.
In the Panglossian Potomac, calamities happen for the best. One could almost hear the doubletalk echo of that American officer in Vietnam who said: "It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it."
The war began with Bush illogic: false intelligence (from Niger to nuclear) used to bolster a false casus belli (imminent threat to our security) based on a quartet of false premises (that we could easily finish off Saddam and the Baathists, scare the terrorists and democratize Iraq without leeching our economy).
Now Bush illogic continues: The more Americans, Iraqis and aid workers who get killed and wounded, the more it is a sign of American progress. The more dangerous Iraq is, the safer the world is. The more troops we seem to need in Iraq, the less we need to send more troops.
The harder it is to find Saddam, Osama and W.M.D., the less they mattered anyhow. The more coordinated, intense and sophisticated the attacks on our soldiers grow, the more "desperate" the enemy is.
In a briefing piped into the Pentagon on Monday from Tikrit, Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno called the insurgents "desperate" eight times. But it is Bush officials who seem desperate when they curtain off reality. They don't even understand the political utility of truth.
After admitting recently that Saddam had no connection to 9/11, the president pounded his finger on his lectern on Tuesday, while vowing to stay in Iraq, and said, "We must never forget the lessons of Sept. 11."
Mr. Bush looked buck-passy when he denied that the White House, which throws up PowerPoint slogans behind his head on TV, was behind the "Mission Accomplished" banner. And Donald Rumsfeld looked duplicitous when he acknowledged in a private memo, after brusquely upbeat public briefings, that America was in for a "long, hard slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan.
No juxtaposition is too absurd to stop Bush officials from insisting nothing is wrong. Car bombs and a blitz of air-to-ground missiles turned Iraq into a hideous tangle of ambulances, stretchers and dead bodies, just after Paul Wolfowitz arrived there to showcase successes.
But the fear of young American soldiers who don't speak the language or understand the culture, who don't know who's going to shoot at them, was captured in a front-page picture in yesterday's Times: two soldiers leaning down to search the pockets of one small Iraqi boy.
Mr. Bush, staring at the campaign hourglass, has ordered that the "Iraqification" of security be speeded up, so Iraqi cannon fodder can replace American sitting ducks. But Iraqification won't work any better than Vietnamization unless the Bush crowd stops spinning.
Neil Sheehan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "A Bright Shining Lie," recalls Robert McNamara making Wolfowitz-like trips to Vietnam, spotlighting good news, yearning to pretend insecure areas were secure.
"McNamara was in a jeep in the Mekong Delta with an old Army colonel from Texas named Dan Porter," Mr. Sheehan told me. "Porter told him, 'Mr. Secretary, we've got serious problems here that you're not getting. You ought to know what they are.' And McNamara replied: 'I don't want to hear about your problems. I want to hear about your progress.' "
"If you want to be hoodwinked," Mr. Sheehan concludes, "it's easy."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CONGRESS; 
Plan for Iraq to Repay U.S. Aid Is Rejected

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators on Wednesday rejected a Senate proposal that would have required Iraq to repay billions in reconstruction aid, ending a brief rebellion against President Bush's $87 billion plan for the occupation and rebuilding of Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The negotiating committee, with members from both houses, approved a spending plan for Iraq that calls for about $18.6 billion in aid to be given as a gift to Iraq, as President Bush had demanded. The White House, arguing that Iraq is already too burdened with debt, threatened to veto the bill if it included a loan provision, and Republicans on the joint House-Senate conference committee echoed the administration's position. 
 "If Iraq's economy gets back on track without a huge additional debt load, it could become the model for the future of the Middle East," said Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California. "To suggest the way we can help best is by more debt load is absolutely ridiculous. 
"It is time for us to recognize that it's in the interest of America to see that Iraq's economy does well," Mr. Lewis said, "because it will produce benefits for us that will last for generations to come."
Democrats argued that Iraq was well equipped to pay its debts, and noted that the federal government would have to increase its own record-setting debts to provide the aid.
"We believe Iraq can pay its own way," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland. "It will add to their national dignity, and it will show that they're ready to enter the world. And quite frankly, our people have sticker shock -- they do not want to this be a grant, they want this to be a loan."
But the Democrats on the committee lost the support of two Republican colleagues who had voted for the loan in the Senate earlier this month, Sam Brownback of Kansas and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado. Once senators on the committee voted 16 to 13 against the loans on Wednesday afternoon, the provision was permanently dropped from the bill, and neither chamber will be able to restore it when they vote on the measure later this week. The legislation will then go to the president for his signature.
However, in approving a compromise bill, the committee did not give President Bush precisely what he had requested in September. The conference cut about $1.7 billion from the administration's original request for $20.3 billion in rebuilding aid, mostly for projects the committee members considered unnecessary, such as housing developments, a ZIP code program, garbage trucks and new prisons.
And, in a slap at what critics see as the administration's reluctance to share information about Iraq with Congress, Republicans joined Democrats in adding several watchdog provisions to the bill, adjustments that demonstrated unease with the administration's desire to spend taxpayer money freely in Iraq. One powerful Republican on the committee openly accused the administration of arrogance.
"There are a lot of people here who have tried to be a strong supporter of this administration, doing everything they possibly could," said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for the Commerce and Justice Departments. "But you bump up against a degree of arrogance over and over again."
Mr. Wolf added: "I want the president to do well, but it's important that you be open when members of Congress on either side, on either party, try to get information. Pride goeth before the fall."
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, seconded the spirit of Mr. Wolf's remarks, criticizing L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, for declining to meet with him and other Congressional leaders this week.
The conference committee approved a proposal by Mr. Stevens to create an inspector general to watch over spending by Mr. Bremer's authority in Iraq, one of more than a dozen new oversight requirements added by both chambers to the $87 billion bill.
Over the administration's objections, the committee also improved health care benefits for military reservists and National Guard members who are unemployed or do not have a company health care plan. The improved benefits would also extend the benefits to reservists and Guard members for six months after they return from active duty. The administration said the plan was too expensive.
The committee rejected a Democratic proposal to require the Senate to confirm the administrator in Iraq. Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, argued that Mr. Bremer controlled a budget larger than that of nearly half the cabinet agencies, but said the Senate has no role in his selection and insufficient oversight of his actions.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: WASHINGTON TALK; 
The Bad News Is Good News For Democrats

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Iraq is a mess, the world resents America and its debt-burdened economy is an international embarrassment. That was the Democratic perspective voiced at a conference that ended here on Wednesday, that things could hardly be more grim.
 "The bad news is, we're headed in the wrong direction" said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's last national security adviser. "The worse news is we can't afford it." 
 So why, then, was there a smile on Mr. Berger's jowly face? Why was John Podesta, the former Clinton chief of staff, standing in the wings and shouting "Tremendous!" into a cellphone? And wasn't that the commanding Richard Holbrooke, the former United Nations ambassador, who boldly took the podium? "I'm a liberal," he thundered, "and I'm proud of it."
In the capital, the party out of power is always frustrated. But there is no better salve for being on the outs than watching on the sidelines as the party in power is struggling. 
That was the tone of a two-day conference of diplomatic veterans who gathered in a hotel ballroom here in a fledgling attempt to define the Democratic view of "New American Strategies for Security and Peace." The conference, sponsored by the left-leaning American Prospect magazine, the Center for American Progress and the Century Foundation, drew some Democratic heavyweights who emerged from their exile in think tanks, high finance and academia, to criticize the Bush administration for steering the nation greviously off course. 
The conference underscored how Democrats are finding a voice to challenge the administration on national security. They are reappropriating national symbols and insisting that their criticism is patriotic and in the best American traditions. 
Mr. Berger said the administration's bent for unilateral action, its doctrine of pre-emptive force and its preference for coalitions over alliances represent "a radical shift in the nature of American foreign policy," and need to be scrapped. Other speakers asserted that the administration's decision to brand Iran and North Korea part of the "axis of evil" prompted those nations to speed up nuclear weapons research. 
Joseph Cirincione, a nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stood in the lobby looking pleased. "It's nice to hear progressives say: this thing is dead wrong and here's how we're going to change it," he said. "They're inviting you to be part of the process. To take back the country."
The first thing Democratic strategists appear to have snatched is the Republican playbook. In the 90's, when Democrats were wrestling with intractable policy issues from Haiti to Bosnia, Republican intellectuals built a formidable phalanx of not-for-profit policy centers that were heavily financed, media savvy, and full of bold, specific recommendations. While Democrats looked for answers, centers like the Heritage Foundation, a conservative institute on Capitol Hill, churned out reams of position papers and captured some of the debate. 
Mr. Podesta, the president of the Center for American Progress, said his new institute is determined to seize back some of that discussion -- and influence. "Our mission is to put before the American people new ideas and alternative strategies," he said in an interview.
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a Democratic contender for president, endeared himself to the crowd by accusing the administration of making the nation more insecure -- not less. 
The gloves were off. There was a sense that the administration is at last vulnerable.
Brett Lambert, a defense contractor, noticed the adjustments. Dozens of American flags -- more common at Republican functions -- met conference guests at every turn. 
"It's nice to see a flag associated with progressive causes," he said. "And it isn't upside down."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Europe is shooting itself in the foot, but not for the officially accepted reasons.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
WHAT is causing the slow economic growth and high unemployment in Europe? 
 When the Swedish people voted resoundingly last month against adopting the euro, the European single currency, some commentators took it as a sign that commitment to the European Union itself was weakening. If economies in Europe were growing rapidly, many say, the Swedes would not have hesitated. 
 But European economies will probably grow by only 0.5 percent this year on average, and unemployment is hovering around 8 or 9 percent. Here in France, all the talk is about cutting back social programs to keep the national deficit within 3 percent of its gross domestic product, as demanded by the European Union. 
Is Europe self-destructing? 
Probably not, but it seems at the least to be shooting itself in the foot -- and not for the reasons widely accepted in the United States. "There is an official view here of what is wrong with the economy," says the economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, who runs the influential Paris research center Observatoire Francais des Conjonctures Economique. "The official view is all about inflexible labor and product markets." That view is held by the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, and by many influential American observers. 
"But then there are the facts," Mr. Fitoussi continues. The facts are these, and they may surprise many Americans. By conventional measures, Europe is as productive as the United States. So the evidence does not readily support claims that the Continent is technologically behind. Exports from France and Germany, for example, are highly competitive with the rest of the world's and, unlike the United States, both countries export much more than they import.
Maybe more surprising to American observers, labor costs as a proportion of G.D.P. have been substantially reduced in Europe over the last 20 years. 
French wage costs, for example, fell nearly 11 percentage points, from 78.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1980 to 67.6 percent in 2000. Even German wage costs, which are widely recognized as high, stand at only 67.6 percent of G.D.P. By comparison, the American level fell only two percentage points, from 70.7 percent to 68.3 percent, the same as an average of 15 major European nations. 
A lot of restructuring that people are talking about has already occurred, says Pascal Petit, an economist at another research center in Paris, the Centre d'Etudes Prospective d'Economie Mathematique. Even temporary work is way up in France.
Instead, economists like Mr. Fitoussi and Mr. Petit argue that the high-interest-rate policy of the European Central Bank has been a major cause of slow growth and unemployment. Yet its impact is almost always treated as a minor influence in the public discourse both here and in America. Meantime, the loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan -- a policy Mr. Fitoussi and Mr. Petit can only dream about -- is given a lot of credit for America's boom. 
If Europeans are so intent on adopting the American economic model, why do they hesitate to adopt its monetary policy? "You have to look at the history," Mr. Petit says. "The Federal Reserve in America is required to pay attention to the level of employment. The European Central Bank is not." And he adds that when Europe's central bank was formed, in the mid-1990's, the tight policies of the seemingly infallible Bundesbank were especially popular. 
In addition, the budget reductions being forced on France by Europe's rules are further restraining growth at a time when the French economy may not be growing at all. It is exactly the wrong medicine, Mr. Fitoussi says. 
There may well be other causes of high unemployment. A group of economists meeting in Seville two weeks ago cast further doubts on the "official" view here. Led by representatives from the University of Utrecht and the University of Amsterdam, they do not deny that high or rigid labor costs may impede employment somewhat. 
But they find that the higher G.D.P. per capita in the United States overwhelms all other factors in accounting for unemployment in Europe. With a higher G.D.P. per capita, American consumers spend relatively more on labor-intensive services; their European counterparts spend more of their family budget on necessities like clothing and food, which require less labor. So, again, strategies that promote growth and raise G.D.P. per capita may be important in raising levels of employment. 
Clearly, this is a complex set of issues that yields no simple answers. Other policies may also be needed. Americans typically work more than Europeans, for example, so maybe the traditionally ample European welfare state is too comfortable and needs further streamlining. On the other hand, Americans may work many more hours, not because they want to, but because they must to meet rising health care and education costs -- more of which the state pays for in Europe. So America's much-vaunted standard of living may not be so much higher than Europe's. 
What is clear is that faster growth, however it comes, would work marvels in Europe. The welfare state would be more affordable because tax revenues would rise. Health care revenues are based on wages, so if they rise, the health care system would be easier to finance. As Europeans got richer, they might spend more on services that employ more people. 
But Mr. Fitoussi remains a pessimist. He says tight monetary and fiscal policies will remain in force.
Could such policies ultimately undermine the European Union? 
Genevieve Schmeder, an economist who teaches at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, shares the concerns, but insists the idea of a united Europe will remain popular. It was always a political idea first, and countries are still lining up to join. 
I am not so sure. Stubbornly self-defeating economic policies are now seriously testing the will of Europe. At the least, there will be some bumps along the road.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL; 
The N.B.A. Expands Its Game And Makes a House Call to Japan

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
There is something about Allen Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers guard, that gets Tadashi Togashi and his friends going. They like Iverson's up-tempo style, and how he finds a way to score even though he is often the shortest man on the court. It does not hurt that his team is a perennial playoff contender in the National Basketball Association.
 But more than anything, it is Iverson's style -- his hair, his clothes, his jewelry -- that inspires them. 
 "He's just so cool," said Togashi, a 19-year-old college student who wears baggy denim pants and a silver chain around his neck. Togashi even has a ring emblazoned with the initials W.W.J.D., "What Would Jesus Do?", because, he said, Iverson wears one like it.
The affection the Japanese have for Iverson and other stars, some might call it an affectation, is more proof that the N.B.A. is not so much a sport as an attitude and a brand in Japan. Although basketball is widely played in schools here, Japan has no professional league to spur interest. Baseball, soccer, sumo wrestling and even golf are far more popular. Yet to younger Japanese, a growing number of whom travel overseas, the N.B.A. speaks an entirely different language: the intangible code of style.
The Japanese are some of the biggest buyers of N.B.A. merchandise outside the United States, readily paying 8,500 yen ($75) for team jerseys, 3,800 yen ($35) for hats and 15,800 yen ($145) for satin jackets. Visits by N.B.A. teams, who have played regulation games here five times from 1990 to 1999, do much to generate interest, too.
Even without games in Japan in recent years, though, the N.B.A. brand has grown here. That is a testament to the sport's reach via television, global advertising campaigns and music videos. Dozens of magazines devoted to the sport have sprung up, including Hoop, Dunk, Shoot and Basketball Magazine Clinic. Some publications, like Woofin', feature hip-hop music and the latest street fashions from New York and Los Angeles.
Thanks to this media machine, sales of N.B.A. goods in Japan have tripled since 2000. Those sales will get another boost when the Seattle SuperSonics and the Los Angeles Clippers open their seasons here on Thursday.
The oddity is that the bulk of those people who buy the gear, including Togashi and his friends, seldom play basketball or follow the games on television. Like many imported fashions in Japan, the clothing is stripped of its original political or social meaning and worn only for appearance. People hanging out in trendy Tokyo neighborhoods like Shibuya and Harajuku mimic United States fashions down to the tiniest details and spend hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars on N.B.A. paraphernalia.
"The N.B.A. is for young culture, so the N.B.A. became the culture for young people in Japan," Hideki Hayashi, managing director of N.B.A. Japan Inc., said. "These kids don't know so much about the N.B.A., but they think the N.B.A. is a cool brand."
This fashion mania aside, there are plenty of fans who admire the N.B.A. for its speed, precision and athleticism. Takeo Cho, a 23-year-old university student, played basketball in high school forthree years after becoming interested in the sport through the popular comic book series Slam Dunk. He still reads several basketball magazines and has Kobe Bryant and Scottie Pippen jerseys and an Iverson T-shirt. "The games are speedy and fun to watch," Cho said. "There are no star players or great teams in Japan. The N.B.A. is the best in the world."
Although most high school gymnasiums must accommodate badminton, volleyball and other sports all at once, participation in basketball is growing. According to the Japan Basketball Association, 592,191 people played on registered teams in Japan last year, 18.5 percent more than in 2000, when statistics were first compiled.
There is even a Japan Basketball League, which includes company teams owned by Isuzu Motors, Matsushita Electric Industrial and other industrial powerhouses. When basketball's popularity peaked, around the time the Dream Team won the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, there was talk of turning the J.B.L. into a professional league. The tough economy and saturated advertising market, however, dampened those expectations, according to Eiji Takase, an editor at Basketball Magazine Clinic. 
By the time the J.B.L. started its Super League, the Japanese economy was already stagnant, he said, so hopes for a professional basketball league have disappeared as the advertisers pulled out.
Though basketball has little hope of having a professional league anytime soon here, there remain pockets of devoted fans who happily pay 18,000 yen ($165) for an N.B.A. League pass to watch more than 200 games on cable television in Japan. And thousands more are expected to turn out this week to see the N.B.A. live, a rare treat for die-hard fans. 
"I can see the players' superhuman abilities more frequently and clearly than in other sports," Teruoki Aoyagi, who runs a Web site for Clippers fans in Japan, said. "The level of entertainment is higher because of the players' super techniques."

+ means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.

Broadway

"THE BOY FROM OZ." Hugh Jackman's shoulders must ache like the devil when he wakes up in the morning. This able-bodied, infinitely appealing young man is spending most of his nights engaged in some painfully heavy lifting that no shoulders, no matter how broad, should be asked to attempt. That's what happens when you put an indisputably authentic star like Mr. Jackman at the center of an indisputably bogus show like "The Boy From Oz," the bathetic musical biography of the Australian entertainer and songwriter Peter Allen, directed by Philip Wm. McKinley. Were it not for Mr. Jackman, there would no reason to recommend this backstage, backstory look at show business, which makes the movie of "Valley of the Dolls" seem like "Children of Paradise." But let it be said that the electric Mr. Jackman, best known for the "X-Men" movies, never looks as if he's even thinking about shrugging this soggy cardboard world of a show off his shoulders (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $101.25 (Ben Brantley).

"GOLDA'S BALCONY." In October 1973 a 75-year-old woman who grew up in Milwaukee nearly started a nuclear holocaust. The woman, of course, was the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir; the occasion was the 1973 Middle East War. As a story it needs very little help from a dramatist or for that matter from a director, a designer, an actor or any other theatrically creative type. Moreover, the elements of the pure narrative are so colossally charged with tension and consequence that understatement is the way to go. "Golda's Balcony" doesn't go that way, however. It is not the story of a crucial moment in world history but a ponderous essay wrapped in melodramatic autobiography, acted with a soulless verve by Tovah Feldshuh and presented in a cheesily overwrought production directed by Scott Schwartz (1:30). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. No performance this Sunday at 3 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 8:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $76.25 (Bruce Weber).

+ "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS." In the desperate, tourist-courting world of cultural appropriation on Broadway -- which has given us stillborn aberrations like "Saturday Night Fever" -- this bland revival of the 1982 musical does not rank as a major offender. It is directed with silky efficiency by Jerry Zaks. Howard Ashman's droll, cliche-bending lyrics and book -- about a florist's nerdy assistant who befriends a people-eating plant -- remain in place, as does Alan Menken's gleeful 1960's-pastiche score. There is also an array of personable, professional young talent, headed by Hunter Foster, Kerry Butler and Douglas Sills. Yet the show has been stripped of the urban grit and parodic wit of the downtown production of 21 years ago. The overall effect is, if not exactly pleasurable, then pleasant. As an exercise in recycling, this "Little Shop" suggests the conversion of sharp, shiny tin into something closer to Teflon (2:00). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $56 to $96 (Brantley).

"THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW." Brrr. An early, unforgiving and highly symbolic wintriness hangs over this domestic drama by William Nicholson. And for this weary study of the death of a marriage, which stars Eileen Atkins and John Lithgow, the designer John Lee Beatty has devised a whopping scenic metaphor: the walls and screens of the set have been garlanded with patterns of bleak, bare branches. It's not only the trees that are skeletal in this stark production, directed rather listessly by Daniel Sullivan. From the opening scene of the play, which is strewn with poetic quotations and historic allusions, the characters show few of the signs of organic life that warm a theatergoer's hopes. Despite the participation of the estimable Dame Eileen and Mr. Lithgow as the disaffected spouses and Ben Chaplin as their son, the overall effect is of three talented performers trying to keep afloat in flat dishwater (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $81.25 (Brantley).

Off Broadway

*+ "BECKETT/ALBEE." When Brian Murray and Marian Seldes get together in a play by Edward Albee, they seem to levitate like Astaire and Rogers. The easy elegance, the polished technique, the playfulness and the passion have been buffed to a high gloss in "Counting the Ways," Mr. Albee's blithely serious portrait of a marriage. Mr. Murray and Ms. Seldes perform a funny, deliberately stylized pas de deux that suggests a melding of Noel Coward and Samuel Beckett. In the show's first half, they take on Beckett himself in three short plays ("Not I," "A Piece of Monologue" and "Footfalls"). And it should be noted that they don't wear Beckett's tatters with quite the same assurance that they wear Albee's party clothes. But the evening offers a fascinating counterpoint of two playwrights of shared sensibility and contrasting styles (1:30). Century Center, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $65, with a limited number of $20 student tickets at the box office on the day of performance (Brantley).

* "THE HARLEQUIN STUDIES." Bill Irwin's sweet, silly and sharp-witted anatomy of the clown figure from commedia dell'arte suggests that every comic working today should call the long-lived Harlequin "Papa." Mr. Irwin and a nimble ensemble of actors-cum-acrobats spring out of trunks, fall from the skies and are improbably packed into small suitcases, evoking everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Jim Carrey along the way. The show, which begins a season of Mr. Irwin's work from the Signature Theater Company, may not be the most accomplished work to date from its creator, the inspired silent clown of "The Regard of Flight" and "Fool Moon." But there is an endearing openness and generosity about the production, which features Rocco Sisto and Paxton Whitehead as well as five younger clowns in training. And in an anarchic and uncertain world, Mr. Irwin confidently locates a special, enduring kind of anarchy that pulls form out of chaos (1:15). Signature Theater's Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, (212) 244-7529. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).

* "IRON." Lisa Emery packs a lot into a single pair of eyes. Playing an imprisoned murderer in Rona Munro's unnerving new drama, Ms. Emery looks upon a shrunken world with a gaze that overflows with contradictions. Hungry and hypnotic, fearful and cunning, submissive and angry -- Ms. Emery's eyes could be described as all this at almost any given moment. Such hard, focused ambivalence matches the sensibility from which "Iron" is forged. This story of a reunion between a prisoner and her daughter (Jennifer Dundas) at first seems formulaic. But as directed by Anna D. Shapiro, it never lets its audience settle into clear or comfortable responses. Ms. Dundas expertly captures shifting filial uncertainties, while as the raw, needy prisoner, Ms. Emery delivers what may be the finest performance of her career (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $47 (Brantley).

+ "THE NIGHT HERON." Deception, betrayal and assorted acts of violence are enlisted in the pursuit of poetry, of all things, in this new offering from the exciting young playwright Jez (Mojo) Butterworth. Set in a shack in the Cambridgeshire Fens, the play follows the self-sabotaging attempts of two unemployed gardeners (Chris Bauer and Clark Gregg) and an ex-convict (Mary McCann) to win a cash prize for best poem. At the same time, they are searching for rhyme and reason in a brutal, random universe. That their chances of succeeding are heartbreakingly slim doesn't keep them from being a very entertaining set of losers. Directed by Neil Pepe, the production is stronger on comic surface than tragic depths, and the play ultimately chokes on its own ambitions. But it offers a bracing testament to the strength and originality of Mr. Butterworth's theatrical imagination (2:20). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45, with a limited number of $10 student rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance (Brantley).

"STRICTLY ACADEMIC." In this evening of two sardonic one-acts, the playwright A. R. Gurney takes aim at a couple of favorite targets, academia and the theater. The opening playlet, "The Problem," is a shrewd bit of camp about the sex life of a mathematics professor (Keith Reddin) and his wife (Susan Greenhill). It's a slight piece but deftly handled all around, and it gently makes a savage point about academics who live only in their minds and not in the world. In the concluding play, "The Guest Lecturer," Mr. Gurney has the same mischief in his heart but bigger things in mind. This time the setting is a nonprofit theater, and it focuses on the poor shnook of an academic who comes to speak to the subscribers on the subject of drama in America, only to find himself as entertainment of an entirely different sort. In the end it doesn't quite work, but in intertwining slapstick black comedy and an essayistic argument on behalf of the theater as a force for good in the world, Mr. Gurney does achieve something interesting and rare: a passionate cri de coeur delivered with a smile (1:30). Primary Stages, 354 West 45th Street, (212) 333-4052. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $48 (Weber).

*+ "THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN." Attributed to Shakespeare and John Fletcher, this tonally ambiguous tale of the travails of love and loyalty contains, as Harold Bloom has written with the roll of a historical drum, "the final writing of any sort by the author of 'Hamlet' and 'King Lear.' " It's hardly ever presented, and the rarity of its appearance is in itself a pretty good reason to pay a visit to the New York Shakespeare Festival's first production of it. Another reason is that this strange, tonally ambiguous amalgam of comic plot and tragic lamentation, as directed by Darko Tresnjak, is enthralling. And though novelty is undoubtedly part of the show's appeal, Mr. Tresnjak's confident production overcomes some occasional heavy-handedness and some uncertain acting to find the genuinelypungent melancholy in this story of love -- all kinds of love -- that bears bitter fruit (2:30). Martinson Hall in the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50, with a limited number of $20 student tickets available at the box office (Brantley).

Last Chance

+ "BOLD GIRLS." The women of Rona Munro's prize-winning 1990 play live in war-torn Belfast, where a typical day includes gunfire, British soldiers, piles of laundry and trying to slip past roadblocks to go to a nightclub. Their husbands and fathers are dead or in prison. Every day also includes their effort to balance family loyalty against honesty and hidden impulses as dangerous as any gunshot. The four actors (Susan Barrett, Heidi James, Paula Ewin and Moira MacDonald) give rich, full-bodied performances. Ludovica Villar-Hauser directs with an alert eye and a steady hand. What a pleasure that this work is being revived, especially when there are still too few complex female characters onstage (2:00). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, (212) 868-4444. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8. Tickets: $35 (Margo Jefferson).

"LIVING OUT." Lisa Loomer's play tries hard to apply the conventions of the 30-minute sitcom to a two-hour play with serious intentions. The situation is knotty, complicated and all too familiar. Ana Hernandez (Zilah Mendoza), a young Latina in Los Angeles, is a nanny for Nancy Robin (Kathryn Meisle), a young Anglo lawyer. Social and emotional complications pile up. The time Ana spends with Nancy's daughter means she has scant time for her own son. Nancy starts to fear she knows less about her own child than Ana does. The two women are forced into a kind of intimacy, but class and nationality impose a still greater distance. Ms. Loomer has an eye for the topical and an ear for laugh lines. The production, directed by Jo Bonney, is sleek and moves quickly. But when more depth is required, the writing fails and the direction falters (2:15). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55, with a limited number of $10 student rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance (Jefferson).

HEADLINE: TV WEEKEND; 
All in the (Rich, Dysfunctional) Family

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
"Arrested Development," a sharply satirical comedy on Fox, is most easily likened to the 2001 film "The Royal Tenenbaums," and that is unfair to Fox. This sitcom does borrow some of Wes Anderson's touches from the film -- absurdist biographical portraits and whimsical non sequiturs -- but it discards the highbrow preciousness.
 The Bluth heirs are eccentric and warped, but they are not hothouse child prodigies like the Tenenbaum siblings. They are nouveau riche misfits, the Ewings of "Dallas" as seen by Bunuel. And they are quite amusing. 
 The first episode, on Sunday night, opens on a yacht, chartered for the retirement party of the family patriarch, George Bluth, founder of a louche development company in Orange County, Calif. Michael (Jason Bateman), the one relatively normal and reliable son, is expecting to be named chief executive at long last. As the Champagne begins to flow, his mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), an imperious socialite, looms in front of Michael and declares, "Look at what the homosexuals have done to me." He replies mildly, "Can't you comb it out and reset it?"
Actually she was referring to chanting gay activists on a nearby boat protesting discrimination at the yacht club.
The feds prove even more disruptive. Almost as soon as George announces his decision to appoint Lucille his successor, the police board the yacht and arrest George on fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Like "Malcolm in the Middle," the Fox sitcom that precedes it, "Arrested Development" has no laugh track and was filmed with a single camera, a cinematic technique that has not really worked well in recent years for any other half-hour comedy except "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Scrubs." (Most such shows quickly vanish, including "Watching Ellie," a recent Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy.) But the approach lends "Arrested Development" the dry, deadpan tone needed to pull off its offbeat satire.
The humor lies in balancing the characters' loopiness with sly, satisfying digs at the rich. And occasionally, the rich and famous: beginning on Nov. 23, Liza Minnelli will make a guest appearance playing Lucille's archrival in a multi-episode subplot.
Michael's twin sister, Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), is a spendthrift social climber who uses company money to finance her swanky fund-raisers, including a black-tie party for an anti-circumcision group that earns her the ire of the Jewish Defense League. She is married to Tobias Funke, an unemployed former psychiatrist and doctor. (He lost his license giving CPR to a stranger who didn't need it.) Tobias is played by David Cross, a stand-up comic, who brings a special, soft weirdness to Tobias that keeps him from becoming a cliche.
Jeffrey Tambor, who oozed imbecilic pomposity as the talk-show sidekick on "The Larry Sanders Show," plays another variation on that genre as the paterfamilias, a stately con man who is not very bright. He is gloriously funny in the part, and well matched by Ms. Walter, glittering with malice and self-absorption as his wife.
George Oscar Bluth II (Will Arnett), the eldest son, is a parasite and would-be magician. The youngest brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is perhaps the oddest of all. Still timidly attached to his mother and prone to panic attacks, Buster is unfit for real work and instead enrolls in graduate courses on things like cartography.
In a contentious family meeting, Lucille wants to put Buster in charge of the company instead of Michael, saying Buster is qualified because he once took a business course. "It was 18th-century agrarian business," Buster stammers, "but I suppose the same principles apply." He pauses. "Are you at all concerned about an uprising?"
Michael, a widower with a sweet but ungainly 13-year-old son, George Michael (Michael Cera), is the sane one, struggling to steer the company away from his egomaniacal, unruly relatives and into some kind of fiscal order. Just when the family enmity and eccentricity seem a little too cute and contrived, the show shifts gears, and the Bluths show a glimmer of normal humanity: they make one another laugh, or at least understand one another's jokes.
The me-and-my-nutty-family formula has worked well, as "Everybody Loves Raymond" still attests. But Mitchell Hurwitz, the creator of "Arrested Development," tried a similar scenario in "Everything's Relative," a 1999 NBC sitcom about a sane comedy writer and his mad family. (Mr. Tambor played the father.) It was canceled after three episodes.
"Arrested Development" has a better shot, partly because viewers have developed more of a taste for tart, even bitter humor on television, and partly because it is set on a broader comic canvas. And it follows "Malcolm in the Middle," a popular show that offers a kinder but not that much gentler skewering of the American family.

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Leader Campaigns, With a Stop in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Trailing in polls for the presidential elections in March, President Chen Shui-bian has stepped up his appeals to Taiwanese separatism but has drawn little reaction so far from Beijing.
 By calling for a national referendum on three touchy issues, to be followed by a redrafting of the Constitution starting in 2006, Mr. Chen appears to have narrowed somewhat the gap by which he trails a rival ticket that unites the fractious political opposition. But his own party's polls still show him behind by a bit, while polls by newspapers, most of which lean politically toward the opposition, have found him behind by as much as 15 points. 
 China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since 1949, when the Communists prevailed on the mainland in China's civil war. 
In a written response in English on Thursday to questions submitted last week, Mr. Chen strongly emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty, but he did so without suggesting a substantive change in Taiwan's policy toward the mainland.
"As an independent sovereign country, Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China, nor is it a part of any other country," he said. He avoided saying directly that Taiwan was independent of the mainland, a phrasing that would upset officials in Beijing.
While Chinese newspapers constantly criticize Taiwan, Chinese leaders have kept largely silent in the early stages of the campaign here. Previous attempts to intimidate Taiwan, most notably by firing missiles into its shipping lanes in 1996, have backfired by building support for Democratic Progressive Party politicians like Mr. Chen while hurting the opposition Nationalist Party, which favors an eventual political reunification.
Mr. Chen is to arrive in New York on Friday, where he will accept a human rights award. 
He has sometimes made headlines with subtle changes in his oratory that could be interpreted as a tilt toward a declaration of independence from the mainland. But senior Taiwanese officials said in interviews here this week that no such comments were likely in New York.
Mr. Chen acknowledged the growing cooperation on diplomatic issues, although not economic issues, between Washington and Beijing.
"The U.S. needs China's accommodation on the issues of antiterrorism and North Korea's nuclear weapons," he wrote. "As long as the U.S. continues to support Taiwan and strengthen substantive relations with Taiwan during its exchanges with China, our government does not oppose improved relations between the U.S. and China."
Mr. Chen wants to hold a national referendum close to the March elections on nuclear power policy, the size of the legislature and Taiwan's efforts to join the World Health Organization. While none of these issues bears directly on Taiwanese separatism, holding a referendum at all could set a precedent on whether to amend the Constitution to include separatist provisions.

HEADLINE: Economic Memo; 
In Big Picture, Winter Misery Faded Quickly

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
This is the autumn of our content.
 Profits are soaring, the economy is expanding at its fastest rate in nearly two decades and there are signs that businesses are finally beginning to hire. 
 All that is in sharp contrast to the outlook just last winter. In February, share prices were falling, the economy was stumbling along at a growth rate of 1.4 percent and the talk among many seers was of the failure of cuts in taxes and interest rates to rescue the economy. Some feared the possibility of Japan-style deflation. 
Deflation is largely forgotten now, but the Federal Reserve is not ready to worry about inflation. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 31 percent from the March low, and now the economy is reported to have grown at a 7.2 percent annual pace in the third quarter. 
Broadly, we now have the story of the economy for the last two years. Monetary and fiscal policies were extraordinarily stimulative, and consumers responded by buying. Home sales boomed. But businesses, depressed by the bursting of the bubble and stuck with excessive inventories and far too much capacity, hunkered down.
Early this year, the deflation talk helped to increase caution, and there was worry about what would happen as a result of war in Iraq. Would oil prices soar? Would there be new terrorist attacks in the United States? Consumer spending slowed and layoffs accelerated.
The Iraq war has brought attacks on Americans, but in Baghdad rather than Boston. Oil prices, which neared $40 a barrel in late February shortly before the war began, are now back below $30. And this year's tax-cut checks -- sent to millions of parents during the summer -- were spent in the back-to-school shopping season.
The gross domestic product report showed that over the last six months, final sales to domestic purchasers rose at a 5.9 percent annual rate, well above the pace of late 1999, when growth was peaking.
Businesses were broadly unprepared for the recovery. The government guesses that inventories fell during the quarter, but there is a good chance that it is underestimating the decline. If so, the third-quarter growth rate will be revised down, but the needed inventory restocking will lift fourth-quarter growth.
Then what? Economic bears point to new layoff announcements at Sony and Electronic Data Systems and predict consumer spending will slow without new tax rebates, leaving retailers with a disappointing Christmas.
The alternative forecast is for a self-sustaining recovery that is already under way. "You've got supercharged monetary stimulus and a tax cut," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. "Look at history. When you get a lot of stimulus and a 7 percent quarter, it does not go away quickly."
If he's right, there will be reason for celebration in the White House. It could even turn out that the difference between the two Presidents Bush was a matter of timing as much as anything else.
The 1990-91 recession ended in February 1991. Almost two years later, in January 1993, came the report of the first quarter to show growth above 5 percent. The 2001 recession ended in November 2001, and once again a report of a good quarter arrived nearly two years later.
Unfortunately for George H. W. Bush, he had lost his race for re-election before the economic news turned positive. Now, strong growth has appeared a year before the 2004 election. George W. Bush had good reason to call yesterday's growth report "encouraging."

HEADLINE: Treasury Loosens Pressure on China Over Exchange Rate 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who has been pressuring China for two months to permit its currency to float more freely against the dollar, adopted a conciliatory tone on Thursday, saying neither China nor any other country was manipulating its exchange rate.
 In a long-awaited report delivered to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Snow pleaded for a continuation of "financial diplomacy" and rebuffed lawmakers in both parties who want to impose retaliatory tariffs on China if it refuses to let its currency rise in value against the dollar. 
 "I think we've really got their attention," Mr. Snow said. "I think the financial diplomacy here of the sort that we are engaged in is the surest course to get the result we want." 
 But Republican and Democratic senators complained that the Bush administration had painted too rosy a picture. They said China and other Asian countries had intervened heavily in financial markets to keep their currencies cheap and give their products an unfair trade advantage.
 China's exchange rates have become an explosive political issue in the last year. American manufacturers have angrily complained that the Chinese yuan is artificially undervalued by about 40 percent, giving Chinese exports to the United States an unfair trade advantage over American products.
 A cheaper currency makes a nation's products less expensive in other countries. China has kept the value of the yuan locked at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar since 1994.
 Chinese imports, like clothing, toys and consumer electronics, have been flooding into the United States for several years. Last year, America's trade deficit with China reached $105 billion -- bigger than the trade deficit with Japan or the European Union.
 Administration officials have been openly alarmed about the political consequences of that deficit.
 American manufacturing companies have cut more than two million jobs in the last three years, and many companies have either started buying products from Chinese producers or begun moving their factories to China.
 Mr. Snow began turning up the heat on China and other Asian countries in September. With support from European leaders, Mr. Snow persuaded the Group of 7 industrialized countries to explicitly endorse more flexible exchange rates -- a direct signal to China as well as Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
 Other administration officials have stepped up criticism of China's trade practices. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, on a trip to China this week, bluntly warned that leaders in Beijing were moving "far too slowly" toward an open market economy.
 "Our patience is wearing thin," Mr. Evans said.
 But Treasury officials do not want to force China into an overnight shift in policy, worrying that such a move could hurt American companies that import low-cost Chinese goods and could also wreak havoc with China's troubled banking system.
The upshot has been an often contradictory approach in which officials berate China on one day and then try gentle persuasion the next.
 In its report on Thursday, the Treasury Department acknowledged that China maintains a fixed exchange rate, and it said China should move as quickly as possible to base its exchange rates more on the market. But it said that neither China nor any other countries were technically manipulating their currencies.
 "A currency peg or intervention does not in and of itself satisfy the statutory test" for constituting "manipulation," the report said.
 That conclusion, though not unexpected, received a frosty reception from both Republicans and Democrats. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, displayed charts showing that China alone had bought $111 billion in foreign reserves in the last year, a move that many economists say was intended to keep the value of its currency from rising.
 Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, said she was "disappointed that this Treasury report fails to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem."
 Senator Dole is among several lawmakers pushing for legislation that would impose stiff tariffs on Chinese imports into the United States that would be comparable to the amount that its currency was deemed to be artificially undervalued.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, asserted that the Treasury Department's report was a whitewash that failed to acknowledge China's well-documented efforts to keep its exchange rate from rising. 
 "It treats China with kid gloves when it should be taking the gloves off," Mr. Schumer said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Close Mixed in Response to Reports on Economy

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street had a mixed session yesterday as investors applauded a surprisingly strong third-quarter gross domestic product report but nonetheless worried that the increase could not be sustained.
 Analysts said the G.D.P. report did not have more of a market impact because it reflected past economic performance, and investors were not certain future growth would be as robust. Disappointing earnings from Exxon Mobil also weighed on shares. 
"The sustainability is the biggest question," said Brian G. Belski, fundamental market strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The question is, What is the current G.D.P. and what will the growth be over the next three quarters?"
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 12.08 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,786.61, after a three-day gain of 192 points. Earlier in the day, the blue-chip average advanced as much as 64 points and lost as much as 20 points.
 The broader market declined modestly. The Nasdaq composite index lost 3.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,932.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,046.94.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the gross domestic product grew at a 7.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. It was the strongest pace since the first quarter of 1984; it also beat analysts' estimates for a 6 percent growth rate.
 The Labor Department reported that new jobless claims last week declined 5,000, to 386,000, signaling a slowdown in layoffs.
 "Certainly, the G.D.P. number was good, and the market celebrated that," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "But no one expects this number to continue at this rate, and they do expect the numbers" to be revised lower eventually, he said.
 Stocks have climbed since mid-March on investor expectations of a strong economic rebound. While gains have been more modest in recent weeks, analysts say investors are still looking for reasons to buy despite some concerns that stock prices might be too high.
 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia rose 41 cents, to $10.40, after reporting a quarterly loss that was narrower than analysts' predictions.
 Akamai Technologies jumped $2.04, or 34.2 percent, to $8, after posting a quarterly loss that was smaller than analysts' predictions.
 Losers included Exxon Mobil, which fell $1.51, to $36.30, on third-quarter earnings that missed analysts' estimates.
 Aetna declined $2.49, to $56.30, after its quarterly profits came in higher than Wall Street's projections.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 7 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was moderate.

Bond Prices Fall
By Reuters
 Treasury prices softened yesterday on news that the economy grew at its fastest rate in nearly two decades, stoking anxiety that interest rates could rise sooner than expected. The economy grew at a 7.2 percent annual rate from July to September, the Commerce Department said, denting the allure of low-risk, low-return government debt.
 By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note lost 13/32, to 99 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 4.35 percent from 4.30 percent. And the 30-year bond was down 11/32, to 102 18/32. Its yield rose to 5.20 percent from 5.18 percent.

HEADLINE: North Korea Agrees to Nuclear Talks, China Says 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
North Korea said Thursday that it was ready to enter a new round of negotiations about its nuclear weapons program with the United States, China and other countries in the region. The announcement suggests that President Bush's offer last week to discuss a security guarantee may have been enough to revive the on-again, off-again dialogue with North Korea.
 North Korea agreed "in principle" to new talks, according to Chinese Central Television's main news broadcast, which announced the results of a two-day visit to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, by a top-level Chinese delegation. 
 After Thursday's announcement by the Chinese, the official North Korean news agency issued a more qualified endorsement of talks, expressing a willingness to take part "if they provide a process of putting into practice the proposal for a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions." 
The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Thursday that the Bush administration was "encouraged by the reports we have seen that North Korea has agreed in principle" to continue the regional talks. 
Chinese television showed Wu Bangguo, China's parliamentary leader and the second-highest ranking official in the Communist Party, meeting with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, during his visit. Mr. Wu was thought to have made the trip to North Korea only after the Chinese received signals that the North Koreans were ready to resume negotiations, and Thursday's announcement appears to confirm China's confidence that the talks will resume despite having made scant progress during two previous rounds.
"Both sides agreed in principle that the six-way talks should continue," the lead anchor said at the top of the Chinese broadcast. "China and North Korea support the idea of a peaceful resolution to the North Korean issue through dialogue."
North Korean officials and the state-controlled news media often make conflicting statements about the country's intentions to negotiate with the United States and other parties, sometimes taking stances that pointedly contradict positions put forward days or even hours earlier.
North Korea could well backtrack once again, particularly if it finds the terms of a new round of negotiations unfavorable.
But China's prominent announcement of the agreement suggests that Beijing has a high degree of confidence in North Korea's intentions. Though relations between China and North Korea are strained, China still has the most economic and political leverage over North Korea.
President Bush started the latest round of diplomacy during an Asian visit earlier this month, when he outlined a new approach to handling the North Korean crisis. Mr. Bush indicated for the first time that the United States was prepared to offer North Korea a written security guarantee that would probably also be signed by other participants in the six-party talks: China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.
Mr. Bush ruled out signing a nonaggression treaty, which has been a longstanding North Korean demand, and North Korea initially dismissed his offer of a security assurance that fell short of a treaty as "laughable."
But that position changed late last week, when North Korean officials issued a revised statement promising to consider the offer.
North Korea has previously said that it will give up its nuclear weapons program over time if it receives a variety of benefits, including aid for its depressed economy, the construction of a nuclear power plant and a nonaggression pact.
The Bush administration refused to negotiate terms with North Korea unless it unilaterally dismantled its nuclear program first, saying that the country had violated an earlier agreement with the Clinton administration when it admitted working to reprocess spent nuclear fuel rods to make nuclear bombs last year.
Mr. Bush's new offer of a security guarantee suggests that the United States has softened its negotiating position and is prepared to offer some benefits to North Korea even before its weapons program is verifiably ended. But North Korea is known for aggressive and often mercurial negotiating tactics and may well end up demanding more than the Bush administration is prepared to deliver.
Some administration officials and conservative supporters argue that North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear arms and that the only solution to the crisis is regime change. But the Chinese have so far successfully prevailed on the Bush administration to keep the diplomatic option alive.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Bush Got $500,000 From Companies That Got Contracts, Study Finds

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Executives, employees and political action committees of the 70 companies that received government contracts for work in either Iraq or Afghanistan contributed slightly more than $500,000 to President Bush's 2000 election campaign, according to a comprehensive study of the contracts released on Tuesday.
 The overwhelming majority of government contracts for billions of dollars of reconstruction work in Iraq and Afghanistan went to companies run by executives who were heavy political contributors to both political parties. 
 Though the employees contributed to both parties, their giving favored Republicans by a two-to-one margin. And they gave more money to Mr. Bush than any other politician in the last 12 years. 
Among the biggest contributions to Mr. Bush's election and re-election efforts were those from executives and employees of Dell Computer at $113,000; of Bearing Point, a business consulting firm, at $119,000; of General Electric at $72,000 and of Halliburton Inc. at $28,000, according to the report.
Nine of the 10 biggest contractors -- the biggest of which were Bechtel Corporation and Halliburton, either employed former senior government officials or had close ties to government agencies and to Congress.
Prepared by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group, the report said the contractors' executives and employees had contributed $49 million to political candidates and parties since 1990.
The new report is the first comprehensive independent study of companies involved in Iraqi reconstruction, and it provides evidence that the process for handing out big contracts has often been secretive, chaotic and favorable to companies with good political contacts.
The report is the result of a six-month investigation, which included obtaining information on 70 contracts through the Freedom of Information Act. 
The report confirms that many if not most of the contracts handed out for work in Iraq were awarded through a process that was inscrutable to outsiders and often without competitive bidding.
One consultant, given a four-month contract to advise Iraqi government agencies, was the husband of Carol Haave, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for security and information operations. A Pentagon spokesman said that Ms. Haave did not see this as a conflict of interest, according to Bloomberg News.
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, told reporters on Thursday that "the reason that these companies get the contracts has nothing to do with who may have worked there before."
He added: "The decisions are made by career procurement officials. There's a separation, a wall, between them and political-level questions when they're doing the contracts." 
One of the report's most basic conclusions is that neither the Pentagon nor the State Department or the Agency for International Development were eager to provide comprehensive or accurate information about contracts that total about $8 billion over the past two years.
Ellen Yount, the spokeswoman for the Agency for International Development, disputed that claim and said her office had cooperated with the center and that requests for proposals for Iraq contracts had been publicly available on the agency's Web site for more than six months. "I found the report sloppy and inaccurate in many instances," she said.
Political questions have dogged the administration over the awarding of lucrative contracts since the war began. Initially, administration officials restricted bidding to a select group of companies and expedited the awarding of the contracts, saying that they needed to be prepared to rebuild the country as soon as the war ended.
Congress is set to approve an additional $20 billion for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan this week, much of it going to these companies.
Although the size of the initial contracts was relatively small, the winning companies gained a huge advantage over competitors with an early presence in Iraq.
One case examined by Congress was the Army Corps of Engineers' awarding of a contract without competition to Kellogg, Brown & Root, a Halliburton subsidiary, to fight oil well fires in Iraq. 
Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 to 2000. The White House said it had no involvement in that or any other of the contracts that were awarded for reconstruction.

HEADLINE: White House Takes Credit For Surge In Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
The White House claimed credit on Thursday for the surge in economic growth, saying the tax cuts championed by President Bush had helped the nation overcome recession and the economic effects of the terrorist attacks, two wars and corporate scandals.
 The news that the economy had expanded in the third quarter at a 7.2 percent annual rate -- the best performance since 1984 -- gave Mr. Bush and his party a compelling piece of evidence to back their assertions that they have put the nation back on the road to prosperity a year before Election Day. 
 "The tax relief we passed is working," Mr. Bush said to whoops of approval from several hundred workers during a speech at an aluminum processing plant here. 
Continuing his strategy of never suggesting he is satisfied with the economy, Mr. Bush said the good news was only a starting point for his efforts to bring down the unemployment rate.
"We're making progress," the president said earlier at a fund-raiser here for his re-election campaign. "But we will not stop until there are jobs aplenty for those looking for work."
Continued success, he said, required enactment of the rest of his agenda, including making permanent elements of his tax cuts that will otherwise expire and passing energy legislation that would promote domestic oil and gas production. 
In a shot at the nine Democratic presidential contenders, all of whom have called for rolling back some or all of his tax cuts, Mr. Bush suggested that they would derail the recovery as it is gathering steam.
"Just as the economy is coming around, some over in Washington say now is the time to raise taxes," Mr. Bush said. "I strongly disagree. Tax relief put this nation on the right path, and I intend to keep America on the path to prosperity."
Faced with the prospect that the strong growth figure would undermine their campaign theme that Mr. Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert Hoover, Democrats sought to focus attention on what they said were two of the administration's greatest political vulnerabilities.
One, they said, is that the upturn in economic activity has not yet translated into new jobs to offset those lost since Mr. Bush took office. Depending on what measure is used, the economy has shed 2.6 million to more than 3 million jobs since January 2001. 
The other point, Democrats said, is that the surge in growth was a result of an unsustainable tax-cutting binge that mostly benefited the wealthy and drove the budget deficit to levels that will bedevil the nation for decades. Persistent large deficits, Democrats said, could undermine the expansion down the road by forcing interest rates higher and limit the nation's ability to address long-range problems like those with Social Security and Medicare.
"We've lost more than three million jobs, three million people have fallen into poverty, the budget deficit and national debt are growing, health care and college tuition costs are escalating," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one of the Democratic presidential candidates. "And this president still has no real plan to sustain this growth, translate it into jobs and rebuild a strong middle class." 
Concerned about raising expectations that the third-quarter growth rate could be sustained, Mr. Bush's aides said they expected the economy to cool but to continue expanding at a pace that will lead employers to begin hiring again.
"It would be unrealistic to assume that 7.2 percent growth will continue," said N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, "but we certainly expect growth to continue at a robust pace going forward." 
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has already said this month that he expected job growth of about 200,000 a month over the next year. Economists say that is about the level needed to begin pushing the unemployment rate down from its current level of 6.1 percent. In September, the economy added 57,000 jobs, the first gain in nine months. 
In a statement on Thursday, the White House said that without Mr. Bush's tax cuts "as many as 1.5 million additional Americans could have lost their jobs."
Strategists in both parties said specific month-by-month unemployment and job creation figures would be less important in political terms than the trend in employment over the next year. If the economy shows steady job growth as the presidential campaign heats up, they said, Mr. Bush will be less vulnerable to Democratic attacks even if the job gains between now and Election Day do not offset those already lost.
The political challenge facing Mr. Bush on the economy is particularly intense in states like Ohio. Mr. Bush won the state in 2000. But like other industrial states it has suffered during his presidency from substantial job losses, especially in manufacturing. In the last year alone, Ohio has lost nearly 67,000 nonfarm jobs, a decline of 1.2 percent, and it lost 22,000 from August to September alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Bush raised $1.4 million at the fund-raiser in Columbus, then flew on to San Antonio for another fund-raiser, which campaign aides said was expected to bring in $1.2 million.

HEADLINE: Senate Defeats Climate Bill, but Proponents See Silver Lining 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE and ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
The Senate defeated a bill on Thursday to combat global warming by restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. 
 The 55-to-43 vote was the Senate's first vote on such a bill, and proponents said it had won a surprising amount of support, signaling that the concept of a policy on global warming has gained traction. 
 The measure's opponents, meanwhile, hailed the defeat, saying it was a vindication of their view that the bill would harm the economy and drive companies overseas. 
Six Republicans joined Democrats in backing the measure, breaking ranks with the Bush administration, which opposes mandatory controls. 
The bill's sponsors, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said the vote was a first step in an inevitable move toward reducing the human contribution to global warming.
"We will be back on this issue just like we were back on the issue of campaign finance reform," Mr. McCain said in the Senate debate.
The Republican senators backing the bill were Mr. McCain, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. 
The vote was the first time the Senate has taken up specific legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. In 1997, just before the talks that eventually led to the international climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol, senators passed a resolution to reject any treaty that significantly harmed the American economy or that failed to include third-world countries. The protocol, which was rejected by President Bush in 2001, did exempt developing countries.
Thursday's vote, supporters of the bill said, reflected a growing concern among voters about global warming. Recent polls, including one by The New York Times, show that Americans strongly support actions to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases.
In the poll, conducted Sept. 15 and 16, 66 percent of the 675 adults surveyed said they knew at least something about global warming. More than 80 percent supported higher mileage standards for cars and trucks as a way to cut climate and pollution risks, and 69 percent said they would support such standards even if it meant paying more for a car. 
Attitudes about higher prices for gasoline or other fuels, however, were mixed. When asked if they would be willing to pay an extra 25 cents a gallon for gasoline to reduce pollution and global warming, 50 percent of those familiar with the issue said no, while 46 percent said yes. 
Opponents of the bill said the support it had received meant little, because the senators were aware that the bill would never win approval in the House. Many voted for it only because doing so allowed them to gain points with environmentalists while avoiding true political costs, the opponents said.
"In actuality," said Scott Segal, executive director of the Electric Reliability Coordination Council, a coalition of six major power companies, "the vote shows that most senators are extremely reluctant to potentially handicap the U.S. economy and energy production."
The backers of the bill argued that not taking action to slow global warming would also have severe economic consequences. In the debate, Senator Daniel Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, and Senator Snowe, of Maine, said that rising sea levels and increasing temperatures would hurt agriculture and tourism in their states.
The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, accounts for 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.
The bill would have required that companies restrict carbon dioxide emissions so that they will be no higher in 2010 than they were in 2000. Homes, farms and small businesses would have been exempt.
The proposal was far more modest than the Kyoto Protocol, which called for a 7 percent reduction in emissions in the United States from 1990 levels by 2010. The protocol also included a second phase that was to begin in 2016. 
Mr. McCain and Mr. Lieberman modeled the bill after acid rain programs that were included in 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.

HEADLINE: Dean Walks a Tightrope Over Positions on Gun Control 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JODI WILGOREN; Adam Nagourney reported for this article from Nashua, N.H., and Jodi Wilgoren from Burlington, Vt.

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Back when Howard Dean was running for governor of Vermont in 1992, he told the National Rifle Association in a signed questionnaire that he opposed any restrictions on private ownership of assault weapons.
 These days, running for the Democratic presidential nomination and appealing to a very different electorate from that of his small, largely rural state, Dr. Dean assures audiences that he firmly supports the assault weapons ban enacted under President Bill Clinton in 1994 though vigorously opposing any further federal regulation of guns. 
 Dr. Dean declined a request for an interview on Thursday. But a spokeswoman said there was no contradiction between his current position and what he told the N.R.A. in its 1992 questionnaire, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by aides to a rival Democratic candidate who is a stronger advocate of gun control. 
The spokeswoman, Tricia Enright, said Dr. Dean's answers 11 years ago applied only to a state ban, though in fact the question at issue specifically referred to both federal and state law. Ms. Enright also pointed out that the question defined assault weapons in a way that encompassed semiautomatic rifles and shotguns commonly used by hunters in Vermont, while the federal ban applied to 19 specific weapons typically used in street violence.
But Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., said the guns banned by the 1994 law "weren't that much different from firearms that are used in hunting and competition." Mr. Arulanandam accused Dr. Dean of "schizophrenia," saying he had taken positions friendly to the rifle association as governor but had changed since becoming a candidate for president.
This turn of events captures the difficulty that gun control poses for Dr. Dean and the other Democratic contenders as they struggle with an issue that many say helped cost their party the White House and a handful of Congressional seats in 2000.
Polls show overwhelming support among Democratic primary voters for federal regulation of gun ownership. But that is not the case among general-election voters as a whole. Dr. Dean himself has said that Al Gore would be president today were it not for support of gun control. Like many other Democrats, he is mindful of Mr. Gore's losses in the 2000 election in states where gun control is not popular, like Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas and West Virginia.
In one example of the issue's delicate nature, another Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, having declared his support on Sunday for reauthorization of the assault weapons ban, will be in Iowa on Friday for what his campaign hopes will be a well-photographed pheasant hunt. And in a forum at the University of New Hampshire on Wednesday, yet another contender, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, made a point of talking in great detail about his childhood in a home where his father kept guns.
But of all the candidates, Democrats say, Dr. Dean may have the trickiest road to walk: trying, after establishing himself in Vermont as highly skeptical of gun control, to appeal to a decidedly liberal Democratic electorate.
At stop after stop, Dr. Dean says that gun control is an issue that should be left to the states but that he supports the central federal gun-control measures adopted during the Clinton administration: the 1994 assault weapons ban and the Brady Bill, which mandated a waiting period on the purchase of handguns.
At a debate before the Children's Defense Fund in Washington last spring, Dr. Dean said: "I support the assault weapons ban, I support reauthorization of the assault weapons ban." He tells audiences here and in Iowa that he supports the ban "because I never met a hunter who needed an AK-47 to shoot a deer." 
But he appears to have taken another position in 1992, when he was seeking the N.R.A.'s support of his run for governor. On question after question posed by the rifle association, he voiced opposition to various gun control measures, including state legislation to impose a waiting period for buying handguns.
The questionnaire also asked: "Semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and pistols, currently labeled 'assault weapons,' are commonly used in hunting and target competition, including the National Matches and the Olympics. Current federal and state law allows a lawful citizen to possess semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and pistols. Would you support legislation to restrict the private possession of these firearms?"
Dr. Dean checked the answer that read, "No, I would oppose restrictions on semiautomatic firearms." 
Ms. Enright, his spokeswoman, saw no contradiction. "It's not a federal answer," she said of his response to the questionnaire. "This is a Vermont questionnaire in 1992. In 1994, he said he'll support a federal law. Where's the inconsistency?"
The N.R.A., which gave Dr. Dean its highest possible rating throughout his 12-year career as governor, declined to provide copies of the questionnaires he had filled out over the years.
Jay Carson, a spokesman for Dr. Dean, said the candidate would not participate in an N.R.A. survey this year because, Mr. Carson said, the group will ultimately back President Bush for re-election.
A number of Democrats have pressed party officials to stop emphasizing gun control issues, asserting that there are few legislative gains left to be made and that the political cost to the party is too high.
"Guns are a good issue for Democrats in many urban areas and in many suburban areas, if not all suburban areas," said Howard Wolfson, former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "But they have not proved helpful, in my opinion -- though I have friends who will yell at me for saying this -- in rural areas, or among rural Democrats."
Campaigning in Wapello, Iowa, the other day, Dr. Dean made a similar argument, saying, "We've got to get guns off the national agenda -- it is not a national problem, it's a state problem -- so we don't lose 20 percent of union members who vote against their economic interests for that one issue."
Dr. Dean said that one year, his home state had just five homicides, "so we don't need any gun control."
"Let New York and New Jersey and California have all the gun control they want," he often says in campaign stops. "But don't impose it on Montana or Vermont or Iowa, where we don't need it."

HEADLINE: ECONOMY RECORDS SPEEDIEST GROWTH SINCE THE MID-80'S 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The economy expanded at the fastest rate since 1984 during the three months ended in September, the government reported yesterday, offering hope that the long economic malaise has finally ended.
 Consumer spending soared, foreigners bought American-made goods at a surprising clip and companies increased their investments in equipment and technology at a pace reminiscent of the 1990's boom. 
 Economists welcomed the report as a sign of strength not seen since 2000 but cautioned that growth was almost certain to slow in the months ahead as the effects of a recent tax rebate and a surge in mortgage refinancing wear off. 
"It looks like the economy is shrugging off its lethargy," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist of the Prudential Equity Group. "But there are some parts of this that are not sustainable." 
In all, the nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department, which adjusts its numbers to take into account inflation and normal seasonal fluctuations.
In two other quarters since 2001, the economy expanded at least 4 percent, only to fall back into a slump that made companies reluctant to hire new workers and helped create the worst loss of jobs in 20 years.
The possibility that growth was finally fast enough, and broad enough, to create jobs offered a salve to the White House. Page A20. 
President Bush and his aides have repeatedly said the series of tax cuts passed since he took office would eventually revive growth.
"The tax relief we passed is working," Mr. Bush said, while visiting an aluminum company in Columbus, Ohio. "We cannot expect economic growth numbers like these every quarter," he added, but "we're on the right track." 
 Democrats said that they, too, had favored stimulating the economy this year but that the large tax cut signed by Mr. Bush in May condemned the country to budget deficits and higher interest rates, which would eventually drag down growth.
 "The president's plan props up economic growth in the short term," Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said, "and undermines economic growth in the long term."
 Senator Conrad added: "There are consequences to spending more money than you take in." 
 The Commerce Department's report -- the latest in a line of encouraging signs -- is likely to allay fears among some at the Federal Reserve that three years of weak growth have left the economy vulnerable to deflation, a sustained period of falling prices like the one Japan has experienced recently.
 Prices for consumer goods rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent during the quarter, up from an increase of 0.8 percent during the second quarter.
 For more than four months now, the Fed has left its benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent, the lowest level since the 1950's, partly to ward off deflation. On Tuesday, the Fed announced that it planned to keep rates low for a "considerable" period. But investors became more confident yesterday that interest rates would rise by this spring, as gauged by futures contracts whose prices are based on Fed policy.
 "There are a thousand problems that remain," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, an investment firm. "But the No.1 problem -- would we end up like Japan because no amount of stimulus could get us out of this? -- has been resolved."
 Stocks closed largely unchanged, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipping 1.17 points, to 1,046.94. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.35 percent from 4.30 percent, a sign that investors expected the economy to keep expanding, albeit at a more languid pace.
 In the short term, the largest problem still afflicting the economy appears to be the lack of job growth. After falling by 2.8 million jobs since early 2001, employment rose during September for the first time in eight months, but the increase was not large enough to keep pace with the growth of the population. The Labor Department reported yesterday that new claims for jobless benefits fell slightly last week.
 In part, the economies of the United States and other developed countries have simply grown too slowly and unevenly for employers to commit themselves to hiring new workers. But companies have also used new technologies and business strategies to become more efficient, able to make more goods with fewer hands.
 Many analysts say the economy must now grow faster than it once did, about 4 percent a year, to create jobs. That is roughly the level that forecasters expect over the next year, though they have been overly optimistic since 2000. 
 The expansion "will translate into jobs very soon," said Bill Cheney, chief economist of John Hancock Financial Services. "But until we actually see real and sustained jobs growth, the fear will linger."
 A small number of forecasters remain concerned that the economy will slip into a torpor again next year. They say that household spending on long-lasting expensive items, known as durable goods, will weaken as interest rates rise and that companies, still suffering from their binge in the late 90's, will not continue to invest in new factories and equipment at a healthy pace.
 In the most recent quarter, consumers played the starring role, with the help of the refinancings, the tax cut and hourly wages that have continued to rise faster than inflation. Household purchases of durable goods, like cars, which continue to be heavily discounted, rose at an annual rate of 26.9 percent in the quarter.
 This summer, the Treasury Department mailed $400 one-time rebate checks to millions of families with children. Income taxes also fell for many families, and that could continue to aid the recovery.
 Businesses helped the economy last quarter as well, suggesting that executives have become more confident about the economy's path or at least have decided they can wait no longer to replace dated computers and other machines. Corporate spending on equipment and software increased 15.4 percent in the quarter, the biggest jump since early 2000. 
 Exports also rose more quickly than imports, reducing the trade deficit, but few economists viewed the change as a turning point. With military spending flat, government agencies made only a slight contribution to growth.
 Perhaps the most encouraging sign for the coming months, economists said, was the $36 billion decline in the value of inventories -- goods piled up in company warehouses -- during the third quarter. The drop suggested that the level of consumer spending caught executives by surprise and that they might need to increase production soon to restock their shelves.
 The ratio of inventories to final business sales was at its lowest level on record during the quarter, according to Prudential.

U.S. Economic Growth Is Fastest Since 1984
The economy expanded at the fastest rate since 1984 during the three months ended in September, offering hope that the long economic malaise has finally ended.
 Consumer spending soared, foreigners bought American-made goods at a surprising clip and companies increased their investments in equipment and technology at a pace reminiscent of the 1990's boom. Page A1. 

The strong growth has appeared just a year before the 2004 election. Do the better economic times bode well for President Bush? Floyd Norris: Economic Memo. A1.

Russia Freezes Billions in Assets
The Russian government froze stocks valued at $14 billion in Yukos Oil, raising the stakes in the investigation into its imprisoned chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. A1.

The arrest of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, and the freezing of $14 billion in Yukos Oil stock is a reminder to foreign investors of how risky and volatile emerging markets can still be, even when a government has been on a reform path applauded by outside analysts. C4.

Judge Jumps Into Magazine Fray
The judge in the trial between Rosie O'Donnell and Gruner & Jahr, the co-owner of the magazine that bore her name, became impatient with the pace of the questioning and took over himself. Ms. O'Donnell is seeking her initial $6 million investment in the magazine and damages, while the publisher has asserted that Ms. O'Donnell should compensate it for more than $100 million. C6.

Universal in DreamWorks Deal
Vivendi's Universal Music Group is expected to purchase DreamWorks Records for an estimated $100 million, according to people close to the company. The proposed deal reflects the general turmoil in the record industry, analysts said, as a three-year sales slump has sparked merger talks among all of the major labels. C4.

Treasury Head Calls for Diplomacy
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow asked the Senate Banking Committee to continue financial diplomacy with China and rebuffed lawmakers who want to impose retaliatory tariffs on China if it refuses to let its currency rise in value against the dollar. C2.

Loss at Martha Stewart Omnimedia
Martha Stewart's legal troubles continued to haunt her company, which reported a loss of 8 cents a share in the third quarter. The loss beat the 15-cent loss predicted in August by executives of Martha Stewart Omnimedia, but it was worse than the profit of 6 cents earned in the quarter a year ago. C6.

Comcast Results Below Estimates
Results at Comcast fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations, but the company said that it had added 473,000 high-speed Internet subscribers, a record for a quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $1.63 billion. Revenue rose 8.8 percent, to $4.55 billion, slightly below expectations of about $4.6 billion. C6.

Goldman Research Official Retires
Andrew Melnick, 61, is retiring after 18 months as co-head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs. C7.

Dow Climbs; Nasdaq and S.&P. Fall
Wall Street was mixed as investors applauded a surprisingly strong third-quarter gross domestic product report but worried that the increase could not be sustained. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,786.61. The Nasdaq composite index lost 3.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,932.69, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.17 points, to 1,046.94. C7.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Making Movies, and Moves, in Long Island City

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
STUART MATCH SUNA, president of Silvercup Studios, walked through the set of "Sex and the City" on Tuesday, showing off the "Manhattan" apartments of the show's main characters.
 There was Carrie's shoe closet stuffed with real shoes and Samantha's wine rack stocked with empty bottles. And what's this? The show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, taking a break and giving detailed salad dressing specifications to an assistant for her lunch order. 
 Hmm, let's hit the pause button here and set up this clip: Big studio head runs into the top screen siren filming on his lot. But Mr. Suna's close-up is foiled by a lowly crew member walking unscripted into the scene and telling the studio head, "It's kind of a closed set." 
What would Sam Goldwyn do? How about Harvey Weinstein? Instead of throwing a "Find out who I am" fit, Mr. Suna backs off and heads to Tony Soprano's house on another soundstage at Silvercup, in an industrial section of Long Island City, Queens.
Mr. Suna, 47, has bigger challenges these days. It is a slow time in the film industry in New York, and competing studios are being planned or built, including the Steiner Studios at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard.
But Mr. Suna insists that he is not worried; his studio space is booked solid right now.
"Besides, I like a challenge," he said, heading for the Bada Bing strip club. "Yes, Steiner Studios are going to be competitors, but we have a head start." As for Kaufman Astoria Studios nearby, which is also seeking to expand, Mr. Suna said, "They started two years before us, and we're already bigger than them."
In 1980, Mr. Suna and his partner -- his brother, Alan Suna, Silvercup's chief executive -- converted the former Silvercup Bakery into a film and television production facility. In 1999, they bought more space nearby and opened Silvercup East. Now Silvercup is the largest such facility in New York.
The Suna brothers also develop and manage real estate in the city. They hope to raise half a billion dollars on another development project, Silvercup West, which would at least double the size of their studio space.
Still in the planning phase, the project is being designed by the British architect Richard Rogers on a 6.5-acre lot on the East River waterfront south of the Queensboro Bridge. With two million square feet of space, it would be anchored by the production studios and include residential, commercial and retail space. Mr. Suna is busy pushing for a zoning change and starting the lengthy approval processes. He needs to move the power generator currently on the site and secure the financing.
"Putting up a building is like making a film," he said. "Your architect is your director, and the developer has to produce it and get the thing made."
MR. SUNA spent last week at the Hamptons International Film Festival (he is chairman of its board). Today, he plans to take 10 members of the British Parliament on a tour of Long Island City to discuss its economic revitalization. What Mr. Suna sees as essential networking, his brother sees as extracurricular nonsense.
Actually, this is Stuart's take, which Alan was shy about corroborating, explaining that their personal relationship is "not germane to the discussion."
Growing up in Roslyn, N.Y., the two brothers shared a room and had to draw a line down the middle to keep order. Now their offices are separated by David Von Spreckelsen, the director of real estate and development, and they concentrate on different aspects of the business. 
Both brothers are trained as architects, as is Mr. Suna's wife, Vicki Match Suna. But she, too, is in the real estate game, as associate dean for facilities planning for New York University Medical Center. She also serves one day a week on the board of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. Mr. Suna added his wife's maiden name, Match, to his, which he says goes over big with women.
Mr. Suna is a self-described "adrenaline junkie" who brags about twice crashing his Triumph TR6. Now he gets his thrills by skiing in Colorado and mountain climbing in the Shawangunks.
On his office wall is an autographed photograph of Don Larsen pitching his perfect game, next to a modernist skull he carved himself from alabaster. Mr. Suna attended Carnegie Mellon University and has two master's degrees, in architecture and fine arts.
"You have to work on your weaknesses but capitalize on your strengths," he said.
Back on the "Sopranos" set, he heads through Uncle Junior's kitchen and into the Bada Bing. Suddenly there's a POP, POP, POP, POP. Gunshots seem to ring out, but it's only Mr. Suna stepping on a sheet of bubble wrap. Next, it's up to the roof to look at the Manhattan skyline and the famous Silvercup sign.
For years, Mr. Suna lived in a spacious loft at Silvercup, above an apartment he rented to Howard Stern. He now lives on the Upper East Side. He has two daughters, Zoe and Rose, and the family weekends in the Hamptons. 
He still brings his two Irish setters, Buster and Whitey, to work. But at age 13, they are going blind and sleep at his secretary's feet, separated by a small gate, almost as the Suna brothers once were.
"The brothers?" Mr. Von Spreckelsen joked. "You need more than a fence for them."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Has but Begun Its Cleanup Of Corruption 

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
For the past four years, as budget battles have been fought, political campaigns waged and laws enacted, there has been a steady background noise in Connecticut state politics: the drip, drip, drip of an ever-widening public corruption scandal.
 Since Paul J. Silvester, the former state treasurer, pleaded guilty to racketeering and money laundering charges in 1999, he has been pointing a finger at others who he says were part of his ambitious plan to enrich himself on the government's dime. 
 This week, as Ben F. Andrews, a civil rights leader and unsuccessful candidate for secretary of the state, was convicted on federal bribery and money laundering charges, one chapter in the corruption scandals seemed to close. Of the state officials and business leaders singled out by Mr. Silvester, Mr. Andrews was the last to be convicted. 
But while Mr. Silvester may be done naming names, there are other investigations that could still portend trouble for Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican in his third term.
From the beginning, the question was how far Mr. Silvester's accusations would reach. "The big thing down the road still remains the question of whether any of this is going to lead to Governor Rowland," said John Orman, a professor of politics at Fairfield University.
On Wednesday, a federal jury found Mr. Andrews guilty of arranging to collect $750,000 in fees from the corrupt investment of $150 million in state pension funds. Although Mr. Andrews denied the charges, Mr. Silvester testified that Mr. Andrews not only knew of the investment, but also made it clear in several conversations that he wanted his share.
Mr. Andrews, a former president of the Connecticut N.A.A.C.P., hoped his long history of public service in the state would lead jurors to believe him rather than Mr. Silvester. Instead, he became the last of the five people implicated by Mr. Silvester to be convicted or to plead guilty.
After the verdict, Mr. Andrews's lawyer, Jeremiah Donovan, said, "I would feel so much more confident in the government's decision to prosecute Ben if, along with Ben, they had also prosecuted all the businessmen and lawyers in Hartford and New York who Silvester has implicated."
But more prosecutions may be coming. Act II features players, either under investigation or already indicted, who are even closer to Mr. Rowland than the former treasurer.
The main player now is the governor's former deputy chief of staff, Lawrence E. Alibozek. Mr. Alibozek, in pleading guilty in March, admitted accepting an unspecified amount of an cash and gold coins in return for influencing state contracts. He is cooperating with investigators, one official close to the case said.
Mr. Alibozek's boss and Mr. Rowland's former co-chief of staff, Peter N. Ellef, was forced out as chairman of the state trash authority after the agency lost about $200 million in state funds in a deal with Enron just before its collapse. Law enforcement officials who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said Mr. Ellef was under investigation in connection with the awarding of state contracts.
There are other people under suspicion, law enforcement officials say, but all the cases have to do with the same thing: old-fashioned graft.
The charges against the state officials named by Mr. Silvester were known to voters when Mr. Rowland won his third term as governor last fall. "Voters knew most of what was out there," Mr. Orman said. "And it wasn't a big deal."
Still, the governor's approval ratings in polls have dropped precipitously since his re-election, hitting 27 percent in a University of Connecticut poll in July. While some of that loss in popularity can be attributed to the sluggish economy, his administration's ethical troubles have remained at the center of attention.
With each new conviction or allegation, Mr. Rowland has expressed his feelings of betrayal. After Mr. Andrews's conviction, he said, "It's very troubling to all of us that have been in public service to see something like this happen."
Mr. Rowland has yet to say whether he will run for a fourth term, but his spokesman, Dean Pagani, said that the scandal investigations would not factor into a decision on the matter. More important, he said, is the fact that Mr. Rowland has already led the state for 12 years.
"That is a long time," Mr. Pagani said.
