HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Winners and Losers In a Seamy World

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR

 BODY:
WHAT I'm saying, what is our life?" (Pause.) "It's looking forward or it's looking back. And that's our life. That's it. Where is the moment?" (Pause.) "And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss. What else?" (Pause.) "The bank closes. We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed . . . the house burned down . . . . What of these happen . . . ? None of 'em. We worry anyway. What does this mean? I'm not secure. How can I be secure?" (Pause.) "Through amassing wealth beyond all measure? No. And what's beyond all measure? That's a sickness. That's a trap. There is no measure. Only greed."
That's Richard Roma, top salesman, talking, venting, philosophizing, sans scatology. It comes next. To spare. 
 Welcome to David Mamet territory, where words -- weapons for the inarticulate -- speak loud, but action speaks louder.
In "Glengarry Glen Ross," a savage comedy about sleaze in the real-estate racket (or perhaps game, but not, in an acceptable sense, business), Mr. Mamet has written one of his most complete, most unarguable plays yet. Like "American Buffalo," it excludes women, thus freeing the playwright from the specters of ambiguity and misogyny.
Here are seven men: five salesmen, one detective and one customer, a pushover.
A woman's presence in a Mamet play presents a fierce challenge, usually unmet, for directors and actors to fill in the open-ended seething phrases. An all-male contingent can just go at it in a combative world of openness. Men outshark one another, "to try to earn a living," in one of the salesmen's words. The battleground or the carnival -- "All it is, it's a carnival," Roma says -- is a contest. It's about selling worthless land in Florida. The winner gets a Cadillac. Two losers get unemployment.
Where the action is in Mr. Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner is in plotting to steal leads and ransacking the office, in the threat and the treachery -- more bile in an hour and a half (intermission included) than is packed into a blood-letting Elizabethan epic. The rampant ethnic put-downs are yet another extra. And nobody dies, except spiritually.
In this production by National Stage, a fledgling nomadic professional company, Andrew Lionetti (Roma) has the alternately cool, slick and manic staccato Mamet style down pat. In a show-stealing performance, the actor represents the playwright's views on the "ways of the world." Roma is a "member of a dying breed, a world of men."
Alexander Barnett (as Shelly Levene) and Jeffrey Norman (as George Aaronow) play the losers. Levene is actually a loser turned winner turned loser. Mr. Barnett invests the role Robert Prosky created on Broadway and Jack Lemmon played in the film, the character whose "bad luck runs in streaks," who then gets hot, scoring a Pyrrhic victory with a poignant sense of need that reveals a life of obligation outside the amoral confines of his job. The heart of Mr. Barnett's work is in sync with the playwright's nonjudgmental view of all the salesmen trapped in a demeaning system.
But no two performances have a right to be at the center of an ensemble piece. Chris Firriolo's staging is thus unbalanced, more formulaic than stirring.
If Mr. Barnett is jittery, Mr. Norman as the most hapless salesman -- an unwitting accomplice to a criminal plot "because you listened," as he is told -- is close to the edge and ready to jump, stammering to an obviously overplayed fault.
At a vulnerable point in its emergence, National Stage is trying to start a theater in earnest. It would be damaging to overpraise it. It is important to notice.

HEADLINE: THE RICH: Who They Are;
The Upper Tail

BYLINE: By ANDREW HACKER; Andrew Hacker is the author of "Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal." He is now at work on "Cash," a book about income and earnings in America, to be published next year by Scribner.

 BODY:

JUST HOW RICH IS RICH:
 To a member of the average American household - the median income jof which is $31,241 j- anyone who makes six figures looks rich. To those working away for their six figures, however, even a million must feel only slightly well off in the company of Bill Gates, who, at last count, was worth about 150 times that much. For the sake of argument, though, let's declare you a rich American if your household's annual income is, say, $500,000. That would put you in the top 0.3 percent of America's households, or 1 in every 556 families. This "upper tail" of wealth has grown drastically over the past years:
 
Number of tax returns in 1979 with income exceeding $1 million: 13,505.
 

Number of tax returns in 1993 with income exceeding $1 million: 65,656.
 
Number of households in 1989 with $1 million or more in investable assets: 834,000.
 
Number of households in 1992 with $1 million or more in investable assets: 3,200,000.
 
(Measured in constant dollars.)
 
WHAT DO WE KNO ABOUT THE NEW CLASS OF RICH PEOPLE?
 
In 1993, of the 205,623 American households that reported incomes of more than $500,000. . .
 
29,843, or 15 percent, received Social Security benefits, averaging $16,426.
 
9,676 paid out alimony, averaging $48,085.
 
151 received alimony, averaging $148,636.
 
1,017 received unemployment benefits, averaging $4,465.
 
20,354 filers, 1 in 10, claimed no deductions for charity.
 
Just who are these affluent people?
 
The most dependable statistics can be gleaned from Census reports, whose wealthiest category is individuals earning more than $100,000. (The median for men was $22,443; jfor women, $13,896.) In 1993, about 2.7 million men and women made more than $100,000. Of those 2.7 million . . .
 
89 percent are men.
 
91 percent are white. People who identify themselves as Asian, Hispanic of African-American each make up about 3 percent.
 
81 percent are married, 9 percent are divorced or separated, 2 percent are widowed and 8 percent have never been married.
 
49 percent had postgraduate or professional degrees, 31 percent had only a bachelor's degree, 12 percent had only some college and 9 percent had a high-school diploma or less.
 
JUST HOW MUCH DO THE RICH CONTROL?
 
Once upon a time, a very small group of American families took home a very large portion of American income. Welcome back to the past.
 
Meanwhile, total household wealth, as distinguished from income, has become even more unevenly distributed. In 1970, the top 1 percent of households owned about 20 percent; in 1989, the top 1 percent held about 36 percent.
 
But that doesn't mean that the wealth stays in the same hands. Consider the parade of newcomers to the top of the pyramid. Here, culled from Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest people in America, are the 10 richest people who built up and are still active in running their own businesses - and where they stood on Forbes's overall wealth list in 1982, when the list first appeared.
 
By today's standards, the top five self-made businessmen in 1982 were of rather modest wealth (in constant dollars).
 
Of the 1,019 people who have ever appeared on the Forbes 400 list, 5 were black (Berry Gordy of Motown Records; John Harold Johnson of Ebony and Jet magazines; Reginald Lewis of Beatrice Foods and Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby) and 3 were women (Winfrey, Estee Lauder and Mary Hudson, a gasoline-station mogul). The top one-year earnings ever was the $1.1 billion attributed to the investment impresario George Soros, in 1993. A not-so-close second: Michael Milken, in 1986, reaped $550 million.
 
SO, YOU WANT TO BE . . . AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON?
 
Many Americans have got rich thanks to the microchip. But some old standby professions have more than kept pace.
 
The typical partner in an American law firm earned $168,000 last year, 7.5 times more than median earnings, whereas back in 1951, the typical lawyer earned $49,000 (in constant dollars), 2.7 times the median. The typical partner in one of Washington's top 10 firms earned $455,638 last year while the typical partner in one of New York's top 10 firms earned $959,038.
 
The average income for physicians in private practice last year, $218,000, was 8.3 times greater than the median earning, whereas in 1973, the average income was $137,000 (in constant dollars), 4 times greater. Last year, among doctors, orthopedic surgeons made the most, averaging $364,000, while doctors infamily or general practices averaged $123,000.
 
The best bet, of course, is to run the company. The C.E.O.'s of America's 100 largest corporations last year averaged $3,554,000 in total compensation, most of it coming in bonuses and stock gains. (The average salary for these 100 was $898,000). And the C.E.O. position has appreciated: 20 years ago, the typical C.E.O. made about 40 times the typical American worker; now the ratio has swelled to 190 times as much.
 
Experts of every stripe are constantly seeking to explain these substantial disparities, citing, among other factors, the rise injobs that require expertise and education. But one facet of the divergence is unmistakable. It's obvious that sex still sells, but which one? At left, the 10 best-paid stars in Hollywood in 1934; at right, last year's top 10.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform That Can Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Welfare Hysteria" (Op-Ed, Nov. 14), Charles Murray misses the point on why President Clinton needs to veto the "welfare reform" legislation now in House-Senate conference.
Through the legislation, Congress wants to cut spending on poor children to help reduce the debt. Much of the debt was created by supply-side economics. The debt rose from $800 billion in 1981 to $3 trillion in 1991 -- partly as a result of huge tax breaks to the rich and tax increases on the poor. Child poverty increased by over 20 percent in the 1980's. 
 Yet the Congressional debt reduction plan -- of which reduced child poverty spending is a part -- is based on more supply-side economics, which will only make the rich still richer and the poor still poorer. This helps fulfill the prophecy of the 1968 Kerner Commission of "two nations, one black, one white, separate and unequal."
The key to reducing child poverty is training parents for employment, placing them in real jobs and providing child care while they work. None of the state plans come close to doing this for all those eligible.
None of the state devolution schemes acknowledge how the job training program for high-risk inner-city young people, the Job Training Partnership Act created in the 1980's, has failed, based on scientific evaluations.
We know what works. There are scientifically evaluated models upon which to build a solid system that links education, training, placement, economic development to generate jobs and inner-city financing through community banking.
Those models, the heart of real welfare reform, include mentoring in safe havens after school, which has been popularized by the Carnegie Corporation; the Ford Foundation's Quantum Opportunities Program, and the Argus Community's program in the South Bronx to train young adults to rehabilitate inner-city homes, which is being replicated by the Labor Department.
Federal funding is needed, but day-to-day program operations should be devolved -- not to the states, but much further, to these grass-roots, democracy-recreating, community-based successes.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE STATES;
Governors In G.O.P. Urge Stand On Budget

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Nov. 19

 BODY:
Twenty-one of the nation's 30 Republican governors today urged the Republican-run Congress to insist on balancing the Federal budget in seven years, advising Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, not to blink in their showdown with President Clinton over the future direction of American Government.
In letters addressed to Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole, the members of the Republican Governors Association meeting here said that "the Republican-controlled Congress must stand firm, balance the budget and avoid the impending disaster that larger and larger deficit spending portends." 
 Even though the states will take big losses if the Federal Government cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid and welfare, Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio said at a news conference, the Federal budget has to be balanced in seven years.
"The Republican Party is not mean-spirited," he said. "The Republican Party believes in tough love. And we understand that if we don't do something about reducing the deficit, we aren't going to have anything for the poor, the children or anyone else in this country."
The governors said they remained what they declared themselves to be at their last annual conference in Williamburg, Va.: disciples of a devolution of power to the states. Neither the impact of the cuts nor the prospect of greater demands on the social safety net in a future recession would dissaude them, they said.
Governor Voinovich said that the Republican-run Congress's drive to replace entitlement programs with block grants for Medicare, welfare, Medicaid and other programs would give governors the flexibility they need to "work harder, smarter and do more with less on the local level."
"What we need to do is convince a lot of people out there who are concerned about what we're doing, to take, I'd like to refer to it as a leap of faith, " he said. "The Federal Government has had these problems for years. They failed. They're bankrupt. We're saying we've got to change the paradigm, return the power back to the states. Give us the authority to solve the problems on the local level. And we're going to have a better America."
Earlier in the day at a brunch for governors and their guests, every governor interviewed said that balancing the Federal budget in seven years was the center of their concerns. And any plan to do so, they said, should be based on real economic assumptions and give states flexibility.
Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois said that if the budget balancing took longer, the elected officials who put it in place would probably not be around to enforce it.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, the vice chairman of the group, said that balancing the budget by 2002, could lower interest rates on mortgages and consumer loans by as much as 2 percentage points.
In response to a question about a plan by conservative House Democrats that would balance the budget in seven years but without $245 billion in tax cuts proposed by the Republicans, Governor Engler declined to comment in detail, but said there is "a middle ground" and that "there are outlines of a compromise out there."
If President Clinton commits himself to a seven-year plan, Governor Engler said, some proposed tax cuts could be scaled back. But, he said, the Congressional Republican plan to cut the capital gains tax will not be negotiable.
Outside the brunch, Governor Voinovich said his state did not get everything it wanted from the Republicans on Capitol Hill. But he said that his welfare and Medicaid experts had concluded that Ohio could handle the transition from entitlements to block grants.
Governor Edgar said he, too, would like to be getting more money in the Congressional Republicans' plans but, he said, "if you want to balance the budget, that means you have to give some things up."
New Mexico's governor, Gary Johnson, said he was willing to take proportional cuts in a wide range of programs because balancing the budget would eventually put hundreds of billions of dollars in the hands of entrepreneurs. "I look at that as an exciting prospect," he said.

HEADLINE: Time Inc.'s Bosses Want Success on Paper

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY and MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
When Don Logan and Norman Pearlstine announced a wholesale reorganizing of Time Inc. last week, they also took the wraps off a formidable new partnership. Although Mr. Logan has been the chief executive of Time Warner's publishing division for 15 months and Mr. Pearlstine is approaching his first anniversary as editor in chief, last week's shake-up was their first coordinated effort to remake the world's largest magazine company.
They named top editors at Time and Sports Illustrated; disbanded Time Inc. Ventures, the Los Angeles-based magazine development division, and consolidated international operations under Mr. Pearlstine. 
 As a team, Mr. Logan and Mr. Pearlstine are projecting a unified vision of Time Inc., as a company that will not be distracted by the siren song of new electronic media but will remain focused on its historic business of producing glossy magazines on glossy paper.
They also projected the message that they are partners, not rivals. "The underlying news about this shake-up is how closely Pearlstine and Logan work as a team," said Walter Isaacson, editor of New Media, who was named managing editor of Time.
This never could have been done, he said, "in the days when the president of Time Inc. looked upon the editor in chief as a rival power center rather than as a partner."
Mr. Isaacson, a longtime fixture among Time's masthead editors, moved to Time Inc.'s unfolding electronic world as the top manager in 1993. His switch back to print underscores the new management's focus on the company's core business.
But the two men now renewing the focus on the creations of Henry Luce are themselves outsiders to the culture Luce created. Mr. Logan, 51 is a quiet Alabama native who spent most of his career at Southern Progress, the Birmingham, Ala.-based publishing company that was acquired by Time Warner in 1983. Mr. Pearlstine, 53, is a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal and man about town whose circle of friends includes some of the most powerful people in New York.
And both are breaking a long tradition of promoting top executives from inside the tradition-bound company.
Under Mr. Logan, Time Inc. has become one of Time Warner's most robust divisions. After suffering through the advertising recession of the early 1990's and an ill-considered effort to centralize the advertising sales staffs of its magazines, Time Inc. is now racking up impressive earnings growth.
John S. Reidy, a media analyst at Smith Barney, predicted that Time Inc. will earn $480 million in operating income in 1995 -- a 12 percent gain over 1994. Such growth puts the division on par with Time Warner's fastest-growing businesses: Warner Brothers and HBO.
Although Time Inc. has benefited from a general surge in magazine advertising, Mr. Reidy said the company was currently outstripping the growth rates of other major magazine publishers.
Mr. Logan attributes Time Inc.'s financial health to a new sense of entrepreneurship at the magazines. Each title has been encouraged to develop profitable ideas for spinoffs like "Money for Kids" or "zoned" sections of Sports Illustrated sold exclusively to affluent golfers.
By decentralizing the advertising sales staffs of the magazines, Mr. Logan said the company has made its core titles more profitable. Besides Time and Sports Illustrated, the company's magazines include Fortune, Life, Money, People, Entertainment Weekly and In Style.
If Mr. Logan is credited with energizing the publishing side, Mr. Pearlstine is viewed as invigorating the editorial staff.
When he took over as editor in chief, Mr. Pearlstine made it clear that he would immerse himself in the Time Inc. culture and learn as much as possible about each of the magazines before making changes.
"He started out as a real student of the building and the culture, and soon it was like talking to someone who had been here 10 years," one editor said, requesting anonymity.
But what really woke up the staff -- and what may perhaps be Mr. Pearlstine's most important contribution -- was his strong role in shaping editorial coverage. Last summer, for example, Mr. Pearlstine became closely involved in Time magazine's unusually frank coverage of the gangsta rap controversy that had engulfed its parent company, Time Warner.
Having come to expect the kind of distance from the fray that had marked the reign of the former editor in chief Jason McManus, staff members were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Pearlstine's actions.
"I would say the result has been that he has clearly increased the clout of the editor in chief's office at Time Inc.," said Landon Y. Jones Jr., managing editor of People.
Mr. Pearlstine also moved quickly to establish a relationship with people at the Cable News Network and take a strong role in integrating CNN into Time Inc. if Time Warner's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting goes through. Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, has asked Mr. Pearlstine to head a committee to create a blueprint for making these relationships work.
Mr. Pearlstine's style "is to immerse himself in everything that's happening, to suck up information from his sources all over the building, then to retreat a bit for a day or so every couple of weeks and sort out the picture in front," one editor said.
Mr. Pearlstine's first move, to remove Walter Kiechel as managing editor of Fortune in February, came after differences with Mr. Kiechel about the direction of the magazine, which Mr. Pearlstine found too narrowly focused on articles about management. He replaced him with John Huey, an old colleague with whom Mr. Pearlstine had started The Wall Street Journal's European edition in 1982.
Last week, Mr. Pearlstine appointed Sports Illustrated's assistant managing editor, Bill Colsen, as managing editor, after a much publicized competition -- referred to internally as a "bake off" -- with Daniel Okrent, managing editor of Life.
Many people in the company feel that the bake off at Sports Illustrated ended in an unnecessary public humiliation for Mr. Okrent, a widely respected editor. He and Mr. Colsen had each been given a three-month trial as acting editor of Sports Illustrated, with Mr. Pearlstine announcing that the one who published the magazine he liked best would get the job.
The trial was followed by a lengthy interview with Mr. Pearlstine and the Time Inc. editorial director Henry Muller -- a process likened to an "oral exam" by insiders. The final decision was announced on Thursday. Mr. Pearlstine said last week that the bake off accomplished his goal. Mr. Pearlstine also replaced James R. Gaines, a former managing editor of People and Life, as managing editor of Time. Mr. Gaines was named corporate editor of Time Inc., a senior editorial management position.
People at the company say Mr. Gaines may have hastened his own departure last summer with a cover story on "cyberporn," based on a seriously flawed study of pornography on the Internet. The study had been conducted by an undergraduate student at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Mr. Gaines later told friends that Mr. Pearlstine had called him up just before the issue went to press and asked him if he was satisfied with the methodology of the report. Mr. Gaines said he was.
The appointment of Mr. Isaacson to replace Mr. Gaines has raised a variety of questions about the future of the company's newest electronic venture, the elaborate Pathfinder site on the World Wide Web.
Two weeks ago Mr. Logan described the venture as "giving new definition to the term 'black hole.' " Last week its overseer, Mr. Isaacson, was taken from the electronic world and installed in perhaps the most prestigious hands-on editorial job in the company.
Was Mr. Isaacson rewarded for success, taken out of failure's way or simply moved into a job that was the logical culmination of his earlier career as a journalist and author?
The answer may be some combination of the three. Mr. Isaacson had held several top editing jobs at the magazine, and was author or co-author of two influential works on the architects of American foreign policy. It seemed a mark of the company's commitment to an electronic future when he was asked to pioneer the new-media projects.
But economic success has been elusive for Pathfinder, as for many other companies' electronic ventures. Mr. Isaacson had signed up more than 40 companies, generating about $2.5 million in ad revenue, according to company executives.
Paul Sagan, who started Pathfinder with Mr. Isaacson and will replace him as chief of new media, said last week that Time Inc. now realizes that Pathfinder cannot cover its expenses through advertising sales alone.
As a result, Mr. Sagan said he would seek ways to raise revenue from Pathfinder's users, who currently browse through the Web site free.
"I believe that electronic publishing is a real business," Mr. Logan said. "But what's not clear yet is how to generate revenue."
As a joke on his boss, Mr. Sagan registered the World Wide Web address www.blackhole.com for possible future use by his boss. And the chagrined Mr. Logan said, "I was simply making an off-the-cuff quip, which I often do, and then proceed to put my foot in my mouth."

HEADLINE: Clinton in Political Quandary on Welfare

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Moments after the Senate overwhelmingly voted in September to end 60 years of Federal social policy and impose a five-year limit on welfare benefits, the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, exchanged a triumphant high-five slap with Rahm I. Emanuel, a Presidential aide.
The Clinton Administration had been bitterly divided over whether the President should support this bill, but on this day, the closest aides to the President saw the Senate action as a victory. 
 In Florida, Mr. Clinton said that if the Senate's bipartisan approach prevailed, "we will have welfare reform this year, and it will be a very great thing."
Now, just two months later, Mr. Clinton is expected to veto the welfare compromise struck by House and Senate negotiators. His aides say it would mean unacceptable reductions in nutrition programs and aid to disabled children and would erode some crucial sections of the Senate measure.
Instead of being an example of Mr. Clinton's seeming inability to hold to a single political course, the journey from September's celebration to the President's expected veto shows the political quandary facing Mr. Clinton since the Republicans took over what had once been the President's initiative and pushed his proposals to the right. In 1991, when Mr. Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it," he never expected to be confronted by the drastic question he now faces about how far he can accommodate the Republicans.
It may be that Mr. Clinton's warm words for the Senate were largely tactical: by supporting the Senate measure, he became free to veto the conference agreement. Then he could keep the allegiance of liberals and say in 1996 that he had supported the same welfare measure as Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican Presidential contender.
Or at year's end, Mr. Clinton may approve a welfare measure that embraces the sweeping changes underlying both the House and Senate bills. Both would replace an array of Federal antipoverty programs with limited lump-sum payments to the states and give the states broad authority to run their own welfare programs. The bills would also set a five-year limit on public assistance.
Mr. Clinton's aides say he holds some bedrock principles on welfare: he advocates time limits on benefits, work requirements, child care for working mothers, and strong measures to wrest child support payments from fathers who have abandoned their children.
But in the past few weeks, Mr. Clinton has given mixed signals in the debate.
Speaking with the neoconservative author Ben Wattenberg, he disowned his own 1994 welfare plan as too lenient. In an interview with black columnists, he said he could not support "just cavalierly putting a bunch of kids back below the poverty line." Yet when his budget office released a study a few days later saying the Senate bill could push 1.2 million more children into poverty, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said the President still "may have to accept that bill."
Now aides say the President's political strategist for the 1996 campaign, Dick Morris, has moved from believing that the President should agree to a balanced budget and welfare legislation to thinking that he can veto Republican measures as too extreme and make next year a referendum on competing values.
Liberals inside and outside the Administration have mounted a crusade to persuade Mr. Clinton to veto the bill. "This is a crucial moral litmus test for this Presidency and this nation," said Marian Wright Edelman, a longtime Clinton friend who heads the Children's Defense Fund.
From the moment Mr. Clinton began his Presidential campaign, hespoke of welfare. "In a Clinton Administration, we're going to put an end to welfare as we know it," Mr. Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas, said in 1991. "We'll give them all the help they need for up to two years. But after that, if they're able to work, they'll have to take a job in the private sector or start earning their way through community service."
Yet Mr. Clinton waited to unveil his welfare plan until June 1994. His proposal coupled the two-year time limit on receiving benefits with $9.3 billion in investment over five years to insure that the people leaving welfare could hold down jobs. That money would provide child care, education and training, job placement assistance and Federally subsidized jobs, as a last resort for those unable to find private employment.
The plan went nowhere. Republicans denounced it as weak, despite its tough work plan. Liberal Democrats remained suspicious of time limits. And the committees that would have to consider the plan were enmeshed in the great health care war.
So the welfare debate was postponed until 1995.
The November elections changed everything. For the first time in 40 years, Republicans controlled Capitol Hill, and they quickly seized the initiative on welfare.
In the name of their New Federalism, the Republicans proposed giving states control of Federal assistance programs serving 40 million Americans and saving billions of dollars on welfare. Unlike Mr. Clinton, they viewed their five-year limit on welfare as an absolute cutoff.
Unwilling to cede the issue, Mr. Clinton convened a welfare conference at Blair House in January with governors and Congressional leaders of both parties to send the message that he wanted to work with the Congress.
The White House decided against reintroducing its welfare bill. "Instead of hanging our hat on a Clinton bill that had no chance, we decided to take advantage of divisions within the Republican Party to make sure that they move in our direction," said Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser to the President.
Administration officials quickly lost hope of influencing the House, and they fell back on a Senate-based strategy in which Democrats would seek common ground with moderate Republicans. After the House passed a bill that would cut social programs by $90 billion, Mr. Clinton criticized the measure in a radio address.
The Senate's deliberations reached fever pitch in September. By then, Mr. Clinton had established several benchmarks.
In a July speech to governors, he opposed the Republican plan to free the states from the current requirement that they put up their own money for welfare as a condition of getting Federal money. Otherwise, he warned, the states "will get involved in a race to the bottom."
In a separate policy statement, the White House said the Senate bill should encourage states to spend their own money on welfare and create a contingency fund for states so they would have more resources for the poor during recessions.
The Administration also asked the Senate to earmark money for job training and child care for working mothers. And it said states should be rewarded with bonuses if they succeeded in moving people from welfare to work.
Mr. Clinton and his closest aides dearly wanted the Senate to draft a measure the President could support, one official said, to demonstrate "clarity" about his commitment to overhauling welfare and to give him leverage in dealing with Congress as it put together its final compromise.
The Senate moved in Mr. Clinton's direction. In a grueling series of day and night votes, the Senate rejected efforts to curb out-of-wedlock births by limiting benefits, approved a $1 billion welfare contingency fund for the states, earmarked $8 billion for child care and voted to require states to maintain 80 percent of their current welfare spending.
But was this enough?
Liberals in the Administration still believed that the Senate bill was scrapping the 60-year-old guarantee of Federal aid to poor children. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, circumvented White House procedures to show the President a draft analysis by her agency showing that the Senate measure could force another 1.1 million children into poverty.
But the next morning, Mr. Clinton praised the Senate bill for bringing the country "within striking distance of transforming the welfare system" in several fundamental ways.
When the final Senate vote on welfare came three days later, White House officials were jubilant: only 11 Democrats defected to vote against the bill. Mr. Clinton had sold the idea of a time limit on benefits, even to his own party.
But other Democrats and advocates for the poor said Mr. Clinton had drastically altered his position in the course of a year. He had moved from his plan, which called for providing poor mothers with education, training and Government-subsidized jobs, if necessary, to supporting a measure that would cut $65 billion from welfare and ultimately erase any safety net. "It's like night and day," Ms. Edelman said.
The liberals rebelled. Ms. Edelman, a personal friend of the Clintons, wrote a scathing open letter to the President that was published in The Washington Post, saying, "What a tragic irony it would be for this regressive attack on children and the poor to occur on your watch."
Opponents of the welfare bill inside the Administration spread the word about the poverty study that Mr. Clinton had received from Dr. Shalala, and liberal Democrats in Congress called for its release. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York accused the Administration of deliberately suppressing the report. "Those involved will take this disgrace to their graves," he said.
Within days, the draft document was obtained by several news organizations. But a week later, after a request from House and Senate Democrats on the welfare conference committee, the President's Budget Director, Alice M. Rivlin, released her own study of the Senate bill. It showed that 1.2 million children could be pushed into poverty.
White House officials found themselves in the position of calling for improvements in the Senate bill while holding open the possibility that Mr. Clinton could approve it.
But Congress has now made this debate moot. While the welfare agreement that emerged from the conference committee would keep much of the framework of the Senate bill, it would increase the amount to be saved on welfare programs to $81.5 billion over five years and would reduce the money available for child care, the recession contingency fund and nutrition programs, Administration analysts said. It would require states to maintain 75 percent of their own welfare spending instead of 80 percent, except for states that succeed in moving mothers from welfare to work.
The President's aides say a welfare overhaul could emerge from a broader budget agreement following a veto.
But Republicans argue that a veto could leave Mr. Clinton going into 1996 without welfare legislation. Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who was a key negotiator for the House, said, "I think this could be his only shot."

HEADLINE: How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass: World Wide Web;
If Medium Is the Message, the Message Is the Web

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Associated Press was formed in the mid-19th century when a group of newspapers decided to invest jointly in a newfangled medium -- the telegraph -- to speed the collection and dissemination of information.
Last week, A.P. announced that it would adopt a newer-fangled medium -- the World Wide Web -- to begin distributing its articles and photographs over the global Internet. It was simply the latest, but perhaps most historically significant, move yet by an old-line media organization into the World Wide Web, the Internet multimedia information-retrieval system that appears on the verge of becoming a mass medium itself. 
 If the medium is the message, then the message these days is the World Wide Web.
In short order the Web, which three years ago was little more than a research tool for physicists and computer hobbyists, has flourished. It is being embraced by media concerns, consumer-product companies and businesses of various stripes that are creating thousands of so-called Web sites each month, with the number of computers playing host to one or more of these sites already exceeding 100,000.
Conservative estimates place the number of people who have used the Web in the millions, and it is not hard to find more breathless estimates in the tens of millions.
Capable of letting people use computers to send and receive text, sound, still images and video clips, the Web incorporates elements of the various print and electronic media that have preceded it. And yet, the Web is poised not to replace its predecessors but to take a place alongside them as a social, cultural and economic force in its own right.
Its complementary role is already evident: many radio stations and all the major television networks have Web sites promoting their programs and stars. Newspapers, including The New York Times, are devising cyberspace editions.
And few movies anymore are released without a promotional Web site, including "Goldeneye" the James Bond film that opened this weekend at theaters everywhere and on the Web at the address http:// www.mgmua.com/bond. The site offers the movie's theme song performed by Tina Turner, more than a dozen video clips from the film and illustrated biographies of the cast members.
Prime-time television commercials by Toyota and other advertisers now routinely include a Web address. And Procter & Gamble, whose advertising has long helped underwrite the mass media, has even staked out prime Web real estate by reserving addresses that include flu.com and toiletpaper.com.
"We are poised on the edge of a new medium," Clay Felker, director of the magazine program at the University of California at Berkeley's graduate journalism school, said. "And it's going to change the nature of how we acquire information."
As with each mass medium that has arrived before it, the Web has reached this threshold through a confluence of a key technology, a ready audience and a stream of corporate backers willing to bet that profitable businesses can be built on it. But few experts are willing to declare that the Web has taken its place in the mass media pantheon because the profitable business formulas have yet to be found.
Newspapers and magazines make money by selling individual copies, subscriptions and advertising space. Radio and television stations sell air time to those with money and a message. Movie theaters sell tickets. But on the Web so far, despite seed-money by adventurous advertisers and some tentative efforts to charge for access to sites or services, there is no certainty that this medium will achieve the critical mass that capitalism demands of its mass media.
"How do you make a business out of the World Wide Web?" asked Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., which has an experimental Web site called Pathfinder that offers selected contents from the company's magazines (http:// www.pathfinder.com). But because ad revenue alone is not carrying the freight, Time Inc. will begin testing ways to charge visitors to its site.
And yet, the technological prerequisites are firmly in place. The Web is an outgrowth of the Internet, which began as an academic research experiment in the late 1960's. For more than two decades the Internet remained largely inaccessible, used mainly by computer scientists and Pentagon researchers, university scholars and students.
Then came the World Wide Web.
Like the Internet, the Web began as a tool to let scientists easily and quickly share information. Conceived in the late 1980's by Tim Berners-Lee, who was then a software designer at CERN, the Swiss physics research center, the basic Web technology was first put to use in 1990.
The big breakthrough came in 1992, when student researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois created Mosaic, a simple software tool called a Web browser. Mosaic permitted access to information anywhere on the World Wide Web by letting the user point and click a computer mouse on highlighted words or images on the screen. The browser, which became available in commercial versions like Netscape Communications' Navigator, not only made Web sites easily accessible, it prompted businesses, organizations and even individuals to create new Web sites by the thousands.
Thus did the Web quickly become a standard and accepted way for the growing millions of the computer-literate to communicate and to entertain and inform themselves. And unlike each previous mass medium, the Web does not require its audience to be merely passive recipients of information.
For very little money, and with a modicum of computer skills, virtually anyone can create his or her own Web site. Anyone with a modem is potentially a global pamphleteer.
One consequence of this democratization is that the Web can be a remarkably anarchic forum compared with the old-style mass media. "Think of this as television colliding with the telephone party line," said Paul Saffo, a computer industry consultant at the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., research firm. "In terms of social consequences, the Web is a great experiment. It's going to deliver us community with a vengeance -- and we may find we don't want it."

HEADLINE: In a Move to Open Its Markets, China Pledges to Cut Tariffs on 4,000 Items Next Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Nov. 19

 BODY:
In one of its most substantial efforts to open its markets, China said today that it would cut tariffs next year on more than 4,000 items by an average of at least 30 percent.
China's promise captured the spotlight on a day in which leaders of 18 Pacific Rim nations endorsed a blueprint to achieve free trade in their vast region by the year 2020 using what they described as a new and unique voluntary approach. 
 "I believe the APEC meetings in Osaka were of historic significance in that they moved APEC from vision to action," said Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan, referring to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
To show their commitment, each nation announced a so-called initial action toward lowering its trade barriers. Rather than announcing bold new initiatives, however, many nations, including the United States, mainly listed actions they had already announced or taken.
While Washington has led the drive toward free trade, American officials explained that the United States had already taken many steps to open markets and now had less to do than other countries.
Other countries, including Japan, announced that they would speed up some tariff reductions that had already been approved. The big exception was China, which needs to bring its trading practices more in line with international standards to join the World Trade Organization. It announced several other measures in addition to the tariff cuts.
Vice President Al Gore, representing President Clinton, cautiously praised China's measures but said more would have to be done before the Chinese would be ready to join the World Trade Organization.
"This was a positive step down that pathway," Mr. Gore said. "There are others."
C. Fred Bergsten, a Washington economist and chairman of an advisory group to the economic forum, said "30 percent or more tariff cuts sound fairly impressive." But he said that more needed to be known, like what items will be subject to the cuts. He said China's tariffs average about 40 percent, so a 30 percent reduction is equivalent to about 12 percentage points.
Last week, the Clinton Administration handed China a detailed "road map" of what it must do to be eligible to join the World Trade Organization, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chinese officials have reacted positively to the road map and appear to want to work with it, American officials said.
The 18 leaders met in a guest house at Osaka Castle. They also tried their hands, somewhat awkwardly, at a traditional Japanese tea ceremony in the castle garden.
In what has become a tradition, the leaders dressed casually. At the 1993 meeting on Blake Island, near Seattle, leather jackets and scarves were in vogue. Last year in Indonesia the leaders wore batik shirts. This year they generally wore blazers and no ties. They were also allowed to wear their shoes, something that would be unacceptable in most Japanese guest houses.
How successful the economic forum will be at achieving its goal of free trade by 2010 for developed countries and 2020 for developing countries will not be known for many years. The "action agenda" released by the leaders today includes only guidelines and principles.
A good hint of how serious they are will come at next year's meeting, in the Philippines, where all the nations will have to present their plans for dismantling their own barriers. While these plans will be voluntary, the forum's members will make sure they are roughly "comparable."
"The Asia preference is to do things in a looser, less institutional, less contractual manner," said Tommy T. B. Koh, Ambassador at Large for Singapore.
Such loose and regionally based approaches to trade liberalization might become more prevalent because negotiating a formal worldwide treaty, as was done in the Uruguay Round of GATT, has become enormously cumbersome.
"We are reinventing the way you do trade liberalization," said Joan Spero, the United States Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, reiterated that the targets were not binding, saying, "We are not held down to this date."
In a sense that is true because there is no enforcement mechanism. Nor is the economic forum a true trade bloc like the European Union where member nations give up some of their own sovereignty.
That could mean that members will never completely end protection of certain industries. But by leaving things vague and voluntary, the forum was able to get off to a faster start on things that can be done.
"It makes the Uruguay round look like a slowpoke," said Dr. Bergsten, the economist. He said that forum members were supposed to begin dropping their barriers on Jan. 1, 1997, only about two years after the goal of free trade by 2020 was set at last year's meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. By contrast, he said, the Uruguay Round took about eight years from start to the beginning of implementation.
Those who favor the forum's approach say the free trade goal, if not a legal commitment, is a political one.
"It was a voluntary commitment in that nobody had a knee in their neck," said Gareth Evans, Foreign Minister of Australia. "That combination of self-interest and peer group pressure will produce the results in the Bogor declaration."

HEADLINE: Gore Says U.S. Will Keep Troop Strength in Japan at 47,000

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, filling in for President Clinton, reiterated today that the United States would maintain its troop level in Japan at 47,000, but he said Washington would consider moving some of them from Okinawa to other parts of the country.
"The American people strongly support continued U.S. presence here in Asia," Mr. Gore said at a news conference after a 50-minute meeting with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. The Vice President said he and Mr. Murayama had reaffirmed the importance of the troops to peace and stability in Asia. 
 Mr. Gore came here to attend today's meeting of the leaders of the 18 nations in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum after President Clinton canceled his trip to deal with the budget crisis in Washington.
The cancellation threatened to strain already tense relations between the two Governments, though not because of the usual trade disputes. The rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa, for which three American servicemen are on trial, has led to sharper calls in Japan for a reduction of the American bases on the southern island, which is home to about three-fifths of the American troops in the country.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Murayama had been scheduled to issue a declaration outlining the rationale for continuing the security treaty between the two nations. But the declaration has been postponed until the President reschedules his trip here, probably early next year.
"This is a matter of urgency," Mr. Murayama said at a separate news conference, adding that he hoped Mr. Clinton would come soon.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Murayama also said that a first meeting would be held in Tokyo on Monday by a special working group to discuss how to reduce the burden of the troops on the people of Okinawa. The committee, with two representatives from each Government, is scheduled to come up with recommendations within a year.
The Vice President also met with President Jiang Zemin of China, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa of Thailand.
Mr. Gore said that President Clinton's absence was not a snub of Japan or Asia and that the United States remained "deeply committed" to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. To help mollify any hurt feelings, Mr. Clinton held an interview with Japanese reporters in Washington on Friday, and it was televised here this weekend.

HEADLINE: Debating Legality of Plan For Cruise-Ship Gambling

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
For more than two weeks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been considering whether to allow gambling cruise ships to sail out of New York City, and he has pledged to make a decision by the end of the year.
If approved, the plan would revive legal casino gambling for the first time since gambling halls were banned by New York State in the 1840's, potentially bringing to New York City the tourism, jobs and tax revenues that cities and states across the country have increasingly viewed as economic jackpots. 
 But the preliminary plans before the Mayor for the four-hour "cruises to nowhere" face enormous hurdles that could prevent the ships from ever leaving port. For one thing, State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who has battled the Mayor over gambling issues for months, said last week that he believed the plan would violate a state law that prohibits gambling equipment anywhere in New York.
The State Legislature last summer approved a statewide ballot referendum that would legalize casinos in four areas of the state but not in New York City. That prompted Mr. Giuliani to criticize Mr. Silver and other legislators from New York City for voting for an amendment that he said would hurt the city by driving revenues upstate.
The cruise ships would skirt the state ban on casino gambling because gambling would not begin until the ships had sailed 45 minutes from the former Navy home port on Staten Island and dropped anchor in international waters, where gambling is legal. But, Mr. Silver said, "Once the gambling equipment came into New York State territory, it would be illegal."
But city officials were undaunted by the obstacle introduced by Mr. Silver. "The Mayor and the Deputy Mayor are quite used to a cascade of caterwauling from certain elected officials," said Forrest R. Taylor, chief of staff for John Dyson, the deputy mayor in charge of economic development.
"Rather than supporting the city in its efforts to retain jobs, create jobs and encourage private investment, they seek to put forth impediments to growth," Mr. Taylor said.
Noting that the Mayor "has not had the courtesy to share the plans with me," Mr. Silver said state law specifically prohibits the possession of "gambling devices," which are defined as "any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment which is used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity."
But city officials said that while city lawyers will carefully review the law, they believe that the ships would be legal as long as they did not carry slot machines. The law states that gambling devices can be transported as long as they are "in a sealed container."
New York Cruise Lines Inc., the parent company for Circle Line Sightseeing Yachts, and Mirage Resorts Inc., started discussing plans for gambling cruise ships with city officials a few months ago. Their tentative plans call for one or two 700-foot ships that would make three or four trips a day and that would carry between 1,000 and 1,500 passengers on each ship.
In exchange for the use of the city-owned port on Staten Island's north shore, the developers have agreed to help build an entertainment village near the port, where gamblers could park their cars and nongambling family members could visit shops, restaurants and a Staten Island museum. But officials from New York Cruise Lines and Mirage Resorts stressed that discussions are still in very early stages and no concrete proposal has been presented.
"There are a lot of issues that have to be settled first," said Alan M. Feldman, spokesman for Mirage Resorts, which operates four casinos in Nevada and plans to open a $500 million casino resort in Atlantic City. He said Mirage would not commit to the project until the city decided on rules of operation and its gaming tax rate, which would be levied on the casino's gross revenues.
The Mayor so far has reacted favorably, saying he has no moral objection to gambling.
Staten Island officials have expressed overwhelming support for the plan. "The waterfront has been wasting away for many decades now. It would be nice to see some new development that's esthetically pleasing and also brings economic benefit to Staten Island," said Borough President Guy V. Molinari.

HEADLINE: Russia's Barren Politics

 BODY:
It is disheartening, if not unsurprising, to learn that frivolous political campaigning is now among the primary American exports to Russia. As Russians move gingerly toward democracy and capitalism, the arrival of vacuous political campaigns was probably inevitable. The growth of inflation and violent crime was a warning that the transition from Communism would not be painless. Still, it seems a pity that these early years of Russian democracy should now be cursed by the kind of superficial politics that has made Americans despair about their own political process.
As Alessandra Stanley reported last week in The Times, next month's parliamentary elections have brought a wave of slick television advertising and Hollywood campaign stunts that might make even Madison Avenue image makers blanch. 
 Hammer, the American rapper, was the marquee performer at one campaign rally. He confessed afterward that he had no clue his performance was part of a political campaign, and members of the party that booked him, Our Home Is Russia, seemed at a loss to understand the connection between rap music and their centrist agenda.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist who first roared into prominence with a call to rebuild the Russian empire, is campaigning for re-election with a television ad that shows a steamy cabaret singer unzipping her blouse as she sings of her devotion to him.
This vaporous campaigning might be comical if it were not a reflection of the shallow character of Russian politics, and the desperation of candidates to separate themselves from a field of 5,000 Russians from 43 parties running for 450 seats in the lower house of Parliament.
The unwieldy field is a tribute to Russia's enthusiasm for democratic elections. But with so many fundamental questions about their political and economic system unanswered, and President Boris Yeltsin in limbo after two heart attacks this year, Russians deserve a more serious campaign.
The new Parliament will play a major role in shaping Russia's future. Although the legislature is overshadowed by a strong presidency under Russia's new Constitution, Mr. Yeltsin's weakened condition seems likely to afford lawmakers greater influence, at least until presidential elections in June. The country is entering a critical period when reform should be consolidated, but may be slowed or even overturned.
The Communist Party, recast but still a threat to reform, has quietly made a comeback, and could win a large bloc of seats in the new Parliament. While Mr. Zhirinovsky has lost appeal because of his erratic behavior, other nationalist candidates may do well next month. Reformer parties remain fractured and disorganized.
This hardly seems a time to turn politics over to cabaret singers and rap musicians. There are some American customs Russians can live without. Vacant political campaigns are one.

HEADLINE: Open Alaska's Wildlife Refuge

BYLINE: By Tony Knowles; Tony Knowles, a Democrat, is Governor of Alaska.

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska

 BODY:
As President Clinton and Congressional leaders sort out their differences on the budget reconciliation bill, there's one provision on which both sides can be a winner: environmentally responsible development in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Oil and gas likely hidden under this remote sliver of land along Alaska's far northeast corner could make a major dent in the nation's budget and trade deficits and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most in the continental United States. Despite predictions by some environmentalists, developing the refuge can be done right. 
 Most Alaskans make a living from the land, and have a special bond with it. Throughout the vast remoteness of much of the state, Alaskans depend on subsistence hunting and fishing to put food on their tables. For many, this subsistence fulfills a centuries-old cultural imperative.
For these reasons, we believe our environment and economy are complementary, not contradictory. This bond means we have gone to extraordinary lengths to balance the development of resources with protection of the environment. That's why, while other states have dammed their rivers or polluted them, Alaska has the world's greatest wild-salmon fishery. That's why wildlife flourish near Prudhoe Bay, where a quarter of America's oil is produced.
A sound resource policy is based on good science, conservation and broad public support. We have applied this test to logging in southeast Alaska's Tongass National Forest. In the face of intense political pressure, we have insisted on protecting the forest for those who depend on it for subsistence, tourism, fishing, mining, recreation -- as well as logging.
This same balance and respect for our land would be exercised in the Arctic refuge. The Interior Department has estimated that less than a tenth of 1 percent of the 19 million acres would be directly affected by development.
Technology has advanced so dramatically that the development "footprint" would be small. Today's Alaska's oil industry technology is the laptop, microchip version of its worldwide counterparts.
We have the technology to do it right, but do we have the political will? I will insist on strict measures to protect the refuge's habitat and wildlife, and on a financial guarantee from oil leasers to return the affected area to its natural state.
Because the Arctic refuge is a national treasure, all Americans deserve to benefit from its assets.
According to the predictions of the Congressional Budget Office, the development would generate leasing income of $1.3 billion, based on $24-a-barrel oil by the year 2010. Royalties on production could total far more.
In addition, a portion of the Federal Government's share of revenues should go to a National Heritage Trust. At a time when some are proposing to sell national parks, these proceeds could be used to preserve them and other critical habitat.
Alaska's political leaders have agreed to reduce the state's share of revenues from 90 percent to 50 percent for this project. (When Alaska joined the union, Congress recognized that development of natural resources was the only way to open up a raw frontier, and that's why the state was allotted a 90 percent return on revenue from its Federal land.)
Energy Department and other studies predict that the development of the refuge could create 200,000 to 735,000 new jobs. Most will be in factories, refineries and high-tech industries in the continental United States.
Alaskans are committed to finding the right combination to protect the state and use its resources. We will do no less in the Arctic refuge.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Investigate Gambling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The public's gorge has begun to rise at the morally corrupting spread of gambling in America.
Connecticut's Senate firmly rejected the bid by a phony aboriginal tribe to extend its glitzy casino empire beyond the confines of its "reservation." And in referendums from Massachusetts to Washington State, voters turned down get-rich-quick schemes of the gambling lobby. 
 In the nation's capital, the movement to stop state-sponsored gambling has put forward legislation creating a bipartisan commission to study the wave of gambling. If people in their localities knew the experience of others gulled by gamblers into dreams of painless taxation, the immoral wave might recede.
The President is on board. "Too often, public officials view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues," Mr. Clinton wrote to anti-gambling leaders in Congress, "without focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs."
Bob Dole also "supports the national commission approach." Government Affairs Chairman Ted Stevens tells me "we have to put the genie back in the bottle" and -- after he funds the commission properly -- "It'll pass this Congress."
In the House, Virginia Republican Frank Wolf's commission bill is in the hands of Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde. This responsive "old bull" was astounded at the groundswell against gambling's spread; conservatives see lotteries and casinos as immoral public policy and liberals see them as a whopping tax on the poor.
Though they cannot stop the momentum toward a national study, casino operators have been trying to gut the bill and rig the commission, using American Indians as a front.
To block examination of gambling's corruption and political payoffs, they began with Representative Sonny Bono, next to Newt Gingrich the most potent Republican fund-raiser in Congress, who has about 500 members of the Agua Caliente tribe voting in his Palm Springs, Calif., district.
With the help of Massachusetts liberal Barney Frank, a Judiciary member in thrall to Indian casino interests, Bono passed along casino-generated amendments that would stop the commission from looking into any illegal gambling or the computerized type that hooks teen-agers. The gamblers also wanted to deny "an assessment of the impact of pathological or problem gambling" -- which wrecks families and ruins lives.
A Bono amendment especially important to the crapshooting crowd (represented by Nevada lobbyist and former Republican national chairman Frank Fahrenkopf) would have deleted the provision "to make an assessment and review of the political contributions and influence of gambling businesses and promoters on the development of public policy regulating gambling."
But then a sand-roots Traditional Values Coalition in Bono's district attracted the attention of The Desert Sun. Suddenly the Congressman abandoned the casino interests and withdrew all his amendments. Morality discovered its muscle.
What's going on here is organized gambling's attempted manipulation of politicians to pull the teeth of any investigation. The casino operators used the same technique 20 years ago, when they staffed with patsies a Senate study of national policy toward gambling, and afterward rewarded the director with a lucrative Nevada consultancy.
Thwarted for the time being by the good citizens of Bono's district, the ripoff artists who call themselves "the gaming industry" used money and connections to take the offensive on another front.
Nevada's Richard Bryan, the Senate's big ethicist, slipped a provision in a telecommunications bill to remove restrictions on gambling advertising -- thereby helping hard-sell this addiction, surely as bad as booze or tobacco, to children. ("Come to the riverboat, kids -- win a fortune!")
When the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling (800 664-2680) blew the whistle on the sleazy Bryan amendment, the Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed urged legislators "to use your influence to strike this gambling advertisement provision in the House-Senate conference committee."
The gamblers own more than a few politicians, and their Indian front has often subdued liberals. But the gorge rises and the tide turns.

HEADLINE: For Bosnia's President, An Agonizing Choice

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Twice before, Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia, has signed agreements on the division of his country, only to fight on for the unitary state of which he dreams. Today, after 43 months of conflict, he faced the same agonizing choice between an imperfect peace and an uphill war.
The American-brokered peace he is now being offered falls far short of the "liberation" of Bosnia of which he has often spoken. It would involve a de facto division of Bosnia with almost the half the country going to the Serbs and the deployment of about 60,000 NATO troops along the dividing line. 
 In effect, despite the proposed establishment of central government institutions and assurances from the United States that it will defend the unity of Bosnia, the risk is real for the Bosnian President that he will be remembered as the man who ultimately signed away the state for which he has long fought.
Officials close to the negotiations described a man who has agonized in recent days over the possibility of peace, torn between the prospect of extreme isolation in the event of a decision to fight on and a deep insecurity about history's judgment if he does finally opt for peace.
"Izetbegovic seems mired in the past," said one participant in the talks. "Unlike the Serbs, he never talks about economic reconstruction. Defiance and struggle have been the story of his life and he seems to have immense difficulty in envisaging the leap to peace."
A lawyer and a devout Muslim, Mr. Izetbegovic, 70, has held himself relatively aloof from the negotiations. While Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, has adopted the Officers' Club restaurant on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as his second home, the Bosnian President has retained a cool distance that has frustrated his American interlocutors.
The United States delegation, led by Richard C. Holbrooke, an Assistant Secretary of State, has turned instead to Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister. Mr. Silajdzic has been apt to wander in and out of Mr. Holbrooke's suite on a casual basis -- something Mr. Izetbegovic would never do.
But this American approach has reinforced divisions within the Bosnian delegation -- strains that have made any decision difficult and could make Bosnia unstable in the months to come.
"The Americans have tried to use Silajdzic because they see him as the guy who can make these negotiations work," said Muhamed Sacirbey, who resigned as Bosnia's Foreign Minister on Saturday.
"Silajdzic wants to claim all the credit he can. But the fact is that Izetbegovic is the one who would take the blame if any peace settlement is seen as a bad one at home."
The leap to a settlement would indeed be an enormous one for Mr. Izetbegovic. Bosnia has never known a day of peace since it gained independence in April 1992 and the remarkable struggle of Bosnia's Muslims has consolidated Mr. Izetbegovic's hold on power. Peace in turn could eventually lead to questioning of his rule.
There are many elite units of the Bosnian Army made up of refugees who have been motivated in the war mainly by the dream of recapturing the towns from which they were chased in 1992. Under a settlement they would have to abandon that struggle, with places like Prijedor, Banja Luka and Zvornik still in Serbian hands. Their frustration could lead to instability in Bosnia.
Although the Clinton Administration has made it clear that it expects indicted war criminals to be tried, Mr. Izetbegovic appears to have no cast-iron guarantee that the leaders of the Serbs who have hounded and killed Muslim civilians in repeated acts of barbarity will face punishment. Without some such justice, he could face an outcry.
President Izetbegovic, who was twice imprisoned in Communist Yugoslavia for leading Muslim movements, has wrestled with such difficulties before. He has always been torn between his desire for a centralized Bosnian state governed from Sarajevo and the grudging awareness that he does not have the military force or the support to attain that goal.
On March 18, 1992, three weeks before war broke out, he signed an agreement in Lisbon on the division of Bosnia into three cantons -- one Croatian, one Serbian, one Muslim -- only to renege on it on his return to Sarajevo. If the accord had held, it is conceivable that war might have been avoided.
A year later, on March 24, 1993, he agreed to the Vance-Owen plan, another proposal for the cantonization of Bosnia. This was ultimately rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. A few months later, Mr. Izetbegovic agreed to the creation of what amounted to a Muslim ministate on part of Bosnia, only for his own Parliament to reject this idea.
Since then, Bosnia has built up a credible army which, backed by the Croats, has secured some notable victories over the once-dominant Serbs. But the goal of that army -- the "liberation" of Bosnia from the separatist Serbs led by Gen. Ratko Mladic -- has not been attained. Deep misgivings are certain to lurk within its ranks.
The alternative to peace now, however, would almost certainly be grim. American support for the Bosnian Government would probably become muted. Croatian help would not be forthcoming because the conflict between Serbs and Croats that lay at the heart of Yugoslavia's disintegration is now largely settled. Promised economic help would be denied. An exhausted population would have to fight on.
"Izetbegovic knows this is his last, best chance," said one person at the talks. "But defiance has been the theme of his career. He is deeply divided within himself at the prospect of peace. He may not be the man to lead his people into a new era."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE SCENE;
With Prayer and a Dictionary, Congress Moves Past the Tumult

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
After a week in which part of the Federal Government shut down on Tuesday, two members of Congress brawled on Friday and Democrats spent the better part of an afternoon staging a noisy sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives, the Senate opened a rare Sunday session today with its chaplain praying for divine intervention to resolve the political impasse.
"A house divided against itself cannot stand," the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie said. "We acknowledge that presently we are a divided Government." 
 Out of earshot of Mr. Ogilvie's prayer, White House negotiators and the Republican leaders in Congress spent the day making offers, counteroffers and counter-counteroffers while tourists jammed the public galleries and hallways of the Capitol, one of the few landmarks not closed by the shutdown.
Just before 7 P.M., in a span of five minutes, the Senate approved two deals on a voice vote: one that reopens all of the Government on Monday and a second that would keep the Government going until Dec. 15 to give Congress and the President time to work out a permanent deal.
Moments before Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican majority leader, announced the deals on the Senate floor and called for the voice votes, he huddled with Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, to work out a final point: should the bill read "will" or "shall."
Holding a dictionary between them, they pored through its pages. After a minute, Mr. Daschle waved his hand as if to say, have it your way, and Mr. Dole's chief of staff crossed out "will" and wrote in "shall."
Speaker Newt Gingrich recalled the House later and it approved the one-day spending bill on a voice vote, and the President signed it late tonight. The House will vote on the second agreement on Monday.
The day began with a Republican offer on the table: a terse, two-paragraph deal that the leaders had sent to the White House the night before that would commit the President and Congress to a seven-year balanced budget, to be certified by the Congressional Budget Office.
But the offer also included movement on one of the sticking points between the Clinton Administration and the Republicans, the reliance on the budget office.
The second paragraph of the Republican offer allowed that the verification that a fiscal plan would balance the budget would be based on the budget office's "most current economic and technical assumptions" and after consultation and review by other Government and private experts, including the Office of Management and Budget, the White House-controlled agency whose balanced-budget figures President Clinton currently favors.
At midafternoon, as Mr. Ogilvie was delivering his prayer, offering a special appeal of wisdom for Mr. Dole, Mr. Gingrich and President Clinton, a White House negotiating team led by the chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, was in a nearby office fashioning the two counteroffers.
One proposal would have differed with the Republicans' offer by adding eight words: "It is the sense of the Congress that . . ." Such language would not bind either the White House or Congress to delivering on the promise of a balanced budget.
The second one, which was eventually accepted by the Republicans with some modifications, contained a string of White House conditions on Medicare, Medicaid, education and environment.
"It's our best good-faith offer," Senator Daschle, the Senate Democratic minority leader, told reporters.
But within an hour, the Republican leaders, cloistered in Mr. Dole's office, had mulled the Democratic offer and sent an amended version of it back to the White House.
"The envelope is licked, but we haven't sealed it," Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee and one of the principal negotiators.
As negotiators conducted their political horse-trading, the Senate carried on its first Sunday session in five years and only the 17th in its history.
The last time the Senate met on a Sunday was on Oct. 27, 1990, for a 5-hour, 17-minute debate on the Clean Air Bill. The first time was on March 3, 1861, when members met to discuss slavery and the Constitution.
There was little discussion today, and when there was some, it was on the weeklong partial shutdown of the Government, the longest time in the nation's history, and the accompanying political farce.
"It's a food fight," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. "Mothers wouldn't approve of their sons behaving in the ways that we've seen happen, especially wrestling matches on the floor of the House of Representatives and a great deal of disparagement of integrity and character and personal attacks that are being mounted on both sides."
From the other side of the aisle, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said, "We have a situation where we have become the laughing stock of the world."
Several members rose in support of legislation that would insure that paychecks for members of Congress were cut off during Government shutdowns.
Under current law, members of Congress, along with the President and Supreme Court Justices, are considered essential and must be paid during shutdowns. Also, members of Congress get their paychecks, about $11,100 each, on the first of the month, rather than every two weeks, as most Federal employees do.
There were reassurances from the floor, by Mr. Dole and others, that the 800,000 workers who have been furloughed by the shutdown would be paid in full for any days of work they have missed, and that was made part of the deal.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform That Can Work;
For a New W.P.A.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Intense disagreement over what to do about Government assistance to the poor is a major cause of the budget crisis. Eddy currents from this debate appear in the comments by Charles Murray (Op-Ed, Nov. 14) and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (letter, Nov. 16), but nowhere is there a credible solution to the problems of poverty, crime and the wasted potential of the unemployed. 
 There is a solution with a record of success waiting for us in the history books. This is the idea of Government-financed jobs for the unskilled, cast in the mold of the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930's Roosevelt Administration.
What money is spent would soon lead to a massive drop in the costs of welfare, prisons and the inefficiency of social disruption. If heavy physical labor for rebuilding streets, parks and so on, were involved, males would be favored for these jobs, which would strongly tend to restore family structure.
This is in sharp contrast to the present situation of both welfare and low-skill jobs, where females are favored, but males are left unemployed and angry.
It is about time that our intellectual and political leaders proposed this constructive move, instead of wrestling endlessly over negative propositions.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET;
Excerpts From President's Comments on Budget Deal

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's remarks yesterday on the agreement to end the partial shutdown of the Federal Government, delivered in the White House press briefing room:
I have made clear from the beginning my principles in this budget debate. We must balance the budget, but we must do it in a way that is good for our economy and that maintains our values. That means we have to do it without devastating cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, in education and the environment. And we have to do it without raising taxes on working families. 
 This agreement reflects my principles. And for the first time, the Republican leaders in Congress have acknowledged the importance of those principles. As I have said throughout this debate, I could only agree to move forward if that occurred. Tonight represents the first sign of their willingness to move forward without forcing unacceptable cuts in health care, education and the environment on the American people. The Republican budget, which was passed just yesterday, clearly does not come close to meeting that test, as I have said repeatedly. Therefore, I will veto that budget.
As you know, I have expressed strong doubts that the budget can be balanced in seven years if we use the current Republican Congressional budget assumptions. But I am nevertheless committed to working in the coming weeks to see if we can reach common ground on balancing the budget. The key is that nothing will be agreed to unless all elements are agreed to. I simply cannot sign a budget that devastates Medicare to the elderly or Medicaid to senior citizens and disabled people and poor children, that robs educational opportunity or educational standards from our children in the future or that hurts our environment. And I can't support a tax increase on working families.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT AND G.O.P. AGREE TO END FEDERAL SHUTDOWN AND TO NEGOTIATE A BUDGET

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The White House and the Republican-controlled Congress agreed tonight on a stopgap spending measure to reopen Government operations after a six-day shutdown, with President Clinton accepting the Republicans' goal of balancing the Federal budget in seven years but insisting on language intended to protect his priorities in long-term negotiations.
After a weekend of intense talks, counteroffers and intermittent standoffs, the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, walked onto the floor about 6:40 P.M. and flashed a thumbs-up sign. 
 The compromise language, which will bring some 800,000 employees back to work on Monday, provides money to keep the Government running at 75 percent of current spending through Dec. 15 and pays Federal workers for their furlough days. But negotiators put off any agreement on extending the Federal debt ceiling to allow the Government to borrow money in the bond markets.
At best, tonight's agreement merely paved the way for an intense debate over the broader bill the Republicans passed last week for balancing the budget by 2002, which Mr. Clinton threatened once again tonight to veto as too harsh, and the stalemate could repeat itself next month if no overall agreement on taxes and spending is reached.
"The real winners tonight are the American people," Mr. Clinton said at the White House after the agreement was announced, "because now we can have an open, honest, straightforward discussion about how best to balance the budget."
Mr. Clinton insisted that he had not given up any of his leverage in the budget fight ahead. "Nothing will be agreed to unless all elements are agreed to," he said.
But Republicans were clearly elated by what they saw as the President's central concession: accepting as a clear policy goal balancing the budget in seven years, something he has only intermittently embraced in the past, generally saying he preferred to balance it in 9 or 10 years. What the President described as flexibility, the Republicans described as an irretrievable pledge.
The Republicans also preserved their right to use the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office in calculating the cuts needed to reach a balanced budget. To satisfy the White House, they pledged to update such calculations after consulting with the White House's Office of Management and Budget. The differences between the two sets of estimates, while tiny in economic terms, have huge revenue consequences.
Mr. Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and their top negotiators could barely contain their enthusiasm. Asked at a Capitol Hill news conference "Who blinked?" a couple of members of the Republican team called out, "It's seven years!"
Mr. Gingrich described the agreement as "one of the great achievements in the history of America," and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, clenched two fists in the air and exulted: "All I can say is, 'Yes!' "
For their part, the Republicans agreed to the White House's suggestion to append a list of programs that must be protected for any seven-year budget to be acceptable. Indeed, they added a number of items to the list, which ultimately stated that such a budget "must protect future generations, insure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans and the environment," and "shall adopt tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future economic growth."
In a rare Sunday session of the Senate, Mr. Dole said, "What we've agreed to in a very bipartisan, nonpartisan way is a very satisfactory conclusion to what has been a very tense situation the last several days." Both sides acknowledged that negotiations had grown acriminous, with increasing political risks to both Mr. Clinton and Congress, as the shutdown of many Government services dragged on.
But the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said: "The most important thing is that we have reopened Government. In addition to this we have preserved our options." He added: "We have established a framework for negotiations; nothing will be agreed to until everything is agreed to."
Mr. Clinton reminded reporters at the White House tonight that he had expressed "strong doubts" that the seven-year timetable for balancing the budget could be realized. But he said he and Congressional Republicans, had agreed to work "to see if we can reach common ground."
"Tonight represents the first sign of their willingness to move forward without forcing unacceptable cuts in health care, education and the environment on the American people," Mr Clinton said.
He added: "Tomorrow the Government will go back to work and now the debate will begin in earnest on how to balance the budget in a way that is consistent with the interests and the values of the American people."
Mr. Panetta spent the afternoon negotiating on Capitol Hill, proposing the language that helped break the logjam. He offered Republican budget leaders two options in which the President would embrace the general goal of balancing the budget in seven years. The first option included language specifying that such a goal would be a nonbinding "sense of Congress," while the second omitted that language but included a list of programs the President wanted to protect.
Congressional parliamentarians have always agreed that attaching a balanced budget proviso to a stopgap spending measure would be nonbinding because the ultimate decisions would be made in individual appropriations and the giant tax and spending bill is yet to be negotiated. But the White House wanted the political cover of pinning such a goal on Congress, so as not to surrender the President's room to maneuver when negotiating details of the budget.
In the end, the Republicans chose the second option, rewriting the language about protecting spending priorities in slightly different terms to fit their free-enterprise philosophy, and, for good measure, added areas like agriculture, national defense and veterans programs as priorities subject to protection. That formed the basis of the final deal.
As a technical matter, both houses of Congress passed tonight, on voice votes, and Mr. Clinton signed, a one-day spending bill to assure the Government would reopen Monday morning. That is because the House leadership called a recess on Saturday that let members go home, and not enough could be rounded up tonight for the roll-call vote needed to approve the month-long spending bill, though the Senate did so and then adjourned for its Thanksgiving recess.
In the past 48 hours, both sides had come to the conclusion that they would only lose in public opinion if the stalemate dragged on. Even before the agreement on the stopgap spending measure tonight, Mr. Clinton signed two more appropriations bills that Congress had sent him over the weekend, one to finance the operations of the legislative branch and the other to operate the White House, Treasury Department and Postal Service.
Those would have brought about 143,000 employees of those agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and Customs Service, back to work on Monday even if no deal were reached on short-term spending, and administrative actions would have brought another 100,000 employees back to work in Social Security, veterans affairs and other offices.
Altogether, Mr. Clinton has now signed six of the 13 annual appropriations bills to finance the Government's operations. The temporary spending measure was needed because those bills had not been finished, and deep disagreements remain on several, both between Congress and the White House and between House and Senate negotiators.
Tonight, Congressional leaders reflected on such lingering disagreements as they viewed the work ahead.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, likened the negotiations just completed to "a pickup football game outside the Super Bowl stadium." Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee, said, "While this is a good agreement, it really requires a lot of heavy lifting between now and the 15th day of December."
Still, resolving the short-term crisis had come to seem paramount. While early public opinion polls showed more Americans blamed Congress than Mr. Clinton for the shutdown, the White House faced increasing pressure from many moderate and conservative Democrats in Congress who were reluctant to vote against a stopgap spending measure solely on the grounds that it included the goal of balancing the budget in seven years.
The consensus on Capitol Hill was that Mr. Clinton would have had a hard time sustaining a veto if Democrats were given another chance to vote on such a proviso, since the last one passed in the House just six-votes short of the two-third margin needed to override a Presidential veto.

Chart: "AT ISSUE: Making Government Move Again"
President Clinton and Congressional Republicans reached an agreement last night on the structure of a compromise spending bill to allow the Federal Government to reopen.
 
IMPASSE
As a condition for financing the Government, Congressional Republicans had demanded that Mr. Clinton agree to balance the budget in seven years using the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Clinton said this would force unacceptable cuts.
 
PROPOSAL
The White House yesterday offered to agree to the terms of Republicans if they would protect programs Mr. Clinton has made a priority, including Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. The President also wanted to avoid tax increases on working families and to have the Congressional Budget Office consult with the White House budget office and outside experts on its economic assumptions.
 
RESOLUTION
The Republicans accepted Mr. Clinton's offer after rewording it to -- call for tax relief, rather than preventing tax increases, for instance -- and to add to the list of protected items to be which now includes agriculture and the military, as well as promising a welfare overhaul.
 
NEXT
Today, Congress plans to pass a spending bill that will keep Government running through Dec. 15th and pay Federal workers for their time off. President Clinton and Congress then will take up their disagreements on the larger budget bill passed last week, which Mr. Clinton has promised to veto. (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Some new English-language magazines are aimed at Hispanic readers earning more than $30,000.

BYLINE: By Kathryn Jones 

 BODY:
UPWARDLY mobile, college-educated Hispanic readers used to have a limited choice of national magazines that spoke directly to them in English.
But two new magazines aimed at middle-class and affluent Hispanic men and women have hit newsstands and mail boxes this year, and more are on the way. 
 Latina Style, aimed at Hispanic women aged 18 to 50 with household incomes of more than $60,000, made its debut in May as a quarterly and plans to go bimonthly next year. And Si, a quarterly for affluent Hispanic men and women that has a format similar to that of Vanity Fair, published its first issue in September. Both magazines are in English.
In addition, People magazine, which is owned by Time Warner, is developing a prototype general-interest magazine for Hispanic readers that it hopes to test in the first quarter. Moderna, a bilingual women's magazine, is backed by Hispanic magazine and may begin publication as early as next month. And Latina, a bilingual women's magazine, will begin publishing in the spring under a joint venture with Essence Communications Inc., whose Essence magazine is one of the largest publications aimed at African-Americans.
The new magazines are aiming at the 9.5 million Hispanic people in the United States with household incomes of $30,000 to $120,000 -- almost half of the Hispanic population of 22 million, according to an analysis of 1990 census data by Hispanic Business magazine.
While there are many Spanish-language publications, only a few national magazines aimed at Hispanic readers have been in English, such as Hispanic magazine, Hispanic Business and Vista, a Sunday newspaper supplement.
Strong reaction to coverage of the slaying of the Tejano singing star Selena helped advertisers appreciate the Hispanic market, some editors said.
People magazine sold 420,000 copies of a Southwest edition in which Selena was featured on half of the cover, and 2 million copies of a special Selena "tribute" issue. The magazine had considered expanding into the Hispanic market; the response to the Selena coverage "really kicked us into high gear," a People spokeswoman, Susan Ollinick, said.
The new magazines found in their market research that most acculturated Hispanic people -- immigrants who had been in the United States for more than 10 years, or second- and third-generation residents -- often used Spanish as a second language; English was their first.
"These magazines are more reflective of the growth of the Hispanic middle class," said Hector Cantu, managing editor of Hispanic Business, which is based in Santa Barbara, Calif., and follows the Hispanic publishing industry. "These people speak primarily English. It's a growing segment, and it's growing phenomenally."
General-interest mainstream magazines have largely ignored that market, Mr. Cantu said. "They're giving these new magazines a chance to come in," he said.
Indeed, Latina and Latina Style were both started by women who could not find a magazine that addressed their interests.
"I was a lawyer and found there was no magazine for me," said Christy Haubegger, president of the Latina-Essence joint venture. "I want to read about raising my son bilingually. I want to update my mother's enchilada recipe with less fat. And if I look at makeup being modeled on a 15-year-old blonde girl, that doesn't do anything for me."
Advertisers will spend about $186.5 million this year on Hispanic print media, up from $177.9 million in 1994, according to Hispanic Business. Thatis a small piece of the total $1.06 billion in advertising expenditures estimated for all Hispanic media this year. Most ad dollars in Hispanic media go to Spanish-language television and radio.
"I wouldn't touch a Spanish-language magazine with a 10-foot pole," said Anna Maria Arias, owner, publisher and editor of Latina Style, which is based in Washington. "A number of Spanish-language and bilingual publications have gone belly up. They have to compete against Spanish-language TV."
Analysts said that not all of the new publications might survive.
"If we have a constriction in the U.S. economy, the first to be hurt will be the entries into the smaller market segments," said Dick Tobin, president of Strategy Research, a marketing research company based in Miami. "We've tried to dissuade some new entries from getting into the market unless they have a lot of capital.
"There's a lot of risk," he added.
Mr. Cantu noted that some start-ups had gone out of business because their approach was too broad. That is why the new magazines are aiming for a niche, he said.
"The magazines are being forced to take a more narrow market approach -- advertisers will demand it," Mr. Cantu said. "It's not going to be wise for anyone to spend money on a broad segment."
A lack of advertising was one reason that several major newspapers, including The Daily News in New York, recently decided to close or cut back their Spanish-language editions.
The first issues of Latina Style and Si are not bursting with ads, but they have attracted some major advertisers, including Nordstrom Inc., the AT&T Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company, the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the General Motors Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., Estee Lauder Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company.
"We're very cognizant that the Hispanic market is increasing and will continue to increase over the next 10 years," said Brooke White, a spokeswoman for Nordstrom, the Seattle-based specialty retailer, which is buying a year's worth of ads in Latina Style. "The Hispanic market has a lot of spending power."

HEADLINE: 3 Are Held in Slayings of Mother and Children

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS 

DATELINE: ADDISON, Ill., Nov. 19

 BODY:
Three people were charged today in a triple slaying here in which a full-term infant was cut alive from the womb while his mother was stabbed and shot to death, the police said. The authorities said the infant, a boy who they said was found later with one of the suspects, was in good health.
Deborah Evans, 28, was killed by a former boyfriend, the boyfriend's cousin and the cousin's girlfriend, the Addison police and prosecutors in the State's Attorney's Office for DuPage County said. 
 The three are accused of stabbing Ms. Evans and her daughter, Samantha, 10, in the family's apartment in this quiet suburb west of Chicago late Thursday. The mother was also shot in the head. Left unharmed was Ms. Evans's 17-month-old son, Jordan. The bodies were discovered by Ms. Evans's boyfriend when he returned home from work about 2 A.M. on Friday.
The body of Ms. Evans's 8-year-old son, Joshua, was found the next day in an alley in the nearby town of Naywood. Joshua had been repeatedly stabbed with several different instruments and tortured before his death, said Dr. Joseph Cogan, the Cook County assistant medical examiner.
Joseph Birkett, who led the investigation for the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office, declined to comment on a motive during a news conference today. But he did say that one of the men arrested, Laverne Ward, 24, was the father of Ms. Evans's toddler, Jordan.
Mr. Ward is a cousin of another the other man held, Fedell Caffey, 22. Mr. Caffey is the boyfriend of the third person arrested, Jacqueline Annette Williams, 28. Ms. Williams was the first of the three to be arrested, when she was stopped by the police outside her house in another suburb. The police would not comment on why they suspected her.
They found with her the infant who had been taken from Ms. Evans's womb. The child had been scheduled for an induced delivery on Monday and had already been named Elijah.
The infant was in a suburban hospital. Jordan Evans was in the custody of the Illinois Child Welfare Agency. The police said he had watched his mother's killing.
A spokesman for the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office said that the office had been deluged with calls about the possibility of devil worship in the case but that possibility had been eliminated.
The DuPage County Coroner, Richard Ballinger, said on Saturday that only someone with medical training could have accomplished the surgical removal of the fetus successfully. The police would not comment on whether any of those arrested had such training. All are unemployed.
The three were charged with murder and aggravated kidnapping. A bond hearing was set for Monday. Mr. Birkett said all could face the death penalty.
Susan Carlson, an obstetrics nurse at Central DuPage Hospital in nearby Winfield, Ill., said it was "a miracle" that the fetus was not injured during the attack. "Since it was full term, you would expect it to be fine once it was removed, as long as it was fed," she said. "But it is wonderful it survived."
A memorial of teddy bears, cards, footballs and basketballs was propped up today outside the family's apartment complex, The Associated Press reported. A family friend, Earl Nix, added a fishing rod because he had planned to take Joshua fishing next summer. "Me and Josh were always talking about fishing together," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The body of Joshua Evans, 8, was found in an alley about 10 miles from his home, where his mother and sister were slain.; The killings of Deborah Evans, 28, and her daughter, Samantha, 10, on Thursday were planned, the authorities said, but had nothing to do with drugs or devil worship. Mrs. Evans's fetus was cut from her womb and found, alive, with one of three people charged in the slayings.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Sues City Comptroller Over Sale of Water System

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Making good on an earlier threat, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council have filed suit against City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, seeking to force him to approve their plans to sell the city's water system to a quasi-public agency.
The suit, filed on Friday and announced yesterday, represents an unusual alliance between the Giuliani administration and the Council, who have twice gone to court against each other, battling over their powers. In this case, however, both want to spend the money that would come from the sale, and they assert that the Comptroller exceeded his authority in blocking it. 
 The Mayor first proposed the water sale in April to raise $1 billion, the amount left over after the city pays off its long-term water and sewer bonds, by allowing the New York City Water Board, a state-created entity controlled by the Mayor, to buy the city's pipes, reservoirs and sewers for $2.3 billion. As part of this year's budget, Mr. Giuliani and the Council agreed to use $400 million of the proceeds for major construction projects, including $200 million to repair crumbling schools.
Mr. Hevesi's signature, however, was needed before the water board could issue and sell the bonds needed to finance the purchase. But in June he announced that he would not approve the bond sale, saying it represented the kind of gimmickry that led to the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
The decision led to several weeks of invective and threats to sue. After five months with no sign of a retreat by the Comptroller, the administration went to State Supreme Court on Friday to force him to sign. In its court papers, the administration says the Comptroller cannot stop the issuance of bonds simply because he does not like their purpose.
Citing the state water finance law, it says he can object only on narrow technical grounds, like the type of bonds to be issued or their interest rates.
"The comptroller is not empowered to question the wisdom of the transaction," said Paul A. Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel.
Mr. Hevesi said he intended to fight the suit through the courts to protect the definition of his powers and to prevent the sale.
"I can object for reasons large and small," he said yesterday. "They can be reasons involving the terms and conditions of the deal, on the one hand, or that it's bad public policy or illegal, on the other hand." He repeated his belief that the city was selling one of its most precious assets for a short-term gain, calling it the "rawest kind of politics" to use the system to balance the budget and get Mr. Giuliani through the next election.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE DEAL;
Who Blinked? They Did. No, They Did.

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
When the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, took his latest offers for ending a Government shutdown to Republican leaders of the budget committees at midafternoon on Sunday, his negotiating team was not especially optimistic. They made two modest proposals that would commit President Clinton to the Republicans' goal of balancing the budget in seven years.
But, they recalled today, each offer also included an escape clause big enough to seem a sucker punch. The first would have cloaked such a commitment in a nonbinding "sense of Congress" resolution that would not require the President's signature. 
 The second stipulated that the goal of balancing the budget would be valid "if and only if" the President and Congress agreed that such a budget would "protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment and doesn't raise taxes on working families."
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the moderate Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, immediately cast aside the laundry list in the second proposal as just so many unacceptable wiggle-words, participants recalled, and the session around a conference table in Senator Bob Dole's office soon broke up.
But less than three hours later, that laundry list became the basis for a final deal, reworked and expanded a bit by the Republicans in a palindrome of a paragraph in which each element of agreement depends on every other one, and in which both sides got to endorse programs protecting groups as diverse as veterans, farmers and the elderly. It proved more than enough to let each side assert that it had not blinked.
How that happened is a story of rising internal tensions between the White House and Congressional Democrats, and between House and Senate Republicans, the Presidential ambitions of Mr. Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich's pique at his treatment on Air Force One, public opinion polls that showed the White House maintaining the upper hand, the approach of Thanksgiving vacation, and the realization by both sides that both could ultimately lose if the deadlock dragged on.
In the end, participants said, House Republicans preferred the language protecting various programs like Medicare and Medicaid, because they have contended all along that they intended them no harm. What they would not countenance was an unsigned resolution, which would amount to written acknowledgment that the whole agreement is merely a prelude and holding action to the debate ahead on the Republicans' overall plan to balance the budget by 2002, which Mr. Clinton has repeatedly threatened to veto as too harsh on the programs he favors.
"Our thinking was that they were asking for hortatory language about things with which we had no disagreement," said Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley. "They may have been saying that we wanted to burn babies in oil and throw people into the gutter, but that's never been our policy. If they wanted to have a statement that we needed to save Medicare, that's what our whole effort's been about."
But for the White House, the laundry list was much more than that: It was the thread that might help unravel the whole cloth of the Republican's broader plans and priorities. Or as, as Mr. Clinton's spokesman Michael D. McCurry put it today, "The first time that the Republican leadership in Congress did acknowledge the President's priorities."
Both sides agreed today that the tide in negotiations began turning last Thursday, with the shutdown entering its third day and both camps increasingly edgy. The night before, the House had passed a stopgap spending measure that included a provision to balance the budget in seven years, and enough moderate Democrats backed it to come within six votes of providing the two-thirds margin needed to override President Clinton's promised veto.
White House aides, led by Vice President Al Gore, spent an anxious night of nose counting, worried that support for the President's position was slipping away. Though public opinion polls continued throughout the weekend to show more Americans blamed Congress than the President for the shutdown, the White House fretted that the Republicans were successfully framing the debate -- in the very way Mr. Clinton has sought to avoid for months -- as whether the budget should be balanced, not how.
But Thursday morning, the House floor erupted into guffaws over Mr. Gingrich's complaint that he had loaded the temporary spending bills with conditions in part to spite Mr. Clinton for his treatment of the Speaker and Mr. Dole on their flight to and from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Israel. Conservatives denounced Mr. Gingrich for stepping on his own message.
By Friday, the rhetoric had cooled, and both sides were talking, but an agreement seemed close, only to slip away. Late that day, the Administration proposed to make balancing the budget in seven years a "goal" rather than a firm commitment, and proposed language offering to do so in seven years with Congressional Budget Office estimates, as Congress wanted, or in a time frame and with economic assumptions mutually agreed to by negotiators.
The Republicans rejected that approach as too vague. But by this point, Republican Senate aides recalled, Mr. Dole sensed that Mr. Gingrich's stature had been badly wounded by the plane flap, and on Saturday morning, the Senate leader called Mr. Domenici to say that he and the House Budget Chairman, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, should get cracking on a deal.
" 'We've got to get this thing to an end,' " one aide recalled Mr. Dole as saying. After returning from a brief campaign appearance at the Florida Republican straw poll in Orlando that afternoon, Mr. Dole corralled Republicans into coming up with an olive branch of their own.
The Republicans offered to use updated estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, after consultations with the more optimistic White House Office of Management and Budget. Because forecasts have improved since the latest Congressional estimates, that would presumably have the effect of softening some of the cuts needed to achieve balance, while preserving the Republicans' insistence that they use their own numbers.
The White House interpreted the move as a serious gesture of good faith, and kept mum about it overnight. On Sunday morning, Mr. Dole's conservative rival for the Republican nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, attacked the proposal as a potential giveaway, while Mr. Panetta and the President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, went back to Capitol Hill with their two-pronged counter-offer.
"There's no question that Dole played a real role here," one senior Administration official said today.
Though Republican aides said Senators like Mr. Domenici viewed the laundry list offer as the weaker of the two, House negotiators preferred it because it was not couched as a nonbinding resolution.
Because Congressional parliamentarians agree that any such proviso is nonbinding, pending final agreement on a budget, the White House was perfectly willing to accept it.

HEADLINE: Strategies Changing For Union

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 20

 BODY:
Altha Kennedy received a tip that a home care aide wanted to join the union, so she drove to the prim gray clapboard house that the woman shares with a daughter and son-in-law.
The aide, Gertrude Martinez, recounted how the disabled woman whom she had bathed, shampooed and taken to doctors since May abruptly dismissed her from her $4.25-an-hour job. Arriving for work a few days ago, Ms. Martinez said, she found her patient interviewing a prospective replacement. 
 "They were whispering," Ms. Martinez told Ms. Kennedy. "I went about my business cleaning up. And then she said, 'I don't want you to come in Monday because I don't need you any more.' "
Ms. Kennedy prepared to start her pitch for the union, Service Employees International. "Do you know they pay zoo keepers $12.50 an hour?" she asked.
But the 58-year-old Ms. Martinez was already sold and immediately signed a card agreeing to join.
Organizing people like Ms. Martinez has become the No. 1 priority of the American labor movement's new leaders, as they try to rebuild after decades of decline. Ms. Kennedy, 34 years old, head organizer for Local 616 in Oakland, has helped her union to double in size to 1.1 million members in little more than a decade by tapping into the economy's vast and little-organized, 93-million-worker service sector. Health care in particular has been a rich target.
The union's growth helped propel its president, John J. Sweeney, to the presidency of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in an election last month. Mr. Sweeney is urging the 78 member unions of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to concentrate on the poorest service workers, like motel employees, store clerks, office building janitors and health care aides, many of them recent immigrants and women.
Health care is the fastest-growing service in the country, with more than nine million workers, or about half the number of manufacturing workers. Union leaders say the field is ripe for organizing because of mounting pressure among health care services, hospitals, nursing homes, health insurance companies and government to hold down the rise in costs.
In pursuing these workers, unions are turning away from recent practices of trying to capture a workplace here and another there. Instead they are tackling whole groups of employers much as industrial unions in the 1930's organized auromobile and steel companies.
Sal Rosselli, president of one of California's biggest service employee locals, No. 250, in Oakland, cites emergency medical technicians, that is, ambulance crews.
"In the late 1980's, that was virtually nonunion," Mr. Rosselli said. "Workers were making $7 and $8 a day with no benefits. Now we have 2,000 emergency medical workers making up to $50,000 a year. We've organized virtually the entire industry in Northern California."
Among health care workers, government-employed home care aides are especially inviting targets for organizers nationwide. The battle has begun in California, the most-populous state and one in which the union says working conditions are particularly susceptible to organizing. California uses 160,000 aides like Ms. Martinez to care for 189,000 patients under a 16-year-old program called In-Home Supportive Services. In a drive that began earlier this year, the service employees union has organized 10,000 of these California workers, union officials say.
To qualify for care under the state program, a patient can have assets of no more than $2,000 and typically receives Supplementary Security Income, the Federal welfare program for the indigent elderly, blind and disabled.
To keep down the costs of serving these patients, the state gives the aides no medical benefits, paid vacations, sick leave, family leave, overtime pay, compensation for injuries on the job, or reimbursement for bus fares and gasoline to run errands for patients and take them to doctors.
The aides are designated self-employed independent contractors and are paid the Federal minimum wage of $4.25 an hour.
These workers, mostly women 40 to 70 years old, receive no training or certification to do work that can include giving enemas and insulin shots, changing bandages and hooking up dialysis machines. Nothing protects a patient from an incompetent aide or an aide from an abusive patient.
No one in the government is accountable for the aides, although a few counties are establishing offices to manage their programs. For now, though, social workers for California's 58 counties set the hours the aides work for patients but little more. The state pays their wages but provides no supervision. No one represents their interests in budget matters.
For an individual aide, the boss, to the extent there is one, is the patient. Patients hire aides, sign their time cards confirming hours worked, and can dismiss them without cause or explanation. Once out of work, the aide must rely on word-of-mouth to find a new patient.
"It's a good deal for the government," said Robert Barton, manager of the adult services branch of the California Department of Social Services, and the civil servant who oversees the program.
David Snapp, the union's director of organizing in Washington, said, "It's a scam."
It is clearly a boon to the state, county and, through Medicaid, Federal governments that share the program's $950 million annual cost. Without these workers, taxpayers would have to pay $30,000 a year to keep the patients in nursing homes. Home care aides, about half of whom work for family members rather than do other jobs, cost less than $7,000 a year for a typical 30 hour-week.
Bill Schimeck, an adult services manager, added that raising the wages was a tough political decision for a state that is just now beginning to recover from years of acute budget deficits. And the lower the wages, the more patients the program can reach, Mr. Schimeck said.
For unions that would represent them, the aides are elusive quarry. In Oakland and San Francisco, many aides speak little or no English. They work alone, going door to door, so there is no central workplace to corral them and often no publicly accessible rosters for unions to comb. Turnover is high.
Enrolling the aides requires a sizable commitment of resources that unions avoided until a few like Mr. Sweeney's determined that the labor movement's survival was at stake. Unions like his have been training corps of men and women to roam the nation's poorest neighborhoods, tracking down aides.
This is taxing work for Angela Osayande, 34, and Manuel Jimenez, 40, who are organizing for the service employees' union Local 250, which commits 18 percent of its budget to organizing, about four times the norm for unions. They hit the streets of San Francisco just after dawn one morning in Mr. Jimenez's rattly, 15-year-old Ford Mustang.
The first stop is a three-story apartment building in the Fillmore district. They ring. No answer. They stuff materials about the union in a slot near the mailbox. Another building. Again, no one home. At a third, in the Western Addition, a man peers out from the fourth floor.
"You Frank?" Ms. Osayande asks.
The man shouts down, "He gets his check here, but he doesn't live here. He's out."
The man, Emmett Brooks, 60, comes down. "He does everything for me," he said. "Helps me set up my dialysis equipment. Goes with me in the van to the hospital. Does the shopping. He's been with me since 1982."
Promising to return in the evening, the union organizers make three more fruitless stops. At last in South Beach, Ken Doctolero, 71, an immigrant from the Philippines, invites them in to see his wife, Maxima, also Filipino and 71.
The Doctoleros have 12 children. Their living-dining shelves are layered with pictures of them in military uniforms and caps and gowns. One shows a beaming son Eddy graduating from a special school for children with Down syndrome.
Eddy, 25, is big and amiable, a fan of televised wrestling. He talks freely, with the inflections and gestures of an adult. But to the untrained ear, it's mostly gibberish. He is often incontinent. Out on his own, he gets lost. Without his parents, who never leave him, he would be in an institution.
The Doctoleros, the union organizers discover, are upset and confused. Without explanation, they say, the county reduced the time it decided Mrs. Doctolero needed to care for Eddy: to 70 1/2 hours a month from 80, cutting her pay to $300 a month, from $343.
Then, someone else, they do not know who, has been counting Mr. Doctolero's $389 pension from an 18-year job as a cabin service worker for United Airlines in the calculation of Eddy's Supplemental Security Income payment. Federal guidelines say a completely unemployable adult should receive about $458 a month. But he gets $391.
"Right now," Ms. Osayande said to the mother, "you have no one to represent you. We want to sign you up for Local 250. There are union dues of $7.38 a month. Do you feel that is something you can do?"
Mr. Doctolero fills out the card for his wife, who apologizes for having stopped school in the fourth grade.
Lately, the union has been making some dents in the home care program. It won state approval to withhold aides' union dues of $7.38 a month, simplifying collection. It recently won a $4 million settlement for 50,000 aides in a suit over delayed payment of the aides' wages during state budget crises in 1991 and 1992. The aides stand to receive $123 to $680 each.
The union was also the prime mover behind legislation permitting local governments to establish authorities to manage the program, set up registries of providers and patients, oversee the program and serve as management's bargaining agent in contract negotiations with unions on the aides' behalf. So far, three Bay Area counties, San Mateo, San Francisco and Alameda, have begun to establish the authorities.
This was a critical breakthrough for the union. In recruiting workers, it has been able to develop some services, like help in finding new clients when they lose theirs and opportunities to gather with other aides who unlike most workers never see a colleague.
Now, that it represents a sizable number of home health care workers, the union has begun its first contract negotiations for them in Calfornia, with Alameda County.
"Now, we have someone to bargain with," Mr. Rosselli said.

HEADLINE: Nassau Cautiously Optimistic As Deficit Drops 3d Year in Row

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Nov. 20

 BODY:
Despite a $9 million shortfall in sales tax revenues and $21 million in cuts in state aid, Nassau County closed out fiscal 1995 with a deficit of only $2.4 million, a small fraction of its record $120 million deficit in 1992, officials reported today.
"Nassau has shown steady and measurable fiscal improvement for the third successive year," said Fred Parola, the County Comptroller. He said the deficit was less than one-quarter of 1 percent of Nassau's 1995 budget of $1.142 billion. 
 "The results are so remarkable," Mr. Parola added, "I am prompted once again to call on the rating agencies to further upgrade Nassau's bond rating." Moody's current bond rating for Nassau is BAA1, and Standard & Poor's is A-, slightly higher than both Suffolk County and New York City. Mr. Parola said a higher rating would reduce Nassau's borrowing costs.
The County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, called Mr. Parola's report encouraging. "The report demonstrates that the county's policy of cutting spending" is benefiting homeowners and businesses, Mr. Gulotta said.
But Mr. Parola warned of what he called "potentially volatile factors" that could lead to budget problems in fiscal 1996.
"Contractual obligations are increasing with municipal unions, and Federal and state aid have fallen and remain uncertain," he said.
"Remember, Nassau went from a $21 million surplus in 1989 to a deficit of $45 million in 1990," he said. The deficit rose to $120 million in 1992, at the end of the recession, then dropped to $20 million in 1993 and $4 million in 1994.
The most positive factors in the budget were a Nassau County Medical Center surplus of about $7.2 million and an unexpected $5.9 million increase in investment income.
The medical center benefited from Federal reimbursements for health care services, debt collections and the enrollment of public assistance recipients into managed care health programs.
But most of the hospital's gains were offset by losses at the county's A. Holly Patterson Nursing Home, which ended the year $6.7 million in the red.
"Caring for the elderly is expensive," Mr. Parola said. "It takes a lot of nurses and a large support staff."
Elsewhere on the negative side of the ledger, state aid dropped by $21 million and sales-tax revenues fell $9 million short of projections.
Mr. Parola said it was too early to determine whether the slump in sales-tax revenues would continue during the holiday season.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE DEBATE;
Agreement Is Only the First Step Toward Balancing the Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton and Congressional Republicans got over their first big hurdle when they reached an agreement on Sunday on a temporary spending bill to reopen the Government. But on the much larger issue ahead -- how to balance the budget -- they may only have agreed to disagree.
Whether it is one or the other may ultimately depend not just on the will to compromise, which is conditioned by polls, focus groups and whichever side makes the latest political blunder and feels weak. 
 It may also depend on whether a fresh look by the Congressional Budget Office at the economic projections for the next seven years -- an art that some economists consider borderline science fiction -- finds enough extra cash to take the roughest edges off the Republican plan to balance the budget in seven years, which Congress finally passed today. The rosier the forecast, the less money has to be cut.
Both sides are now formally committed to "enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002." That is the part of the agreement that the Republicans like to focus on.
And they are equally committed to the idea that such a budget must "protect future generations, insure Medicare solvency, reform welfare and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans and the environment." That is the part Democrats emphasize.
Since the Republicans had never said they were against any of those things, and Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, cheerfully asserted today that the Republican budget did all that, it might seem that they gave up nothing and that they won because the President had finally agreed on seven years.
But that language also provides Democrats with a reason to disagree or, as Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said this morning on the NBC News program "Today," to reject any deal unless it "protects the President's priorities."
When they heard Mr. Panetta make comments like that, talk about balancing the budget in "seven or eight years" and assert that "we basically preserve the options of both sides," House Republicans were annoyed.
"There is no wiggle room here," asserted Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of New York, chairman of the Rules Committee. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Representative Robert L. Livingston, Republican of Louisiana, said the agreement "sets in strong cement" the commitment to balance the budget in seven years.
Still, whenever politicians make an interim agreement, each side claims to have snookered the other.
So it is important to remember that this deal is just that, a pact that provides for reopening closed Government offices for four weeks. And for the last three of those weeks, starting next Monday, after the Thanksgiving holiday, the two sides will talk about balancing the budget. If they agree, they can then be statesmanlike and talk about how everybody had to make concessions for the nation's good and so on.
The reasons that both sides chose to negotiate this time -- each backing down a little bit from their postures -- are of more than historical interest. Questions of Democratic determination and polls suggesting Republican weakness are still going to be part of the calculus when talks begin next Monday.
The Administration had two good reasons for sitting down to deal.
One was fear. When 48 House Democrats voted with Republicans late Wednesday for a stopgap spending bill, they did not provide a veto-proof majority. But the combination of conservatives and liberals with civil service constituents like Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, came close enough so that President Clinton, scorned by Congressional Democrats as an uncertain ally over the summer, now had to worry about being deserted if he stood firm.
The other was a sense that Speaker Newt Gingrich was at a low point in terms of influence. He had been widely ridiculed for complaining about his treatment on Air Force One, and his standing with the public was dropping like a stone.
That included the Republican public. A CBS News poll released on Sunday showed that when the public was asked if it thought Mr. Gingrich believed what he said about the budget, or was just saying "what he thinks people want to hear," more Republicans thought he was pandering. Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, was believed by his own party, and by the public as well.
That same sense of Mr. Gingrich's immediate weakness also helped the Senate Republicans, who were more concerned than their House colleagues about the spectacle of the Government's being closed for six days. While House Republicans were hardly run over by the senators, the senators held the initiative.
One of the great uncertainties in everyone's calculations is what the Congressional Budget Office is likely to find when it updates the economic calculations cited in the agreement. These estimates are expected to indicate that the Government will take in more tax money because of higher economic growth and pay out less in entitlements like Social Security because inflation is down.
Guesses between $50 billion and $200 billion in additional net revenue were floating around the Capitol today, with most estimates toward the lower end, where the additional resources would not provide much flexibility -- even if Republicans were willing, as they hinted, to shave part of their $245 billion tax cut.
The prospects for an agreement on the budget fundamentally depend on political issues, whether politicians judge that the public's desire to have a balanced budget outweighs its reluctance to curb spending on programs that matter.
The Sunday agreement, as Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, put it, "created a picture frame." But Mr. Reischauer, a Brookings Institution scholar, added, "The picture we have to put in it is still too large too fit." The only way to make the budget picture fit the frame is to cut.

HEADLINE: Math of a Class-Action Suit: 'Winning' $2.19 Costs $91.33

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Dexter J. Kamilewicz never wants to win a class-action lawsuit again -- at least not when it costs him more than he wins.
Mr. Kamilewicz, a real estate broker in Portland, Me., found out this year that he was among the winners of a class-action suit against his mortgage bank, the Bank of Boston. He learned of his victory only when he spotted a $91.33 "miscellaneous deduction" from his escrow account that turned out to be his payment for lawyers he never knew he had hired. His winnings were apparently just $2.19 in back interest. 
 Many class actions end with plaintiffs winning meager awards while their lawyers walk away with millions of dollars in fees. But the suit against the Bank of Boston has taken that difference to a new level.
"This is the only class action that I have heard about where the consumers won and ended up paying money out of their own pockets," said Will Lund, superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection.
The suit, which accused the bank of keeping excessive amounts of its customers' money in escrow accounts, involved a nationwide class of 715,000 current and former mortgage holders. The 300,000 current holders wound up footing the lawyers' bill for $8.5 million. Only after the case was settled last year did some members of that group -- just how many is unclear -- say they realized they ended up with a loss.
Now the matter is back in court again and may soon be the catalyst for Congressional action.
Mr. Kamilewicz (pronounced CAM-eh-lev-itch); his wife, Gretchen, and a third disgruntled plaintiff recently filed a new lawsuit -- which is itself seeking class-action status -- that accuses the original plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as the bank, of fraud. Both the bank and the lawyers say the settlement was fair and deny doing anything wrong.
Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, says he has heard enough complaints about the settlement to propose a corrective measure. His legislation, expected to be introduced in the next month, would differ from other recent efforts in Congress at tort reform in that it would protect plaintiffs, rather than defendants, against the excesses of lawyers.
"There is evidence from around the country that in many instances class actions are benefiting lawyers to a much greater extent than their clients," Senator Cohen said.
Dozens of suits were filed in the early 1990's over escrow accounts before Federal regulations were adopted to more strictly limit the excess money that banks could hold in the accounts. Scores of class actions of all sorts are certified in Federal and state courts each year.
In the Bank of Boston case, critics of the settlement note, the lawyers' fees took the form of an assessment against the escrow accounts that sometimes dwarfed the modest awards. What is more, apart from a few dollars in back interest, the "awards" were simply refunds of the plaintiffs' own money, which would have been returned sooner or later even without the suit. Mr. Kamilewicz and others who apparently had no excessive amounts of money in their accounts were hit hardest because they got no refund but still had to pay legal fees.
Finally, the fees were larger than they should have been, the critics say, because they were based not on the current value of the refunds but on unrealistic projections of their future worth.
"Lawyers' fees are often a problem in these kinds of cases," said Jerome Hoffman, a former top official with the Florida Attorney General's office, which had tried to block the settlement. "But this is probably the most egregious case I have ever seen."
For their part, the plaintiffs' lawyers and a bank spokesman noted that the settlement had been approved by a state judge in Alabama, where the suit was filed.
In the settlement itself, the bank denied doing anything improper in handling the escrow. Money held in escrow is used to pay real estate taxes and property insurance. Banks are allowed to maintain a cushion of extra money to cover increases in those costs, but the Bank of Boston was accused of using a formula that often resulted in an excessively large cushion.
Ed Russell, the bank spokesman, declined to comment on the new suit, filed this month in Federal court in Chicago. But several of the lawyers now being sued described it as groundless. The lawyers are with Ezell & Sharbrough of Mobile, Ala., and two Chicago firms, Edelman & Combs and Lawrence Walner & Associates.
One of the lawyers, Daniel A. Edelman, called the new suit "the most frivolous I have ever seen."
But legal experts say that the dispute highlights the problems associated with class actions. Consumers and investors are often made parties without realizing it or understanding that they may receive trivial amounts while their lawyers make millions.
Information in legal notices is often shrouded in dense jargon. In some cases, lawyers for both sides may intentionally cloud that information to mislead plaintiffs about important issues, the experts said.
"It is not designed to be good communication," said John Coffee, a professor at the Columbia University School of Law. "It is designed to convince a judge who can wave his magic wand and approve a settlement." Stephen Gardner, a lawyer in Dallas who has handled many consumer cases, said, "A lot of settlement notices are engineered by the parties to keep class members in the dark about how much money the lawyers are making versus how many dollars they are going to get."
To address that problem, Senator Cohen said his legislation would, among other things, require the parties to disclose proposed settlements to the attorneys general in all states in which plaintiffs reside.
In settling its case, the Bank of Boston agreed to pay a maximum of $8.76 in back interest to individual mortgage holders. The bank also agreed to change its future escrow accounting methods and refund about $30 million in excess escrow payments. Normally, any extra money is returned when a mortgage ends or is refinanced. All told, plaintiffs' lawyers say, the settlement conferred about $40 million in benefits, including estimated savings from the accounting change.
"Nothing fraudulent or improper took place," Mr. Edelman said. "There was an economic benefit in excess of $40 million and the lawyers received $8.5 million, and that is a low-end number."
Even critics acknowledged that the plaintiffs' lawyers helped their clients by getting the bank to change its escrow practices. Still, they said the plaintiffs ended up with a questionable deal on two fronts.
For one, fees were assessed even against people, like Mr. Kamilewicz, who apparently did not have excessive amounts of money in escrow, or not enough extra to produce a refund to fully cover the fees.
The fees were levied as a percentage of the balance in each escrow account, court papers indicate. Mr. Russell, the bank's spokesman, declined to comment when asked if the bank knew how many accounts might not have had excessive amounts. He also declined to discuss Mr. Kamilewicz's case.
Speaking generally, Mr. Gardner, the Dallas lawyer, said that in an escrow case of this size, at least several thousand people would have no cushion at all in their accounts.
The other problem for the plaintiffs was the way the fee was set, critics of the settlement said.
After the plaintiffs won a partial summary judgment in 1993, negotiations to resolve the case began. Initially, the bank offered to change its escrow accounting procedures and to pay lawyers' fees of $500,000, court papers indicate. The bank said that to take such money out of the escrow accounts would result in a "net out-of-pocket loss" to many customers, the new lawsuit contends.
Mr. Russell, the bank spokesman, declined to make the bank's lawyers available. But one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, John W. Sharbrough 3d, said the $500,000 offer did not even cover the lawyers' expenses, and to negotiate fees with the bank would have been unethical.
In any event, the lawyers requested as their fee a third of the $42 million in excess escrow that was then held by the bank, a court transcript shows.
A one-third award to plaintiffs' lawyers would not be unusual in a typical contingency-fee case, like a personal injury suit, where the settlement comes out of a defendant's pocket. But since an escrow case involves the return of the plaintiffs' own money, banks have frequently paid the plaintiffs' legal bill, using a fixed figure for each account.
To justify a far larger fee, the plaintiffs' firms offered expert testimony suggesting that consumers would realize a significant windfall by getting their money back now rather than later.
For example, E. W. McKean, an accountant in Mobile, testified that if a consumer used a hypothetical $100 refund to reduce the principal on a 20-year, $10,000 loan at 8.6 percent interest, the benefit over time in lower interest payments would be nearly $400 in current dollars.
But consumer lawyers like Mr. Gardner said it was unrealistic to place too much future value on small sums that are recovered.
"This is like winning a scratch card," he said. "People are not going to invest this money."
Mr. Edelman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, disagreed, saying that the future benefit of a recovery is a common yardstick for determining fees.
The judge in the case eventually decided that to cover their fees and expenses the plaintiffs' lawyers should be awarded 28 percent of the excess escrow -- a pie that totaled about $30 million when the fees were actually set.
Mr. Sharbrough said that while some class members who got in touch with him were initially confused about the settlement, they were all pleased once it was explained to them. Mr. Edelman said banks were probably behind the new lawsuit because he had represented consumers in other class-action claims against financial institutions.
Such an assertion would no doubt surprise Mr. Kamilewicz, who said he started the ball rolling because he was so angry. "The issue isn't the $91," he said. "The issue is behavior, standards."
Some lawyers are wishing him luck. "Somebody ought to give him a gold medal," said Peter Antonacci, the Deputy Attorney General of Florida. "This thing was begging to be done."

Long Bond Price Slips After Budget Deal

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Despite an agreement on Federal budget negotiations, long-term Treasury prices ended lower yesterday.
While concerns about an impasse over the budget weighed down the market last week, Sunday's announcement on the budget failed to encourage much buying "because everyone knows they haven't increased the debt ceiling, and have not yet hammered out a budget agreement," said Kenneth J. McCarthy of the Economic Intelligence Company, a New York-based economic consulting and forecasting firm. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 7/32 , to 10816/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.24 percent, from 6.23 percent on Friday.
Prices of short-term maturities, however, were bolstered by a well-received auction of new three-year notes.
The Treasury sold $18 billion of three-year notes, and active bidding lowered the average yield at auction to 5.549 percent, the lowest since February 1994, when it was 4.83 percent.
The strong demand was not entirely surprising as it was the Government's first three-year note auction since Aug. 8. The three-year note auction was originally scheduled for Nov. 7.
But some dealers were hestitant to participate in the auction. Having missed a few economic reports because of the partial Government shutdown, they were unsure what price concessions would be needed to be priced into the new paper to make them attractive to investors. Some say that the short end of the market is priced rather high relative to prices in August.
Today , the Treasury auctions $13.5 billion in 10-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, the notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.90 percent, up from 5.87 percent on Friday.
And at the Treasury's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday, demand was also strong. Traders said they saw a great deal of interest in the bills from small investors. At auction, the average discount rate for a three-month bill was 5.34 percent, down from 5.43 percent last week, and the average rate for a six-month bill was 5.25 percent, down from last week's 5.33 percent.
With the Federal Government up and running, the market can now focus on economic data. The Government's report on business inventories for September, postponed last week, will be released tomorrow. And reports on October housing starts and October durable goods are expected next week.
"The market," Mr. McCarthy of Economic Intelligence said, "will tend to trade technically and react to things like the auctions today, but you won't see any new trend developing."
With the holidays and the end of the year approaching, he added that he expected trading would grow thinner.
In the corporate debt market, the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation took advantage of the lowest interest rates in 21 months to sell $200 million of 100-year bonds. The two-part debt offering was priced through Morgan Stanley & Company.
A corporate issue with such a long maturity is rare. Last year, Walt Disney, Coca-Cola and ABN-Amro of the Netherlands issued century-long debt.
In all, Columbia/HCA sold $350 million of bonds. The first part, $200 million of 7.50 percent debentures due 2095, was priced at 116 basis points more than the 30-year Treasury bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The bonds are noncallable.
The second part, $150 million of 7.19 percent debentures due in 2015, was priced to yield 85 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. Both parts are rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: In Land of the Peso, the Dollar Is Common Coin

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Despite the drubbing it has taken this year, the peso remains the official currency of Mexico. Sometimes, though, it is hard to be sure because, increasingly, companies that have been hurt by the gyrations of the peso are switching to doing business in dollars. Executives and managers are seeking to protect themselves from further peso losses.
This unofficial dollarization of the Mexican economy means that it is now common to see computer manufacturers and real estate agents advertise their prices in dollars, even when the transaction takes place purely within Mexico. Although it is technically illegal to use anything but the peso, the businesses get around that restriction by saying in tiny footnotes that they will accept pesos at the current exchange rate. 
 Big hotels and international airlines have been using dollar prices since long before the peso was devalued last December. But now, even smaller hotels and tour agencies -- where nothing is imported -- have started doing the same. Since the devaluation, a number of such incidents have turned into a visible trend -- gathering speed with each episode of peso weakness and reaching down to the most local of businesses.
Such examples only hint at how far advanced the dollarization process has become, and the extent to which the battered peso has been discarded by people who normally defend national symbols and reject any sign of American intervention on their native soil.
Take, for example, a recent request for bids to construct three microwave relay towers for Petroleos Mexicanos, the huge Mexican oil monopoly widely known as Pemex. All the suppliers that submitted bids were based in Mexico; the material they would use to construct the tower was all Mexican. But Pemex held the bidding competition in Houston and insisted that all the bids be submitted in dollars. The winning bid, by the Mexican company Mantenimiento Technico S.A., was $600,000.
"There, you have the largest monopoly in Mexico negotiating in dollars for three big towers to be built in Mexico, using steel from Mexico and concrete from Mexico," said John Lambuth, a businessman from the United States who is the head of Energia Eolica, a tower builder in Mexico City that also bid for the contract. "If that's not dollarization, what is?"
For its part, Pemex says that it asks for payment in dollars or pesos, depending on the product or service it is buying. Gilda Rota, a spokeswoman for Pemex, also said that while contracts may be priced in dollars, payment may be arranged in either pesos or dollars.
The turn toward dollars began after Mexico decided on Dec. 21, 1994, to let the value of the peso float freely. Since then, however, the currency has done a lot more sinking than floating. Just before devaluation, one peso was worth about 29 cents, at an exchange rate of 3.46 to the dollar. Late today, the exchange rate was 7.63 to the dollar -- meaning that one peso was worth 13.11 cents, a decline of nearly 55 percent in 11 months.
The determination of so many businessmen in Mexico to seek stability by using dollars suggests that there is little confidence that the peso is ready to stabilize. Once it does, or begins to make up some of its losses, the dynamics, of course, could change again.
But for now, dollar signs seem to be everywhere. Even the central bank acknowledges the trend by publishing an exchange rate each day solely for determining dollar-based transactions. And Mexican bankers have asked the Government to allow them to offer dollar checking accounts, which now are forbidden.
The Baby's Room, a store for cribs and clothing, offers its own exchange rate -- at 6.5 pesos to the dollar, better than the official one -- as a way to attract customers in this recession year. Hewlett-Packard recently based an advertisement for computers in Mexico City newspapers on the promise that it would actually accept pesos in payment.
"In commercial real estate, everybody tries to deal in dollars," said Henry B. McDonald, director of the Cushman & Wakefield office in Mexico City.
Mr. McDonald said Citibank, a Citicorp unit, had just negotiated a lease for a new headquarters building of about 85,000 square feet here. American currency was the bottom line of discussion, according to Mr. McDonald. "We used dollars to drive the rates way down," he said.
Many landlords in the wealthier sections of Mexico City have long demanded that rent be paid in dollars, despite a legal prohibition against that. Some doctors and dentists bill in dollars; orthodontists, whose work in a teen-ager's mouth could be spread well over a year, routinely want to be paid in dollars.
Syscom, a communications company in Chihuahua, publishes an equipment catalogue for replacement parts that is current for the entire year and thus a great risk for the company every time the exchange rate flutters. So equipment in the catalogue, like an HT-100 speaker for a Motorola radio, which costs $7.50, is priced in dollars.
Auto-parts suppliers that work with the big American assemblers in Mexico have found that each has its own prejudice for or against the peso. A Mexican businessman said he billed the Ford Motor Company in dollars, but paid in pesos at the prevailing exchange rate. The same businessman bills General Motors in pesos, but has to renegotiate the exchange rate every eight days.
And the businessman said that Chrysler varied, depending on the percentage of the product that is manufactured in Mexico. For example, he said, if 30 percent of an automobile seat was considered Mexican-made, then Chrysler wanted 30 percent of the total bill priced in pesos, with the balance paid at the dollar equivalent in pesos.
Mr. Lambuth, the tower builder, said he had encountered taxi drivers in Tijuana who insisted on being paid in dollars, and bartenders in Juarez who priced their Mexican beer entirely in American dollars.
"You can price something in bags of beans, bars of gold or U.S. dollars to establish the exchange rate -- it really doesn't matter," Mr. Lambuth said. What is important is stability.
"One of the best things that could ever happen to Mexico," he said, "would be to get rid of the peso all together and just use dollars."

HEADLINE: The Next Budget Battle

 BODY:
President Clinton swallowed hard over the weekend before agreeing to the Republicans' key budget demand -- a balanced budget within seven years according to estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office. That was a high price to pay for signing a temporary spending bill that reopened Government offices yesterday. But Mr. Clinton built into the deal enough maybe's so that he will have no trouble finding grounds to reject the budget reconciliation bill that will shortly land on his desk.
Mr. Clinton prefers, with justification, to spread out budget cuts over a longer interval. But the Government shutdown was producing an increasingly surly public, and 48 Democrats had already voted with Republicans to pass a stopgap spending bill. In a week or two the President would likely face a humiliating override of his veto. Also, he could ill afford a partisan squabble in Congress during the week he might announce a peace accord in Bosnia requiring American troops abroad. 
 Despite Mr. Clinton's concessions, his veto pen remains potent. He must wield it in upcoming negotiations over the permanent budget if Congress tries to scrap federally guaranteed food stamps and Medicaid for poor families. The Republicans will get their seven-year timetable, but Mr. Clinton can insist that the G.O.P. soften blows to Medicaid, food stamps, low-income tax credits, national service, education, job training and other priorities.
It would also be useful if he sharpened his attack where the Republicans have gone wrong rather than continue to cater to the elderly by attacking the G.O.P. for wanting to raise subsidized Medicare premiums.
Is there room for compromise on the big budget bill? The key is for the Republicans to scale back their wasteful, unfairly targeted tax cut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday that a $245 billion cut was not set in stone. Congress may also get a gift from the Congressional Budget Office when it revises its estimates based on the economy's better-than-predicted growth earlier this year. If the tax cut is trimmed by perhaps $100 billion and the C.B.O. chips in, say, $75 billion or more, then Congress would have enough money to soften blows to the training, education and welfare programs that Mr. Clinton has vowed to defend.
The President cannot make a good budget with his vetoes. But he can remove Congress's most damaging excesses.

HEADLINE: U.S. Keeps Balkan Talks Alive Despite Impasse on Peace Maps

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Frustrated and exhausted after 20 days of negotiations to end the war in Bosnia, United States diplomats struggled today to keep alive peace talks that seemed on the verge of collapse.
Despite a decision by American envoys on Sunday to shut down the talks this morning no matter what the outcome, the United States backed down from its pledge and plunged ahead with more negotiations all day today and through the night to break the impasse among the three parties. 
 The determination of the American side not to give up was underscored by the personal involvement of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who cut short his trip to Japan last Friday to return to the site of the talks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near here to press for an agreement.
Mr. Christopher, a 70-year-old lawyer, shuttled among the parties throughout the night last night, sleeping for 70 minutes and resuming work shortly after 7 A.M. today. But by tonight there still was no breakthrough. So he and his team again worked into the night and were planning to stay and negotiate at least until Tuesday.
Earlier today, some senior officials of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government said that the negotiations had failed and that the Serbs were to blame. But some negotiators said it was the Bosnian Government that had raised the final objections. Later, however, the same officials reported some progress in the talks, although no one was either claiming victory or predicting defeat.
"The last two days have been the diplomatic equivalent of a roller coaster ride," Carl Bildt, the former Swedish Prime Minister who is negotiating on behalf of the European Union, said in a telephone interview. "There have been times when I was dead certain we were there and times I was certain we had failed."
The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, denied reports from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, that the peace talks had collapsed, telling reporters that Mr. Christopher would continue his efforts to reach an agreement.
"The talks have not broken down," Mr. Burns said. "They are ongoing. We're into extra innings, and when you're in extra innings and you think you have a chance to succeed, you don't give up at the last moment."
But other officials involved in the talks said the more time that passes, the more remote the chance that the three Balkan Presidents -- Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia -- would sit down at a table in the Hope Conference Center at the Air Force base and initial the final documents and maps before they go home.
Early this morning, it seemed as if there might be an agreement. Negotiators said that at 4 A.M., the Serbs and Bosnians appeared to have resolved the most difficult issue that divided them: the width of a crucial 30-mile-long passage, known as the Posavina corridor, linking Serbian-held eastern Bosnia with its territories in the northwest, around the city of Banja Luka.
But the agreement quickly began to unravel, and the Balkan parties exchanged bitter recriminations about who was to blame.
According to a senior Bosnian official, the tentative deal fell apart when the Serbs issued new demands, insisting on more land in the corridor and other bits of territory to insure that its side got a full 49 percent of the country's territory as they had been promised.
Bosnia was also furious that the United Nations Security Council was poised to suspend its crippling trade sanctions against Serbia as soon as the Serbs initialed a peace agreement, the official said.
The Bosnian Government wanted written assurances from the United States that it would arm and train the Bosnian Army as soon as an agreement was reached -- a pledge the United States refused to give.
But a senior negotiator blamed the Bosnian Government for recoiling from a peace that required it to relinquish claims to nearly half of Bosnia's territory. Indeed, while the stated goal of the peace talks is to lay the foundation for coexistence among the peoples of Bosnia, it would not force them to live together, but require 60,000 NATO troops to insure that they are divided.
"It is no longer a matter of territory," the negotiator said. "It is a matter of political will."
The negotiations were further complicated today when Serbs and Croats got into a fierce argument over the fate of a small pocket of Croat-held land lining the Posavina corridor, northwest of the town of Brcko. The Serbs want to control the so-called Orasje pocket in order to make more secure their access to Banja Luka, the biggest Serb-held town in Bosnia.
But the Croats today refused to give up the territory, and President Clinton called Mr. Tudjman, the Croatian President, this afternoon to urge him to resolve the remaining territorial problems, a White House official said.
Coming just a few days after Serbs and Croats appeared to settle their last territorial differences, the dispute underscored just how volatile the issues are and just how deep the distrust is in an area where bitter fighting was raging only weeks ago.
If the initiative fails, it means that the three parties will have lost what the Americans had called the "last best chance for peace" in a war that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.
The Clinton Administration had brought the full force of American prestige to the bargaining table, parading a series of Cabinet officials and generals to Wright-Patterson Air Force base here to pressure the parties to reach a peace agreement.
Mr. Christopher is so personally involved in the process that he has made four trips to Dayton since the talks began, and a State Department official said the Secretary would be spending the night in Dayton. Even President Clinton was poised to fly into Dayton today if his presence could have brought the talks to a successful conclusion.
But the Bosnians did not yet seem ready. And the Serbs appeared unwilling to go along with a partial success that would not secure their main aim: relief from the international economic sanctions that have crippled their economy for the past three-and-a-half years.
Mr. Burns said that if the talks fail, there will be a number of options available to the parties. He did not elaborate.
The failure of the talks also would raise the possibility that the diplomatic gains already agreed to since the beginning of September could be lost, and called into question the future of the cease-fire, which began on Oct. 10 and is scheduled to last only 60 days.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Dow Conquers 5,000 Mark, Riding Surge of Confidence

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average moved decisively past 5,000 yesterday, adding another notch to one of the most extraordinary bull markets in history. The move came less than nine months after the market's most widely watched index passed 4,000 for the first time.
After flirting with the number for several days and briefly piercing it on Monday, the Dow jumped 40.46 points, to 5,023.55, with much of the gain coming in the final hour of trading. 
 The latest surge in the market has been helped by falling interest rates, quiet inflation and rising profits, as well as by one of the hardiest markets ever. And it has been fueled by an unprecedented flood of money going into stock mutual funds.
Although the market had a history of at least pausing after hitting a new millennium mark, it did not do so after hitting 4,000 and most on Wall Street believe that continued rises are all but inevitable.
"At these prices, investors are paying for 1995 earnings, but not paying much for 1996 earnings," said Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-head of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs. Like many on Wall Street, she thinks the economic cycle has a long way to go.
Byron R. Wien, the chief United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said, "Bull markets are destroyed by the Federal Reserve tightening, as are economic expansions." But now, he said, the Fed is likely to ease as soon as a final deal is reached on the Federal budget.
Mr. Wien thinks that long-term interest rates, which have fallen sharply this year after rising in 1994, could go back up a bit, holding down future gains in share prices. He is forecasting a 10 percent rise in the Dow over the next year, a move that seems tame both in comparison with what has happened -- the Dow is up 37 percent since last Thanksgiving -- and with many other forecasts.
"We easily go to 6,000 from here," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, the chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company. He cited both the economic outlook and "the level of confidence" that investors feel in financial assets.
That confidence level may never have been greater, in part because bad experiences in the stock market have been rare in recent years. Not since 1990 has the Dow fallen more than 10 percent from a high to a subsequent trough, by far the longest such period in the history of that average.
In fact, the level of bullish rhetoric now heard makes a forecast of 6,000 seem tame. Edward E. Yardeni, the chief economist of C. J. Lawrence, is talking about "10,000 by 2000" -- a doubling of the Dow within five years.
"Many of the same trends that brought us from the depths of the 1987 crash to where we are today are likely to continue to work to push the stock market even higher," Mr. Yardeni said in an interview. "I'm impressed by how well the U.S. economy has adapted to new economic forces unleashed by the end of the cold war."
Mr. Yardeni cautions that -- notwithstanding the steady ascent since the market fell in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait -- "the business cycle has not been repealed." He predicts that early in 1996, profits for many companies will be below the levels of a year ago, and says there might be a full-fledged recession as well. If so, he thinks the major stock averages could fall 10 percent or 15 percent.
Charles I. Clough Jr., the chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, is also worried about earnings, saying they "could be the Achilles' heel of this stock market." He says it is clear that many companies are having trouble raising prices for what they sell, and therefore may have trouble showing rising profits.
"The market has to deal with these earnings problems," he said. "But I can't make a case for any serious pullback here." He said the overall market might stall for a time, but added, "If the economy is really weak and the Fed starts to ease, we haven't seen the highs of this bull market."
To some, there are already signs of the market stalling for a time. Technology stocks, which were the stars of most of 1995, have started to weaken. And the Nasdaq composite index, weighed down by technology shares, fell 4.48 yesterday, to 1,024.99, leaving it 4 percent below its peak, reached more than two months ago.
There is a tradition of the market stalling either just before or after reaching a new millennium. The legendary example was the first, when the Dow neared 1,000 in 1966, only to fall back and not exceed the level until 1972. Then it fell back again, and did not top the mark for good until late 1982.
It took nine months from the time the Dow first approached 3,000 for it to surpass that level, and then the market stalled again; it was eight months later that the Dow traded under that figure for the last time. And the Dow fell back after nearing 4,000 in early 1994 and did not get back to that level until this past February. But then it tarried only two weeks in that area before surging ahead.
The exception to the rule of pausing was when the Dow went over 2,000 in early 1987. It did not pause for even a day. But later that year came the crash, and it was not until Feb. 23, 1989, that the Dow last closed under 2,000.
If earnings start to fall for many companies, it will be interesting to see how well stock prices hold up. For among traditional valuation measures, only those that relate prices to earnings do not show extreme overvaluation.
But measures based on things like dividends or book value show extremely high valuations for stocks. For example, before this year the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 -- the income from all the stocks in the index -- had never gone below 2.6 percent -- a level that was reached both before the 1973-74 bear market began and before the 1987 crash. Now it is at 2.3 percent.
"This is a temporary new era from a valuation standpoint, just like 1929 was," said Steven C. Leuthold of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, one of the few market seers still focused on such valuation measures. He has been negative on the market since early 1994, and has missed a lot of profits as a result. "This is the most treacherous market I've seen, and I've been in the business for 34 years," he said.
And what will change it? Only a change in public attitudes, he said, noting that mutual fund cash flows were running at unprecedented levels, with $36 billion going into American stock funds in the third quarter of the year.
In the meantime, this is a market that is rewarding shareholders and -- especially -- the founders of companies that have a hot story to tell. Boston Beer, the maker of Sam Adams beer, went public yesterday at $20 a share. Many insiders were among the sellers at $20, but that did not stop eager investors from bidding up the shares to $28 -- a price that is almost 100 times annual profits. That level can be seen as a forecast of rapid growth, or it can be viewed as an indication that lots of people are leaping into a hot stock, assuming it will go up even more.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW;
ACCORD REACHED TO END THE WAR IN BOSNIA; CLINTON PLEDGES U.S. TROOPS TO KEEP PEACE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The presidents of three rival Balkan states agreed today to make peace in Bosnia, ending nearly four years of terror and ethnic bloodletting that have left a quarter of a million people dead in the worst war in Europe since World War II.
The leaders -- Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia -- initialed the peace agreement and 11 annexes in a hastily-arranged ceremony in the same conference room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where they opened their talks 21 days ago. 
 The agreement is to take effect when it is formally signed by the parties in Paris in mid-December.
Unlike previous peace accords that have collapsed, this one was reinforced by widespread fatigue of a war that has uprooted two million people from their homes and appalled the world with scenes of harrowing atrocities, and by the promise of enforcement by 60,000 NATO troops. President Clinton, hailing the agreement in a White House Rose Garden ceremony, reiterated his pledge that the NATO force would include 20,000 Americans.
"The agreement is a victory for all those who believe in a multi-ethnic democracy in Bosnia," said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who spent several exhausting days brokering the final details of the accord. "It offers tangible hope that there will be no more days of dodging bullets, no more winters of freshly dug graves, no more years of isolation from the outside world."
But underneath the self-congratulation of today's ceremony was a grim awareness that the basic questions the parties failed to settle before the war remain: Can Bosnia, with its mutually suspicious populations of Muslims, Serbs and Croats, survive as a single state? What degree of self-government should be given to the Serb minority within its borders? And does Mr. Milosevic have the power to force the Serbs of Bosnia to do what he says?
Today the Bosnian Serb representatives who served in a delegation headed by Mr. Milosevic did not show up for the ceremony to initial the various annexes that affect the Serbian part of Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serbs were particularly upset by the military annexes in the agreement, which they charged essentially made NATO an occupying force, American and European negotiators said.
Under the agreement, NATO will have the right to remove or relocate specific forces and weapons from any location in the country whenever it determines that they constitute a threat to its troops.
The Bosnian Serbs were even more enraged by the map of the capital, Sarajevo, which turned Serb-held neighborhoods over to the Bosnian Government. One American negotiator said that when the Bosnian Serbs saw the map -- which Mr. Milosevic refused to show them until today -- they went "berserk."
"The agreement that has been reached does not meet even the minimum of our interests," said Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament.
The Bosnian Serb pParliament scuttled a peace settlement in the spring of 1993, after the same three presidents signed the so-called Vance-Owen peace plan that divided Bosnia into 10 provinces along to ethnic lines.
But in the antiseptic, fluorescent lit conference room in the Hope Conference Center, the mood was palpably upbeat, as the Balkan presidents took turns at the podium to explain -- in English -- why making peace was important to them.
For Mr. Milosevic, who longs to be embraced again by the West, the war in Bosnia was a merely "civil war" that "should be left to the past." What was important now, he said, was not only peace and understanding but also economic and cultural development. He portrayed himself as a conciliator, saying, "the solutions achieved here include painful concessions by all sides, however; without such concessions it would be impossible to succeed."
For Mr. Izetbegovic, who is determined to preserve Bosnia as a multiethnic democracy, the importance of the agreement is that it guarantees the sovereignty and territorial integrity of his country, he said, as well as the "development of an open society based on tolerance and freedom."
In announcing the agreement earlier in the day, President Clinton said, "The people of Bosnia finally have a chance to turn from the horrors of war to the promise of peace." He added, "Something stirred among the leaders themselves and they decided that they should not let this moment pass."
But it also means that he now will have to make good on his pledge both to the allies and to the Balkan nations to send American troops to Bosnia as part of the NATO-led force.
The agreement calls for the preservation of Bosnia as a single state. But it also divides Bosnia into two almost-equal parts, with one side controlled by a Muslim-Croat federation and the other by a Serb republic.
The plan also envisages a central government with an elected president and parliament, the return or compensation of refugees, the separation of Bosnian and Croatian troops on one side and Serbian troops on the other, and the reconstruction of the country. But it is not at all clear how a government made up of enemies who only recently have put down their arms will function.
The capital, Sarajevo, remains united -- a key demand of the Bosnian Government -- but some eastern suburbs, including the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in Pale -- are to remain under Serb control.
The agreement also leaves unresolved the fate of Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the two Bosnian Serb leaders who have been indicted by an international war crimes tribunal.
Although the agreement prohibits any indicted war criminal from running for office, it does not meet the initial demand of the Bosnian Government that Mr. Milosevic turn the two men over to the United Nations-sponsored tribunal.
The agreement is to be followed by actions by the United Nations Security Council. One would suspend trade sanctions that have crippled the Serb economy in the last three-and-a-half years. Secondary sanctions, like a ban on Serbia's membership in the United Nations and access to World Bank loans, would remain until the Serbs showed compliance with the peace accord.
Another Security Council resolution would gradually lift the arms embargo on the six republics of the former Yugoslavia, beginning 90 days after the agreement is signed. The embargo is believed to have handicapped the Bosnian Government during the course of the war against the better-armed Serbs.
But while the embargo is to end, the rivals agreed today to temporarily forswear arms purchases.
Each side is to retain its own army. Throughout the talks the Serbs refused pleas by the negotiators to give up their heavy weapons, and the Bosnian Government was unable to get a side agreement with the United States pledging immediate American help in arming and training its army.
In a news conference after the ceremony, European negotiators, who will be responsible for organizing a plan to reconstruct Bosnia, stressed that success depends on how the agreement is put into effect.
"These agreements are not self-implementing," said Pauline Neville-Jones, the head of the British delegation. Even Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator, warned that on every page of the agreement "lie challenges to both sides to set aside their differences," which he called "raw and open wounds." He added: "On paper we have peace. To make it work is our next and our greatest challenge."
Until this morning, there was no deal and the rollercoaster, marathon talks seemed doomed.
At first, the sticking point seemed to be the width of a 30-mile-long passage linking Serbia with the Serb-held territory in northwestern Bosnia, around Banja Luka. Last night the United States thought a deal was near, after the Serbs agreed to the Bosnian demand that the corridor be no wider than three miles.
At 10 P.M. Mr. Christopher went to the Bosnian delegation with a last, take-it-or-leave-it offer.
"If you can agree we have a final agreement and we can initial a peace," he told them. "If you don't, these proceedings are going to have to be suspended."
He said he needed their answer at 11:30 and went to bed. By that time, the Bosnians had no answer. Mr. Christopher called Mr. Clinton, told him he wanted to suspend the talks and went to bed.
About midnight the Bosnians issued a new demand -- control over the town of Brcko in northern Bosnia, which is currently under Serbian control and is in the middle of the corridor linking the Serbs' Bosnian territories. By morning there was no accord. The defining moment came after all three presidents agreed that the issue of Brcko could be resolved by a still-undetermined method of arbitration over the next year.
The first tangible sign that the deal was complete was a gesture as the ceremony opened. On the first day, Mr. Christoher did not shake the hand of Mr. Milosevic, who is widely blamed for starting the war. Today he did -- twice.
It was a personal achievement for both Mr. Christopher and Mr. Holbrooke, and the result of an extroardinarily complicated negotiating process in which the United States brought together the three Balkan presidents and their delegations and negotiators from Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
It also represented the evolution of Mr. Christopher's own thinking. Even before he was confirmed as Secretary of State, he was skeptical that diplomacy could bring peace to Bosnia. But he later came to the conclusion that the only way for the parties to make peace was if the United States seized control of the negotiations from the Europeans and pressured all the parties.

Map/Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: The Dayton Accord: A Peace Agreement for ther Balkans"
The settlement is a compromise amongconflicting aims. For the Muslim-dominated government of Bosnia, it affirms the legal integrity of the country and restores the unity of the capital, Sarajevo. The Serbs get -- if not the separate state they want -- a semi-autonomous republic. The Croats secure their national borders and will be able to nurture ties to Croats within Bosnia.
An elaborate governmental structure is spelled out, involving a central elected presidency and parliament presiding over two entities -- a Bosnian-Croat Federation, and a Serb Republic. Some issues, such asthe fate of Bosnian Serb leaderswho have been indicted as war criminals, are not fully addressed. The agreement does not take effect until it is formally signed, expected in Paris in mid-December.

 The Final Disputes

 Sarajevo: The Serbs wanted some parts of the city to be part of the new Serb Republic; the Bosnian government wanted and won a unified, open city, the symbolic heart of the unified nation it seeks.

 Serbian corridor: The Serbs wanted a wider corrider around the town of Brcko, linking the Serb-held areas of eastern Bosnia with the city of Banja Luka. This will be decided by arbitration.

 Path to Gorazde: The Bosnian government regains control of a swath of land linking Sarajevo with now-surroundedGorazde, strengthening its presence in the east.

 War criminals: People indicted by the international tribunal cannot hold elected office. The governments pledge to cooperate with the tribunal but are not explicitly required to arrest indicted people, who include top Bosnian Serb leaders.

 The Broad Outlines
 
Territory
The Bosnian-Croat Federation will control roughly 51 percent of the land, the Serb Republic 49 percent. Some areas of current control are given up by each side.

Constitution and Elections
A constitution creates a central federal government with a group presidency, a two-house legislature, a constitutional court and a central bank. The two sub-entities, the Bosnian-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, will each have their own presidents and legislatures as well. Officials at all levels are to be chosenin internationally supervised elections next year. How much power the central government will have, in practice, over the Serb Republic is a major question.
 
Military Pull-back
Parties must withdraw forces behind agreed cease-fire lines within 30 days, with demilitarized zones along the lines. All heavy weapons and forces will withdraw to barracks areas within 120 days. Arms imports to all sides are temporarily halted and negotiations will begin on numerical limits for heavy weapons and combat aircraft.

Peacekeepers
 Current United Nations forces will withdraw and be replaced by a peacekeeping force under NATO command, headed by an American general. The force will monitor the cease-fire and control the airspace. It will be "an active, robust force capable not only of implementing a peace agreement but also of defending itself vigorously."

 Refugees
 Displaced people will have the legal right to reclaim their homes or receive compensation. All parties will respect basic human rights and a commission will investigate violations.

 Next Steps

 The United Nations will lift the arms embargo against all states of the former Yugoslavia. Trade sanctions against Serbia will be suspended, but limits remain on its participation in international organizations.
 The peace agreement will be formally signed in Paris in December, after which a NAT0-led force, including some 20,000 American troops, will enter Bosnia to police the settlement. (pg. A10)
 
"HIGHLIGHTS"
 
TERRITORY Bosnia would maintain its current borders, but be divided into two entities -- a Bosnian-Croat federation and a Bosnian Serb republic.
 
 A central Government, with a parliament and presidency, would remain in a united Sarajevo.
 
 WAR CRIMINALS Would not be allowed to hold office, but no requirement to arrest them was specified.
 
 TROOPS Forces would be withdrawn to agreed positions and an international force sent in to keep the peace. NATO has outlined a plan for a 60,000 member force-- one-third of it American -- to act as peacekeeper.
 
 REFUGEES Would have the legal right to return home; human rights would be monitored by an independent commission. (pg. A1)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Tentative Pact Allows Enron To Continue Project in India

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
A regional government of India tentatively agreed yesterday to let the Enron Corporation go ahead with a $3 billion power plant project, signaling that India will probably continue to embrace, however hesitantly, the foreign investors it so desperately needs.
The state's nationalist Hindu leaders had scrapped the plant, the nation's largest foreign project, in August, but lately had softened their opposition in the face of legal threats and the country's huge power needs. 
 The reversal could relieve other investors who, following the case intently, were asking whether the world's second most populous market justified the aggravation and risks.
Manohar Joshi, chief minister of Maharashtra state, told reporters in India that Enron and a panel appointed by his government had agreed to reduce the costs of the project and of the electricity produced. Negotiators were discussing a possible $300 million cut in the plant's total cost to allow an 8 percent reduction in initial electricity charges. Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board had already agreed, at least in principle, for the board to buy at least a 30 percent stake in the project, but neither side said whether the sale would take place.
Enron, which is based in Houston and is the largest natural gas company in the United States, was invited into India by Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, whose national Government guaranteed the project's fulfillment. But newly elected Maharashtra politicians accused Enron of padding the project's costs by more than $700 million and corrupting politicians to win high electricity rates without competitive bidding.
The attacks on Enron cast doubt on India's four-year-old commitment to economic change and openness after decades of socialist self-reliance. India has become one of the few emerging Asian markets where American companies have bounded in ahead of Japanese competitors, with Clinton Administration officials regularly leading groups of executives there.
Yesterday's agreement, by a three-member panel of experts, must still be approved by the Maharashtra Cabinet, which expects to act by Dec. 10. Until then, Enron has agreed to suspend an arbitration case in London in which it hoped to recover at least $300 million in expenses, and as much as $2 billion including lost profits.
The Maharashtra government faced a crucial arbitration meeting in that case this Friday in London. Although legal experts call Enron's arguments strong, they note that foreign companies sometimes take decades to collect from agencies or corporations in India. Enron's costs for mothballing the project with only its foundations in place amounted to $250,000 a day.
The state's leading Shiv Sena Party eventually reconsidered its opposition, and began formal negotiations with Enron less than two weeks ago. However, a dispute with a large minority party in the governing coalition could still block the Cabinet's approval. That party, the Bharatiya Janata, plans to challenge Prime Minister Rao next year.
Despite the political discord, Ronald J. Barone, who follows Enron for Paine Webber, said that the state government was likely to back the project and that Enron would still enjoy attractive returns.
The power plant, on the rocky coast of the Arabian Sea 100 miles south of Bombay, Maharashtra's capital, is meant to supply more than 2,000 megawatts of power to a nation where industries have to generate their own power, operate at night or face chronic brownouts and blackouts.
Among the terms being negotiated was whether the first $990 million phase of the plant, to be completed in 1997, would be fed by fuel oil, probably imported, or by India's own naphtha. The next phase, costing $2 billion under the initial plans, would be fueled by liquefied natural gas that Enron plans to import from Qatar.
Enron, fearful of irritating India's officials, refused to say much more yesterday beyond blandly confirming the agreement. "We are pleased with these developments and believe we have reached a mutually beneficial settlement," said Diane Bazeledes, a company spokeswoman.
Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University trade specialist who was born in Bombay, said the Enron case should alert American investors to avoid deals that seem too friendly. The lack of competitive bidding and boasts by American officials of the benefits they had won for American companies gave Indian nationalists an inviting target, he said. "It was a boil that had to come up and be lanced," as he put it.
Diplomats said that several foreign companies had delayed or reconsidered their investments until the resolution of Enron's problems. Enron's deal brought cheer especially to CMS Energy, which threatened to pull out of two Indian power projects worth a total of $800 million if politics killed the Enron plans. "To the extent they've been able to reach an agreement to keep that project going, we view that as a positive," said Kelly M. Farr, speaking for CMS, the parent company of one of Michigan's largest utilities.
Mr. Rao initially made the Enron project the leading example of his nation's new desire to attract foreign capital and to start catching up with rapidly modernizing Asian neighbors. Since 1991, India has won only about $2 billion in foreign investment, less than China draws each month.
But as elections next spring approached, nationalist politicians derided the Enron investment as evidence of Mr. Rao's plans to sell India off to foreign exploiters. Nationalists have also staged protests against the Indian operations of Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Pepsico's Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose first restaurant in India was briefly closed by local authorities in September.
Enron owns 80 percent of the Indian project, with Bechtel Enterprises and GE Capital, the General Electric Company's finance arm, splitting the rest. Enron, which would continue to own the plant with its partners, has a contract to sell electricity, with rates tied in part to the plant's costs. The company has wanted to reduce its share of the project, but it is unclear whether the Maharashtra state electricity board can raise the money to invest.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: IN BELGRADE;
For Milosevic, a Chance at a New Lease on Political Life

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 21

 BODY:
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who presides over an economy in a shambles, a state that has been internationally branded as a pariah and a populace exhausted by war, will return to Belgrade carrying the one thing he hopes will keep him in power: a signed peace agreement.
"The war is finally over in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Mr. Milosevic said in remarks broadcast from Dayton, Ohio. "It is now time for all to turn to peace, reconstruction and economic recovery." 
 Mr. Milosevic told Serbs that the Balkan peace agreement meant that sanctions would be lifted against the truncated Yugoslavia, opening the road to "economic development."
The Security Council is expected to consider suspending sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and lifting the arms embargo on all former Yugoslav republics.
And some of the President's fiercest critics acknowledged his accomplishment and said they feared its success would strengthen Mr. Milosevic's grip on power.
"Milosevic's dream of restoring Communism is not over," said Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader. "Now that this deal is signed the biggest problem we face will be how to stop Milosevic from consolidating his totalitarian state."
Despite his triumphant tone, the last four years have been devastating for Mr. Milosevic and the Serbs. He was largely responsible for the war that led to the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the death of more than a quarter of a million people and the economic sanctions. And he has serious problems with a recalcitrant Bosnian Serb leadership, on whose behalf he negotiated, and who he must now cajole into abiding by the agreement.
Defending the deal, Mr. Milosevic said talks were long, but had given the Serbs a fair share of territory. And he said the division was better for the Serbs than a previous peace plan drawn up by the major powers.
"Everyone has now forgotten that Milosevic started the war," said Dusan Jaksic, a 30-year-old engineer. "What is important is that he ended it."
The 54-year-old President could call for new elections as early as next spring, diplomats say. He faces no real opposition, and the lifting of the sanctions will prove a potent weapon in his hands.
But the decision by Mr. Milosevic to push the Bosnian Serbs into this agreement is also a gamble, especially if they defy him, as they have in the past. Mr. Milosevic could also face growing unrest from workers who called a series of strikes around Belgrade last week, if the moribund economy does not begin to improve.
The President's toughest battle when he returns will be with the Bosnian Serb leadership. Government-run news outlets in Belgrade said today that the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and the military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, had agreed to resign in exchange for assurances that they would not be handed over to an international war-crimes tribunal.
The President intends to force the two men out of power soon after returning to Belgrade, Western diplomats said. But the two Bosnian Serb leaders said they would remain in their posts. And the Bosnian Serbs, many of whom dislike the agreement, say they are in no mood to follow dictates from Belgrade.
"What they should do with Milosevic is hang him from the nearest tree," said Mico Kovacevic, a soldier in the Bosnian Serb army, who is in Belgrade visiting friends. "There will never be peace here. There is too much hatred on both sides."

HEADLINE: Solectria Says Car Passed Crash Test

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
An advanced electric car with a body made of composite materials has passed the Federal crash test for head-on collisions, according to its manufacturer.
The development is significant not only for the company, Solectria, of Wilmington, Mass., which hopes to mass-produce the cars, but also for the three major American car companies, which are cooperating to design a high-mileage, low-pollution car, one that is likely to be made of composites. 
 The car, a four-passenger sedan called the Sunrise, broke a record in May when it went 238 miles on a single charge, in the Tour de Sol, an annual electric car race in the Northeast.
The car, which has twin air bags, passed the standard 30-mile-an-hour head-on test, Solectria said. "This full frontal crash test demonstrates that a comfortable high-performance electric vehicle comprised wholly of composite materials can provide a high degree of passenger safety," Mark Dockser, Solectria's vice president of planning and business development, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Dockser said the composite body had "consistent and predictable" results in tests on the components and on the whole vehicle.
Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, in partnership with the Federal Government, are trying to develop a "next-generation vehicle" that would achieve a fuel economy of 80 miles per gallon of gasoline, or its equivalent in other fuels.
Robert M. Chapman, the chairman of the partnership's technical task force, said today that passing the crash test was "a very positive accomplishment."
The partnership, which was formed two years ago and is still choosing which technologies to invest in, is seeking a 40 percent reduction in the weight of a midsized vehicle, he said, and "we recognize that to do so, we're going to have to go to some advanced materials." Composite materials are usually made of strands of glass and carbon fiber that are embedded in a plastic or metal matrix.
The Sunrise weighs 1,800 pounds, which is 500 pounds less than Solectria's previous car, an electric version of the Geo Metro called the Force. The Force, which has a steel body, carries three people and goes less than half as far as the Sunrise.
The Sunrise falls short of the goals for the next-generation vehicle, but appears to be creeping up on them. The Big Three want to see a car that goes from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 10 seconds, but the Sunrise, which is engineered for range, takes a sluggish 18 seconds. The next-generation car is supposed to go 380 miles on the highway on a single charge -- an optimistic estimate of the range of a midsized car today -- compared with about 238 miles now for the Sunrise.
But the 80-mile-per-gallon or equivalent goal has been met. The Sunrise carries an electrical equivalent of less than two gallons of gasoline, meaning its mileage exceeds 100 miles a gallon. And while some safety tests remain to be done, including tests on the defroster, Solectria believes the safety standards are well within reach.
The next-generation car is also supposed to cost about the same as a conventional car. Solectria believes that with enough orders -- about 20,000 a year -- it can produce its Sunrise competitively. But that depends on further cuts in the cost of batteries.

HEADLINE: Republicans Look to a Governor Who Stood Firm

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 21

 BODY:
As John M. Engler prepared to run for his second term as Governor of Michigan two years ago, his pollsters, relieved to see Mr. Engler's approval ratings rebounding from dismal lows, started asking voters what animal he brought to mind.
Some politicians might have hoped for "thoroughbred horse" or "golden retriever." But the voters delighted Mr. Engler's staff by suggesting creatures like "badger" -- not because of Mr. Engler's build, but because of his determination. 
 "It was, 'Man, if he says he's going to do something, you better get out of his way,' " said David B. Hill, Mr. Engler's pollster.
As they drop in the polls and await the next election, Speaker Newt Gingrich and many other Republican lawmakers take heart from Mr. Engler's example. The Governor, who fulfilled promises to cut taxes and state programs, was overwhelmingly re-elected last November. And Republicans say the lesson from his comeback is this: Whatever their short-term disapproval, voters will ultimately reward politicians who deliver on promises.
But Mr. Engler, with a four-year term, had twice the time as first-term Representatives for his policies to pay off. He also focused on a few issues, like welfare, whose beneficiaries, the poor, do not have much political influence. Congress, with its proposals to overhaul Medicare, the Federal health care program for the elderly, risks alienating a more powerful group.
Mr. Engler's critics and some independent analysts also say he was fortunate to preside over a booming state economy.
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said he had spent "countless hours" cnsulting with Mr. Engler on changing the welfare system. Mr. Shaw said the Governor's experience had shown that "the people will like you if you do the right thing and continue to do it and don't worry about the polls."
"He really did have a massive turnaround in the polls," Mr. Shaw added. "That man was dead meat for a while."
But Mr. Engler had four years to achieve his turnaround.
William S. Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a nonpartisan newsletter, said, "It's very obvious what the big difference is, and that is two years versus four years, or, you could say, one year versus three years."
The advantage of a longer term also applies to first-term Governors like George E. Pataki of New York, who has three years to turn around his flagging approval ratings.
Mr. Pataki, who hired Mr. Engler's budget director, is pursuing an agenda similar to Mr. Engler's.
"A lot of the things we're trying to do in New York, Governor Engler has been successful doing in Michigan," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman.
But Mr. Ballenger noted that in addition to time Mr. Engler also had superb timing.
"Whether he had a lot of luck, or a lot of skill, or a good measure of both -- and frankly I think it was the latter -- everything seemed to gel for him at exactly the right time last year," he said.
For Mr. Engler's staff, one of the grimmest moments was a meeting in November 1991 at which the pollster Mr. Hill told Mr. Engler that 40 percent of the voters "strongly" disapproved of him and 15 percent "somewhat" disapproved. Only 31 percent approved.
"It was the most depressing meeting I ever sat through," said John Truscott, the Governor's press secretary. While other polls showed Mr. Engler hitting different low points at different times, state analysts agree on his overall political trajectory. "By the end of '91 and into '92, he had tremendously low ratings," said Bernie Porn, president of EPIC/ MRA, a polling firm.
Having inherited a $1.8 billion debt, Mr. Engler eliminated the Department of Licensing and Regulation and cut 20 boards and commissions. He also eliminated a program that gave grants to unemployed adults without children, and in his first two years reduced the state payroll by about 5,000 positions, or more than 7 percent.
Less than a year into Mr. Engler's first term, television reports showed people being thrown out of low-rate hotels, attributing the evictions to state welfare cuts. An "Englerville" of tents sprouted on the Capitol lawn.
In surveys, Mr. Hill said, voters were describing the Governor as "mean, no account, doesn't care about anybody."
But rather than try to soften his image, Mr. Engler and his staff turned his perceived toughness into an asset, refusing to back down on his cuts. And Mr. Engler took another calculated risk by pushing for a reduction in the property tax, coupled with an increase in the sales tax, to change the state's approach to financing public schools.
Apparently because voters did not believe that property taxes would actually go down, Mr. Engler lost two referendums on versions of his financing plan. But after tinkering with the formula to broaden its appeal, he won overwhelming support for the measure in its third appearance on the ballot, in March 1994.
Later that year, with the state running a surplus and voters relishing the property tax cut, Mr. Engler ran for re-election on a slogan of "Promises Made, Promises Kept" and walked away with 61 percent of the vote. His approval ratings have remained high.
Mr. Engler owes some popularity to an economy that he, like other governors, has little control over. His tax and spending cuts came as the auto market strengthened. During that grim meeting in 1991, the state unemployment rate was 9.5 percent; last month, it was 4.4 percent, the lowest in at least 25 years.
In an interview, Mr. Engler said that in demonizing Republican policies Democrats were making the same mistake nationally that they had made here.
"Things started to change for us in 1992 as people began to see that the scare tactics that had been used just literally months before didn't come to pass," he said. "It's a little like now, when you've got the White House and the Democrats in Congress scaring old people."
Mr. Engler argued that voters would approve of the Republican Congress for sticking with its program. "We had a lot of people saying, 'He's doing what he said he would do,' and that's exactly what you can say about this Congress," he said. "That's a powerful thing, at a time when there's a great cynicism about people in public office."
But it is not certain that Congress can expect that accolade. Mr. Engler's critics argue that those most hurt by his policies -- the poor -- lack political influence. Republicans in Congress risk alienating more politically powerful constituents, the elderly. And while Mr. Engler focused on a few issues, Congress could be judged on everything from cutting agricultural subsidies to rewriting lobbying laws.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises vs. Yen and Mark; Trading Quiet Before Holidays

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday in quiet trading ahead of holidays in the United States and Japan.
Some market participants said that they expected wrangling over the United States budget and economic crosscurrents to keep the dollar in narrow ranges for the rest of the year. 
 "We're in a real quiet zone here for the dollar," said Karl Halligan, strategic currency trader for CIC Bank New York.
On Monday, the dollar rose in early trading after a temporary spending agreement was reached between Congress and the Clinton Administration, but fell back as market participants realized arduous negotiations for a balanced budget were ahead.
The dollar bounced back yesterday, and currency traders viewed the move as a continuation of the dollar's up-and-down pattern within tight bands. In the last two months, the dollar has traded in ranges of 97.50 to 104.14 Japanese yen and 1.3810 to 1.4440 German marks.
"The budget thing being pushed off into December makes it difficult to do anything on the dollar," said Richard Koss, currency strategist for MFR Inc., a money management and consulting firm.
Bruce English, manager of institutional currency sales at ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago, predicted that the dollar would trade in ranges of 1.38 to 1.44 marks and 98.50 to 104.50 yen until the end of the year.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 101.47 yen from 101.35 yen on Monday. The dollar also rose to 1.4076 marks from 1.4067 marks, but fell to 1.1369 Swiss francs from 1.1375 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5580 from $1.5539.
Financial markets will be closed tomorrow in observance of Thanksgiving Day, while the market in Japan will be closed for Labor Thanksgiving Day.
In other trading yesterday, the Canadian dollar surged along with Canadian bond prices after a leader of Quebec's secession movement, Lucien Bouchard, said he would run for premier of the province and would not call for a referendum on independence until at least 1997. Quebec separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence on Oct. 30.
"We have addressed a major source of political uncertainty here," said Michael Gregory, a fixed-income analyst with Lehman Brothers in Toronto.
The Canadian dollar rose as high as 74.22 United States cents before retreating. It settled at 73.92 United States cents, down from 73.98 cents on Monday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Are Weaker

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices weakened yesterday as market participants, faced with additional new supply, squared their positions ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Prices were hurt in part by retail sales data that suggested that consumers were stepping up their buying as the holidays approached. The market was also weighed down by the Treasury's auction of new 10-year notes. While the $13.5 billion sale drew strong demand, some traders and analysts said the results were not as impressive as Monday's auction of three-year notes. In any case, prices are typically weaker when there are auctions as the market braces to absorb the new supply. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 108 /32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.26 percent, from 6.24 percent on Monday. 
 The market shrugged off the day's first retail sales report. The Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim chain store sales index for the week ending Nov. 18 showed a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent. Analysts said the gain represented a slight rebound from a depressed pace in October.
Later in the day, however, the more closely followed Johnson Redbook report surprised market watchers, showing a 2.2 percent gain in retail sales for the first three weeks of November. Many market participants had expected sales growth to ease below 2 percent.
With Congress away until next Monday, negotiations over a balanced budget and debt ceiling extension will not begin in earnest until next week, so the market had only the auction and retail data to focus on yesterday.
At yesterday's auction of new 10-year notes, which marks the conclusion of the Government's quarterly refunding, the average yield at auction was 5.90 percent. It was the lowest yield since Feb. 9, 1994, when the yield was 5.92 percent.
The Treasury is expected to anounce at noon today the size of next week's two- and five-year note auctions.
Activity usually quickens ahead of a Treasury auction as yields rise when dealers and traders lower prices trying to make the new issue more attractive to investors and make an easy sale to clear old inventory from dealers' shelves.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst with Chase Securities, said the market was dealing with the supply, and that the absence of fresh numbers would keep it on hold.
Trading is expected to be light today, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Public Securities Association has recommended that the cash market close early today, at 2 P.M. The cash and futures markets will be closed tomorrow and will reopen on Friday.
Today, the University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence in November will be released.
In futures trading, analysts said the December bond futures contract was approaching a critical level.
Robin Mesch, a fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, said 117 22/32 to 117 17/32 was a major barrier of resistance "and today we were down to 117 10/32 at the close."
"I expect a fight at between 116 20/32 and 117 20/32, with the winner taking all," she said.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: New Buyer Being Sought For Coliseum

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
After more than a decade of pitched neighborhood battles, court fights, environmental studies and last-minute deadlines over the fate of the New York Coliseum, the state and city have now decided to turn the clock back to 1984 and look for a new buyer for the valuable Columbus Circle site.
Yesterday, Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of New York State's economic development agency, announced that the state, the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Coliseum, would issue requests for new development proposals before the end of the year. 
 "We are open to a variety of possibilities," Mr. Gargano said. "We would consider any project that would provide the most value for the M.T.A., the city and address the interests of the surrounding community."
The decision marks a significant reversal on the part of the M.T.A. Ever since a deal with Mortimer B. Zuckerman to create a huge retail and residential complex there fell through, the transit agency and the Giuliani administration have feuded bitterly over the future of the Coliseum.
While city officials wanted to look for another buyer -- a process that could take months, if not years -- the M.T.A. argued that it should lease the building as a way of generating quick income.
And not only is the agency changing its financial goals, it also seems to be relinquishing its role as the lead agency in determining the fate of the Coliseum.
Mr. Gargano said the involvement of his agency was a reflection of Gov. George E. Pataki's continuing interest in turning some government functions over to private enterprise. "Gov. Pataki is looking toward privatization wherever possible," he said. "We want to put a sharper focus on the effort to determine the best use for the development of the site."
But it is also a reflection of the political realities in Albany. The transportation authority is now run by a Pataki appointee and close associate of the Governor, E. Virgil Conway. His predecessor, Peter E. Stangl, had staunchly resisted efforts by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to press for a sale of the property, particularly at a time when real estate prices were depressed.
Mr. Conway did not respond to telephoned requests for comment yesterday. But in a written statement he expressed support for the initiative and seemed comfortable with his agency's secondary role in the matter.
"For far too long, the Coliseum has been a political football and the subject of endless feasibility studies," Mr. Conway said. "The time for studies has ended. The time for action is now. The Coliseum will be developed and Columbus Circle and all of New York will benefit."
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for economic development, also said the Giuliani administration welcomed the state's involvement. "We very much want it back in private hands," Mr. Dyson said. "Much more reasonable minds are running the M.T.A. now, which will help keep the focus on development."
Mr. Gargano said the terms of the requests for proposals for the redevelopment of the Coliseum had not been finished, and he said he would be willing to consider proposals for only portions of the site, like just the Coliseum itself, or just the adjacent office tower. In addition, he said officials would also consider a long-term lease.
But Mr. Dyson said the city still believed it would benefit most from some type of convention facility on the site. While Mr. Dyson said that a convention center was not stipulated in the request for proposed uses, he added that, "Our economic study plainly shows that the city would best be served from the taxes, hotel and entertainment uses generated by a convention center."
The announcement that officials would seek new bidders is only the latest in a tortuous series of moves and countermoves that began when the M.T.A. first put the Coliseum up for sale in 1984. At the time, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was under construction, and officials felt that the Coliseum's business was certain to fall off sharply once it was built.
After an intense struggle among several developers, Boston Properties, headed by Mr. Zuckerman, was awarded the development contract, agreeing to pay $455 million. But after a series of court challenges and after the stock market crash of 1987, the proposal was scaled back considerably. But even that was not enough to save the proposal, and it collapsed in acrimony in the summer of 1994.
That the Coliseum has been the subject of intense and emotional interest from neighborhood groups, public officials and private developers is understandable. Occupying a 3.4-acre parcel near the southwest corner of Central Park at 59th Street, a new development could offer spectacular views of the park and midtown Manhattan. The property's development potential resides in both its proximity to Central Park and its position as the gateway to the Upper West Side, one of the city's most popular residential neighborhoods.
But no matter what sort of project emerges with the support of the state and city, any development would still face intense scruitiny from community groups and be subject to the required public review process.
In announcing the plan to seek developers, city and state officials referred to the recent revival of Columbus Circle and the development on the Upper West Side.
Directly across the street, Donald J. Trump, the developer, in partnership with General Electric is redeveloping the former Gulf and Western building. Mr. Trump is transforming the former office building into a combination hotel and apartment building. Near Lincoln Center another development company, Millennium Partners, is completing a mixed-use project including offices, shops, a movie theater and apartments.
While the city, state and M.T.A. for the first time in years appear to agree on what to do with the Coliseum, not all city officials were pleased with the renewed efforts to develop the property.
Ronnie Eldridge, a city councilwoman whose district includes the Coliseum site, said she feared that the state's involvement would make it more difficult for people in her community to have a say in project's future. "I am stunned by the abruptness of this move," Ms. Eldridge said. "I regret that they did not talk to us before making the announcement. Many of us had hoped to be part of any comprehensive plan for the use of the Coliseum and Columbus Circle."
Ms. Eldridge said she believed the initiative to put the Coliseum back on the market was a reflection of budget shortfalls for both the city and the state. "Both the city and the state are facing such severe gaps," said Ms. Eldridge, who supported plans for an interim use of the Coliseum, "that we are in a race to control those items that will bring in as much revenue as possible."
The Giuliani administration has been pressing for a sale because of the jobs new construction would create and because a new development would send a message that the city's economic recovery was under way. The M.T.A. argued that it would be more lucrative to lease the building for 10 years or more for quick revenue and wait for the real estate market to recover. After the deal with Mr. Zuckerman fell apart, the agency considered proposals ranging from a television studio to a roller-skating rink to retail stores.
After months of wrangling over the fate of the Coliseum, last spring the city and the M.T.A. appeared to have found common ground on the issue. Based on a report by city economists showing that a successful convention center could earn up to $30 million in taxes and create 10,000 jobs, the city and the M.T.A. agreed to reopen the Coliseum as a convention center.
Last month, the Coliseum resumed full operation and is booked well into the early part of next year.

HEADLINE: Talking, Thinking, Cooking Turkey;
When Menus Are Long and Time Is Short, Stress Is Served

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
For Barbara Anne Livingstone, the days before Thanksgiving have been filled with premonitions of disaster. Her second-worst fear: that she will neglect her 24-pound turkey for mere seconds and burn it to ashes. Her worst: that she will not clean it properly, and sicken her husband and their seven guests.
"This is my first Thanksgiving," said Mrs. Livingstone, 30, of Butler, N.J., a relatively new homeowner who has little experience with large poultry. "I want it to be memorable, but not that way." 
 For Arline Tarte, the days have been filled with a sense of blessed relief. In previous years, Ms. Tarte, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, would return home from long hours at the office and cook past midnight for a party of 20. This year, she has hired a chef to come to her apartment and do it for her.
"I can relax, sleep late and not look harried and exhausted," said Ms. Tarte, 53, an executive with a printing company. "What a pleasure."
Around the New York region this week, people readied themselves for a holiday with a famously long menu and notoriously complicated family logistics, but perhaps no two of them committed themselves to the same level of fussing, and perhaps no two felt the same excitement and apprehension.
For some, Thanksgiving promised to be a reminder of the bounty in their lives: a large family, close friends, the means to spread out a lavish and sumptuous smorgasbord. For others, it was a sad reminder of their loneliness or poverty that held out the possibility of a brief respite from deprivation in the form of a turkey handout.
Janet Burgos, who stood on a long line outside a food pantry in Manhattan yesterday, said she had not yet devised a Thanksgiving menu for herself, her husband and their four children, because it all depended on what was in the bag of free groceries she would soon receive.
"I've already spent all my food stamps for the month," said Ms. Burgos, 33, who lives two blocks from the Yorkville Common Pantry, on the border between the Upper East Side and Harlem.
Ms. Burgos said she would love to invite relatives over, or to cook something special in addition to a turkey. "I've always wanted to make lamb roasts the way I've seen them on TV, with the little paper bows," she said.
But she and her husband are both unemployed, so Ms. Burgos arrived at the pantry promptly at 9 A.M. yesterday so she could be near the head of the line and lay claim to one of the biggest birds.
A few dozen blocks to the north and south, streets and stores buzzed with different kinds of holiday activity. On the Upper East Side, patrons filed into William Greenberg Jr. Desserts to fetch one of the hundreds of boxes of pumpkin and apple pies stacked in tall, leaning towers. In Harlem, Thora Seeley, 53, came away from an open air produce market on 137th Street with a plastic bag of collard greens that weighed 16 pounds and was more than half as large as Ms. Seeley herself.
Although she is not the host for her family's celebration in the South Bronx, she said she always makes the collard greens. She usually buys them at the same place and follows the same recipe, using plenty of smoked pork and a small amount of vinegar.
"I'll wake up at 5 A.M. on Thursday to do it," Ms. Seeley said in a tone that hovered between harried and proud.
Sleep deprivation and the burden of upholding a traditional Thanksgiving menu were common themes among those shouldering the responsibilities for cooking.
"At Christmas, you can fudge a little bit," said Maria Nunes, 31, a corporate image consultant who lives and works in Manhattan. "This is a little more complicated, because there are things people expect, and it's not Thanksgiving without them."
Five years ago, when Ms. Nunes's mother died, she and her older sister, a professor at Columbia University, inherited the holiday cooking chores for the family, even though both women work 60-hour weeks.
They now have it down to a science. Yesterday, Ms. Nunes's sister faxed a menu and list of recipes to their father in Milford, Conn., so he can do the shopping today. Tonight, Ms. Nunes will arrive by train in Milford at 10:30, inspect the groceries, run out to an all-night store to remedy any mistakes and then bake until at least midnight.
Her sister will join her on Thanksgiving morning to prepare the turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes for a dozen other family members. It's an endeavor exhausting enough that the Nunes sisters have prodded their father to take cooking classes.
"We've started to mutiny," Ms. Nunes said.
Andrew Bergh, a 33-year-old waiter and playwright in Manhattan, has negotiated a different route out of the kitchen. Although he is supposed to bring a dessert for his family's celebration in Armonk, N.Y., he said, "I'm not above buying a cake and putting it in some Tupperware and saying it's mine."
In terms of scale, nobody was preparing like the Salvation Army. The organization expects to serve Thanksgiving dinners to 3,000 people at its headquarters in Manhattan on West 14th Street. The grocery list is staggering: one to one and a half tons each of turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and kernel corn; 1,000 pounds of cranberry sauce; 250 apple and pumpkin pies.
A more unusual kind of preparation unfolded early this week at the Catholic Migration Center job training site in Brooklyn, where 10 immigrants learning to be chefs received a lesson on this holiday's menu.
The instructor, Carl Esposito, had to digress when one student quizzed him about the meaning of Thanksgiving. Mr. Esposito spoke of Pilgrims and Native Americans, religious persecution and corn on the cob, then moved on to the fine points of oven temperature and safeguards against bacteria in a turkey.
When he finished, a student from Poland innocently asked: "Why bother?"
Mrs. Livingstone, a receptionist at an insurance company, has an answer for that. As soon as she and her husband, a postal worker, bought their first home a year ago, she set her sights on making this Thanksgiving as her debut as a host, a baptism by fire. But first, she and her husband had to do something about their stove, which was too small to cook a decent-sized turkey.
A new stove arrived last week. Mrs. Livingstone said she hoped it would be a charm for the first turkey she has ever roasted.
"My sister said to me, 'Call me as soon as you get up that morning and I'm going to tell you everything you have to do, step by step,' " Mrs. Livingstone said. "I think she's a little afraid."
 
Designing Dudley
 Among the familiar faces that will appear in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade tommorrow, there will be three new ones. One has scales, a goofy grin and a cute little dental problem - Dudley the dragon, the star of a children's show on PBS. Here is a look at how Dudley was brought to life.
 
1. Sketches Are Made
At an unassuming warehouse in Hoboken, designers study the character and produce a number of sketches, with the emphasis on capturing the personality of the character.
2. A Clay Model Is Made
Clay is applied to a steel frame to produce the first three-dimensional model of the balloon.
3. Fiberglass Model
A mold is made of the clay sculpture. The mold is then used to make a fiberglass model at a scale of half an inch per foot. This model is painted for realism.
4. The Fabric Is Cut and the Balloon Constructed
Fabricators at another factory cut panels for the balloon from a very strong, rip-resistant, flash-coated urethane fabric to make 16 air chambers. The panels are then heat-sealed and the completed balloon is sent back to the studio in Hoboken.
5. Finally, the Balloon Is Painted
The balloon is brought to the center of a large three-story room, inflated and painted using the fiberglass model as a reference.
6. Inflating the Balloon: Air vs. Helium
Air is combined with 10,500 feet of helium to inflate the 13,000-cubic-foot balloon. The mixture varies chamber by chamber to help the balloon stand up straight. The lower chambers of hte balloon are virtually all air to keep the balloon stable.

Confidence in Economy Drops

BYLINE: By SUSN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The business community's confidence in the state economy has declined from last year's eight-year high, according to a survey released yesterday by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Only 56 percent of the survey's 2,000 respondents -- mostly small-business owners -- said they believed the state's economy was expanding or recovering, compared with 78 percent of respondents last year. The survey was mailed to association members in September. 
 "In terms of economic growth, 1995 wasn't a barn-burner and 1996 isn't likely to be one either," said Joseph P. Gonzalez Jr., the association's executive director. "The message from this survey is: slow growth ahead."

HEADLINE: Clinton Neglected Promises on Economy;
A Promise He Kept

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire, my favorite conservative columnist, surely knows better. In his Nov. 16 column he wrote: "On taking office in 1993, the previously centrist Clinton made a surprise 'lurch to the left,' raising taxes and proposing new spending." 
 Candidate Bill Clinton was the most liberal Democratic nominee since 1972. He repeatedly promised to raise taxes on the wealthy. (That promise appears four times in the first 15 pages of the campaign book "Putting People First.")
He also promised dramatic new investments in infrastructure (remember high-speed rail?) and education. "Putting People First" promised $50 billion a year in new investments. Mr. Clinton virtually ignored that great "centrist" obsession, the deficit; he was content to abandon that issue to the also-rans Paul Tsongas and Ross Perot.
Once President Clinton was in office, as Bob Woodward has detailed in his book "The Agenda," he made a surprising "wrench to the right."
He surrounded himself with deficit hawks like Lloyd Bentsen and Leon Panetta, who persuaded him to abandon the investment strategy and instead cut spending to reduce the deficit. The 1993 budget contained over $200 billion in spending cuts, but less than $10 billion in "investments."
Mr. Clinton did fulfill his promise to raise taxes on the wealthy, but, fearful of antagonizing Wall Street, he failed to highlight that fact in his public campaign for his budget. Mr. Woodward recounts that the political adviser Paul Begala was apoplectic at Mr. Clinton's failure to emphasize the tax on the rich -- for good reason: A March 1993 poll showed that 82 percent of Americans supported the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy.
Mr. Clinton paid a fearful political price for his rightward turn. The public, who find the deficit a boring and confusing issue, gave Mr. Clinton no credit for reducing it. A November 1994 Newsweek poll showed that most Americans incorrectly believed that the deficit had gone up during Mr. Clinton's turn. And, since Mr. Clinton failed to emphasize that he was taxing the rich, Republicans managed to deceive two-thirds of Americans into believing that the middle class, rather than the rich, had borne the brunt of "Clinton's tax increases."

HEADLINE: POP REVIEW;
Double A Trio And the Music Debates

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
In a recent interview in Guitar World magazine, Robert Fripp explained the epiphany that led him to reform his influential art-rock band, King Crimson, as a double-trio (two drummers, two guitarists, and two people playing the Chapman stick, which combines guitar and bass). It occurred when he was driving down a street with a school on the left and a church on the right. Here were two institutions intrinsic to human history but also teaching lessons that conflict with each another.
On Monday night at the Longacre Theater, in the first of a series of five concerts that concludes on Saturday, King Crimson worked toward reconciling conflicting musical styles. In past incarnations of the band, which formed in 1969 and regrouped this year after a decadelong hiatus, this meant melding improvised and composed music using blues-rock, modal jazz, early-20th-century classical music and electronic technology. 
 But as a double-trio, each pair of players came to embody a dialectic. Mr. Fripp sat stiffly in the dark at the back of the stage, navigating his guitar with an extreme economy of hand and arm movement, while Adrian Belew stood in the spotlight in front of him, producing the sounds he wanted from his guitar with flashy moves like warping the neck and punching the strings. On percussion, Pat Mastelotto played like a slightly ambitious rock timekeeper while Bill Bruford complicated the sound with a repertory of jazz and avant-garde frills and flourishes. And on Chapman stick, Trey Gunn played rogue and rookie to Tony Levin's large arsenal of techniques and instruments. When building their mannered progressive-rock, they no longer seemed to be using divergent styles, but rather to be working together to create a smooth, linear sound with pointillistic playing.
Since it last performed in New York in June, the band has become much more fluid, and has grown comfortable with the songs on its new album, "Thrak" (Virgin). The instrumental "Vrooom," with Mr. Fripp's beautiful computer-processed guitar picking, and the languorous "Walking on Air," with Mr. Belew abandoning his arty squawk for Bryan Ferryesque smoothness, held up to older songs like "Elephant Talk" and "Frame by Frame."
In the new "Dinosaur," a wry comment on King Crimson's old-timer status, one could hear the sound of Adrian Belew's pick striking his guitar strings with a dry, brittle crack. But what came out of the speakers was digitally altered into a lush, orchestral string sound. This ability to turn simple and ordinary and into the erudite and unusual made Monday's concert a welcome return.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
A Money-Mad Mirage From Scorsese

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
Of all the bravura visual effects in Martin Scorsese's dazzlingly stylish "Casino," it's a glimpse of ordinary people that delivers the greatest jolt. Strategically timed to offset three hours' worth of vintage Las Vegas glitter, it's a reminder that Mr. Scorsese has given this film's setting the surreal and breathtaking intensity of a money-mad mirage. The real world looks shockingly impoverished by comparison.
With its rivers of cash and mountains of neon, its high rollers and lowlife hoods, "Casino" luxuriantly explores the anatomy of America's gaudiest (and now most cinematically popular) playground. The place is quagmire enough for an epic morality play, but this film's tone is staunchly journalistic, as borne out by its matter-of-fact last words: "And that's that." 
 So "Casino," based on reportorial work by Nicholas Pileggi, comes equipped with the liabilities of investigative journalism: no conveniently sharp focus, a plot built like a centipede and characters with lives too messy to form conventional dramatic arcs. But the material unearthed by Mr. Pileggi also features truths much stranger than fiction, wildly histrionic showdowns, intricate mob trivia and people whose Faustian conniving and obsessive fury fit perfectly into the Scorsese canon. Mr. Scorsese has been here and done this already in "Goodfellas," but not with his new film's blistering bitterness or its peacock extravagance. The long, astonishing Copacabana sequence in "Goodfellas" was only a warm-up for this.
Mr. Pileggi, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, all "Goodfellas" alumni, are back in familiar capacities, joining Mr. Scorsese to do what they do best. But "Casino" also has a new ingredient in Sharon Stone, who will be nobody's idea of Hollywood fluff after this spectacular, emblematic performance. As Ginger McKenna, a gorgeous hustler who falls from the ranks of Vegas's royalty to its lowest depths, she represents the full range of this film's stark extremes. Like all the film's principal characters, Ginger is a renamed and slightly modified version of the woman described in Mr. Pileggi's book. But her most crazily extreme behavior is true to his account.
"Casino" is chiefly about a gambling prodigy -- called Sam (Ace) Rothstein in the film -- who supervised a thriving hotel casino in its glory days. More number-cruncher than swaggering mobster, Ace was fastidious enough to regulate the number of blueberries in his restaurant's blueberry muffins. When it came to the showgirls in his nightclub, he kept track of their exact weight without, it seems, even bothering to ogle.
So Ace depended on the mad-dog energies of his vicious best friend, Nicky Santoro -- at least until Nicky became a menace. "We made a great pair," Ace recalls in the voice-over, which is one of the film's bolder moves, since one of the two narrators turns out to be speaking from beyond the grave. "I made book, and Nicky made sure we always collected."
From those simple beginnings, with Mr. De Niro and Mr. Pesci cast ideally as Ace and Nicky, "Casino" spins a gigantic web. It outlines the intricacies of casino cheating; the complex financial structure linking casino profits to mob bosses in Kansas City; the greased-palm etiquette ruling all Las Vegas, from its politicians to its valet parkers; the Federal investigation that had Ace and Nicky dodging surveillance planes, wiretaps and lip-readers, and even the blinding peculiarities of local fashion and interior decor.
Outlandish and yet becoming, the flashy 1970's costumes are a movie in themselves thanks to Rita Ryack and John Dunn, who show off Ms. Stone to traffic-stopping effect and find Ace more colors than there are in the rainbow. Costume and character are well linked, as when Ace sits in his office in a shirt, white socks and turquoise loafers, keeping his turquoise pants on a hanger unless company appears. Meanwhile, Dante Ferretti, a long way from "The Age of Innocence," contributes wonderfully witty and affectionate production design.
Sometimes the film overloads its audience's capacity to absorb arcane schemes or fiscal data; sometimes it takes off on abrupt tangents. Occasionally it seems repetitive, but most of it is agile and enveloping, economically packing in a wealth of detail.
In a town where even marriage is a business deal, Ace makes a gambler's proposal to Ginger: "Wanna take a chance?" She responds in kind, demanding jewelry from Ace without abandoning an old boyfriend whom the film slyly calls Lester Diamond. Played with suitable sleaze by James Woods, Lester is described by Ace as "a moocher, a card cheat, a country club golf hustler chasing dentists for a few bucks." Even this film's many minor figures are sharply drawn.
Lester, Nicky, booze, greed and hubris all contribute to the breakdown of Ace and Ginger's marriage, culminating in a riotous, terrible meltdown that makes for one of the most scorching episodes Mr. Scorsese has ever filmed. "Casino" depicts some savage gangland violence (most of it brief), but its chief viciousness is reserved for the domestic arena. Look elsewhere for moral lessons or warm, fuzzy accounts of true love.
"Casino" doesn't do as much as it might have with the tale of Ace and Ginger's merger, which shares the whole film's taste for gleaming surface over inner depth. But it does know why Ace's first sight of Ginger, on a black and white surveillance camera scanning the casino, is enough to stop him cold. At pivotal moments, the film's terrific pop score (supervised by Robbie Robertson, ranging from "Stardust" and soul to the Rolling Stones and Devo) delivers just the right ironic commentary on the action. At Ginger and Ace's wedding, "What a Difference a Day Makes" says it all.
 
"Casino" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes frequent profanity and several quick but graphic violent episodes involving beatings, a stabbing and a head caught in a vise.

 BODY:
THE average Thanksgiving dinner at home this year will include 12 people and will cost $8.79 a person. The favorite pie will be pumpkin; the most popular side dish, mashed potatoes.
Those findings are part of a study, the Lenox Report, commissioned by Lenox Brands in Lawrenceville, N.J., a manufacturer of china, crystal and gift ware. 
 The report is based on a nationwide telephone survey of 1,000 adults. It also revealed that nearly all planned some kind of Thanksgiving celebration, virtually half of these events at home.
And if they travel, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warns, overeating, which induces drowsiness, is as dangerous for drivers as drinking.
As for ideas for leftovers, Martini & Rossi, the vermouth company, will have home economists ready to answer questions on Friday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Eastern standard time, at (800) 972-2784.

HEADLINE: Pilgrims Wear Different Hats In Recast Thanksgiving Tales

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Plymouth Rock and the Mayflower were nowhere to be found in the Thanksgiving story that Kate Seid read to her fourth-grade class at Public School 87 on the Upper West Side this week.
Instead, there was a band of "strange-looking people" who landed a "big airship" in a family's backyard and proceeded to ransack their house, cut down their trees, kill their pets and take tomatoes from their garden. 
 Across town at P.S. 6 on the Upper East Side, Rebecca Applebaum's first graders heard another Thanksgiving tale about boat people who fled a tropical dictatorship and braved a perilous journey to become refugees in America.
"The story shows how anyone can be a Pilgrim," Ms. Applebaum said. "A lot of people came to America because they weren't free in their country to believe what they wanted to believe."
In schools in New York City and across the country, Thanksgiving is getting a makeover, as teachers recast the Pilgrim-and-Indian story to reflect the political and cultural sensibilities of the 1990's. In some cases, as in the allegory about the aliens, the lessons veer sharply from traditional American history to cast the European settlers as selfish trespassers. In others, as in the refugee tale, teachers are cleaving to the original interpretation but seeking to put a history lesson in a contemporary context.
Just as Christopher Columbus has been transformed in many classrooms from brave explorer to false hero, the Thanksgiving holiday is being reconstructed, even celebrated differently. Feathered headdresses and pointed black hats are out in some schools, while others make sure such costumes are only one part of the celebration. Harvest festivals and multicultural feasts are in. Depending on the teacher, the Pilgrims have been likened to tree-cutting aliens, emigres from oppressive countries or pioneers who worked with the Indians to plant and harvest crops.
Experts on history are wary that some of the creativity may lead to distortions. "It's nice to give Thanksgiving some cultural relevance," said Kenneth C. Davis, the author of "Don't Know Much About History" (Crown Publishers, 1990). "It's important to make contemporary parallels. But let's not throw out the real history either."
Across the country, the Thanksgiving story is increasingly being taught as an immigrant story, an invasion story, a cultural-exchange story or some combination of the three, said James R. Giese, executive director of the Social Science Education Consortium in Boulder, Colo., a national organization that trains social studies teachers and develops curriculum. The best schools "are trying not to look at it as good guys, bad guys," he said, but are emphasizing the complexity of the relationship between the Pilgrims and the Indians.
The New York City Board of Education does not take a position on the Thanksgiving story, but trains teachers that "you have to look at things like this from many different perspectives," said Barbara Gerard, assistant director of multicultural education.
Three years ago, the principal of P.S. 150 in Sunnyside, Queens, began to feel that the traditional version of Thanksgiving held little meaning for a school with immigrants from 75 countries.
"We did some research and found out that a lot of countries have harvest festivals that happen more or less around this time of year," said the principal, Gloria Guzman. "And then, going back and rethinking the whole Thanksgiving piece, we decided that was also a celebration of the harvest. We try to emphasize the Pilgrims as pioneers, and we talk about the how the Indians helped the Pilgrims plant vegetables."
So now, on the day before Thanksgiving the school's first graders hold a harvest festival and bring in food from their native countries. Classes learn about Thanksgiving alongside harvest rituals from South America, Asia and Africa.
Schools are also increasingly defining Thanksgiving as a time to help the homeless, the elderly, the sick and other people in the community. Food banks and other programs say donations are up this Thanksgiving from schools.
"What we'll do is celebrate it as part of a community, but not take time from the curriculum to sort of stop and study Thanksgiving," said Frank DeStefano, the principal of P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village, which held both a food drive and a coat drive this year. Mr. DeStefano was momentarily dismayed this week when he saw a kindergarten class making Indian headbands.
"I thought, 'Oh no, are they doing Indians for Thanksgiving?' " Mr. DeStefano said. "But it turned out it was actually a follow-up to a trip" to the National Museum of the American Indian.
Some elementary school classes, especially for the older pupils, talk about Thanksgiving mostly in the context of regular social studies courses, like a fourth-grade lesson about immigrants or a third-grade class on world cultures. For second graders at P.S. 6 this week, Thanksgiving discussions were supplemented with an exercise in another piece of 17th-century American history, a Dutch Day, in which children pretended to be in New Amsterdam with Peter Stuyvesant-era costumes, dunce chairs and horn books.
But some schools are sticking with tradition.
At P.S. 42 in Far Rockaway, Queens, where 95 percent of the students are African-American, Hispanic or both, children still dress up as Pilgrims and Indians, said the principal, Juanita Bass. The school stays away from interpretations that depict the Pilgrims as interlopers because "we consider that one of the negatives of history and we like to emphasize the positive," she said.
Mr. Davis, the author, said he worried that some of the new Thanksgiving stories may lead to actual distortions of history, swinging from the traditional glorification of the white settlers to the romanticization of the Indians.
Schools that paint the Plymouth settlers as political refugees, for instance, are not entirely right, he said. Only half the passengers on the Mayflower were Pilgrims who were persecuted for their religious beliefs; the others were economic opportunists called Strangers, he said. Rather than treating the main characters as either good or bad, he added, history suggests a "tremendous amount of cooperation and peacefulness between the Indians and the Europeans."
Do the various modern interpretations of Thanksgiving sink in with children?
Leila Tamari, a 6-year-old at P.S. 87, seemed to get the message this week, as she and other first graders baked pumpkin pies for homeless and elderly people.
"Thanksgiving means to be happy and glad and healthy and careful, and you got to care for another people, not just yourself," Leila said. "I pray for the homeless people and the sickness people."
But in Ms. Seid's fourth-grade class, the impact was a little murkier. When she reached the end of her story, at which the aliens announced they were staying put in the backyard and invited the bewildered homeowner to a celebratory feast, she explained that the homeowners represented the American Indians in this allegory.
"Here you are living in your homes with your pets, your vegetables, your trees and your stream and somebody comes and starts killing your pets, eating your vegetables and cutting down your trees," Ms. Seid said. "I want you to think about that and how you would feel."
Dzavid Pjetrovic raised his hand.
"Well," he asked, "what kind of pets were they?"

HEADLINE: Budget Bill, Following Tradition, Offers Its Share of Tax Oddities

SERIES: The Fine Print -- A close look at G.O.P. tax plans.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
As long as the United States has had tax laws, politicians have twisted them for political reasons. The very first such law, approved by the First Congress, levied a tax on Jamaican rum -- not so much because the Founding Fathers wanted to discourage drinking the demon rum but because they wanted to give an advantage to the Kentucky bourbon industry being developed by the Rev. Elijah Craig.
There was no exception this year in the way the Republicans handled the tax sections of the big budget legislation that Congress approved this week. 
 The way the capital gains provision was written, it would cost the Treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue every year after 1996 except one. The only exception is 2002, not coincidentally the year Congress has promised that the budget would be balanced. In that year, according to calculations by the Congressional tax staff, the cut in the capital gains tax would miraculously increase Government revenues by $1.5 billion.
Another anomaly is that taxpayers would get the first benefit of the $500 tax credit for each child next October, just before the election, and not in April when tax returns are normally filed. No matter that this would cost the Internal Revenue Service an extra $300 million to process the additional forms.
Here is still another oddity: Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, maintains that more than three-fifths of the tax cuts would go to families with incomes below $75,000. The Treasury Department figures that about three-quarters of the benefits would go to families with incomes above $75,000. Both sides have figures to back up their claims.
Take the capital gains question first.
The budget bill would make two main changes in the way individuals must pay taxes on capital gains, which are the profits from the sale of investments. First, for all stocks and bonds and other property sold after Jan. 1, 1995, the maximum tax rate would be reduced to 19.8 percent from 28 percent. The new rate would be the lowest since the Eisenhower Administration.
Then, beginning in 2001, the purchase price of the property, for tax purposes, would be adjusted for inflation. Thereafter, taxpayers would have to pay capital gains taxes only to the extent that their profit exceeded the inflation in the economy over the period the property was held.
Taxpayers who want to take advantage of the inflation indexing after 2001 without selling their stock (or whatever else they own) would be permitted to pay a tax that year on their capital gains that have accumulated since they made their investments. From then on, the cost of their property would be adjusted annually for inflation.
In terms of lost revenue for the Government, according to the staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, the capital gains provisions would lose $2.7 billion in the 1997 fiscal year, $6.8 billion in 1998, $7.5 billion in 1999, $8.2 billion in 2000 and $8 billion in 2001.
Then, in the 2002 fiscal year, it would raise $1.5 billion in additional receipts.
After that, the revenue loss would mushroom: $10.5 billion in 2003, $12.2 billion in 2004 and so on.
The reason for this anomaly (first brought to light by Iris J. Lav, a tax specialist at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research institute) is that investors who wanted to take advantage of indexing would pay the additional taxes on their accumulated gains in April 2002 when they filed their tax returns for calendar year 2001.
This would give the Government a one-time-only increase in revenues of about $10 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. As Ms. Lav observed, "Most of these revenues simply represent taxes the Federal Government would have collected anyway in subsequent years, when the assets actually would be sold."
But without the extra revenue, the estimates would show a budget deficit in 2002, the year the Republicans in Congress have promised a balanced budget.
Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the timing was purely coincidental. Mr. Archer "wanted nothing more than to maintain indexing from the first day," Mr. Fleischer said.
"When it became clear that as a result of the various changes made to all aspects of the budget package, we could not afford it from the beginning," Mr. Fleischer said, "he acquiesced in putting it into effect at the earliest possible date."
On the matter of the family tax credit, the measure would give couples with incomes up to $110,000 and single parents with incomes up to $75,000 a $500 tax cut for each child under 18. But the budget writers decided that this would be too expensive for the Government if it were fully effective this year. So they decided it would go into effect for one-quarter of the year, as of Oct. 1, 1995, and that the credit in the first year would be $125 for each child.
Under the bill, the I.R.S. would be instructed to send taxpayers a notice of the credit next February and to send them the form and instructions in June. Taxpayers would have to file for the credit by August, and a refund based on the credit would be paid in October 1996.
This means that taxpayers would get their refunds just before the 1996 election. It also means that the cost would be shifted to the 1997 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 1996, keeping the budget for the 1996 fiscal year from being way out of whack.
When this odd procedure was approved last week, Mr. Archer and other lawmakers said the reason was that the I.R.S. would not be able to handle the change on the regular tax forms for 1995, which are already printed and due next April 15. But this turns out not to be the case.
In a letter sent on Tuesday to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Margaret Milner Richardson, wrote: "Neither the Senate nor the House formally asked the I.R.S. how best to implement the credit. If the I.R.S. had been consulted, I can assure you that we would have strongly encouraged Congress to use the normal Form 1040 return filing process to implement the credit and thus minimize the burdens on both taxpayers and the I.R.S."
Mrs. Richardson calculated that the procedure Congress devised would cost her agency $308 million in additional mailing and processing expenses.
On the question of who would be the main beneficiary of the new measures, Mr. Archer said last week that 61.1 percent of the dollar value of the tax breaks would go to taxpayers with incomes from $30,000 to $75,000 and that 80.2 percent would go to those with incomes below $100,000.
"Middle-income Americans will emerge as big winners," he declared.
Then this morning, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that most of the tax break would go to the wealthy. He released tables showing that 66.5 percent of the dollar value of the tax breaks would go to taxpayers with incomes above $75,000 and that 47.5 percent would go to those with incomes over $100,000.
Who is right? Where you stand depends on how you count.
The main difference is that Mr. Archer's data are based on the first five years the bill would be in effect. The Treasury figures are based on the benefits when the bill was fully effective, which in some cases would not be until the next century. The provisions involving capital gains and individual retirement accounts would become especially expensive down the road with most of those breaks received by upper-income taxpayers.
Other differences involve the way benefits from capital gains and the earned income credit are figured.
Also, the Treasury calculates that 12.1 percent of taxpayers have incomes over $100,000. Congress puts it at 6.2 percent. The reason is that their definitions of income are quite different.
But that's another story altogether.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE PLAY-BY-PLAY
21 DAYS IN DAYTON: A special report.;
In U.S. Eyes, 'Good' Muslims And 'Bad' Serbs Did a Switch

BYLINE: The following article is by Elaine Sciolino, Roger Cohen and Stephen Engelberg. 

 BODY:
The wine was drunk and a lavish lobster dinner eaten, and it was time to resolve one of the most delicate issues in the Bosnian peace talks: a route for the Bosnian Government from Sarajevo through Bosnian-Serb territory to the beleaguered Muslim enclave of Gorazde.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia made his way to a high-tech auditorium to play Powerscene, the Pentagon's computer mapping program that reproduces terrain on a vast movie screen. The Serbian leader was adamant that the corridor could be no more than two miles wide. 
 Lieut. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the senior American military official at the negotiations, whisked Mr. Milosevic off on an imaginary aerial tour of the region to show why such a narrow corridor made no strategic sense. "As you see, God did not put the mountains two miles apart," General Clark said.
Mr. Milosevic downed a large whisky, considered this topographical fact, and the deal on a five-mile-wide corridor was consummated. It became known as the Scotch Road.
Throughout the 21 days of talks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, from the wary chill of the opening to the sleep-deprived marathon and near collapse at the end, the American negotiators established a remarkable rapport with Mr. Milosevic. The Muslim-led Bosnian Government, which the Americans initially saw as their friend and the victim of the war, ended up not fitting into the fraternal Realpolitik in which negotiators cut through days of stalemate over slugs of whisky.
The Bosnians, convinced after years of Serbian barbarity against Muslim civilians that they were merely defending their homeland, ended up being badgered into agreement. By the end American officials spoke with disappointment and anger of what they saw as the vacillation, internal conflicts and sometimes cynical maneuvering of Bosnian officials.
The only party more isolated than the Bosnian Muslims was the delegation of Bosnian Serbs. Although their cooperation is essential for any peace plan to succeed, they were not shown any of the proposed peace maps until a few hours before the talks ended. Their three representatives in Dayton, kept out of the actual talks because Mr. Milosevic insisted on representing them, mostly say around trying to find out what was going on.
And so, as all the parties left Dayton, the least happy of all were those representing the two largest groups of Bosnians -- the Muslim-led Government, which was deeply uneasy, and the Bosnian Serbs, who felt betrayed.
For four days at the end, arguments raged, nerves were frayed, sleep was scarce. Failure often looked certain. Just hours before an agreement was finally announced, the Clinton Administration drafted a statement explaining a collapse of the talks.
Progressively, the niceties of international intercourse were abandoned. At one point Warren Christopher, the unfailingly polite Secretary of State, started yelling at the President of Bosnia when he accused Mr. Christopher of breaking his word. At another, Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator, grabbed the Prime Minister of Bosnia by the shoulder after he disappeared for a snack at a critical moment.
In the end, it took the combination of Mr. Christopher and Mr. Holbrooke -- two negotiators with vastly different styles -- to make the agreement happen.
Meetings rooms and corridors became popcorn-littered expanses reeking of stale fast food. Versailles it was not.
The result of this careening enterprise was an improvised settlement that is at once a tribute to the force of revived American diplomacy in the Balkans and an unfinished road map for peace riddled with potential for confusion and conflict.
It is founded on uneasy relationships whose evolution will become a crucial issue as President Clinton tries to convince Congress and the people that 20,000 American troops will have to go to Bosnia to enforce the peace.
The scenario looks potentially menacing: A Bosnian Government lacking any real conviction about a peace it resisted until the very last moment, and potentially restive Bosnian Serbs who were kept largely in the dark about the settlement.
"We have to have the strategic consent of all the parties," General Clark said. "We will not go in as an invasion force." That consent, it is clear, has not yet been secured.
 
The Start
Trying to Dispel The Bitterness
 The tone for the talks was set at the outset on Nov. 1. Despite pleas by Mr. Christopher to discard a bitter past and build a future for the children of the Balkans, all the antipathy and mistrust among Mr. Milosevic, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia was evident in the perfunctory handshakes and averted eyes at the opening ceremony.
American officials, led by Mr. Holbrooke, spent much of the first week trying to dispel this tension by creating a convivial atmosphere in the small quadrangle of red-brick buildings where the delegations were housed -- a tactic they used throughout.
At one point, the Americans gave a dinner in the shadow of a massive B-52 bomber at the Air Force Museum at which a military band played Glenn Miller, but not everyone was in the mood. At another, Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Tudjman worked on a formula for one outstanding territorial dispute between Serbs and Croats for Eastern Slavonia, the last remaining area of Croatia in Serbian hands, between sets of tennis.
At still another, Mr. Milosevic, who started the war, sidled up to the piano in the Officers' Club to sing "Tenderly."
But underneath the veneer of politesse, the American negotiating strategy was clear: First, strengthen the Muslim-Croat federation to present a united front to the Serbs on the critical question of land in Bosnia; then settle the one outstanding territorial dispute between Serbs and Croats to increase the pressure on the Bosnian Government to opt for peace.
And finally, with a mixture of economic blandishments and displays of American power, to persuade all the parties that this was last, best chance to end the barbarity.
But problems were immediately apparent.
Mr. Izetbegovic, a devout Muslim with a distant gaze who was twice imprisoned by the Communists of the former Yugoslavia for leading movements of Muslim protest, kept a reserved distance. He preferred to eat alone; he never talked of the future or economic reconstruction; to American officials, he seemed strangely unmoved by the suffering of his people.
Of course, the Bosnian President felt he was being asked to give away half his country to Bosnian Serbs who had repeatedly massacred and abused Muslim civilians in pursuit of their dream of secession.
American officials, however, felt that the 70-year-old President was missing the point. If peace really took hold, if money poured in, if the West was firmly behind the reconstruction of Sarajevo, then the old divisions might fall away. Rather than losing half of Bosnia, the Bosnian Government might ultimately have a hope of gaining something inaccessible through more war: a unified and multi-ethnic state.
"Izetbegovic was occasionally animated in front of maps, but never before suffering or the prospect of rebuilding his country," an American official said. "He's a very stubborn, very elusive man."
Negotiating with the top Bosnian delegates was further complicated by the fact that they seldom saw eye to eye. Mr. Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey became known as "Izzy, Silly and Moe." Their spats were interminable and often vitriolic.
When an American official suggested that Mr. Silajdzic might constitute the "swing vote" in this shifting cast, a furious Mr. Sacirbey screamed at Mr. Holbrooke, "There's only one swing vote here, and that's the President."
For much of the time the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister would not speak to each other. Occasionally Mr. Silajdzic would disappear for a prolonged sulk. Just what, if any, objectives the three men shared was almost impossible for the American team to assess.
Mr. Milosevic, whose vitriolic nationalism unleashed the Balkan wars in 1991, was the exact opposite.
His determination to get three-year-old trade sanctions on Serbia lifted made him flexible; his taste for drink and hearty meals made him accessible; his utter domination of the Serbian delegation made him, as one person put it, "one-stop shopping."
For much of the time, moreover, he was trading land that was not his but held by the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, a personal rival of Mr. Milosevic. This tended to make the Serbian President unusually amenable, even over issues as complex as Sarajevo, a city, he once confided to one American official, "that Izetbegovic has earned through what happened in this war."
 
The Croats
Resolving the Issue Of East Slavonia
 As for Mr. Tudjman, the Croatian President, he had arrived in Dayton already a victor. Having retaken all but Eastern Slavonia from the Serbs through military conquests over the last six months, he had relatively limited concerns.
His advice from the Administration were clear: honor the nominal alliance with the Muslims in Bosnia and resolve Eastern Slavonia through diplomacy as the price for continuing American support. A man whose shrewd instincts are often underestimated, Mr. Tudjman was ready to oblige.
By Nov. 10, nine days after the conference began, an agreement to strengthen the strained Muslim-Croat federation was ready. It was more theater than substance, since the real issues between Muslims and Croats will be solved only on the ground where mutual suspicion is still rampant after the 1993 war. But it did at least open the way for discussion to turn to the more serious issue of Eastern Slavonia.
Mr. Christopher, on the second of his four visits to the conference, spent most of his time on this question. The conflict between Serbs and Croats had come down to this: Should there be a transitional period of one year, as favored by Mr. Tudjman, or two years, as favored by Mr. Milosevic, before the restoration of full Croatian sovereignty over the Serbian-occupied area.
"Let's call it 12 months of transitional rule, plus a second period not to exceed the first period," Mr. Christopher suggested. That way, the only number the volatile Mr. Tudjman would hear and have to relay to his people was the one he wanted to hear: a single year. Meanwhile, Mr. Milosevic could call it two years.
The two men, whose sparring for territory and hate-filled propaganda propelled Yugoslavia toward disintegration, reviewed the matter for about an hour. Then they came into Mr. Holbrook's suite, sat together on the sofa, and Mr. Tudjman said, "Mr. Secretary, we've solved Eastern Slavonia."
The breakthrough was kept secret until two days later, when it was announced in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. It immediately set an upbeat tone as the talks moved into what officials hoped would be the final days.
When Carl Bildt, the European Union representative, asked Mr. Milosevic about the remaining Bosnian problems after the accord, he waved his arm dismissively. "The rest is nothing," Mr. Milosevic said. "I will take care of it. The war is over now."
This remark reflected the Serbian President's intimate conviction that Serbs and Croats set the terms in the Balkans, while the Muslims are a mere side show. It was thus in 1991, when Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman agreed to carve up Bosnia. He believed it was thus still in 1995. But three years of struggling to survive had given the Bosnian Government a stubborn new conviction.
 
Sarajevo
Milosevic Ready To Yield the City
 But the negotiations deteriorated rapidly as soon as the talk turned to the map.
When Mr. Christopher arrived Nov. 17 for the final push, nearly all of the most contentious territorial issues remained in dispute, including the status of Sarajevo.
No issue was of greater symbolic importance to all sides. Many of the Bosnian Serb leaders come from Sarajevo. They have never wavered in their insistence that the city be divided, and that the Serbian quarter become capital of a Serbian republic.
And now, on a Saturday night in Dayton, Mr. Milosevic was preparing to give it away. He appeared unannounced at Mr. Holbrooke's room and said, "I was in your neighborhood and did not want to pass your door without knocking." He sat down, and began an intense discussion of how Sarajevo could become a unified city.
The next morning, on Sunday, the Americans decided to set a final deadline of 10 A.M. Monday. If things could not be worked out by then, there would be a news conference announcing why the talks had failed.
Almost immediately, another snag arose. The Americans' high-tech mapping computers showed the Serbs' concessions on Sarajevo and Gorazde had whittled their holdings from 49 percent to 45 percent. Mr. Milosevic told participants that he could not sell the deal in Serbia, or to the Bosnian Serbs, if Serbs had less than 49 percent.
"The problem was, our technology was too good," an American official said ruefully. "They had agreed on the lines on the map. They said it looked good. Then, they found out the percentages, and it all came apart."
Thus began the desperate scramble to come up with more land for the Serbs. And the Bosnians added more demands.
Mr. Milosevic met late Sunday night in Mr. Holbrooke's suite with Mr. Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, to sketch out a new map. Midnight came and went, and still they argued.
"What do you want, what are you seeking?" Mr. Milosevic repeatedly asked.
The Serbs made an additional small concession around Gorazde. Then, Mr. Silajdzic, who was leaving the room every half hour for instructions, came back with new demands for land around Sarajevo.
Mr. Milosevic had already told his Bosnian counterpart, "You deserve Sarajevo; you stayed there through the siege and shelling." Now, he stiffened and said, "There's a limit to what I can give." Even so, he bowed to Mr. Silajdzic's request.
In the end, Mr. Milosovic gave up his demand to widen a crucial route linking his country to Banja Luka, the largest Serb-held town in Bosnia.
With all this settled, the Bosnians proposed a map that would expand the Bosnian Serbs' holdings with some land carved out of western Bosnia. Nearly all of it came from the Croats.
Finally, at 4 A.M. Monday, there was a deal. The Americans scrounged up some California white wine to celebrate.
Mr. Izetbegovic was awakened to look over the agreement. He arrived a few minutes later, dour and groggy, wearing an overcoat over his nightshirt, his hands in his pockets. Mr. Christopher extended his hand and kept it in midair until Mr. Izetbegovic shook it.
 
The Bosnians
Muslim Leader Remains Reluctant
 But Croatia was still not on board.
The Americans summoned Mate Granic, the mild-mannered Croatian Foreign Minister, to bless the culmination of 19 days and nights of work.
"Thank you very much; this is very interesting," one participant quoted Mr. Granic as saying. "Now, may I please have the map."
When he saw the map, he exploded. Serbian territory had been expanded almost wholly at the Croats' expense. "Impossible, impossible, zero percent chance of acceptance by my Government," he shouted as he swept the map off the table.
As Mr. Granic grew angrier, Mr. Izetbegovic seemed to become happier. The deal about which he was deeply ambivalent was unraveling.
The deal had held for 37 minutes.
Mr. Christopher went to bed at 6 A.M. and resumed work 70 minutes later.
By early afternoon on Monday, Mr. Clinton intervened. He phoned Mr. Tudjman, and asked him to use his influence with the Bosnians to break the deadlock. "The time is now," Mr. Clinton said.
The Croats gave up most of the land needed to give the Serbs their 49 percent.
Mr. Christopher insisted that the Bosnians come up with the additional territory, that the Croats had already done enough. When Mr. Izetbegovic accused Mr. Christopher of lying to him, the Secretary of State exploded, ordering him to come back at 11:30 P.M. with a final map.
"This is as far as I can take these negotiations," Mr. Christopher told the Bosnian President. "If that is not good enough, you have to make that judgment. You have until 11:30 to make a decision."
Mr. Christopher also called Mr. Clinton and said that if the Bosnian President did not agree, "our work is done -- we'll suspend."
Mr. Clinton said, "If that's your judgment, go ahead."
A deal still seemed possible. But the Bosnians resurrected an old demand: The status of the Serb-held town of Brcko would have to be determined by international arbitration. Mr. Sacirbey, Bosnia's Foreign Minister, delivered the message, and said he was deeply saddened that his side could not agree to terms without Brcko.
The flabbergasted Americans refused to reopen the issue.
Instead, a few minutes later, the Americans delivered to three Balkan Presidents a two-page statement that would lock in gains already agreed on and close down the talks the next day.
Mr. Milosevic said that no matter what the Bosnians did, he wanted to initial the agreement for the Serbian delegation and would ask Mr. Tudjman to do the same for Croatia. Mr. Milosevic seemed confident that the Bosnians would eventually go along, . , particularly if the other two delegations signed.
"You Americans think this is more complicated than it is," he said.
When Mr. Christopher went to bed late Monday night, a statement of failure was composed for him to deliver the next morning.
At 8 A.M., Mr. Christopher met with his negotiators. They watched from their window as Mr. Milosevic trudged out in the snow to visit the Croats.
A Croatian official said the Serbian President had proposed that the Serbs and Croats jointly announce that the talks had failed because of Bosnian intransigence.
Mr. Tudjman, this official said, instead told Mr. Milosevic that the fate of Brcko was too small an issue to derail a peace settlement, and he suggested that the question be referred to an international commission that would render its ruling in six months.
A few minutes later, Mr. Milosevic told Mr. Christopher that he would accept the commission on Brcko. The Secretary then took the news to the Bosnians and the Croats. Mr. Izetbegovic was reluctant to the end. "Well, it's not a just peace," he said. "But my people need peace."
A short time later, Mr. Milosevic sought out Mr. Christopher, who told him the deal was struck. The Serbian President raised his left hand in triumph. Tears came to his eyes, and he impulsively hugged Brig. Gen. Donald Kerrick, an Army general on the negotiating team.
 
The Hard Part
Will Bosnian Serbs Accept the Peace?
 Even as the participants exchanged congratulations at the initialing ceremony, the signs of discord were evident. The Bosnian Serbs, enraged that Mr. Milosevic had negotiated without them, boycotted the ceremony.
They were fuming at the agreement's military annex, which, they told Carl Bildt, the representative of the European Union, made the NATO troops an "occupying force."
Just as serious was the way Mr. Milosevic had ceded Sarajevo to the Bosnian Government. The Bosnian Serbs did not realize until the morning of the ceremony that they had lost the Sarajevo suburbs of Grbavica, Ilidza, Vogosca and Ilijas, which they have defended with an iron will since the beginning of the war.
Mr. Milosevic had purposely withheld this information, telling American negotiators, "I'll only show them the map at the end."
Shortly after midnight, hours after Mr. Christopher, the Europeans and the three Balkan Presidents had flown out of Dayton for good, a group of Bosnian Serbs who stayed behind turned up at the base's military headquarters to confront General Clark about Sarajevo.
Huddling over a printed map in the auditorium where the Powerscreen mapping system operates, the Bosnian Serbs politely but firmly explained how Mr. Milosevic had given their roads and neighborhoods away.
"The red line is Milosevic's," General Clark patiently explained. "You can't change it. It's agreed."
"It may be Milosevic's line," one of the Bosnian Serbs said, "But it's our road."
"The line doesn't mean anything anyway," the general continued. "Freedom of movement is guaranteed."
The Serbs were dubious. Finally, General Clark said, "It's best to let it alone for now and allow this to sort itself out."
But the problem of Sarajevo remained far from sorted out. The mountain road overlooking the city's southern edge -- a road from which the Serbs have regularly shelled the city over the last 43 months -- is a road that NATO troops are supposed to patrol in a few weeks.
"Now for the hard part," said James Pardew, a senior Pentagon official who witnessed the exchange. "The glory's over."

Division of Territory
 When the Serbs were finished conceding land, it was discovered that they had given away too much, and that instead of controlling 49 percent of the country, as called for under the peace plan, they would hold only 45 percent. When it was proposed that the imbalance be redressed by handing a chunk of Croat-held land to the Serbs, the Croats hit the roof, but were brought back by a call from President Clinton to President Franjo Tudjman.
 
Brcko
 The Bosnian Government wanted Brcko, a Serb-held town in the middle of the narrow lifeline linking Serb territories in northwestern Bosnia with eastern Bosnia and Serbia proper. In the face of Serbian intransigence, the Bosnians at first acquiesced, then demanded binding arbitration of the issue. The talks teetered on the verge of collapse before the Serbs accepted arbitration.
 
Gorazde
 Milosevic wanted to cede only a narrow corridor connecting the Muslim enclave of Gorazde to the rest of Bosnian Government-controlled territory. But after a large whiskey and a virtual-reality tour of the corridor, Milosevic accepted the wider version insisted on by the Bosnian Government.
 
Sarajevo
 After Milosevic asserted that the Bosnian Government had "earned" control of all of the Bosnian capital by their suffering in the war, he ceded the Serb-held suburbs of the city. The Bosnian Serbs, cut off from the negotiations, were appalled.
 
Eastern Slavonia
 Croatia's main aim in the talks was to regain the region from the Serbs. The Serbs arrived ready to make a deal, but wanted a two-year transition period. The Croats insisted on a one-year transition. Warren Christopher came up with a circumlocution that satisfied both sides.

HEADLINE: Government Shutdown Cost Is Estimated at $700 Million

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
As the Administration considered its strategy for next week's budget negotiations with Congress, the White House disclosed today that last week's Government shutdown cost taxpayers $700 million to $800 million. And it said it could not promise Federal workers that another shutdown would not occur in a few weeks.
Roughly half of the estimated costs, White House officials said, are the salaries of the 800,000 workers furloughed for four work days. As in past Government shutdowns, these workers will be paid for the time they were sent home. The other half consists of lost Federal revenues, some of which may be recouped. 
 At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin disclosed that the Administration was developing plans to keep paying the nation's bills into early next year in the event that Congress refuses to raise the nation's borrowing limit as part of the negotiations over a balanced budget.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. Rubin also hinted at President Clinton's strategy in those negotiations, saying the Administration would seek to bridge the huge gulf between Congressional and White House economic assumptions and to pare down the Republicans' proposed tax cut.
Other Administration officials say they have no indication that the first- and second-year Republicans in Congress, who have clung to the Congressional Budget Office's economic assumptions as an article of faith, are willing to find a middle ground between those numbers and the figures used by the Administration.
The Congressional estimates about how the economy will perform are less optimistic than those of the Office of Management and Budget, which the White House prefers, and would require far deeper cuts to reach a balanced budget in seven years. But Mr. Rubin acknowledged today that any estimates that reach seven years into the future were by their nature a bit fanciful.
Asked today if there was any way to balance the budget in that time period -- one of the goals specified in the agreement reached last weekend -- without abandoning the Congressional Budget Office figures, a senior Administration official thought about the question for a second and then said simply, "No."
That response underscored how little was resolved in the agreement struck last weekend, an accord that brought the 800,000 furloughed workers back until at least Dec. 15 and permitted Congress and many in the executive branch to depart for the Thanksgiving holiday. But over the past several days, it has become clear that neither side has moved on the broad disagreements over a budget.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged the possibility of a continuing impasse in an open letter to Federal workers.
"We can't promise you that your jobs and your lives won't be disrupted again," he wrote. "Too much is at stake for America."
It also does not appear likely that Congress is about to act soon on raising the debt limit, in part because Republicans believe the prospect of default gives them additional leverage in budget negotiations. Mr. Rubin conceded today that last weekend the Administration abandoned its effort to have the debt limit raised as part of its short-term deal. And while he insisted that Congress should "act on a clean debt limit extension" soon, Mr. Rubin made clear by his tone that the Administration was not counting on early action.
"There are numerous measures we can take," said Mr. Rubin, who has been accused by Republicans of creating a crisis over imminent Government default, then sidestepping the problem with a few quick financial maneuvers. "How far and long it can go, I do not know."
It seems clear that using maneuvers similar to the ones he announced last week, Mr. Rubin can get through January. Inside the Treasury and the Justice Department, however, lawyers are struggling to find ways that the fiscal balancing act can be kept going until early April. After April 15, when taxes are due, the Government will be flush with cash, giving Mr. Clinton considerably more room to negotiate without fear that Congress could force a default.
Mr. Rubin's comments today came as more and more Administration officials are discussing the possibility that there will be no budget settlement, and that the parties will leave the issue of the Federal Government's role in major entitlement programs like Medicaid and welfare to next year's Presidential campaign.
A few of Mr. Clinton's political advisers even favor that strategy, arguing that it would allow Mr. Clinton to present himself to the voters as a budget-cutter who is also the savior of some of the nation's most politically popular programs. There is also some suggestion that Congress may not send Mr. Clinton the balanced budget bill that it passed on Monday night because Republican leaders want to deprive him of the opportunity for a ceremonial veto in front of the cameras. It was only after Mr. Clinton's certain veto that the two sides were expected to get down to serious negotiations.
Mr. Rubin argued today that a budget agreement was critical, implying that failure to reach one would harm both the stock market rally and the steady decline in interest rates.
But he added that reaching a balanced budget in seven years, while still preserving all of Mr. Clinton's budget priorities, "will be very difficult." He also said that the $245 billion tax cut that lies at the heart of the Republican budget plan "needs to be substantially reduced."

HEADLINE: Baltimore Opening High-Tech Central Booking Center

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ALTIMORE, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Just beyond the vast renewal efforts that have made Baltimore a model of urban redevelopment in recent years, another new building stands ready as a tribute to the city's modernization.
On Tuesday, the doors will open at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center, a high-tech detention center that will replace the less-sophisticated booking operations now conducted at nine police district buildings around the city. It is designed to save countless hours of manpower and paperwork, and experts on prisons and criminal justice say there is nothing like it in the country. 
 In centralizing the system and using computers for identification, background checks, mug shots and fingerprinting, the new center drastically cuts the time arresting officers spend writing reports, getting them back on the street that much faster. City officials say that, at a time city officials are trying to improve law enforcement through community policing, the new center will also return as many as 160 officers to street patrols who have been performing booking duties.
"It frees up cops, and that's the biggest bang for the bucks," Bishop L. Robinson, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, said today, as officials previewed the center for reporters and Lieut. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who was booked, photographed and fingerprinted as a demonstration.
The idea for a central booking center in Baltimore grew out of rising concerns over a crowded prison system that was further choked by a sluggish and inefficient booking process. Almost 30 percent of the arrests in Maryland are made in Baltimore, but suspects were sometimes detained for days before a court judge reviewed charges against them and set bail.
When the state assumed responsibility for operating the city penal system in 1991, the Legislature set aside $54 million for construction of a booking center and $10 million for equipping it with the latest technology, anticipating at least as much savings in manpower redeployment.
Mr. Robinson and other officials visited prisons around the country to study technologies already in use, and they said they devised a process that combines the best of them, which had not been done anywhere else. The result is a system that replaces ink-pad fingerprinting with electronic scanners, uses video links with courtrooms to eliminate transporting suspects and allows local officials to exchange information with other jurisdictions and law-enforcement agencies instantly by computer.
If the center operates as expected, local officials predict that people detained could be released hours after arrest if they post bail or if a judge determines there is no probable cause to hold them.
"Some of the technology has been used before," said Rod Bottoms, a senior corrections specialist with the National Institute of Corrections Information Center in Longmont, Colo. "But this is very, very high tech, used all together. Very high tech. Most facilities don't have this number of things state-of-the-art."
The new center was constructed beside a penal complex that has been in use for nearly 200 years. Ground was broken for the original building, a foreboding castlelike structure of rocks and cement, during Thomas Jefferson's Administration, in the early 1800's. Five more buildings have been added over the years. All six, as well as part of the state prison down the block, now serve as pretrial detention centers, to accommodate Baltimore's pretrial population of 4,000 people, the seventh-largest in the country.
But now, the point of entry into the system will change. Instead of being hauled into the nearest police station, any person arrested in the city will be driven into the downtown booking center, given a bar-coded wristband that enables cameras and computers to track his movements, interviewed by prison personnel, photographed, fingerprinted, then placed in a one of the center's 120 holding cells while officials discuss bail with a court commissioner, who determines whether charges should be pursued.
If bail is set, the person arrested will appear by video-telephone before a local judge, who reviews the amount of bail. If a suspect either is denied bail or cannot post it, he will be held for trial in the same building or one of the prison cells.
Officials say time will be saved every step of the way.
Sitting at a computer today, typing in made-up charges against Ms. Townsend as part of his training, Sgt. James Sharpe said he had spent up to two and a half hours writing out reports in longhand.
"With this," he said, pointing to his computer station, "I could do the same thing in maybe an hour."
"And," he said with a laugh, "the new system has spell-check."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Despite a year of legislative successes, Speaker Newt Gingrich enters the final stage of budget negotiations with a public image so battered that the Democrats see it as one of his party's prime vulnerabilities. Congressional Republicans, including some of his staunchest loyalists, are increasingly concerned.
Mr. Gingrich dismisses his poll ratings, which dropped significantly during this month's budget maneuvering, as transitory, the short-term price of pushing for long-term change against the fierce opposition of a party that he asserts is bound to distort his program. "When people learn the facts over the next five or six months, we'll be fine," he told the Republican governors this week at their meeting in Nashua, N.H. 
 But Democratic Congressional strategists want the public to see Mr. Gingrich and his party's economic platform as a single, unattractive package: intellectually challenging, perhaps, but chilly and arrogant, and simply too extreme. And some Republicans on Capitol Hill, clearly frustrated at their difficulty in getting their message across to the American people, are increasingly worried that this image of the Speaker is getting in the way.
They bitterly complain that the Democrats have mounted a concerted, systematic campaign to "demonize" Mr. Gingrich and thereby discredit his agenda. But some of them also acknowledge that Mr. Gingrich himself occasionally gives ammunition to his enemies. The furor he prompted on Tuesday when he linked a bizarre Illinois murder case to "the moral decay of the world the left is defending" and his lengthy complaints last week over his treatment aboard Air Force One were two such instances.
"He has truly been demonized," said Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut. "And I don't know how he can take it. Some of us want to put our arms around him and say, 'How do you hold up?' But at the same time, we want to say: 'Don't give them ammunition. Don't give them superficial things that they can magnify.' "
Mr. Shays said he and other Gingrich loyalists had conveyed their concerns to the Speaker in recent days, urging him to rest more and to focus his energies on broad strategy instead of day-to-day tactics. "When Newt Gingrich is upbeat and positive, nobody can touch him," Mr. Shays said. "When he's tired and angry, he's a mere mortal. The Democrats know that he really is the center of our gravity, and, in military terms, you identify the center of gravity and go after it."
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant who is a longtime friend of Mr. Gingrich, said: "Anybody who's not worried about it is not being realistic. Having said that, whenever you're on the cutting edge of the fundamental change we're trying to put in place, it was inevitable that he was going to have this problem, although clearly he's contributed to it with some of his less-than-wise statements about the back of the plane and all that nonsense."
A new round of polls released this week showed that Mr. Gingrich's job approval ratings, already lacking, dropped significantly during this month's budget impasse and partial Government shutdown. A CBS News poll showed that only 27 percent approved of his performance in office -- compared with 59 percent who disapproved, including a plurality of Republicans. In contrast, President Clinton's approval rating held stable at 48 percent; 40 percent disapproved.
Democrats say they now view Mr. Gingrich's public persona as a source of political opportunity. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, "We've been telling our challengers for some time now that their opponents' middle name is Gingrich."
Congressional Democrats also make Mr. Gingrich the issue in the ongoing struggle for the moral high ground on the budget -- and favorable coverage on the nightly news. They were gleeful last week when he suggested that the budget impasse had been prompted in part by his treatment aboard Air Force One to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. Stoked by the Democrats, the episode overwhelmed what could otherwise have been two very good news days for the Republicans as they tried to turn the debate back to their goal of a balanced budget and gained conservative Democratic support for their cause.
A Democratic strategist close to the Clinton Administration said, "You can't separate the message from the messenger," arguing that Mr. Gingrich's persona gets in the way "even when the words make sense and are relatively persuasive."
Still, as Republicans are happy to note, it was the Democrats who were convinced in the fall of 1994 that Republicans had made a huge mistake by signing on to the Contract With America, the campaign manifesto on which the Republican majority came to power.
Moreover, whatever the qualms about the polls, Mr. Gingrich remains immensely popular among House Republicans. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of upstate New York, said party caucuses still had the flavor of pep rallies for the Speaker. "A guy who's carried us this far, thus far, is going to be cheered on and not shunted to the sidelines," Mr. Boehlert said.
Strategists nonetheless acknowledge that as a messenger, Mr. Gingrich has not only strengths but also weaknesses. "He has a sound-bite problem," argued Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, "in that TV will click in on the harshest eight seconds and run it on the national news. If you let him communicate in long form, in these half-hour or 40-minute C-Span shows, he scores off the chart. It takes two minutes for people to warm up to him. It takes five minutes for people to really respect him. And it takes 10 minutes for people to be enthralled with him."
Mr. Luntz acknowledged a warmth factor but said: "He comes across as very intellectual and very visionary. That's what he's best at. I'd never put a baby in his arms, but I would have him talk about the future of the country."
And Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, asserted that it was simply too early to be thinking about polls. "Next fall I'll be worrying about polls," he said. "The only reason to worry about polling in an odd-numbered year is if you think the poll numbers are hurting your ability to achieve your legislative goals -- and it's not."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
His Goal: No Room at the Inns

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla.

 BODY:
Dismissed by the Walt Disney Company in 1972, Harris Rosen lived in a tiny apartment for the next two years as he struggled to make a living selling carpets. Even after he scraped together $20,000 toward a down payment on a hotel that was about to be foreclosed on, he bunked down in two of its rooms for the next seven years.
Now one of the most successful independent hotel owners anywhere, Mr. Rosen can stay pretty much where he wants -- including in any of the 1,334 rooms of the recently opened Omni Rosen here. "But I still can't get to sleep," said Mr. Rosen, who is 56, "until I know all my hotels are filled." 
 To an astonishing degree, he has succeeded. In the Orlando area, where the average annual occupancy rate has not exceeded 78.8 percent in the last decade, Mr. Rosen's hotels have averaged 96 percent over that time and were below 92 percent only once -- at 87.9 percent in 1985. Occupancy at the Omni Rosen, Mr. Rosen's sixth property, already averages 74 percent in its fourth week of operation, and few people here doubt that it, too, will reach the stratosphere.
"The man's ability to fill hotel rooms from the day he opens is amazing," said Brendan Ebbs, the president of Rodeway Inns, a chain with two hotels in Orlando -- including one run by Mr. Rosen. "He's like no other hotel owner I know."
Mr. Rosen's secret is fairly simple: Much to his competitors' dismay, he openly cuts prices during the day, often to a rock-bottom $29.95 at his lower-priced properties, to lure the last weary traveler to the last empty Rosen room.
He likens this fine-tuning to the airlines' practice of yield management -- lowering fares at various times on seats that may otherwise remain unsold. Also used by cruise ships, the technique has not yet caught on in the hotel industry, where many operators fret that cutting prices, at least openly, may tarnish the polished image of their chains.
But if the hotel-management companies that dominate the industry in this city -- and elsewhere -- do not have the foresight to follow his example, Mr. Rosen says, that is their problem. "Most of them would rather wind up with empty rooms than drop the price, in order to preserve the sanctity of their average daily rate," he scoffs.
Privately, other hotel operators here complain that Mr. Rosen's fixation on filling rooms is holding down room rates, which now average $66 a night and have risen an average of less than 1 percent a year since 1989.
Yet Mr. Rosen's success, exemplified by his name emblazoned across the 24-floor Omni, has made hoteliers reluctant to criticize him publicly. In a rare on-the-record jab, Linda W. Chapin, the head of Florida's Orange County Commission, told Lodging magazine this year, "He is a control freak; he has a monumental ego and he wants to run things."
Mr. Rosen brushes off that outburst as inconsequential. "Linda was angry because I opposed an increase in the hotel-room tax to build a baseball stadium," he said. "But that's past, and I don't feel any animosity toward her."
Mr. Rosen professes not to understand the broader controversy. "I'd like higher rates, too, because our average rate has increased only about 1 1/2 percent since 1980," he said. "But isn't the question, 'Why would anybody build a hotel and not try to fill every room every night?' "
He tries very hard. On days when it appears his properties may not fill up, electronic message boards outside three of them -- with rates normally averaging $39 to $59 a night -- begin flashing "$29.95."
Mr. Rosen's hotels consist of two Quality Inns, a Comfort Inn and the Clarion Plaza, as well as the Omni and the Rodeway. All told, they account for about 4,850 of the Orlando area's 84,400 hotel rooms. All but one of his properties, the Comfort Inn in Lake Buena Vista, are on International Drive, the main tourist strip that snakes through the triangle connecting Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World. Posted rates at the Clarion run from $89 to $135, and those at the Omni will soon rise to a range of $165 to $195.
But at a Rosen property, actualrates depend on occupancy levels, time of day, maybe even phase of the moon. As principal owner of Tamar Inns, the company that runs his six hotels, Mr. Rosen decides whether and when to change prices, based on intuition and intimate knowledge of each property. (About a half-dozen friends hold a minority stake of roughly 25 percent.)
He has much leeway to move prices, he says, because his company's debt is "a minuscule 5 to 10 percent of the value of our properties, so we don't need to keep rates high to pay off the interest." The Omni Rosen, built for $75 million (not including the bargain price he paid five years ago for the 20-acre site), is debt free.
"Harris doesn't believe in a slow season," said Bob Franz, an assistant manager at the Clarion Plaza, taking a pause one recent evening from working the phones to fill the six remaining unoccupied rooms in the 810-room hotel. One way he does that is by honoring the rates of Tamar's lower-priced hotels that send him walk-in customers they cannot accommodate.
Each night at 11, Mr. Rosen calls the front desk at each property to see if the hotel is sold out -- and if not, why not. After getting a daily 6 A.M. wake-up call, he is on the phone with the night auditors, recapping the previous day's occupancy rates, average room rates and food and beverage revenue. Then he discusses the coming day's room rates -- that is, the starting rates.
Mr. Rosen makes no bones about his obsession with detail. When his hotels were being built, he says, he negotiated the price of everything from elevators to light fixtures. Today, he could easily be mistaken for a handyman as he prowls his properties, picking up scrap paper and cigarette butts. When he strolls through his hotels' lobbies and down their corridors, he greets many of his 2,500 employees by name.
"He loves to micromanage, and he's so driven it could drive you crazy if you worked for him," said Michael French, vice president of hotel operations at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and the former manager of the Orlando Peabody hotel. "But if I owned a business I'd want him to run it."
Mr. Rosen sees the big picture, too. He built the Omni Rosen and the Clarion on either side of the Orlando/Orange County Convention Center, which attracts 2.1 million people a year to 15,000 events. The two hotels have 44 meeting rooms of their own, with 200,000 square feet of space. Because convention business is usually booked years in advance, the hotels' proximity to the center gives them a buffer against swings in the economic cycle.
Moreover, while some hotels shun tour buses, tour groups account for as much 65 percent of Tamar Inns' business.
"The classic way is to go after bus tours when business is down, but when business is up to ignore them, because they're low profit," said Gerald W. Petitt, the co-chairman of Choice Hotels International, the unit of Manor Care Inc. that franchises the Quality, Clarion, Comfort and Rodeway brands. "But Harris early on identified the importance of the group tour business."
This prescience has transformed him into a millionaire 100 times over, according to an estimate by Lodging magazine. Standing outside the Omni, Mr. Rosen would say only, "Everything I own is in this hotel, and if it succeeds it could easily be worth $300-to-$400 million in five years. If it doesn't . . . "
Despite criticism of his style, few would question his generosity: He established a foundation that provides a preschool program for children in a low-income neighborhood bordering International Drive and that pays for older students to go to vocational school or college. He built a clinic complete with a full-time doctor to treat his employees and their dependents for minor ailments.
But his critics say he gets impatient if he does not get his way. "He does some wonderful things for the community, but he does not believe in consensus," said Cheryl D. Taubensee, the executive director of the Central Florida Hotel and Motel Association.
Mr. Rosen resigned from the association a few years ago, Ms. Taubensee said, after contending that it was too slow to adopt safety and fire regulations."He didn't understand," she said, "that an association can't just dictate to its members."
Mr. Rosen was born and raised on Manhattan's Lower East Side. His father was the safety engineer at the Waldorf-Astoria and an amateur artist who sketched some of the hotel's famous guests in his spare time. Jack's, the restaurant in the Clarion Plaza, is named for the elder Mr. Rosen, and its walls are lined with his drawings of Winston Churchill, Pablo Picasso, Babe Ruth and many other famous faces.
After graduation from the hotel school of Cornell University and three and a half years in the Army, Harris Rosen joined the Waldorf as a clerk, then spent the next decade in a variety of hotel positions with Hilton Hotels and Walt Disney.
"It wasn't that I was doing a bad job for Disney," he said of his dismissal. "They said I didn't conform. They were right. My inclination is to raise my hand and say, 'But.' "
Mr. Rosen turns a competitive drive toward everything he does. His swimming is "only a little better than average," he said, but that has not stopped him from training daily to compete in the Y.M.C.A. Masters nationals swimming meet here next April. And he remained single until six years ago because, he said, "Before that I knew I wouldn't have the time to make a marriage work." With three sons and a daughter ages 9 months to 5 years, he appears to be making up for lost time.
Sometimes, Mr. Rosen tries to take charge beyond his own turf. Mr. French, the former Orlando Peabody general manager, recalls how Mr. Rosen set himself up as guardian of International Drive in the 1970's when unkempt hotels and tacky shops suddenly starting popping up along the highway. "Once he phoned a T-shirt shop and told the owner to paint a light pole outside the place," Mr. French recalled.
Mr. Rosen remembered the incident. "But I didn't phone him," he said. "I drove over to his place. And after getting his permission, our people painted it for him."

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE SERBS;
A Town Feels Betrayed by Milosevic and Talks of Fighting On

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: ILIDZA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Just past a French checkpoint that straddles the front line outside Sarajevo, there is a grumbling that grows louder with every pass of the bottle and every mention of peace.
Ilidza, a Serb-held suburb, is set to return to the Bosnian fold. For the soldiers and civilians who crowd the checkpoints on the road into town, this provision of the peace agreement reached on Tuesday has brought nothing but pessimism and pain. 
 "We feel like losers," said Milenko Djukic, 46, a truck driver, as he passed a half-empty bottle of rakija, local brandy, to a friend. "The Muslims have gotten everything, and we have gotten nothing out of this agreement.
"The status of Sarajevo was the reason for this war, and we have a right to our piece," he added. "The city has to remain divided. The Muslims cannot come back to Ilidza."
The unification of Sarajevo under Bosnian Government control is a point of bitter contention among the Serbs who ring the city and have been indoctrinated with a well-worn belief that they cannot trust their former neighbors. Most of them do not believe that they will be allowed to remain in their homes if the deal is signed. Few of them want to.
And some of them talk about not giving up the fight, despite the peace agreement.
Mr. Djukic said he had lived in Sarajevo until the authorities there gave his apartment to some refugees. He said he had spent five days on the streets and that his escape had cost $350 and left him with only the clothes on his back.
He said that if the Muslims came knocking for entrance into his new sanctuary, he would certainly not stay. "They scare me," he said. "I would just pack my bags and leave."
The decision by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to sign the agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs was met by protest from many in the Serbian-held portion of Bosnia.
Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament, called Mr. Milosevic's decision to sign "an especially big mistake." He said Mr. Milosevic had been warned that "nobody has the right to sign that plan or accept those maps."
Today, people on the street mimicked the remarks Mr. Milosevic made at the peace talks in Dayton, Ohio. They intimated that he was satisfied with the lifting of economic sanctions against Serbia and not concerned with seeking a fair future for his brethren in Bosnia.
"We have been betrayed by Milosevic," said one Bosnian Serb soldier, propping up his black sunglasses. "He was not thinking about our people. He was thinking about his."
Another soldier added: "Everybody is against us. We have lost the war and will have to move away from here."
Muslims in Sarajevo have expressed a willingness to live with Serbs as they once did and said they were even looking forward to seeing their old Serbian neighbors and friends. But fear has gripped the Serbs.
Their political leader, Radovan Karadzic, and their military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, are about to lose their offices and face war crimes indictments in The Hague, a fate that many soldiers worry could be their own.
"Who will decide who was a war criminal and who wasn't?" asked one 26-year-old soldier. "I have lived in Ilidza my whole life and defended my home. For them, that makes me a criminal. They would not allow me to live a normal life."
These Serbs had nothing but complaints about the Ohio agreement, from the corridor that will link Sarajevo and Gorazde to the lifting of the arms embargo. That, they said, assures that Bosnia will become the flash point of World War III.
Only one hope remained: that what came to pass in America would falter on Bosnia's winter ground.
"Only a just agreement can carry peace," Mr. Djukic said, "and this is not justice. We are all sick of the war, but the Muslims have gotten too much. On the basis of this, we will fight to the end."

HEADLINE: Boeing Outlook Hurt by Labor's Rejection of Pact

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The surprise decision by 32,000 machinists to continue their six-week strike against the Boeing Company led analysts yesterday to cut their earnings estimates once again for the fourth quarter. If the strike continues long enough, they said, the company, the world's leading maker of commercial aircraft, will face a loss.
On Tuesday, 61 percent of the votes by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were against the contract, even though union leaders had unanimously recommended it. The sticking point appeared to be a requirement that workers either join a health maintenance organization or pay an insurance premium for health care for the first time. There was also concern that the contract did not contain strong enough language regarding the use of overseas contractors, negotiators said. 
 Analysts said that at the least the continuation of the strike would lower the quarter's earnings for the company, which is based in Seattle. But they said that most airlines are not that eager to take delivery of planes in the immediate future because of their own slow recovery, so the ultimate effect may be merely to delay some sales and earnings. Boeing shares shook off the short-term earnings worries and rose 75 cents, to $74.125, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
"I've already taken a substantial whack out of my fourth-quarter estimate, and now I've got to take it down further," said William B. Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle. He said he had lowered his per-share earnings estimate from 73 cents to 18 cents on the assumption of a strike ending this week after 47 days. "If you assume the strike goes through the whole quarter you probably get to a negative number," he said.
In the fourth quarter last year, Boeing earned $157 million, or 46 cents a share. Sales totaled $5.12 billion. Before the strike, some analysts had predicted quarterly earnings of 80 cents a share.
Union leaders, Boeing executives and Federal mediators appeared to have misread the sentiments of rank and file union members, and it was not clear where negotiations could lead. Boeing officials have said they will not consider using replacement workers because of safety concerns.
"We're extremely disappointed," Paul Binder, a spokesman for Boeing, said. "Both the company and the Federal mediator had been assured by the union negotiators that the proposal we submitted would be acceptable to the employees represented by the union. Obviously it wasn't.
"At this point we have to assess what alternatives are available to us."
Tensions between employees and the company may have been exacerbated by the awarding of millions of dollars of stock options to senior management just as the contract went to a vote. The executives obtained the options as part of a plan that rewards them as Boeing's stock rises, according to their compensation package. To profit, the executives must exercise the options and sell the shares. So far, only Phil Condit, Boeing's president, has exercised a portion of his options, the company said.
"Frank Shrontz and the top Boeing executives got multimillion-dollar bonuses today because the company's stock is doing so well," Bob Gregory, a lead negotiator for the union, said in a statement, referring to the company's chairman and chief executive.
"Yet here is Boeing, insisting they have to cut our health care, and that they can't afford to do anything more in the way of wages or benefits. Our members have fought long and hard, and they're not going to start building airplanes again until Boeing improves that offer."
Even as analysts cut their estimates for the fourth quarter, most remained optimistic for the longer term. "As long as it doesn't get acrimonious, we should expect normal production sometime in the first quarter," Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said.
In addition to deferring revenue for the company, the strike has a direct effect on the communities surrounding Boeing plants. Boeing machinists' wages in the Seattle area alone amount to about $18 million a week, according to Dick Conway, editor of the Puget Sound Economic Forecaster newsletter. Thus, a nine-week strike would reduce income directly by $162 million, he said, with the ripple effect on other businesses bringing the total lost to about $300 million.
"These guys are going to be pulling back on spending, at least for a time, and that's going to have an impact on retail trade and services, particularly on big-ticket items," Mr. Conway said. "Back in 1989, when we had the last Boeing strike, you could actually see a spike in auto sales in the city of Seattle right after the strike was settled."

HEADLINE: Governors Tussling Again, With Port Authority Jobs at Stake

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, two Republicans who agree on most issues, are feuding again over the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- this time over control of jobs, contracts and policy at the multibillion-dollar agency.
Mr. Pataki is holding up the appointment of a new Port Authority chairman because he is seeking a guarantee from Mrs. Whitman that his appointees to the authority's board will oversee hiring and finances, officials said. He is also looking for assurances that the authority will not be biased in New Jersey's favor and will continue to cut its budget. 
 The nominee for chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, was selected by Mrs. Whitman, who as New Jersey's governor traditionally fills that position. But Mr. Pataki has until Tuesday to veto the choice, and is threatening to do so.
Mr. Pataki wants his two appointees, Charles A. Gargano and Peter S. Kalikow, to lead two board committees that would give the governor more power over jobs and contracts. The board chairman names committee heads, so Mr. Pataki is trying to extract a promise that Mr. Gargano and Mr. Kalikow will get those posts before he accedes to Mrs. Whitman's choice, authority officials said.
"They should go to the governor's people," a senior Pataki adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The quarrel has surprised some board members because Mr. Eisenberg is a well-known Republican who has close ties to Mr. Pataki, having served on his transition committee and raised money for his gubernatorial campaign last year. Mr. Pataki and his wife have even eaten at Mr. Eisenberg's home. Mr. Eisenberg, an investment banker, is also an adviser to Mrs. Whitman and is one of her appointees on the authority's 12-member board.
Senior Whitman aides said they were also caught off guard by the quarrel, with some suggesting that it was retribution for the last time the two governors were at odds over the authority. When Mr. Pataki took office, he was criticized by Mrs. Whitman after he named George J. Marlin to be the authority's executive director without consulting her first.
Yesterday, some board members accused Mr. Pataki of seeking control of the two committees, operations and finance, because it would strengthen his hand in filling jobs at the authority with his supporters. Already, the operations committee is considering hiring the son of Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. Mr. Hatfield is an ally of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who is the political patron of Mr. Pataki.
Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for Mr. D'Amato, said Mr. Hatfield's son, Mark O. Hatfield Jr., applied on his own for the job in the press office of the authority. He listed Mr. D'Amato as a reference, and when authority officials called Mr. D'Amato, he gave Mr. Hatfield a strong recommendation.
The operations and finance committees are now headed by board members who were appointed by Mr. Pataki's predecessors.
Mr. Pataki's aides have said in recent days that Mr. Pataki was annoyed that Mr. Eisenberg did not meet with the New York Governor before Mrs. Whitman put his nomination to the board on Nov. 9. The board approved Mr. Eisenberg by a vote of 8 to 2, with Mr. Gargano and Mr. Kalikow voting no in an unusual breach of etiquette. Either governor can veto any move by the board.
Mr. Gargano, who is the Governor's top economic adviser and also vice chairman of the authority, said yesterday that the dispute could have been avoided if Mr. Eisenberg had gone to see Mr. Pataki before the vote.
"I think that the Governor is interested in finding out whether New York will be treated in a fair way," Mr. Gargano said.
Mr. Gargano declined to say whether Mr. Pataki would veto Mr. Eisenberg's nomination. "That is available to the Governor, if he would like to use the veto," Mr. Gargano said.
Mr. Kalikow declined to comment.
Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said Mr. Pataki was not delaying the nomination over the committee posts. She said the governor wanted to make his priorities clear to Mr. Eisenberg, and would focus on the committees later on.
"The issue is regarding the Governor's concerns about downsizing," she said. "And the Governor has in the past expressed some concerns that the Port Authority has not always acted favorably toward New York."
Asked about the veto, Ms. Mucha said, "The Governor is reviewing his options."
Becky Taylor, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman, said Mrs. Whitman had no objection to a meeting between Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Pataki. She and other Whitman officials emphasized that Mr. Eisenberg had made repeated attempts to contact the Pataki administration in recent weeks, adding that he received a response only yesterday.
And she said that Mrs. Whitman had called Mr. Pataki before the board vote to alert him that she was nominating Mr. Eisenberg to replace Kathleen A. Donovan, who is stepping down as chairwoman.
Mr. Eisenberg declined to comment. But other officials in New Jersey said they did not believe that the dispute was over a courtesy call.
"This sort of ranks up there with Newt Gingrich being treated badly on the airplane," a senior Whitman official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I don't know who is doing this or why. It just doesn't hold water."
Robert C. Janiszewski, a board member from New Jersey, said the explanation from the Pataki administration was a smokescreen.
"What is the big deal about their insistence on some chat?" he said. "It has got to be something else. There is something behind this."

OPEC Keeps The Ceiling On Oil Output

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided today that it would maintain its production ceiling through the first half of next year, even though some members were pumping more oil than allowed.
After OPEC ended its meeting, some analysts warned that prices could drop if the organization did not crack down on members who exceeded their quotas. Prices are already $4 to $5 a barrel below OPEC's target of $21. 
 Since 1993, OPEC has had a production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels a day, but some members are exceeding this by about 900,000 barrels a day. It has tolerated that overproduction, hoping that rising demand would be sufficient to lift prices. That has not happened.
"The real issue is the compliance," said Leo Drollas, chief economist for the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, who came to watch the OPEC meeting. "The market's looking for confidence."
But OPEC must also worry about larger amounts of oil coming onto world markets from countries that do not belong to the group, and analysts said this too might undermine prices next year.
In New York, crude oil gave up early gains to end 1 cent lower at $17.96 a barrel for January delivery, indicating that traders had little confidence that OPEC would be able to lift prices.
 The issue of exceeding quotas was a main focus for many gathered in Vienna this week and several ministers said they would seek ways to crack down on the cheaters, although OPEC has never found an effective way to accomplish that.
Two oil ministers, Abdallah Salim el-Badri of Libya and Abdulmohsen al-Mudij of Kuwait, said that OPEC might better police output by monitoring oil as it flowed out of wells, replacing the current system of reporting oil sold on the market or placed in overseas storage.
But changing the way quotas are measured would be a delicate proposition -- as is the topic of quota violators.
OPEC's Secretary General, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, held a news conference on Tuesday and refused to answer a question about a looming supply glut mentioned in an internal OPEC report.
Venezuela's oil minister, Erwin Jose Arrieta, opened the meeting Tuesday by attacking booming production from non-OPEC sources like North Sea operators.
OPEC holds back production to support prices, but these other producers abuse the situation by pumping at capacity, he said. "There is a serious anomaly here," he said. OPEC managed to withhold production, he said, despite the fact that "OPEC's proven oil reserves are three times the size of those of non-OPEC, vastly more accessible and less expensive to exploit."
OPEC members are Algeria, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE SANCTIONS;
U.N. Begins to Lift the Embargoes on Balkans

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Security Council, fulfilling its part of the Bosnia peace agreement, began today to lift economic and military sanctions that had been imposed to end fighting in the Balkans.
One resolution, adopted without opposition but with Russia abstaining, suspends indefinitely the arms embargo that was imposed in September 1991 after Yugoslavia disintegrated. 
 The other resolution, which passed unanimously, lifts the trade sanctions first imposed in May 1992 on Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining two republics in the Yugoslav federation, but will not apply to the Bosnian Serbs until their military forces have pulled back to zones specified in the peace agreement.
Russia, which was a co-sponsor of the resolution to end trade sanctions, abstained on the arms embargo because of "serious doubts and concerns" about an interpretation of arms control that lets the outgunned Bosnian Army acquire more heavy weapons while requiring the Serbs to scale down their larger arsenal.
The Russian delegate, Sergei V. Lavrov, said allowing new arms into the region "does not fit into the logic of the political process." China and the Czech Republic also expressed reservations about arms transfers but voted for the resolution.
The United States delegate, Madeleine K. Albright, defended balancing the arsenals.
"Our plan is to discourage an arms race and to encourage a stable balance of military power," she said. "Our desire is to nourish a conviction on all sides that no side will seek to evade or take military advantage of this agreement."
The arms embargo will remain in effect for 90 days once the peace agreement is formally signed, which is expected to take place in Paris in mid-December. During the following 90 days, it will be lifted on lighter defensive weapons, but not on heavy offensive weapons like tanks, artillery and aircraft.
At the end of the 180 days, the embargo will be terminated and the system for controling and reducing the total number of heavy weapons in the region will go into effect.
Bosnia's Foreign Minister, Muhamed Sacirbey, who addressed the council after the vote, said that if the arms embargo had been lifted earlier, "peace would have come much sooner and at a lower cost." But he pledged that the Bosnian Government would not misuse its opportunity to buy arms.
"Weapons in the hands of the victim will not be used to redress yesterday's wrongs," he said.
The suspension of economic sanctions, Belgrade's major incentive to cooperate in the peace negotiations, will lead to a full termination after free and fair elections have been held in Bosnia. But they could be reimposed if the Serbian side did not respect the peace agreement.
The suspension of the economic penalties extends to the frozen assets of the former Yugoslav Government as long as there are no are claims against them. But the resolution sidesteps the competing demands by the five countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia. Ms. Albright said the United States favored "an orderly and equitable distribution" of property among the successor nations.
"The United States does not intend, itself, to release any assets until all assets are examined against possible claims by the successor states, and against outstanding commercial or private claims," she said. Both resolutions were sponsored by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, which along with Russia form the so-called contact group that has worked to find a solution to the Balkan wars.

HEADLINE: Meshing the Sacred and the Secular;
Floyd Flake Offers Community Development via Church and State

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
On the corner of Merrick Boulevard and Sayres Avenue, the old Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church is like the knotted bottom of an old oak tree, its long arms stretching out in all directions across St. Albans, Queens.
Down the street is the Allen Christian School, where Allen's pastor, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, preaches on Sunday mornings to his swelling, 8,400-member congregation. To the west, there's the 300-unit apartment complex for the elderly built by the parish 15 years ago with Federal housing loans. Next door are about four dozen two-family homes that the church's real estate arm is helping to build with city and state housing dollars. Dotting the neighborhood are 75 more houses that the church acquired or developed and sold to private home buyers. 
 Just below the school, the church also owns a strip of shops and offices: a pizzeria, a beauty shop and a home health care agency.
And up the road, on Merrick Boulevard, lie the flattened grounds of Allen A.M.E's most ambitious project yet: a $16.5 million, 2,500-seat cathedral that the parish is building, along with a three-story parking lot, a fast-food franchise and a health clinic.
Mr. Flake, 50, the pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church for nearly 20 years, refers to his parish as the model of "African-American development for the future," pointing to the $25 million it has pumped into the neighborhood.
As he also happens to represent part of Queens in the United States Congress, however, the neighborhood has greatly benefited from his savvy at funneling dollars from Capitol Hill into a variety of housing and commercial development projects, mostly around his church.
This year alone, his aides said, the Sixth Congressional District, which Mr. Flake, a Democrat, represents, has been blessed with $230 million in Federal money, the bulk of it for a United States Food and Drug Administration testing facility at York College, a stone's throw from the Allen A.M.E. Church.
He has helped secure Fannie Mae loans for several hundred houses being built nearby by the Southeast Queens Clergy for Community Empowerment, a nonprofit group that helped launch Mr. Flake's political career more than 10 years ago. And the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is now interested in financing a proposed retail strip along Guy Brewer Boulevard, sandwiched between York College and the two-family homes that Allen A.M.E. is now helping to build and sell.
Critical of black leaders who he says are wedded to government-financed social programs, Mr. Flake's mantra for uplifting urban African-Americans is filled with the language of trickle-down economics.
"I'm interested in investment,' he said, "as a way to generate in those particular communities jobs, commercial strips, entrepreneurs, small businesses that can hire people who will not become welfare recipients, who will not become people who occupy these jail cells."
The Congressman's success at funneling Federal money to his district, his admirers and critics agree, rests largely on his willingness to befriend powerful Republicans abhorred by most New York City Democrats. Prominent among his allies on the other side is Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
With a rhetorical backhand slap, Mr. Flake, who has been in Congress nine years, says his liberal critics have failed their constituents by not reaching out to the Republicans. "Most African-American politicians in my community produce nothing,' said the Congressman, whose 25-year-old Chief of Staff comes from a conservative lobbying firm. 'And the reason they produce nothing is that they don't understand the two-party system."
Senator D'Amato earlier this year encouraged Mr. Flake to run for the New York City Mayor's office in 1997, but in an interview last week in Washington, Mr. Flake said he had decided against joining the next mayoral race.
In Mr. Flake's neighborhood of single-family homes and wide boulevards, some people praise him for bringing in Federal and private dollars for projects that have spruced up what was once a bleak stretch of St. Albans. But others say the rest of his Congressional District has not yet enjoyed the same level of public or private investment.
"It is important that the benefits reach other areas in his district, other than downtown Jamaica and the area in close proximity to the church," said Stephen Jackson, a Jamaica resident who ran unsuccessfully for the 33d State Assembly seat two years ago.
Still others applaud Mr. Flake's financial acumen but say that his emphasis on building houses and strip malls has not addressed the needs of the most disadvantaged residents of southeastern Queens -- those who can neither afford to buy a home nor run a business.
"The poorest in the community need a champion," said Solomon Goodrich, who heads the Southern Queens Park Association. "I have yet to see a commensurate amount of energy given to mass employment projects and an emphasis on the poorest of us."
Mr. Flake counters that his church builds two-family homes that can serve renters and home buyers. He maintains that his church has not received any new funds from Washington since he took office in January 1986, although long-term commitments continue. He also points to $48 million in Federal money that he helped secure this year for renovations and commercial development at the public housing projects in distant Far Rockaway, also part of his Congressional district.
In the church world, Allen A.M.E.'s real estate ventures are nothing new. The Catholic Church holds an impressive real estate portfolio. And over the last decade, many black churches have taken up the task of building housing and running neighborhood businesses at a time when the Federal Government has largely abandoned urban economic development.
Mr. Flake's parish, however, has built more and spent more than most other churches in the city, leveraging government dollars with bank loans and contributions from its middle-class congregation. Last year, the church raised more than $5 million from its members, and its nine profit-making and nonprofit subsidiaries reported $27 million in assets. In turn, Mr. Flake has built a cadre of political foot soldiers and fund-raisers among his 8,400-member church and its tenants.
"He just spread his wings in all these areas and became a political and economic force with that church base," said Nat Singleton, a veteran political activist who helped Mr. Flake get elected to Congress in 1986. 'You can't get a better base for politics."
Aptly enough, his desk in his Capitol Hill office prominently displays a three-volume set of books called "God and Government," a fitting symbol of the two hats Mr. Flake simultaneously wears. His political and pastoral activities can sometimes be intricately entwined: his onetime chief of staff, Edwin Reed, for instance, served on the board of directors of the Allen A.M.E. Housing Development Corporation while he was the Congressman's right-hand man on Capitol Hill.
But Mr. Flake can't be bothered by the questions that are raised by this meshing of church and state. "I've never been one to have a serious problem with the role of church and state," he said, shaking his head. "I don't think African-American communities can allow themselves to get caught in that trap while their communities are dying."
Allen A.M.E.'s complicated mix of sacred and secular ventures has not escaped scrutiny, however. In August 1990, after a former church secretary's testimony to a grand jury in Brooklyn accused Mr. Flake of financial improprieties, Federal prosecutors charged the Congressman and his wife, Margarett Elaine, with not reporting $177,578 in income from the church and dodging Federal income taxes. In April 1991, three weeks into the trial, prosecutors, their approach derailed by an early ruling by the judge, dropped the charges against the Flakes.
But later that year, the Justice Department brought a civil suit against Mr. Flake accusing him of improperly using Federal housing funds to build a portion of the church school. In a settlement last year, Mr. Flake and his church agreed to repay the $500,000 loan with interest but admitted to no wrongdoing.
In addition to his Congressional salary, Mr. Flake earns a $17,000 salary at Allen A.M.E. Until less than two years ago, while he was serving in Congress, the church paid for his family's house in Rosedale. He and his wife bought the house in 1993. The church, he said, had initially refused to sell it to them.
Allen A.M.E.'s latest expansion along Merrick Boulevard is not without critics in the surrounding community. Last month, the local community board approved the church's bid to rezone a three-block stretch of Merrick Boulevard, where it proposes to build a parking lot and open a Burger King franchise and a health clinic.
But some homeowners complained that there would be too much traffic from the new cathedral, while others worried that a fast-food establishment would bring rats into their homes. And some frowned on the rezoning proposal and bristled at the way in which church officials had failed to inform neighborhood residents of exactly what they want to build and where.
James Richardson, whose home lies just behind the proposed Burger King site, said he worried about what else could be built along that stretch of Merrick Boulevard if it is rezoned for commercial use. "At this time," Mr. Richardson said, "the people have no way of knowing what will be put there."
The City Planning Commission will review the church's zoning application and hold a public hearing.
In Washington, Mr. Flake dismissed the neighborhood naysayers, saying that nearly every Allen A.M.E. project had encountered some resistance from homeowners who did not understand the church's economic development agenda.
"In the end," he said, "we get done what we want."

HEADLINE: GAINS IN EXPORTS CUT TRADE DEFICIT

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
American exports unexpectedly continued to climb to new heights in September as the nation's trade deficit inched down to $8.35 billion, the lowest level of the year, Commerce Department figures showed today.
At the same time, the American deficit with Japan narrowed for the sixth consecutive month to a level nearly one-third less than in the spring. And even the deficit with China, which has been swelling rapidly to rival Japan's, contracted. 
 The gap narrowed with most trading partners in the Far East, and approached balance with Western Europe.
The Clinton Administration was quick to boast of the latest results, which, among other things, indicated that the economy's growth rate during the third quarter was likely to be revised upward significantly.
Exports jumped 1.6 percent, to $67.2 billion, after an even larger August surge that many specialists thought could not be maintained. Imports rose by about the same amount, to $75.6 billion. The decline in the trade deficit was small -- to $8,349,000,000 in September from August's $8,359,000,000, which had originally been reported at $8.8 billion.
"The trade deficit appears to have peaked," said Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary. "President Clinton has pursued a trade policy that aggressively promotes exports and presses for open markets abroad."
But today's report did not hold only good news for the Administration. The nation's trade deficit has been widening significantly with Mexico and Canada. Administration officials have already been bracing for Republican attacks over President Clinton's promotion of closer trade ties with Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement, and on the American bailout for Mexico after the peso crashed last December.
And today's figures also showed that the United States experienced a small deficit in trade of advanced technology products, the first time this traditional source of large surpluses had been negative.
The trade deficit, the amount by which a country's purchases of foreign goods and services exceed what it sells abroad, is widely watched as a gauge of the appeal of American wares in the global market. If they are seen as not being good value, foreign orders may go elsewhere and jobs could be lost here. One rule of thumb is that $1 billion of exports keeps nearly 20,000 Americans at work.
Trade figures also reflect fundamental trends in how a nation uses its resources. Since the United States does not generate enough savings, it relies on borrowings from abroad to cover its Federal budget deficit. The foreigners get the cash to finance the United States deficit by selling more here than they buy.
Although reports of the nation's trade position, which are published only after a considerable lag, normally do not generate talk of a shift in monetary policy, September's export surge was strong enough to at least cloud expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates at its next scheduled policy meeting the week before Christmas.
"Nevertheless, we don't believe that the trade report will keep the Fed from further easing," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. "All recent evidence suggests that domestic demand remains sluggish."
Other analysts also expressed the view that exports would need to remain strong if the economy, which has been expanding for more than four and a half years, is to prosper in 1996.
"The challenge is to maintain export growth into Japan when the Japanese economy is so weak and with the dollar having recovered from its lows," said David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities International in New York. He attributed much of the recent decline in the trade deficit with Japan to the dollar's particular weakness against the yen during the first half of the year.
Today's figures on individual countries, which are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation, showed the deficit with Japan narrowed by $800 million, to $4.3 billion, in September, the smallest since May 1993. About half that change reflected higher exports to Japan, including new cars, and the rest lower imports.
September was the first month this year in which the year-to-date deficit was lower than in 1994, according to Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser.
The deficit with China contracted to $3.6 billion from $3.9 billion.
On the other hand, the deficit with Canada widened to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion, as did the deficit with Mexico, which grew to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, attributed much of this to weakness in recent months in the currencies of those two countries. "That has made a huge difference," Mr. Kantor said in a telephone interview with a group of reporters.
Private analysts said the results would provide more ammunition to those seeking to prevent an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement, an effort that has already stalled.
The deficit with Western Europe nearly evaporated in September, totaling just $125 million compared with $769 million in August.
Mainly reflecting higher imports, the United States posted a $30 million deficit in advanced technology products in September after a surplus of $672 million in August. For the first nine months, the surplus is now $10 billion, compared with an $18.7 billion surplus in the comparable 1994 period.
"Finally our archaic controls on high-technology exports have caught up with us," contended Willard A. Workman, a vice president and trade specialist for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
A separate Commerce Department report found today that inventories of unsold goods climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in September, the 18th straight increase, while sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent but less robustly than in August.
And in a more current survey, covering the latest two weeks, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment insurance totaled 371,000 for the week ended last Saturday. This was little different from the 370,000 reported for the preceding week but analysts said they had become a bit nervous over the fact that the monthly average had now risen to 372,250, nearly 7 percent above its level in mid-October.
"Claims have approached new heights" indicating "only tepid growth" of the job market, economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette told clients.
The claims figures covering last week were published a day early because of the Thanksgiving Day holiday; those for the week ended Nov. 11 were delayed from last Thursday because of the partial shutdown of the Government.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
In a Land Lush With Cash, the Robbers Cash In

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Morimatsu Saito barely knew what hit him. The 63-year-old securities company employee was walking through Tokyo's financial district carrying a bag containing $400,000 to his company. Just as he reached his building, a man wearing a helmet approached him, sprayed a debilitating gas in his face, and ran off with the money.
The robbery, which took place in September on a busy street in broad daylight, was one of several recent episodes that have shocked normally safe Japan. But why would someone walk unguarded through the streets with $400,000 anyway? 
 The answer is that Japan runs on cash. Personal checks have never caught on here. Credit cards have recently been spreading rapidly, but even their use is not that well ingrained.
Instead, people often pay bills amounting to thousands of dollars in cash. Postal service employees visit customers' homes on red bicycles to collect cash for life insurance premiums or savings account deposits. And on the 10th and 20th of each month, traffic is said to be particularly heavy as businessmen visit suppliers and clients to pay bills or receive payment in cash.
In Mr. Saito's case, he was bringing the money from a nearby bank because his company, Kyoritsu Securities, needed it to pay customers, who like to receive their proceeds from stock sales in cash, even in amounts up to tens of thousands of dollars.
A result is that Japanese often carry what, by American standards, are large amounts of cash, even given the high prices here. This habit has made Japanese tourists tempting targets for pickpockets around the world. But in Japan, where robberies are rare, it has hardly been a problem.
Shigeru Nomura, an 80-year-old man who emerged from a securities company near where Mr. Saito was robbed, said he sometimes carried tens of thousands of dollars in a paper bag. "I get a little nervous," he allowed -- but not nervous enough to have someone accompany him.
Recently, however, the number of robberies, while still very low by international standards, has been rising. The police have been issuing warnings to those who transport large amounts of cash not to travel alone and to change routes frequently.
But so far people "don't feel the danger keenly," said Kiichi Shiraishi of the National Police Agency's community safety planning division. "It is said that Japanese people believe you can get safety and water free of charge," he said.
So the robberies keep occurring. In late October, Satoshi Murao, 33, an employee of Fuji Bank, visited three customers to pick up cash for deposit. When he emerged from the last customer, a hospital, he was stripped of $130,000 in a robbery.
When asked why people do not use checks, Japanese are likely to be puzzled by the question. "In a way, I wonder how Americans can trust personal checks," said Seiichiro Saito, a professor of economics at Rikkyo University. Accepting a check requires verifying or trusting the check writer's identity and financial resources.
In Japan, people can pay bills by having money automatically deducted from their bank accounts. Or they can deposit money in another party's account using sophisticated automated teller machines that give exact change.
Personal checks will also not do for bribery or tax evasion, two popular practices here. In a famous scandal a few years ago, a trucking company executive sent a bribe of about $4 million to a powerful politician. The politician's secretary had to wheel the bills in from the parking lot on a dolly.
In 1989, passers-by found moldy packets of cash worth $1.7 million in a bamboo thicket in Kawasaki, a Tokyo suburb. A businessman later admitted he had dumped the money rather than prompt a tax audit by putting it in the bank.
How hard it will be to break the cash habit might best be seen in the case of Toshio Miyaji, the president of Jonan Denki, a chain of discount electronics stores. "I feel very lonely if I have less than one million yen in my pocket," he said, referring to an amount equal to $10,000.
Mr. Miyaji's office contains an automatic cash-counting machine, the type normally found in banks, which bundles 10,000-yen notes into packages worth one million yen and spits them out onto the floor. Every day, Mr. Miyaji's aides insert one of those bundles into his wallet.
But Mr. Miyaji is most famous for his Louis Vuitton attache case, which can hold up to one million dollars in fresh 10,000-yen bills. He is often seen on television being driven around in a red or sky-blue Rolls-Royce, dispensing bills from his attache case to buy products for his stores. Paying cash, he said, allows him to get bigger discounts.
One would think this behavior would make Mr. Miyaji a conspicuous target. Sure enough, he has been robbed seven times, losing an amount equal to $390,000 at today's exchange rates.
In one case, his own driver made off with an amount equal to $65,000 at those rates. "After spending all the money he committed suicide 10 days later," Mr. Miyaji recalled. He added that he blamed himself for tempting the poor driver by leaving his attache case in the car.
Despite the robberies, the feisty 67-year-old Mr. Miyaji still carries cash around without security. "If I start worrying, it's just like closing down the store," he said.
He has, however, made a few changes. After he was robbed in his own office last year, he installed some burglar alarms there. And, oh yes, he now takes his attache case with him when he leaves the car.

HEADLINE: Dow Continues to Surge, But Broad Market Is Flat

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average continued its remarkable surge yesterday, while the broad stock market remained relatively flat.
"The day's story was that the economically sensitive stocks rose," said Barbara G. Marcin, vice president of Citibank Global Asset Management. "And the Dow is made up of 30 economically sensitive stocks." 
 By increasing 18.06 points, to 5,041.61, the Dow not only set another record -- its 61st this year -- but also marked its ninth gain in the last 11 trading days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.84 points, to 598.40, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.75 points, to 1,021.24.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange narrowly topped declining issues, 1,202 to 1,104. Volume on the Big Board maintained its heavy pace, with 405 million shares changing hands, compared with 408.3 million shares on Tuesday.
Analysts cited a Commerce Department report that showed a narrower-than-expected United States trade deficit as an important factor in the Dow's rise. The deficit in goods and services shrank to a nine-month low in September, as exports registered a new high.
Cyclical stocks that benefit the most when the economy accelerates were yesterday's market standouts. With the Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks jumping 6.24 points, to 342.97, key advancers among manufacturing issues included Alcoa, up 2 5/8, to 57 3/4; United Technologies, up 1 1/4, to 92; Du Pont, up 2 1/8, to 67 1/4, and Goodyear, up 1 3/4, to 42 3/8.
"People were looking for stocks in sectors that have underperformed this year," Ms. Marcin of Citibank said. "So their attention was focused on the cyclicals."
Paper companies with large export sales showed strength that was attributed to the foreign trade report. International Paper closed at 36 3/4, up 1 1/4; Georgia-Pacific finished at 75 3/8, up 2 3/8, and Champion International closed at 46 3/4, up 1 3/4.
Many technology stocks lagged once again, as traders rotated out of a number of this year's high-fliers. Microsoft fell 5/8, to 87 3/8; Intel declined 1 1/8, to 61 7/8; Micron Technology dropped 2 7/8, to 47 3/4, and Motorola lost 1 1/4, to 59 7/8.
Oil issues were also lower, following the announcement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that it would retain its current production ceiling for another six months, despite slower demand. Mobil declined 2 3/8, to 105 1/2; ARCO slumped 1 1/8, to 109 7/8, and Chevron fell 1 3/8, to 49 1/2.
Newbridge Networks advanced 1 3/4, to 41 3/4, after reporting stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profits on Tuesday. IMC Global rose 3 3/8, to 76 3/8, after being upgraded by Dean Witter. And Boston Beer, which jumped 8 when it went public Tuesday, gained another 1 3/8 yesterday to close at 29 3/8.

HEADLINE: Ernest Jarvis, 92, a Contractor Who Lighted Theaters and Road

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Ernest Jarvis, who began his career as a 14-year-old union electrician and ended it 64 years later as head of his own contracting company, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Morristown, N.J. He was 92 and had outlived many of his most famous projects, from the illuminated West Side Highway in Manhattan to a string of Loews movie palaces across the country.
Mr. Jarvis, who bore such a striking resemblance to his second cousin, Jacob Javits, that the Senator's bodyguards were forever being fooled, could be a case study of the social and economic saga of 20th-century America. 
 His father, Louis, an immigrant from Russia who changed the family name from the original Hebrew, settled in Newark, where he went to work for a hat factory and helped organize the work force at a time when union organizing was not an especially genteel activity: He almost went to jail after the factory happened to burn down.
Mr. Jarvis himself obtained his first electrician's union card in Newark in 1917, and maintained it long after he became a senior executive at the old Hoffman & Elias electrical company, which operated in some pretty tough times. As his son Michael, also an electrical contractor, recalled yesterday, when the union electricians showed up for a job, "the bulges under their coats weren't sandwiches."
Despite the security of union work, Mr. Jarvis was so determined to improve himself that, although he lacked academic credentials for admission, he virtually camped out at the dean's office at Columbia University until he was accepted into its engineering school in 1925.
He did well in his courses, but a lack of funds forced him to withdraw without a degree two years later. This was a galling failure for a man who prided himself on finishing everything he started, so much so that decades later, whenever asked to receive a civic award, he invariably declined, to avoid calling attention to his lack of college degree.
Moving from union to management ranks when he joined Hoffman & Elias, Mr. Jarvis was so impressive that while still in his 20's, he was operating as chief estimator, calculating projected costs before bids are submitted for a job. He advanced the process considerably in the 1930's when he developed a unit estimating system that is the basis of procedures in use today.
In addition to working on many theaters, including the old Roxy at Seventh Avenue and 50th Street and other movie palaces in New York as well as a number of Loews theaters across the country, Mr. Jarvis was in charge of the electrical work on the Julius Miller Highway, along the West Side of Manhattan, which is recalled as both the Depression's largest construction project and the nation's first elevated urban highway.
Other big projects included the Jersey City Medical Center, where Mr. Jarvis's daughter, Joyce, was the first baby born, in the Martha Hague maternity unit after it was completed in 1932.
After leaving Hoffman & Elias in the late 1930's, he worked for other contractors, and supervised several projects, including the installation of the Edison Memorial Light in Edison, N.J. He formed a company, Ernest Jarvis & Company, in Newark in 1940.
Striking out on his own was a daring move given the economic times, but Mr. Jarvis had some key financial backing -- a revolving $600 loan from his mother-in-law.
"That money went back and forth a dozen times," his son said, recalling that every time his father would repay the loan he would need to borrow it again.
The company, which specialized in industrial work, was eventually so successful that half a dozen branch offices were opened before Mr. Jarvis retired in 1972.
Since then, changing entertainment patterns and urban development have doomed the Roxy and many of the other theaters he worked on. Much of the once-wondrous West Side Highway has been torn down for safety measures. That, of course, was hardly Mr. Jarvis's fault. It was not, after all, flaws in the highway's lighting system that caused the demolition.
Indeed, as for the quality of his work, city officials said yesterday that the memorial light Mr. Jarvis helped install in Menlo Park, at the base of a tower erected on the spot where Thomas Alva Edison invented the light bulb, has been burning continuously since 1938.
Mr. Jarvis's wife, Dorothy, died in 1960. In addition to his son, of Livingston, N.J., he is survived by his daughter, Joyce Hoch, of Morristown; a sister, Sylvia Margolis of Dallas, six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Down a Bit In an Abbreviated Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower in an abbreviated session yesterday.
The consolidation came despite the release of a number of economic reports -- including data on the nation's trade deficit and business inventories -- that had been delayed by the Government's partial shutdown last week. 
 "The reports," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, "with the exception of the export data, were all mildly bullish for the market, but not enough to draw in fresh buyers ahead of the long Thanksgiving holiday."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 5/32 of a percentage point, to 108 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 6.27 percent, from 6.26 percent on Tuesday. The market will be closed today in observance of Thanksgiving Day.
The cash market for Treasury securities closed at 2 P.M. yesterday; the Public Securities Association, an industry trade group, has recommended that the market close early tomorrow.
Yesterday, most market participants chose to square positions as the market began to look ahead to next week with more supply looming and fresh economic data. The Treasury announced yesterday the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions. Both sales will be $500 million more than previous auctions. On Tuesday, the Government will sell $18.25 billion of new two-year notes and on Wednesday, $12 billion of five-year notes.
In when-issued trading late in the day, dealers were offering the two-year notes at a price to yield 5.51 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 5.71 percent.
Mr. Hale of MMS International attributed the market's weakness in part to concerns over supply and to the trade and export data, which suggested there were still some pockets of strength in the economy.
The Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit shrank one-tenth of 1 percent in September, to $8.3 billion of goods and services. September's gap was smaller than the $9.7 billion that economists had expected, and could prompt some economists to raise their estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product.
The Government also said that business inventories grew at a rate of three-tenths of 1 percent in September, slower than their pace of four-tenths of 1 percent in August. The report was in line with analysts' expectations. Sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent in September after gaining 1.8 percent in August.
Other data gave a modest lift to bond prices. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a drop, to 88.2 from 90.2, in October, traders and analysts said. The numbers were noticeably weaker than than the initial numbers of the index reported earlier this month, analysts said. The consumer sentiment survey is released only to subscribers.
In futures trading, which was also an abbreviated session, the December Treasury bond contract closed at 117 13/32, near its high for the day of 117 17/32. Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research of Boston, said the critical support level for tomorrow appeared to be 117 8/32. "If it stays over that, the price could go as high as about 117 22/32," she said.

HEADLINE: Washington's Statistical Wars

 BODY:
The chairman of the House's tax-writing committee, Bill Archer, has defended the fairness of the budget bill Congress passed this week by pointing to his staff's estimates that only about 9 percent of the Republicans' tax cuts would go to families earning over $200,000, the richest 1 percent.
The Democrats did not believe the figures, and yesterday the Treasury showed why. It estimated that the richest 1 percent would rake in almost twice as much, or 17 percent, of the tax cut. Indeed under the Republican bill the poorest 20 percent of families, taken as a group, would pay higher taxes as a percentage of their income. But the bill would reduce taxes by steadily increasing amounts as family incomes rise. The biggest tax cut would go to the richest families. 
 Confused? So was Congress when it voted. It relied on misleading estimates by its tax analysts. The Treasury analysis can be challenged, but in the main it followed guidelines that independent economists would agree with. The Treasury figures are solid evidence that the Republican tax cut is heavily weighted toward the rich.
The Republican distribution tables are distorted in at least four ways. First, they underestimate the benefit to wealthy investors of the cut in the tax on capital gains. The Republicans and the Treasury start off by calculating how much less tax investors would pay under the new, lower rates on the amount of sales they would normally undertake. But the Republican analysis reduces this estimate by the amount of extra taxes investors will voluntarily pay because they decide to sell off more stocks and bonds than usual.
This bizarre reduction makes the total tax savings to investors look small because it treats voluntary tax payments -- triggered by a gift from Congress -- as a burden.
Second, the estimates ignore the distribution of corporate tax cuts, which help the wealthy more than the poor. Third, Mr. Archer's numbers look only at the first five years of the tax cut. Treasury's estimates calculate the benefit when the taxes are fully phased in. For example, the tax bill gives high-income families the option of depositing money into a new type of tax-advantaged retirement account. Over the next few years, wealthy families might pay more because of this change. But several years later, they will reap big savings. The Treasury captures these benefits, the Republicans ignore them.
Fourth, Mr. Archer's figures fail to consider the fact that many low-income families will lose rebates they now receive under the earned-income tax credit -- a subsidy for low-wage workers. Indeed, according to the Treasury's estimates, almost eight million low-income families will pay higher taxes under the G.O.P. plan even after taking account of the $500 child credit and a higher standard deduction.
The Treasury figures can also be challenged. They, like Mr. Archer, ignore cuts in estate taxes, the benefit of which would go primarily to wealthy families. Impartial analysts can differ whether the Treasury apportioned corporate tax cuts correctly. But over all, the Treasury methodology is much less partisan -- and similar to what Congressional staffs used to provide.
Besides taxes, the Republican budget bill also tilts spending cuts against the poor. Federal spending under current laws would total in the year 2002 about $2.2 trillion, of which about $333 billion, or 15 percent, would go to the needy -- mostly for food stamps, welfare, Medicaid and tax credits for low-paid workers. The Republican budget in 2002 would cut these need-based programs by almost twice their share, a whopping 24 percent.
Congress and voters will engage for at least the next several weeks in an intense debate about the merits and demerits of the Republican budget. Before people make up their minds, they need to know unvarnished facts. The Treasury may not have provided the last word, but its word is truer than Mr. Archer's.

Biting Bosnia's Bullet

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For years, those of us who believed the world had an obligation to stop Serbian aggression in Bosnia favored "lift and strike": First, lift the U.N. arms embargo that blocked the Bosnians from matching the far superior Serbian firepower; then, strike hard from the air to stop the aggressors while a balance of power was being achieved.
The idea was to get ineffective U.N. troops out and make possible a peace between military equals. This road was not taken. 
 Instead, after the hand-wringing by President Clinton and our NATO partners led to intolerable bloodletting, the decision was taken to "strike and peacemake." Air power was at last used to scare the Serbs to the peace table, and the promise of NATO troops, including 20,000 Americans, was made to persuade the Muslims to give up half their country and accept on-site protection.
So here we are. The Clinton Administration -- acceding to our allies' nail-nibbling demand for American leadership in Europe -- has brokered a peace requiring another American expeditionary force. .
By so doing, Clinton has painted all of us, hawks and doves, into a corner. He made an ill-considered promise in May 1993 -- with no public debate or thorough internal review or consultation with Congress -- to send U.S. ground troops to carry out what was called the Vance-Owen plan, concocted in a previous era.
Now he tells us that unless his "commitment" of troops is honored and supported here, the Balkan carnage will begin again, NATO will become a dead letter and the word of the American President will be revealed as worthless.
Unfortunately, that's true. Like it or not, our choice is to go along with him or repudiate and humiliate him. That's Hobson's choice, which is no choice at all.
We'll go along. Why? Because he may be mistaken in his method, but his belated Bosnia activism is not foolhardy, U.N.-subordinated, mean-spirited or immoral. With luck, it could even work.
Rather than grump about the rejection of "lift and strike," air-power interventionists should recognize that Clinton's policy is better than another year of his demeaning vacillation. Rather than sit back and say to the President, "Convince us," Congress and the public should help him refine and define his new policy.
In his Monday night speech he should declare that if any side hits our peace-enforcers we will not cut and run, as in Lebanon and Somalia. The full division of Americans based in Tuzla will respond with ferocity, even as our allies plead with us to be "proportionate."
The agreement negotiated in Dayton suggests that the Administration at last understands the need to create a balance of power. Clinton must make clear to Congress that the half of Bosnia that is Muslim-Croatian will have more tanks and artillery and electronics than the part that is Serbian, because the Bosnian Serbs have backup forces in Serbia.
Does that mean we are making peace by building up one side? Yes; we are obligated to build the defenses of the weak, who did not start the war. If, as Defense Secretary Perry keeps hoping, the aggressors achieve balance by a "build-down," fine; but let's not count on it. Forget evenhandedness; remember who the victims were and which entity remains most threatened.
At the same time, the President should make clear to Muslims and Croats that further reliance on Iran is unacceptable. With the embargo lifted, Pakistan and Poland can work out the transfer of ex-Soviet arms.
Clinton should emphasize that we expect more war-crimes indictments, and will put economic heat on the parties to give up those indicted for trial at The Hague. That goes for one mad psychiatrist and the butcher of Srebrenica as well as individual murderers and rapists.
Should the President ask Congress to authorize this use of troops? That was decided long ago. In an Oct. 20, 1993, letter to then-majority leader George Mitchell, Clinton brought up the possibility of sending an unspecified number of troops to "implement" a peace agreement, and said he would "welcome and encourage Congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia."
Congress should listen, probe, debate, caution -- and then, on Bob Dole's motion, give him the authorization he needs.

SHARES OF LUND INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS DROP 23%

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Shares of Lund International Holdings Inc. fell 23 percent yesterday after the company said late on Tuesday that sales for its second quarter, ending Dec. 31, would be lower than expected. The company, which makes accessories for light trucks and vans, attributed the outlook to a soft retail economy, a decline in light truck sales and other factors that caused expanded inventory at distributors. Lund, which is based in Anoka, Minn., said it had cut its work force by 10 percent and had consolidated its operations. In last year's second quarter, Lund earned $1.65 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $11.1 million. Lund's shares were down $3.375, to $10.75, in Nasdaq trading.

HEADLINE: Liberal Urging Has Given Way To Eerie Hush

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
With the Republican Congress moving to slash many Federal social programs, an odd hush has fallen over Washington: the sound of liberal advocacy groups that have been unable to create much of a clamor against the most drastic cuts in decades.
"If you compare what's going on now to the health care debate two years ago, you can't help but wonder why there is such an eerie silence on issues that are so central to so many people's lives," said Alan Ehrenhalt, the executive editor of Governing magazine. "There's so many important things going on in Congress, with Medicaid, Medicare and welfare reform. I read the paper, and I think, Where's the noise?" 
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has been frustrated at his inability to muster opposition to the welfare overhaul bill this fall, wonders the same thing, far more furiously.
"Fifteen years ago, if there was a proposal to take $40 out of some demonstration project here on the Senate floor, there would be 40 representatives of various advocacy groups outside," Mr. Moynihan said. "There are very few advocacy groups outside. You can stand where I stand and look straight out at the Supreme Court -- not a person in between that view. Not one of those flaunted, vaunted advocacy groups forever protecting the interest of the children and the helpless and the homeless and the what-you-will.
"Are they increasingly subsidized and therefore increasingly co-opted? Are they silent because the White House is silent?"
What is happening to advocacy? As the Government lurches toward its Dec. 15 budget deadline for resolving how much to spend on Medicare, education, the welfare system, and other social programs, the landscape seems dramatically altered.
In part, momentum has shifted from the liberal advocacy groups, which are reeling in the face of the Republican agenda, to the conservative ones, which have gained tremendously in strength and power.
For conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life Committee, these are heady days, replete with respectful attention in the news and the chance, for the first time in decades, to work with a Congressional majority to change the role of the Federal Government.
At the same time, the nature of advocacy has changed, becoming less a matter of mass protests and grass-roots coalitions than an expensive amalgam of focus groups, paid television advertisements, E-mail and faxes put together by highly paid Washington lawyers. Indeed, the only large march in Washington in the last year, the Million Man March in October, was not based on an advocacy agenda or political demands, but was pure identity politics, bringing black men together.
 
Liberal Groups AskIf Anyone's Listening
The sheer breadth of the battles to be fought has stunned many liberal advocacy groups: welfare, legal services, Medicare and Medicaid are all under attack. Some advocates say they have felt compelled to cooperate with the Republicans rather than lose all by fighting. Contributing to the silence is the difficulty of mobilizing their own members at a time when so many Americans have lost faith in Government.
And some Republicans in Congress are attacking the advocacy groups themselves. Representative Ernest Jim Istook Jr. of Oklahoma and others are seeking to make nonprofit groups ineligible for Federal grants if they engage in significant advocacy. The Istook amendment, which delayed the budget resolution for 10 weeks and galvanized opposition from liberal advocacy groups, is dead for now, but is likely to be reintroduced as part of a lobbying disclosure bill.
Liberal advocacy groups say Senator Moynihan's tirade in Congress, during this fall's welfare debate, was unfair. They say they have lobbied desperately to get the White House and Congress to reject the Republican spending cuts, and have won some important concessions. And as to mobilizing mass support, they say, it is not that they are keeping quiet, but that no one much is listening -- and that outside Washington, there is little understanding of the profound social changes the Republicans propose.
"If there's a silence, it's the silence of trees falling in the forest unheard," said James Weill, general counsel of the Children's Defense Fund. "Like all the trees cut down to print our excellent report on the state of America's children, which passed unnoticed across many, many desks. Between March and September, we did all kinds of reports, press releases, and events on welfare, but they just didn't get the attention they did in the past. Part of it is that people in this country don't have the foggiest idea of what's coming at them. When the Congressional cuts begin to bite, we'll start seeing reaction."
Meanwhile, though, liberal advocacy groups are spending most of their time defending old ground.
"Most of the advocacy work these days is trying to defend the hard-won victories of 10 or 20 years ago, or even back in the New Deal," said David Cohen, co-director of the Advocacy Institute, a Washington group that teaches citizen groups how to influence policy. "We had to fight the Istook amendment. There's no choice about that. It had to be done. But it's not a substitute for a vision. There isn't a vision right now."
 
In Centers of Power, Fewer Voices on Left
As liberal advocacy groups run to stay in place, conservative groups march ahead with a clear agenda.
"What we're saying is that on fundamental issues like welfare, Medicare and the budget, government has not been working," said Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "This is something we've been crystallizing over many years, and it strikes a chord for average Americans, who agree that we need structural changes. So of course it's very difficult for the left to mount mass opposition to those changes."
Certainly, there are fewer liberal voices heard in centers of power these days. What was once an extensive network of welfare rights organizations largely withered under the Reagan Administration. And the bloc of liberal mayors and governors who could be counted on to protest any attempt to cut back social spending in the years that the Republicans held the White House -- among them Mario M. Cuomo, David N. Dinkins, Michael S. Dukakis, Henry G. Cisneros and Ann Richards -- have been replaced by more conservative politicians.
"The larger story is that this is a time when Americans doubt the ability of the government to do anything, so it's hard to rally public support," said John Rother, the legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons.
If liberal advocacy is less visible than it once was, he and others said, it is in part because many groups have decided that in light of the political realities in Congress, their energies are better used on the inside, negotiating with legislators, than on the outside, organizing mass protests or letter-writing campaigns.
"Any group like A.A.R.P. that represents a broad spectrum of people has a responsibility to get the best possible deal for its members," Mr. Rother said. "We had to go in there and negotiate. Even if what we end up with is still unacceptable, it's clear to me that without us in there, the bill would've been worse in quite specific ways."
Some longtime Washington watchers, though, say that the liberal advocacy groups were slow to develop their tactics for fighting a Republican Congress and that they were stranded by a President who did not stand his ground.
"We had a fundamental transfer of power, and in the opening months, people were just sitting there shell-shocked, and the President was essentially sitting on the sidelines," said Fred Wertheimer, the former president of the public-interest group Common Cause. "Meanwhile, the Republicans were rushing to do everything at once."
 
New Technology Replaces Grass Roots
At the same time, Mr. Wertheimer said, the nature of advocacy has changed since the mass protests of the 1960's and 1970's.
"Marches aren't the way you fight advocacy battles now," he said. "Technology is becoming more and more a factor in the ability to conduct advocacy campaigns. That plays to those with resources: Welfare mothers don't send faxes, they don't get E-mail, and they can't buy paid television ad campaigns."
Business groups have become sophisticated about using boiler-room telephone operations in Washington to create the semblance of a grass-roots advocacy campaign. One such "Astroturf" campaign was last summer's fight over the telecommunications law, in which long-distance telephone companies flooded Congress with more than half a million telegrams ostensibly sent by citizens urging the House not to rewrite the law.
But an investigation by members of Congress, puzzled to be getting so much public reaction on an issue that was hardly riveting to most Americans, discovered that as many as half the telegrams were bogus, sent by a telemarketing firm without authorization from the people whose names were signed -- some of whom were dead.
"Our vendor messed up, and I feel terrible about the breakdown of the system," said Robert Beckel, chairman of Beckel Cowan, the public relations firm that coordinated the campaign. "But that aside, I don't see anything wrong with this kind of advocacy. If you have the resources, what's wrong with calling people, asking for their support, and telling them you'll send a telegram for them? It's a lot more representative than hiring some well-connected Washington lobbyist."
Perhaps, but neither kind of campaign is available to those without resources. "We're in an era when most political speech is bought, so we heard a lot during the health care debate two years ago from insurers and others whose economic interests were at stake," said Mr. Weill of the Children's Defense Fund. "The reason there isn't much now is that people with lots of money are perfectly happy about what's happening."
Ralph Neas, a Washington lawyer who is counsel to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said progressive groups needed to learn to match right-wing prowess in handling electronic media and shaping a clear message.
"Our side has not done as good a job as we should have in framing the issue," he said. "Americans might think we're just talking about the budget deficit, when we're really talking about the role of government. I don't think people have any idea what is going to happen to millions of children and women in poor families if we undo a 60-year Federal social safety net. If the President doesn't stand firm in blocking the conservative agenda, we will probably not see that net put back together in our lifetimes."

Bank Guidelines Prepared For Traders Who Gamble
Responding to trading scandals at Barings and other banks, Federal banking regulators are to propose guidelines to limit pay for traders who take excessive risks, Government officials and traders said.
Bank regulators hope to bring traders' personal financial interests in line with their banks' interests, rather than see employers reward traders who take huge risks to earn large bonuses -- while endangering their employer's viability. While examiners' guidelines do not carry the force of law, banks follow them scrupulously because poor marks from an examiner can lead to a wide range of regulatory problems. [D10.]
 
Leeson Charged in Singapore
Singapore formally charged the former Barings trader Nicholas W. Leeson today with fraud and forgery linked to some $1.4 billion in losses that broke the venerable bank. Mr. Leeson arrived in Singapore on Thursday, after a 13-hour flight from Germany. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 14 years in prison. [D12]
 
English-French Water Merger
A French water company is buying a big British counterpart for the first time. Lyonnaise des Eaux is buying Northumbrian Water Group for $1.28 billion. Shares of Northumbrian surged to almost five times their value at the time the company was privatized. [D12.]
 
Bonanza at a Nickel Mine
Prospectors in Eastern Canada stumbled upon a vast cache of nickel in 1993, making a small company into a giant mining company. The market capitalization of the company, Diamond Fields, has soared from $100 million to $3 billion in less than a year. And within a few years, the mine could be producing 8 percent of the nickel consumed in the world. It is welcome news for the company's founder, who is in trouble with American authorities after the collapse of one of his earlier enterprises. [D10.]

Cartel's Woes Drain Colombia
The Cali drug cartel is facing an economic crisis that appears to be roiling the economy of Colombia. The stock market there has tumbled, and members of the cartel have been selling real estate for cash. At the same time, the peso has lost 7 percent of its dollar value because of the scarcity of dollars. [A7.]
 
Troubles at Privately Run Jails
As the Federal Government puts control of some of its jails in private hands, pitfalls are emerging, including overly generous contracts and the hiring of companies that are difficult for the Government to supervise. [A1.]
 
A Study of Economics of Gambling

HEADLINE: Federal Study Would Weigh Costs of Gambling's Spread

BYLINE: By By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: DEADWOOD, S.D.

 BODY:
Betty Whittington and Bill Walsh have come down on opposite sides of the argument over gambling in this gritty Black Hills mining town, which voted to legalize casinos in 1989. Although both fought to pass the legislation, Mrs. Whittington now strongly opposes the casinos, which have all but wiped out the town's retailers, while Mr. Walsh, who owns a casino and a hotel, says gambling has helped revive what had been a dying community.
But the two agree on what is becoming one of the most critical issues for the dozens of communities across the country that have considered proposals for gambling. Mrs. Whittington and Mr. Walsh say that before the vote, they had no idea what the casinos would do to the town and that they would have done things differently if they had. 
 "In many ways, it's been 180 degrees different from what we sold the state when we fought for this," said Mr. Walsh, who runs the Franklin Hotel on Main Street, which is now lined by gaudy gambling parlors. "We had thought it would just be back-room gambling. Obviously, we've lost a lot of retail because of it. I don't think we had any idea how much people wanted to gamble."
Strolling past storefront casinos that have replaced everything from the state social services office to the insurance broker and department store, Mrs. Whittington commented, "I'm homesick all the time, and I never left home. We were completely unrealistic."
The experience of Deadwood -- and many other communities that had once embraced gambling as a shortcut to prosperity, from Atlantic City to New Orleans -- is an important reason why the most significant legislation for the future of the rapidly expanding, $482 billion gambling economy may be two bills in Congress that would provide communities with a commodity often in short supply: information.
The bills would create a national commission that would study the profound, if still poorly understood, economic, social and political effects of gambling and would arm communities with that information before they decided whether to allow casino operators.
The legislation is being fought bitterly by the American Gaming Association, a powerful new industry group that is led by Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the former chairman of the Republican Party. Mr. Fahrenkopf, who has warned against an assault on the industry by "a greedy Federal Government and moral crusaders," says the bills are Trojan horses whose real intention is to open the way for Federal regulations.
The sponsors insist that the bills are focused only on information.
"If you want it in your community, fine," said Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia who is the original sponsor of the House bill and is an admitted opponent of casinos. "But at least you should have information available to make an intelligent choice. People have not had that."
The House bill has more than 100 co-sponsors, and its passage appears likely, perhaps before the end of the year. The Senate version, sponsored by Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, could be voted on early next year.
"One of the main reasons you've seen this headlong rush to build casinos in the past few years is that there was not much information on the broader economic impact of gambling," said Robert Goodman, a professor at Hampshire College and author of "The Luck Business," a book recently published by Marvin Kessler Books/The Free Press. "You cannibalize the local economy to a large degree when you open a casino. You just transfer money from one area to another. People just have no idea."
Among the issues that would be explored in the study are how much casinos simply transfer spending from local businesses to the slot machines and gambling tables and how much gambling increases crime and the costs of crime prevention. It would also look at the drawing power of gambling advertising, the effects of computerized gambling and gambling on the Internet, and the actual costs of gambling addictions to businesses and communities.
It had once been estimated that slightly less than 1 percent of a population was susceptible to gambling addiction, but some new studies are putting that figure as high as 5 percent. They find that treating the disorder can cost more than $15,000 for each person.
In fact, corporations are already starting to deliver their own assessments of the impact of gambling by avoiding areas that have casinos.
"It is a very competitive environment among cities seeking corporate relocations," said James Wadley of the Wadley-Donovan Group, corporate relocation consultants in Morristown, N.J. "All things being equal, if you had two opportunities, the one without gambling is going to be more attractive than the one with gambling."
Gambling supporters have tried to amend the legislation. They complain that the bills would be the first step toward Federal regulation of a business that the states are better equipped to control, and they question the fairness of any study financed by Congress.
Mr. Fahrenkopf said, "Our concern is that these two pieces of legislation are predisposed to an unfair and biased look." Since no two communities are alike, the study cannot provide general conclusions about gambling nationwide, he added.
"Each jurisdiction has got to weigh the issue based on their own socioeconomic conditions," Mr. Fahrenkopf said. "It's our view that gaming may not work everywhere. But you can't take that study and apply it to Oregon or Minnesota."
Before the explosive spread of gambling in the past few years, academic experts interested in the topic had little to study, beyond the isolated instances of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Now the proliferation of casinos is generating a slow trickle of reports.
Clearly, casinos have brought some economic benefits to certain communities, particularly to a few Indian tribes. Perhaps the best example is the enormously prosperous Foxwoods Resort Casino, opened by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Ledyard, Conn., in 1992. That gambling revenue has created jobs, bought homes and given many tribe members a good education.
But even the Indian casinos have a great impact on the surrounding areas. A study of the 17 Indian casinos in Wisconsin earlier this year found that they had produced $326.7 million in revenue for the state but that related social costs had reduced those benefits to a maximum of $166 million. Because of those social costs, the state might even have lost money in the long run, the study said.
The study also found that the Wisconsin casinos generally attracted the poor and the elderly. The typical gambler is 50 to 70 years old, the report said, and has a family income of $20,000 to $30,000 a year.
"What we found is that it's a transfer of money, really from the lower-middle-income and poor to the casino operators," said William Thompson, a professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and a co-author of the study.
He estimated that if less than half the gambling at a casino is done by people who live outside the state, the state loses substantial sums of money.
"When the industry studies casinos, they tell you where the money goes to, not where it comes from," said Mr. Thompson, who endorses the national study proposed by Congress.
Other studies have also shown that there can be substantial hidden costs for casinos.
John Warren Kindt, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author of several gambling studies, has estimated that every dollar in tax revenue brought in by legalized gambling generates about $3 in costs. He has also estimated that a one-cent increase in a local sales tax will raise more net revenue than legalized gambling.
Supporters of the gambling bills say a national study is important because casinos often have an impact on more than one state. Thecasinos draw customers from a broad area.
"The problem is that states are not making these decisions independently," said Peter Reuter, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and a researcher on a study being done in his state. "The decision to put casinos in Massachusetts is based on what's happening in Connecticut, for instance."
The Parish of Grant, a rural district in Louisiana, does not have gambling, but it is within 50 miles of a number of riverboats and other casinos. Edward L. Tarpley Jr., the local prosecutor, said the area had suffered a big increase in the number of cases of worthless checks, embezzlement and forgeries, most of them related to gambling.
"We do not have a casino in our parish, but we have all the problems," Mr. Tarpley said. "We simply did not know what this was about. What the gambling people are doing is picking off states and communities one at a time, using the studies they have paid for. People don't have the real information about the costs. We sure didn't."
Jeffry Bloomberg, the former prosecutor in Deadwood and now head of South Dakota's prison system, said that another side effect of gambling was its tendency to dominate local politics. The local government becomes so dependent on the success of gambling to raise revenue that it has to rethink positions on numerous issues, he added.
"It changed the whole character of the community and the government," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Almost any decision at City Hall is based on what's good for gambling now. I'm not sure that is what the government should be focused on."

Meanwhile, Bill Walsh, owner of the Franklin Hotel and Casino, said a 1989 vote on gambling in Deadwood, S.D., would probably have come out differently had he and others known more about how gambling would change the character of their town.

HEADLINE: John Collins, 76, Boston Mayor During City's Renewal in the 60's

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
John F. Collins, one of three strong postwar mayors who rebuilt Boston with a formula emulated around the country, died of pneumonia today at Vencor Hospital here, where he had been under treatment since July. He was 76.
During his two terms as Mayor, from 1960 to 1968, Mr. Collins oversaw a wave of rebuilding and renovation begun in the late 1950's by his predecessor, John Hynes. 
 "What Collins has left us is the greatest legacy any mayor can, which is an investment in the city for the long term," Marisa Lago, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said today. "He had the vision to insure that Boston wouldn't recede into a backwater city."
During Mr. Collins's tenure, the redevelopment authority, created by Mr. Hynes, channeled $2 billion of Federal money into renewal projects. Government Center arose from the rubble of seedy Scollay Square during the Collins administration, the Prudential Center became an anchor of the city's economic and commercial revival, and the city's dying waterfront began a new life as a business and tourist center.
Mr. Collins also envisioned the conversion of run-down warehouses around Faneuil Hall into a bright mix of restaurants and stores. That project, Quincy Market, was begun under his successor, Kevin White.
Not that Boston's urban renewal was regarded as universally successful. The wholesale razing of the working-class, vibrant West End to make way for high-rise apartments became its most widely criticized feature.
Mr. Collins, a native of Boston's Roxbury section, attended city schools before enrolling in Suffolk University, where he studied law and, in 1941, graduated at the top of his class.
Mr. Collins, a Democrat, practiced law in Roxbury before serving for several years in the Massachusetts Legislature. Then, during a 1955 epidemic, he and his four children were all stricken with polio. The children recovered fully, but he spent 10 years in a wheelchair and later was able to walk only with the help of crutches.
Mr. Collins is survived by his wife, Mary Patricia Cunniff; their four children, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Parade Leader Can Never Show Deflation

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Greeting yesterday's blustery dawn with a general's determination, Jean McFaddin drove out to inspect her troops. She powered her golf cart past human bowling pins, assorted clowns and two cross-eyed dragons, before stopping to speak in code with a lieutenant.
"I hear there's a little Big Apple problem," she said to the aide. "If it falls through, we'll move to Mother Goose." 
 She had not slept in more than 24 hours, but this was no time for rest. Not on the D-Day of pageantry, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. And certainly not for Jean McFaddin, its producer, director and grande dame for the last 18 years.
Having addressed the Big Apple float problem -- the engine was acting up -- Ms. McFaddin continued north on Central Park West. She wore a uniform of red and black, Macy's colors. In her pocketbook was a walkie-talkie: on this day, communication was almost as important as the weather.
Almost. There was no way for Ms. McFaddin to anticipate the mischievous winds that would soon toss her 18 balloons around like -- well, like balloons. Two would meet their demise, and two more would limp to the finish line, bleeding helium.
At that moment, however, she was determined to conquer the elements. As a breeze ruffled her gray hair, she squinted south toward the wind tunnel known as Broadway. "It's going to be a great parade," she said.
Ms. McFaddin is a Macy's vice president in charge of public relations, promotions and events. She oversees events throughout the year, from the annual flower show to the Fourth of July fireworks. But the Thanksgiving parade looms over the rest like a huge dollar-sign balloon.
The event is thought of as the kickoff to the Christmas shopping season. The advertising potential prompts toy and candy manufacturers to promote their products through floats and balloons. For example, this year marked the maiden voyage of a balloon modeled on the Sky Dancer action doll.
But the parade also reflects American society's changing interests. In 1934, Walt Disney provided balloons of Horace Horsecollar, a long-forgotten cartoon character, and the Big Bad Wolf, then the symbol of Great Depression fear. That same year a balloon bearing the likeness of Eddie Cantor was buffeted by midtown winds; he is remembered now, vaguely, for once having made whoopee.
It has even mirrored the country's tragedies and triumphs. Parades were canceled during some of the World War II years, with the balloon rubber donated to the war effort. And in 1963, less than a week after President Kennedy's assassination, parade flags bore black bunting, signaling that people were marching more out of duty than celebration.
Given the event's rich history, a lot depended yesterday on Ms. McFaddin. Macy's was counting on her. So was NBC, which televises the parade. And so were the bundled-up children, tens of thousands of them.
But she seemed well-suited to handle the pressure -- more so than her celluloid equivalent, played by Maureen O'Hara in "Miracle on 34th Street." Once a director who specialized in avant-garde productions and the plays of Shaw, Ms. McFaddin switched to pageantry, caught the eye of Macy's executives and was hired to revive its annual parade.
The job has clearly grown on her. Yesterday, she greeted people with "Happy Parade!" and seemed oddly at home amid the surreal tableau at Central Park West and West 77th Street, the starting point.
She was surrounded by human fire hydrants, dogs and bumblebees. Up the street was Humpty Dumpty. And around the corner, a gigantic Barney the dinosaur was strapped face-down outside the Museum of Natural History, as though awaiting paleontological inspection.
Suddenly, it was 9 A.M. Months of preparation had come down to this moment. The skies were slate-colored, the temperature was 35 degrees, and a teasing wind was blowing from the south.
Ms. McFaddin cut a red ribbon with a battery-operated carving knife and stepped out to lead the parade. Behind her were 18 balloons, 32 floats, 14 marching bands and thousands of singers, dancers and other entertainers.
The spectators roared their approval, as passing clowns showered them with multicolored confetti. People cheered from the wooded lip of Central Park on one side and from the windows of apartment buildings on the other. Ms. McFaddin, marching a block a minute, returned their smiles and waves.
But soon the queen of the parade began to march backward. She saw trouble: Some balloons were teetering dangerously close to deadly tree limbs and street lamps.
At Columbus Circle, Chelsea Farley, age 10, and her 6-year-old cousin Dana sat under a police barricade with eyes and mouths wide. Chelsea said she liked the Garfield balloon the best; Dana's favorite was Dudley the Dragon, a cheerful television character with 20-foot sneakers who was added to the parade this year.
Alas, Dudley was doomed. A stiff wind sent the 65-foot balloon into something sharp, leaving a gaping wound in its belly.
Dudley was discreetly removed from the parade route and quickly deflated just a few feet from young Chelsea, who didn't seem to mind. But Meridian Worldwide, the character's licensing agent, probably did; according to New York magazine, the company paid Macy's $350,000 to have the balloon created and highlighted during the nationally broadcast event.
Ms. McFaddin and her entourage pressed on down the 2 1/2-mile route, cheered along by people who stood five deep on the sidewalks. Once she reached the end, in front of Macy's at Herald Square, she clambered onto a reviewing stand to watch, and to receive reports from the field.
Just before noon, Santa Claus's sleigh arrived at Herald Square, officially ending the 69th parade. Then came the casualty count, with Ms. McFaddin grimly acknowledging, "We had a lot of balloon damage."
Like Dudley, Sonic the Hedgehog of video-game fame was so banged up that it couldn't finish. A deflated Pink Panther finished, but barely. Betty Boop lost the half-crescent moon on which she sits. And Sky Dancer's first parade appearance was marred by facial damage.
Still, Ms. McFaddin said she was very pleased. She said she was also tired, and expected to be sound asleep in her Upper West Side apartment by mid-afternoon.
Sometime after midnight, she said, she will get out of bed. She will make some popcorn and rewind a videotape. Then, protected from cold winds and far from teetering balloons, the general will watch her parade in private.

HEADLINE: IN REVERSAL, SERBS OF BOSNIA ACCEPT PEACE AGREEMENT

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The Bosnian Serbs agreed this evening to abide by the peace accord reached in Dayton, Ohio, removing an obstacle to sending American troops to help enforce the peace.
The Bosnian Serbs had refused to initial the agreement on Tuesday in Dayton, where they had been represented by Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, on whom they have relied for military and political support. The Clinton Administration had said that no American troops would be deployed unless the Bosnian Serbs accepted the accord, which has been signed by the two other parties in the Bosnian conflict, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats. 
 The Bosnian Serb leaders initialed the very accords that they they had refused to sign on Tuesday, said Lawrence Butler, the ranking American diplomat in Belgrade. Mr. Butler said he faxed the signed documents to Washington late tonight.
In announcing the reversal, the official Belgrade television said the Bosnian Serbs had "fully accepted" the accord, even though they found provisions "painful."
Nikola Koljevic, a vice president of the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic, confirmed that the Bosnian Serbs had agreed to the accords. He said, however, that they were hoping for "some improvements" in the agreement. "I can not be more specific," he said in a brief telephone interview tonight.
The Bosnian Serb capitulation came after a meeting here today of their top leaders with President Milosevic, who may have lost his dream of a Greater Serbia but has taken another step in his drive to be seen in the West not as the man who started the war but as the moderate leader who brought it to an end.
A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said he had thought it would take longer for President Milosevic to bring the Bosnian Serbs around. "It was a complete humiliation of the Bosnian Serb leadership," he said. "I didn't expect it to happen so soon."
In Washington, Administration officials greeted the Bosnian Serb announcement with relief, but cautioned that they still needed to review what the Serbs had agreed to.
"Milosevic assured us before leaving Dayton that he'd get the Bosnian Serbs on board, but that he'd need a couple of days to calm these guys down," said a State Department official. "It sounds like he's been able to pull this off."
Defense Department officials, in particular, had expressed concern that winning Congressional approval for the accord would be even more difficult without the Bosnian Serbs' consent.
The acceptance suggests that moderates within the Bosnian Serb leadership, who are supported by Mr. Milosevic, have prevailed over the hard-liners, led by Mr. Milosevic's political rival, Radovan Karadzic, political leader of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic.
The Bosnian Serbs' capitulation would appear to spell the political end for Dr. Karadzic and for Gen. Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb army. The agreement says that individuals who have been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague may not hold political office. Both Dr. Karadzic, a former psychiatrist, and General Mladic have been indicted on several counts.
The hard-liners had been angry with Mr. Milosevic, who was negotiating in Dayton on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, for having agreed that Sarajevo would be a unified city, which would require the return of Serb-controlled suburbs to the Bosnian Government. They also felt that he had given away too much other territory that the Bosnian Serbs had gained on the battlefield.
Dr. Karadzic was present at the meeting with Mr. Milosevic, Belgrade state television reported. General Mladic, who has been reported to be suffering from kidney stones, was represented by his deputy. Also attending, the state television said, were Mr. Koljevic, the vice president; Biljana Plavsic, another vice president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, and Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of its parliament.
That Mr. Milosevic won over Ms. Plavsic and Mr. Krajisnik was considered of particular importance. While Mr. Koljevic is viewed as a moderate in the Bosnian Serb context, the others were considered hard-liners.
Mr. Krajisnik, who was present in Dayton, had denounced the agreement; two years ago, Ms. Plavsic had rejected the peace proposal put together by the former American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen of Britain, saying that six million Serbian casualties was not too high a price for the Bosnian Serbs to pay for their goals. Mr. Milosevic retorted that she should probably be committed to a mental hospital.
Reached by telephone at their headquarters in Pale, Bosnia, outside Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serbs said they would have no official comment on today's events.
Details of the meeting between Mr. Milosevic and the Bosnian Serb leaders, including which person actually initialed the document, were not made public, but Western diplomats and Belgrade political analysts say they are certain Mr. Milosevic used some of the same strong-arm tactics on the Bosnian Serbs that the American negotiators had used in Dayton.
"You can just about bet that they had their arms twisted far up their backs," said a Western diplomat. "They succumbed to his blandishments, and believe me, they can be pretty unattractive."
Mr. Milosevic's position was as strong as that of the Bosnian Serb leaders was weak.
To begin with, the United Nations Security Council had lifted economic and military sanctions, but if the Bosnian Serbs' intransigence upset the Dayton agreement, the sanctions might have been imposed again. "You can bet that Mr. Milosevic was telling them that they would have the wrath of all the Serbs on them," a Western diplomat said.
In Belgrade today, an extended broadcast was devoted almost exclusively to the lifting of sanctions, with interviews of people on the street who welcomed the day and praised their leader. "This is the happiest day of my life," said one woman.
Then there is the Bosnian Serb army, which has been dependent on support from Belgrade. It has been badly routed in recent weeks by the Bosnian and Croatian armies, and was thus in no position to argue that it should fight on.
While rogue elements of the Bosnian Serb military could still engage in guerrilla warfare, the army cannot be expected to achieve any significant military gains if Mr. Milosevic this time lives up to his promise not to support it. It is a promise he has made before, and then broken.
As for Dr. Karadzic, "it is too early to know what he will do," said a Western diplomat. "He might try to hang on, but it will be very difficult, if not impossible, without the loyalty of the army, which he does not command."
And the last 48 hours have accentuated a power struggle within the Bosnian Serb leadership, which had been remarkably united until recently. The hard-liners, principally Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, have their base in Pale, but little remains there beyond their bodyguards and local residents who once catered to skiers in the winter resort village. The moderate leadership, led by Mr. Koljevic, operates out of Banja Luka.

HEADLINE: The Wounded Giants of Japan;
Its Bank System Is Reeling, but How Serious Is the Pain?

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Japanese banks are the titans of the international financial system, towering over Citicorp and BankAmerica like sumo wrestlers over a kindergarten class. But now, to hear some people talk, the titans are about to topple with a crash that would devastate financial markets around the world.
Some analysts, regulators and business executives worry that a financial meltdown in Japan, home to the world's 10 biggest banks, could be set off by a ballooning burden of bad debts and a loss of confidence abroad. Even American officials have tried to avoid actions that would further endanger the Japanese institutions. 
 Are the pessimists right?
Those who know the Japanese banks the best, the bankers and the analysts in Tokyo, seem almost unanimous in their contention that the biggest banks will survive on their own or be rescued through mergers. They say the banking system, saddled with bad debts amounting to at least 8 percent of national economic output, will not collapse, though anything short of that could happen.
"They're not going to suddenly step back and watch the whole thing burn down," David Threadgold, a financial analyst at BZW Securities (Japan) Ltd., said of the Japanese authorities. "Ultimately, the second most important thing for any government to do, after securing their borders, is securing their credit system. If you haven't got a credit system, you haven't got a country. So they'll do what they have to do."
To be sure, financial experts in Tokyo have been surprised before, and some Japanese bankers who express confidence now did not exactly show great acumen a few years ago when they were piling up all those bad loans.
Moreover, while many experts say a collapse is not imminent, some have grave concerns that in the long run the banks will stumble out of their ordeal as much weaker, second-rate financial institutions. To escape that fate, they will have to change their old ways, which have left managers overcompensated and the banks complacent, overprotected and secretive, the experts say. And there are few signs of that happening.
For now, the bankers and analysts base their guarded optimism in part on capital ratios and other financial data, but mainly on their understanding of Japanese politics -- especially the role of the Ministry of Finance. Here in Japan, where the term "free markets" is rarely heard and regulators and bankers often seem to be on the same side, the ministry, with the wave of a hand, can rush more than $180 billion in dollar reserves and hundreds of billions more in yen to the banks to prevent them from crashing in a liquidity crisis.
So when Masayoshi Takemura, the Finance Minister, says the nation's largest banks will not fail, people in Tokyo tend to believe it. If the ministry keeps the biggest banks afloat -- even if some are absorbed by others -- any other banking problems look manageable.
Some analysts say that up to three dozen of the nation's 1,000 main financial institutions may become technically insolvent as bad loans erode their capital bases. Yet, they add, even if the Government allows some of the smaller institutions to fail, such bankruptcies are unlikely to cause severe repercussions abroad.
In fact, the United States suffered a similar debacle that began in the 1980's -- a widespread crisis in the savings and loan industry, costing several hundred billion dollars. The cleanup of bad debt, which equaled about 2.5 percent of economic output, according to Morgan Stanley Japan, hastened a big consolidation of the banking business -- but it did not impair America's financial system.
While Japan's debt crisis is of a larger magnitude, analysts here say that it, too, is unlikely to bring down the house.
Still, the financial community has felt a few sharp jolts, like the failures of five institutions in the last year and the expulsion of Daiwa Bank from the United States a few weeks ago. The industry's borrowings from the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, are more intensive this year, and the seasonal crunch has not yet come.
But the central bank has mapped out the system's liquidity flows, with an eye on cash needs for each day through the end of the year. Dec. 4, for instance, is corporate tax payment day, requiring a $70 billion injection; Dec. 10 is bonus day for employees across the country, and then comes the rush toward the new year, as companies scramble to dress up their year-end accounts.
A credit squeeze seems to have abated somewhat, and, as many big Japanese banks plan to announce on Friday a near doubling in operating profits for the half-year ended Sept. 30, foreign bankers and investors are showing new interest in doing business with them.
For the long term, though, there is still enormous anxiety because it will be expensive to mop up the mess.
"A bank can go on operating -- even if it's insolvent -- for eternity if people don't start yanking their money out and if the Government starts pumping in money," said Alicia Ogawa, a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. here. "But the Bank of Japan needs its money back eventually, and where's it going to come from? Who pays for the losses?"
The Finance Ministry has floated the idea of using taxpayers' money to bail out financial institutions that lent recklessly for real estate projects during the 1980's. That strategy would mirror the United States Government's approach to the savings and loan debacle. But with operating profits rolling into the Japanese banks, the idea is unpopular with the public.
As a result, politicians probably will delay a public bailout as long as possible, raising the ultimate cost -- just as was done in the United States.
That final amount remains unclear. The Government recently said bad debts amounted to 37.4 trillion yen, or about $370 billion, with half unrecoverable. But some analysts say the number could top $735 billion.
At the banks, meanwhile, the new surge in profits has forestalled any sense of crisis. Indeed, the average annual income for male employees at money-center banks is $96,000, among the highest of any industry.
When a hijacker commandeered a plane in northern Japan this summer, what shocked some people most was that he turned out to be a banker drawing about $80,000 a year on long-term sick leave from Toyo Trust and Banking, an institution with a sizable portfolio of bad debt.
"His income is better than mine!" Hiromu Nonaka, the Home Affairs Minister, said at the time. "Unless the banks give up their own fortunes before they ask for public funds, they will not get any understanding from the people."
Despite modest efforts to cut costs, Japanese bankers say they still entertain clients often, typically spending $100 to $200 a person.
"There are very few financial systems around the world that have this big a problem and then go off to spend lots of money," said David Atkinson, a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.
While bonuses on Wall Street fluctuate with profits, the only consequence of Japan's crisis on bankers here is that this year, their annual bonuses, typically equal to six months' pay, will be cut to less than five and a half months' pay. And the banks had to be pressured to do that much.
"They are cutting the bonuses because everyone out there is criticizing the banks," a Japanese banker said. "Morale is still high, but we are worried about the future."
So are many investors and bankers abroad. Specifically, they are worried that there is no standard mechanism by which a bank can fail, and so the recent failures have been handled in quirky fashion.
When the Finance Ministry in August closed Kizu Credit Cooperative, the nation's largest credit union, it wanted to display its financial muscle to limit a chaotic bank run -- more than 10,000 people had swarmed into Kizu branches to withdraw deposits. The Bank of Japan trucked in sacks of money, piling them on the counters and into rooms in the buildings.
Not everyone was convinced. Some customers refused to leave the lobby at one branch and spent the night there. Managers also neglected security, even with so much money lying around, and two months later they discovered that about $1 million in yen had been stolen during all the shuffling.
Nor is there a way for an insolvent bank to raise money in the markets to bolster its capital base to international standards of adequacy. Traditionally, the Finance Ministry simply arranged for a troubled institution to be absorbed by a healthy one, and the public never knew the extent of the ailing bank's problems.
Such methods, however, no longer comfort the foreign community, which became increasingly anxious after United States authorities expelled Daiwa Bank following disclosures of $1.1 billion in secret losses in bond trading in the bank's New York office. What angered the Americans most was that the Finance Ministry knew of the scandal for six weeks before informing them.
The Japanese public is getting jittery, too. Many savers are transferring some of their money from private institutions to the postal savings system run by the Government.
There are other warning signs, some experts say. The current high profits are a dividend from lucrative bond trading and low costs of funds, not from their bread-and-butter lending business. The Bank of Japan has lowered its discount rate, the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks, to five-tenths of 1 percent, giving the banks a cheap source of funds and a virtual subsidy that helps them write off bad debt.
But even with that help, profits are low by international standards. Return on assets for the top 150 banks is an average of two-hundredths of 1 percent, compared with 1.3 percent, for example, at Citicorp.
So while there may be little risk of a sudden collapse, some experts fear for the future. Even with an economic recovery, they say, the financial system faces long-term decline that may turn the banking titans into mere shadows of themselves.
"The Japanese authorities can handle an abrupt liquidity crisis," said Kazuhito Ikeo, an economics professor at Keio University. "But I doubt they are capable of handling basic solvency problems. So there could be a gradual meltdown of the Japanese financial system."

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks And the Dollar Finish Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
With markets closed in the United States, stocks were mixed overseas yesterday, while the dollar gained strength against leading European currencies but fell against the Japanese yen. Gold was lower.
In London, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 stocks tumbled eight-tenths of 1 percent. The selloff was led by electricity stocks, which fell after news that the British Government would begin antitrust investigations of proposed takeovers of regional electric companies by two British power companies, Powergen P.L.C. and National Power P.L.C. 
 In Frankfurt, the DAX stock index was unchanged from Wednesday, and in Paris, the CAC-40 index fell four-tenths of 1 percent.
Markets in Japan were closed for Labor Thanksgiving Day.
On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the 300-stock composite index rose 13.45 points, to 4,672.3. In Mexico City, the IPC index was up about 1.4 percent from Wednesday's close.
The dollar strengthened against the German mark, helped by speculation about a cut in German interest rates, which would make the dollar more attractive to investors. The monetary policy committee of Germany's central bank will meet next Thursday.
In London, the dollar fetched 1.4135 marks, up from 1.4057 late Wednesday. The dollar bought 100.66 Japanese yen, down from 101.62.
Other late dollar rates in London, compared with Wednesday: 1.1410 Swiss francs, up from 1.1350; 4.8674 French francs, up from 4.8500; 1,593.50 Italian lire, up from 1,589.50, and 1.3541 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3532.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5635, down from $1.5645 late Wednesday.
The Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar. In Mexico City trading, 7.6150 pesos fetched a dollar. Late Wednesday, the rate was 7.6650 pesos to the dollar.
Gold closed in London at $382.70 an ounce, down $1.70. In Zurich, gold fell $1.90 to end at $382.60. In Hong Kong, it fell $2.74, to $382.02.

HEADLINE: A Canadian Diamond in the Rough

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Prospectors for a small company in Vancouver, British Columbia, did not find the diamonds they were searching for in Labrador in September 1993, but they did stumble on something else: a vast cache of nickel. And almost overnight, this serendipitous discovery vaulted the company, Diamond Fields Resources Inc., into the ranks of the world's major mining companies.
The discovery, of course, has vastly increased the wealth of the company's founder, a penny-stock promoter named Robert M. Friedland. And it may also help his reputation, for he is in trouble with American authorities after the collapse of one of his earlier enterprises. He faces a possible civil suit from the Environmental Protection Agency over toxic waste that was left behind. 
 For Diamond Fields, growth has been swift. In less than a year, on the strength of what is expected to become one of the world's biggest and lowest-cost nickel mines, its market capitalization has soared from $100 million to $3 billion.
By the end of the decade, the mine near Voisey Bay in Labrador could be producing at least 133 million pounds of nickel a year, or 8 percent of the world's consumption. At current prices, that is worth more than $500 million. "A field of dreams," exulted the normally reserved Canadian investment house, Nesbitt Burns, projecting that the mine may hold as much as 150 million tons of nickel, which is used mainly for stainless steel.
Added Douglas Leishman, a geologist and senior mining analyst of Yorkton Securities of Vancouver: "This is the ultimate discovery. Only in my wildest imagination did I think the story would develop as it has."
No doubt Mr. Friedland never imagined such a turn of events, either. The boyish-faced 45-year-old promoter, who started Diamond Fields in 1993, moved from Vancouver to Singapore last year to expand the Asian operations of his personal holding company, the Ivanhoe Capital Corporation. He came into the sights of American authorities after the 1992 collapse of one of his earlier ventures, Galactic Resources Inc.
Mr. Friedland had been chairman and president of that beleaguered gold company, which from 1986 to 1992 operated a mine at Summitville in the mountains of southwestern Colorado.
When the E.P.A. came on the scene in the winter of 1992, it said it found an environmental disaster. Cyanide and copper waste had seeped into streams that feed the Alamosa River, which nourishes the rich San Luis farming valley near the New Mexico border.
Eleanor Dwight, a spokeswoman at the E.P.A.'s Denver office, said the agency had already spent $70 million to try to restore the land and decontaminate the water and expected the total bill to hit $120 million.
The E.P.A. is collecting data for a possible civil suit against Mr. Friedland as part of its cost-recovery efforts. Nancy Mangone, an enforcement attorney at the Denver office, said, "My hope is the Voisey Bay discovery will improve our chances of getting some money because it may be a source of funds for Friedland of any judgment we get against him."
A Federal grand jury in Denver has just handed up an indictment against Galactic and two of its executives who stand accused of multiple violations of the Clean Water Act.
The indictment did not name Mr. Friedland, but the grand jury investigation is continuing "concerning the Summitville mine in all its aspects," said Ken Fimberg, an assistant United States attorney in Denver.
Mr. Friedland, who holds both American and Canadian citizenship and is a graduate of Reed College in Portland, Ore., with a degree in political science, said the charges against the two Galactic executives -- Samye Buckner, the general manager, and Thomas Chisholm, the environmental manager -- "remain to be proven."
"I have seen no evidence that these violations took place," he said.
In any case, he added in an interview, the accusations "recite a chain of events that took place after I ceased all association with the company." He also stressed he had "no operating role in the company whatsoever."
Galactic ceased operations in late 1992. Mr. Friedland, who had been controlling shareholder, resigned as president in February 1990 and as chairman that June.
Rolling the dice has always been part of the international minerals business. According to a brochure of his Ivanhoe holding company, Mr. Friedland has raised more than $500 million of venture capital for enterprises with mining, oil and gas, real estate and other interests in more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, and North and South America.
But elsewhere, the dice have been less than generous. Vengold Inc., another of his enterprises, plunged from a 1994 high of $16.25 to less than $2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after exploration prospects in Venezuela were reported below expectations.
No one expected the new Klondike at Voisey Bay, halfway up Labrador's east coast, which has catapulted Diamond Field shares from less than $1 a year ago -- adjusted for a four-for-one split in September -- to its current $25.875.
The discovery, which has made Diamond Fields the best-performing equity this year on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is also pumping nearly $100 million a year into one of Canada's most economically depressed regions. "We are seeing increased employment and spinoffs to hotel, aircraft and other service companies," said Dr. Rex Gibbons, Minister of Natural Resources in Newfoundland, which includes Labrador.
Much more money could be on the way. Diamond Fields and its partners contemplate an investment of up to $1 billion in a new mining mill complex and associated smelting and refining plants.
Government environmental and other regulators would have to approve the projects. Also needed is consent of the native Inuit and Innu people who are concerned about maintaining traditional ways of life and the ecology of the region -- a place where the bears and the caribou roam.
The Teck Corporation, a $550 million (Canadian) a year Vancouver-based mining company, bought 10 percent of Diamond Fields shares last April for $108 million (Canadian). The International Nickel Company, or Inco, made a deal in June.
Inco is spending $700 million (Canadian) to acquire 30 percent of Diamond Fields' Voisey Bay deposit. Inco gets 25 percent directly through the issuance to Diamond Fields of $525 million of 6.5 percent preferred shares, convertible into 13.3 million Inco shares. Conversion would give Diamond Fields an 11 percent equity interest in Inco, making it the largest single stockholder.
Inco, based in Toronto, also agreed to acquire 7 percent of Diamond Fields shares, which works out to a 5 percent stake in the deposit, making it the fifth-largest Diamond Fields shareholder. Mr. Friedland, with 13 percent, is the largest.
The Vengold and Galactic experiences delayed institutional acceptance of the breadth of the Voisey Bay discovery.
"There was such a bad taste in people's mouths that some firms still won't even write a recommendation for Diamond Fields," noted Dorothy Atkinson, senior mining analyst at Pacific International Securities of Vancouver.
But she added: "I personally think Friedland has rehabilitated his reputation. He has a world-class deposit which will have terrific cash flows."
Bob Purcell, manager of Inco's corporate public relations, commented: "We consider Bob Friedland a really smart cookie. That's apparent from his track record. He's told everyone he wants environmental perfection on this project, and that's what we want too."

HEADLINE: Investments Abroad Reach Record Pace

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
American corporations, flush with record profits, are investing far more abroad than ever before -- buying companies, building factories and opening offices and stores.
Direct investment abroad reached $33 billion for the first six months of 1995, according to the Commerce Department. This $66 billion annual pace represents a 47 percent jump from last year and a 27 percent increase from the record year, 1993. 
 The resurgence in American spending overseas has reversed a long imbalance. Throughout the 1980's, foreign direct investment in the United States, especially in real estate and corporations, vastly outpaced American investment abroad. But the tide turned in 1991, and American spending has been greater every year since.
Some of these investments have resulted in the shutting of American factories. But economists and the companies making the investments hail the foreign expansion as a testament to American efficiency.
American companies are leading a global investment boom fueled by worldwide economic growth, especially in developing nations. Formerly protected markets have opened, and state-owned enterprises have been put up for sale. Countries that until recently regarded multinational corporations as pirates coming ashore now let American companies drill their oil wells, grill their hamburgers and even bury their dead.
While Western Europe still gets most of the money, the flow is increasing most rapidly into Asia and Latin America and has more than doubled to the developing world's four leading recipients -- Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and Indonesia -- from just three years ago.
Even regional telephone companies and electric utilities, once the local yokels of American business, have joined the corporate jet set to scour the world for new markets.
Since the late 1980's, U S West has gone from handling local calls in 14 states to providing cellular telephone service, cable television, international call switching, telephone directories, standard telephone service and advanced wireless communications in Hungary, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Britain, Lithuania, France, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Slovakia, Poland, Japan, Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands and India.
"American telecommunications companies are some of the best in the world," said Charles M. Lillis, chief executive of the U S West Media Group, which includes foreign operations. In other countries, he said, "one of the big benefits is enormous growth opportunities in businesses we know very well."
Japan, despite its economic slowdown, is also attracting billions in new American investment, reflecting some success in efforts to pry open that nation's markets. But investment in China, with its uncertain political outlook and its frequent flouting of American intellectual-property rights, has slowed.
Although United States companies have been investing abroad since America itself was an emerging market in the early 19th century, economists say that even adjusting for inflation, the latest surge has been unmatched.
American companies have already transformed themselves into some of the world's most efficient, lowest-cost producers of goods and services, regaining their lead in many high-technology fields. They have also bolstered profits at home by cutting jobs and installing the latest technology, said Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor and consultant.
"Now, the hot topic around board rooms is, 'How can we grow?' Many companies are seeing foreign expansion as the best avenue," Mr. Porter said.
While corporate mergers and acquisitions within the United States are often merely transfers of control, he said, American companies can use foreign acquisitions as bridgeheads for larger market invasions.
Though the United States is leading the charge, investments are rising around the world. Total direct foreign investment by all countries -- excluding portfolio investment, which brings no direct management or control -- rose 9 percent last year, to a record $226 billion, from $208 billion in 1993, according to United Nations figures.
One of the favorite targets is the United States. Direct investment in this country totaled $28 billion in the first half of this year, a $56 billion annual pace that would be the strongest in this decade. But adjusted for inflation, investments in the late 1980's exceeded today's pace. Still, although economists caution that investment figures can be distorted by shifting exchange rates and the timing of major transactions, most believe the latest surge is part of a long-term trend. "Everybody's into a less protectionist, more deregulatory mode," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade economist at Columbia University. "Our firms are in a position to move in."
Most of the factories American companies are building abroad are meant to capture foreign customers, who account for an increasing share of the companies' sales and profits. "The single most prominent reason for people investing in a market is as a base for selling into that market," said Lewis Alexander, the Commerce Department's chief economist.
Many companies that were shorebound just a few years ago are now, in the face of saturated markets and increasing competition at home, looking abroad. This month, the Central and South West Corporation, an electric utility based in Dallas, agreed to pay $2.6 billion for Seeboard P.L.C., a British utility. Also this month, Texas Utilities completed a $1.6 billion agreement to buy Eastern Energy from the Australian Government.
Other service providers, having jammed practically every available shopping strip and highway exit in the United States with their fast-food restaurants, video stores and fashion shops, now want to share Big Macs, blue jeans and American movies with more foreigners. In September, Gap Inc., the clothing retailer, opened its first two stores in Japan. Blockbuster, the movie-video chain owned by Viacom Inc., announced plans recently to nearly triple the number of its foreign outlets by the year 2000, to 4,000 from 1,400 today. The expansion is expected to double the foreign share of its total sales to 30 percent from 15 percent today and to bolster revenues for Hollywood studios.
McDonald's is also counting on foreign demand for most of its growth this year, cracking markets in Malta and Jamaica and in the former Soviet bloc countries of Slovakia and Estonia. It plans to open 2,300 restaurants this year, 30 percent more than last year, with two-thirds of them overseas.
Several major oil companies have been concentrating their investment in new rigs, refineries and gas stations abroad, although there is some evidence that this is beginning to slow.
As American oil supplies play out and environmental restrictions curb drilling, Exxon executives like to say that their prospects at home are limited by acts of God and acts of Congress. Instead, the company looks for oil under the remote Tarim Basin of China and beneath the seas off Malaysia. As foreign energy demand grows more rapidly than domestic need, Exxon is also speeding investments to sell gas and refined oil in emerging markets like Thailand, Singapore and Eastern Europe.
While Exxon's domestic capital and exploration spending fell 7.5 percent, to $1.3 billion, over the first nine months of this year, foreign spending rose 18 percent, to $4.8 billion. "It only makes sense for Exxon to select its investments from among the most attractive available on a worldwide basis," said Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's chairman, at the company's annual meeting this year.
Direct foreign investments do put Americans out of work when companies take advantage of low wages abroad to build factories and then ship goods back into the United States. Reduced trade barriers, especially with Mexico, have helped companies like Allied Signal, Farah and General Electric shift jobs to Mexico this year.
American companies, which invested $3.3 billion in Mexico last year, backed off after the peso crisis started in December, and they spent only $142 million in the first quarter of this year. But with the cost of Mexican labor and plants suddenly much cheaper because of the Mexican currency's crash, American investment bounced back to $885 million in the second quarter, equal to last year's rate.
Economists say the current American investment drive is especially impressive because it coincides with a relatively weak dollar, which would be expected to increase the cost of doing business overseas.
"There is no question that relative competitiveness of international firms is what drives foreign investment," said Edward Montgomery Graham, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research center. "A few years ago it became downright fashionable to talk about the declining competitiveness of U.S. industry and how we were being annihilated by the Japanese. But there has been a resurgence of U.S. competitive strength."
American makers of computer chips, seemingly on the verge of succumbing to the Japanese a few years ago, find few barriers to their global ambitions. Motorola, with 60 percent of its sales abroad, up from 56 percent last year, announced in September a $720 million plant expansion, primarily to make semiconductors, in Tianjin, China. In October, Intel announced plans to build a $1.6 billion plant to make flash memory devices in Israel, a $1.5 billion plant to make microprocessors in Ireland and a plant to make computer components in Malaysia.
American companies' quest for foreign customers does not even stop at the cemetery gates. Service Corporation International, the world's largest chain of funeral homes and cemeteries, announced in July that it was buying Europe's largest funeral business from Lyonnaise des Eaux of France for $423 million. The year before, Service Corporation bought two chains in Britain, becoming the largest owner of funeral homes there. The European funeral business, the company explained both times, had never seen the sort of efficiencies and competitive zeal that Service Corporation brought to the United States.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, the Inflow of Mexicans Seems to Slow

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Victor Covarrubias knows Mexico's northern border well. He has waded the Rio Grande here many times, slipping past the Border Patrol as he heads north to America's pepper harvests or construction sites where $6 an hour is 15 times what he can earn back home.
But this week Mr. Covarrubias, who has crossed the border at many different points, found that it has changed. For several days, he tried to cross the river from Juarez into El Paso, only to have American agents block his advance again and again. Finally he hired a coyote, a people-smuggler who promised to lead him across the river along a secret route and put him on a plane to Dallas for $400. But that was a swindle, and although Mr. Covarrubias did finally make it to the United States, agents detained him before he got close to his plane. 
Although thousands of illegal migrants still cross parts of America's 2,000-mile southwest border virtually unhindered, others are finding that since enforcement has been tightened along some key stretches, it is no longer an easy matter. It has become so difficult to breach the border south of Juarez or San Diego, which until recently accounted for 60 percent of illegal crossings, that after repeated failures, some migrants, like Mr. Covarrubias, have exhausted their resources. And thousands of other Mexicans are now weighing a complex equation of transportation costs, wages and logistical risks before trying to migrate north.
A recent study by Jorge A. Bustamante, a prominent Mexican demographer, concluded that despite Mexico's wrenching depression, illegal immigration to the United States decreased somewhat this year because tightened enforcement greatly increased the costs.
The study appears to support an assumption underlying a crackdown by the Immigration and Naturalization Service: If the authorities make illegal border crossings sufficiently difficult and costly, some people will quit trying.
"As long as there are huge wage disparities between Mexico and the United States, you'll have a continuing flow," said Robert Bach, an executive associate commissioner at the I.N.S. "But what Bustamante is showing, and what we believe, is that our increased enforcement has begun to tip the economic balance. For many workers, it's become too expensive to come north."
Several respected researchers dispute Dr. Bustamante's conclusions. Frank D. Bean, a demographer at the University of Texas at Austin, for instance, has concluded that in the last year not only Mexico's economic crisis but also strong job growth in the United States have helped increase illegal border crossings, though he adds, "It's not the mammoth phenomenon that some people are saying it is."
About 40 percent of the illegal Mexican migrants apprehended each year have tried to cross from Tijuana, south of San Diego; 20 percent have come from Juarez. Until recently, these borders were out of control, with thousands of migrants racing across the line each day and American agents pursuing them through railroad sidings and suburban patios.
Two years ago, however, the Border Patrol put 400 agents at 100-yard intervals for 22 miles along the border in the area of El Paso, forming a virtual human barricade.
One year ago, along the border running east from Imperial Beach, Calif., the authorities built a 14-mile steel fence, installing searchlights and motion detectors and fielding hundreds of new agents.
This year, new agents have also been deployed south of Tucson. With $236 million in additional funds in the fiscal year that ended on Oct. 1, the Border Patrol increased the number of agents along the 2,000-mile line from Brownsville, Tex., to Imperial Beach to about 5,000 from under 4,000.
But even as the Border Patrol has offered new deterrents, the Mexican and American economies have provided powerful incentives for migrants to go north. Last December's peso devaluation cut Mexican wages in half and threw millions of Mexicans out of work, and 1995 has seen a surge in American job growth.
In the wake of these factors, the number of illegal migrants apprehended by the Border Patrol surged by 30 percent, from 979,101 in the fiscal year 1994 to 1,271,390 in 1995. But how to interpret the increase?
For nearly two decades, the relationship between the number of illegal migrants apprehended and the number seeking to cross appeared straightforward, because the Border Patrol's size and tactics were consistent. Now, however, demographers are divided about whether the increase in migrants apprehended should be interpreted as a swell in illegal migration, or in the beefed-up Border Patrol. Further complicating the analysis, agents seize and count thousands of the same illegal immigrants many times.
Dr. Bustamante's study is not based on I.N.S. statistics. For eight years, he and other demographers at Mexico's Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a Tijuana-based research group, have carried out weekly interviews with migrants at crossing sites in Tijuana, Mexicali, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, and in 1993, they began a parallel survey at several northern cities.
Using the random-sample techniques of a household survey, Dr. Bustamante estimates the flow of undocumented migrants crossing the border. In the first three months of this year, he concluded in a recent study, the northward flow declined by about 9 percent, compared with the same period in 1994. The reason, he said, was that migration costs, including bus and airplane tickets to northern cities, have increased, and breaching the border has become so difficult that many migrants now pay hundreds of dollars to coyotes.
"It's overwhelmingly clear that the number of undocumented migrants has declined," Dr. Bustamante said. "Costs have risen, and that's largely due to the increase in the numbers of border agents."
Another factor dampening the flow may be the political climate in the United States as it is portrayed in Mexico; lately it has seemed openly hostile to immigrants.
"Five-Year Prison Terms for Illegals!" screamed the Diario de Juarez's headline on Sunday for an article about a proposal by Republican legislators to increase prison terms for recidivist illegal immigrants who are using false documents.
Thomas J. Espenshade, a Princeton University demographer, expressed skepticism that stepped-up enforcement has had any significant impact. "A short-term decline is not out of the question, but my guess is that it wouldn't be a permanent reduction," he said. "It's a pretty porous border."
Neverthless, many potential migrants are weighing the risks carefully. In Mr. Covarrubias's case, he and his wife were barely supporting their four daughters when in September he was laid off from his job in a tire factory 375 miles south of the border. When an old friend called from Dallas with news of a job in an auto-body shop and wired him $500 for travel costs, Mr. Covarrubias boarded a bus to Juarez.
After the coyote took his money, Mr. Covarrubias waded the river into the United States southeast of Juarez, but he was detained hours later. He looked a bit dazed when he was deported back across the bridge into Juarez last week.
"Put in your story that of every five who try to cross, only one gets through!" Mr. Covarrubias said.

HEADLINE: Watches That Time Hasn't Forgotten

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Imagine a new car powered by a steam engine -- a superb steam engine built from modern materials, but still a variation on a 19th-century design. Imagine that the car is a delight to the eye, but hardly up to modern performance standards. Now imagine that it is manufactured in limited numbers, priced at $10 million and heavily advertised with the hope of attracting conspicuous consumers, speculative investors and collectors with nostalgia for a time when they understood how machines worked.
Hardly a viable marketing strategy, you say? A nearly identical one is working nicely for the dozen or so Swiss companies that are using computerized design systems and space-age materials to create outrageously expensive mechanical timepieces in an age of cheap, accurate quartz watches. Indeed, while most high-end watchmakers, including Audemars Piguet, Breguet, Patek Philippe, Rolex and Vacheron Constantin, do not make their earnings public, all are apparently doing very, very well after near-death experiences in the early 1980's. 
 Sales of the watches are expected to be strong enough, in fact, to qualify as one of the few bright spots for retailers in what seems to be shaping up as a dreary holiday season. Many shoppers, concerned about new rounds of job cuts and other economic problems, appear to be watching their purchases more closely than usual. But the sharp rise in the stock market has added to a feeling of good cheer among the affluent, leading to bullish projections for expensive goodies, including the old-style watches.
The sales of 11 members of Montres et Bijoux Geneve, the trade association for the high-end mechanical watchmakers, represent just 7 percent of the watch production of Switzerland. But in 1994, they generated 40 percent of the country's $7 billion in earnings from watch exports, which have tripled since 1981. Indeed, the market for expensive mechanical watches is so hot that Blancpain, a defunct brand until its trademark was purchased for just $15,000 in 1982, was sold only 10 years later to SMH, the conglomerate that makes Swatches, for $65 million.
"This is an extremely profitable industry," confirms Roland Schild, a consultant to Montres et Bijoux Geneve.
It was not always so for the industry, now a fabulous anachronism built on craft, snobbery and the expectation that anything rare and beautiful will become more valuable.
Quartz watches, introduced in the 1970's by two Japanese manufacturers, the Seiko Corporation and the Citizen Watch Company, rapidly made inroads into the near-monopoly of Swiss watchmakers. Swiss brands that had dominated the middle and upper-middle portions of the world market -- notably Tissot and Omega -- reacted late and never recaptured the initiative.
Eventually, most high-end Swiss manufacturers offered their own quartz movements to supplement their lines of mechanical watches. And in 1979, the Swiss impressed the world with the Concord Delirium, an expensive quartz watch less than one-tenth of an inch thick that was widely seen as the industry's means of reinventing itself.
"By 1980, people thought the mechanical watch was dead," said Joe Thompson, editor of Modern Jeweler, an American trade publication.
But a number of factors kept the upper end of the mechanical market alive.
One was stubbornness. Rolex, a large Geneva-based watchmaker owned by a charitable foundation, chose to continue depending primarily on mechanical movements. In effect, the company was forced to move to the high end of the market, as the middle became the exclusive domain of quartz. However, canny marketing emphasizing quality and ruggedness -- not to mention the idea that anyone who could afford a Rolex had arrived -- gave the company an identity that no other men's watch had provided since the Omega in the 1950's. "Sticking with mechanical watches was a risk for Rolex, but a very good risk," Mr. Schild concluded.
Another factor was technology. The innards of any mechanical watch made in 1995 would have been understood by a watchmaker in 1895. But some of the materials, notably light, super-strong titanium, would have been foreign. So would the machine tools capable of forming minuscule parts with far greater precision. And the computer programs used to design watches with more functions that fit into smaller spaces would have seemed miraculous. Thus, once the decision was made to stick with mechanical designs, technology made it possible to sustain the "dazzle" factor at acceptable costs.
But neither technology nor marketing genius probably would have saved the mechanical watch without a third phenomenon in play: collectibility. While there had long been a market for antique pocket watches and clocks, the wristwatch was viewed as too new and too common to rate as a collectible. Indeed, in Sotheby's first auction, in 1980, six fine watches fetched a measly total of $16,000.
But perceptions changed rapidly in the mid-1980's. This was due in part to a scarcity of new mechanical watches at a time when all manner of nostalgia items were finding their way into auctions. Daryn Schnipper, a senior vice president at Sotheby's and the house's expert on watches, thinks the boom was prompted by a rumor that Patek Philippe, the high end of the high end, was dropping out of the business.
The boom, however, was no fluke. In 1985, a Patek Philippe watch made in 1955 sold for $159,000 at Christie's in Geneva. And once the idea was firmly planted that mechanical watches were collectible, the companies with grand old names began emphasizing the inherent scarcity of hand-finished watches.
"The luxury watchmakers took a second look and asked, 'What can we do to catch up with the secondhand market?' " Ms. Schnipper recalled. The answer was a revival of the tradition of making mechanical watches with extra features -- perpetual calendars, stopwatch mechanisms, moon phase indicators, hour-and-minute chimes and the like, which watchmakers call "complications." In 1989, Patek Philippe produced the Calibre '89, a softball-sized "watch" with 900 parts and 33 complications that sold for $2.7 million and sent collectors into a frenzy.
Mechanical watches with multiple complications -- and prices of $50,000 to $100,000 -- are now the rage, in part because they effectively guarantee to collectors that the models will be made in small numbers, in part because they are fabulous toys for the rich. So are so-called skeleton watches -- the back and front of which are made from clear crystal, with the design of the movement permitting light to pass through. "We had high tech," Mr. Thompson of Modern Jeweler suggested. "Now we have high mech."
While the simplest versions of the high-end mechanical watches can be purchased for $5,000 to $20,000 directly from the jewelry shop display, watches with multiple complications generally must be ordered months or years in advance. "With some models, we simply buy as many as we can get," explained Anthony D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau Inc., the biggest retailer of high-end mechanical watches in the United States.
Rodolphe Schulthess, the director of marketing for Breguet, said that making the watches only after they had been ordered was good business practice in part because it kept inventory costs to a minimum. In part, too, the scarcity is linked to a dearth of watchmakers.
But mostly, scarcity is a marketing device to validate collectors' speculation that unique watches will appreciate rapidly.
From a distance, the high end of the watch market looks like a single business. Close up, it is plain that the companies have strikingly different strategies.
Rolex, which will make 750,000 watches this year -- 50 times as many as Audemars Piguet -- sells what Mr. Thompson calls "mass class." Most of the watches have relatively simple movements housed in superbly finished steel or gold cases. However, if you insist on paying more than $20,000 for a Rolex, the company will oblige: clad in platinum and studded with diamonds and sapphires, the watches can have retail prices of well over $100,000.
Patek Philippe, which dominates the collectors' market, is known for conservative -- even austere -- designs. Its simplest watches are still available for less than $10,000. But the company has moved rapidly to exploit its identity, offering an array of skeleton watches and models with multiple complications for up to $900,000.
Vacheron Constantin, which dates from 1755 but was purchased by Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani of Saudi Arabia in 1987, boasts the most impressive enameling, a process known to only a few dozen Swiss workers. The enameling can add months to manufacturing time and tens of thousands of dollars to the price. Breguet, founded by the acknowledged genius of 19th-century watch design, Abraham-Louis Breguet, and now owned by Investcorp, a group of Arab investors, is the master of complications.
One company, Chopard, in contrast to all the others, aims its products specifically at women. Its watches are meant to be jewelry as much as timepieces. Indeed, the company is known for "happy diamonds" -- watches with loose precious stones between the crystal and the face.
Perhaps the most striking marketing story, though, is Blancpain, which, in Ms. Schnipper's words, "rose from the ashes." Advertised as Switzerland's oldest brand, but not seen in stores for decades, the watches reappeared in jewelry stores only in the mid-1980's. The resurrected company caught the wave perfectly with the slogan "since 1735 there has never been a Blancpain quartz watch and never will be." And it has exploited new technology to specialize in celebrations of old technology: Blancpain has sold nine of its "1735" models -- big, 800-part watches that do everything but brew coffee. The current price is $800,000.
Can expensive mechanical watches keep flying high? While skeptics wonder how many people will pay more for a watch than for a Mercedes-Benz, the champions of the high end say the potential market has barely been scratched.
"Men who wear $1,000 suits and $200 shoes are just beginning to see watches as fashion statements," Mr. D'Ambrosio suggested.

HEADLINE: Drug Crackdown Is Believed to Sap Colombia's Economy

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Nov. 22

 BODY:
As the authorities arrest leaders of the Cali drug cartel, seize their properties, close their bank accounts and destroy cocaine-processing laboratories, the organization is facing an economic crisis that many say has affected sectors of the national economy.
In recent weeks, investigations into donations by drug traffickers to President Ernesto Samper's 1994 campaign, have caused nervousness among investors and sharp declines in the stock market. While the trends have been attributed by some to Mr. Samper's difficulties, others say the weakening of the cartel cannot be ignored as a factor. In any event, drug power and drug money seem to be the root of the uncertainty. 
 Calculating the impact of the drug trade on the economy is difficult, economists and officials say.
Salomon Kalmanovitz, co-director of Colombia's Central Bank and the author of a study on the effects of drug trafficking on Colombia's economy, estimates that before the Government crackdown, drug trafficking brought in $3.5 billion a year or 5 percent of the gross domestic product of almost $70 billion.
Doug Wankel, chief of operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration, says that $4.5 billion to $7 billion is a conservative estimate of drug money in the Colombian economy. He said 80 to 90 percent of that comes from the Cali cartel.
Over the years, drug traffickers have become the country's largest land owners, with more than seven million acres of farmland, giving them control of entire regions.
But crackdowns have created a shortage of dollars within the cartel, and since August, cartel members have been selling real estate in areas including Cali for cash. At the same time, the peso has lost more than 7 percent of its dollar value because of the scarcity of dollars.
"One of the real factors that have pressured the devaluation of the peso has been the suspension of part of the drug traffickers' income," Mr. Kalmanovitz said.
As demand and prices have fallen, the construction industry, especially in Cali, has entered a recession. An estimated 20 percent of investment in construction in Cali is said to come from drug traffickers.
The selling off of land came a month after several drug lords were arrested and allegations about illegal campaign financing gained strength.
President Clinton last month announced sanctions against more than 40 Colombian companies that have been identified as front organizations for the Cali cartel and measures to prevent United States companies from trading with them.
"It was a strong political message, but there are teeth attached to it," Mr. Wankel said. "A number of American companies and banks have called us concerned about the effects of this law."
Since Mr. Clinton's announcement, both Government and private statements and actions to combat the financial side of the cartels have increased. Recently, the Government won Congressional approval for a law that, for the first time, makes money laundering a felony.
Private banks have closed the accounts of Drogas La Rabaja, one of the country's largest drug store chains and distributors of medical products, which is owned by the children of the Cali cartel's leaders, Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez.
However, opposition to the crackdown is high. Earlier this year, lawmakers nearly succeeded in approving legislation that would protect undeclared income and inhibit prosecution on charges of illicit enrichment.

HEADLINE: Ruthless Ex-Dictator Getting Credit for South Korea's Rise

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
If there is a villain in South Korean history, it might at first seem to be Park Chung Hee, who overthrew a democratic Government and ruled for nearly two decades as a ruthless dictator.
Yet Mr. Park's image these days is improving. While few people deny that he was sometimes brutal, Mr. Park is also increasingly remembered as the architect of the South Korean economic miracle. 
 "We give some credit to Park for economic development, even though politically he had problems," said Lee Shin Bom, a spokesman for the governing Democratic Liberal Party.
One of those political problems was a proclivity for torture, as Mr. Lee discovered first-hand in the 1970's when he was detained and tortured several times. The worst was electric shock treatment, recalled Mr. Lee, who was once arrested for nothing more than possessing an article about Korea clipped from an American newspaper.
Yet Mr. Park, who was assassinated in 1979, today is buried in the national cemetery. A range of political parties send flowers to his grave, and even his old nemesis, Kim Dae Jung, has visited his tomb.
Mr. Kim's tribute is particularly striking because Mr. Park tried to kill him. Mr. Kim, a dissident who ran against Mr. Park for President in 1971, was kidnapped while in Tokyo and apparently would have been executed if it had not been for American intervention.
One of the lessons of Mr. Park's renaissance in public opinion seems to be that the public is willing to forgive a good deal of a leader who presides over an economic boom.
Mr. Park took power when South Korea was barely more prosperous than India, and he oversaw the economic takeoff that has transformed it into a modern industrializing country. Some scholars say he paradoxically contributed enormously to Korean democracy, despite his repression of democracy movements, for he nurtured an economic boom that created the middle class that is the backbone of Korean pluralism today.
To be sure, Mr. Park is hardly hailed as a national hero. There are no statues of him, no schools named for him. The cruelty of his rule is widely acknowledged.
Part of the reassessment of Mr. Park seems to reflect disenchantment with two of his successors as President, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, both of whom have been disgraced for corruption.
"I wouldn't say that there's a broad nostalgia for Park," said Lee Chul, a National Assembly member who as a student democracy leader was sentenced to death by the Park administration. "It's just that the public sees Chun and Roh, and they think that Park was better."
Mr. Park was a brilliant Japanese-trained major general when, in 1961, he overthrew the democratic -- but chaotic -- administration of Prime Minister Chang Myon. That precipitated more than three decades of rule by military leaders.
In 1979, in a dispute over how to handle demonstrations, Mr. Park insisted on using paratroopers to crush the protests. His intelligence director favored a softer line and tried to settle the disagreement by shooting Mr. Park dead.
"We criticized Park Chung Hee because we saw things through the prism of American democracy and human rights," said Lee Young Duk, an editor of the Chosun Ilbo, a major Seoul newspaper. "But if we had had American democracy in the 1960's, would we have achieved this much? Perhaps Park Chung Hee's approach was better suited to the public consciousness of the time."

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
At Nebraska, a Reunion of Sorts

BYLINE: By DOUG SCANCARELLA 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, N.J.

 BODY:
Damian Peter is expecting a happier holiday season this year as he visits his older brothers, Christian and Jason, at the University of Nebraska this week.
Nebraska, college football's No. 1 team, will play Oklahoma at Lincoln today and Damian, who attends Notre Dame, will be watching his brothers play on the defensive line for the unbeaten Cornhuskers. 
 "All three of them, especially Damian, have been looking forward to this week for a very long time," their mother, Mary Peter, said recently. "They're very close, but it's very rare that all three of them are together. It seems like there is always a game."
The Peter family, from Middletown in Monmouth County, didn't think today's reunion would ever take place after what happened last year. Damian, at age 20 the youngest of the brothers, had hoped to follow Christian, who is a senior, and Jason, a sophomore, into major college football. He signed with Notre Dame in the spring of 1994, but his dream was cut short three months later after a swimming pool accident nearly left him paralyzed.
A month before reporting to South Bend, Ind., he stopped by a friend's house in New Jersey to go for a swim. Diving into the pool, he hit his head at the bottom where the shallow end meets the deep end. The initial diagnosis was paralysis from the neck down.
"The first thing that came to my mind was football," Damian said. "I worked all of my life to get a chance to play major college football and then I had some doctor that I didn't even know telling me I could never play again. I was crushed.
"I dove in that pool a million times. This time I just dove out too far. I just blacked out. The next thing I knew, I was in my hospital room."
With his football dreams shattered, Damian spent that season watching Notre Dame and Nebraska play on television. Now, after more than a year of rigorous rehabilitation, Damian is not only on his feet, but back at Notre Dame, which honored his scholarship, attending classes and preparing to play football again.
"Notre Dame has been great," Mary Peter said. "There was never any question that they'd honor the scholarship."
Before the accident, the Peter brothers, all of them about 6 feet 6 inches and 300 pounds, seemed to have it all. Damian graduated from Middletown South High School, a New Jersey power, with honors and was named an all-state offensive lineman as a senior.
Christian, however, has had troubles off the football field while at Nebraska. In 1993, he was charged with sexual assault in Lincoln, the first of three such incidents. He was accused of twice improperly touching a young woman. Blaming an alcohol problem, he pleaded no contest and served 18 months probation. He was also sentenced to 100 hours of community service and instructed to complete an alcohol-treatment program.
Less than six months later he was accused -- but never charged -- with sexually assaulting a nightclub dancer. The authorities said that there was not enough evidence to prosecute.
This past summer a Nebraska student said she had been raped by Christian in 1991. The woman said she did not report the incident for almost four years because she feared retribution. Christian, through a family lawyer, has vehemently denied the accusation.
In 1994, Christian led the Cornhuskers in sacks. This season, with Nebraska looking toward a second consecutive national title, he is second on the team in sacks, fourth in tackles and projected as an early-round National Football League draft choice. Jason is ninth on the team in tackles.
Christian refused to address his problems off the field, saying he has been instructed by the university not to discuss the case.
Meanwhile, Damian has vowed to prove the doctors wrong who said his football career was over.
"The thing that I'll always remember," Christian said, "is that the first thing Damian said when he saw me after the accident was, 'I'm going to play football again.' If any of us can do it, he can. He's the strongest of the three of us."
When Damian wiggled his toes 48 hours after the accident, the prognosis was upgraded from being paralyzed from the neck down to partly paralyzed above the waist. Doctors determined at that point that Damian had suffered a severe bruise to the spine and temporary paralysis.
Although it is doubtful that a person can return to the football field after sustaining such an injury, one can regain mobility in the legs and arms and carry on a normal life.
While Damian knows the odds are high, he has vowed to play for the Fighting Irish.
"The progress he's made has been incredible," his mother said. "From where he was, to where he is today, is world's apart. In the end, though, it'll be the doctors' decision."
Damian is taking a full load of classes, majoring in economics. He lifts weights daily, runs, does neck exercises and works out on the football field, hoping to return for spring workouts.
"Next spring is the most realistic goal," he said. "Every day I keep working out with the hope of suiting up. Some people have told me to be thankful that I've recovered to where I am and not try to push it by playing football. But that's not me. I have to be out on the field doing what I love.
"I try not to look back and monitor my day-to-day progress. My goal is to play football. I just work day today to reach that goal. I'm getting encouragement from my family and my teammates."

HEADLINE: Oil and Wildlife Just Don't Mix

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Open Alaska's Wildlife Refuge" (Op-Ed, Nov. 20): Alaska's Governor, Tony Knowles, is living in a fantasy land created by the big oil companies and their puppets in Alaska's Congressional delegation. 
 When considering oil drilling in a great untouched wilderness, there is no such thing as doing it right. Wilderness and an industrial zone cannot by definition exist together; any intrusion can be felt for many miles.
To say it has been done right at Prudhoe Bay is disingenuous: Grizzly bears and wolves have been killed, driven away or become addicted to garbage. Removal of predators and a hunting ban allowed a growth spurt in the caribou herd, but its birth rate is now declining. The oil fields spew as much of some air pollutants as the District of Columbia. The pipeline is in such shoddy condition that it is too dangerous to inspect.
As for reducing the deficit, to reach the dream revenues Governor Knowles quoted, leases would have to sell for as much as 40 times the price of adjacent, far-lower-risk offshore leases.
As for the United States Treasury's receiving half of any revenues -- which are highly unlikely considering the low odds that economically recoverable oil is present -- you reported Nov. 11 that Representative Don Young and Senator Ted Stevens have said the state will get the refuge opened with a 50-50 revenue split and sue later for its full 90 percent share.
This is one small example of the dishonesty of this whole drilling campaign.
Though the area to be drilled is a small percentage of the refuge, even the Reagan Interior Department called it the "biological heart" and "center of wildlife activity" for the entire refuge. Don't let the Alaskan marauders destroy this last great wilderness.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A Plain-Speaking Conservative

 BODY:
This 60-second commercial is one of nine that Steve Forbes is broadcasting in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states.
ON THE SCREEN -- Close-up photographs of Mr. Forbes with Ronald Reagan, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and his family, and then Mr. Forbes speaks to the camera. 
 PRODUCER -- Our Town Films, Paul Sanderson.
SCRIPT -- Announcer: "He's been called a champion of economic growth and a visionary. He is Steve Forbes, and under his leadership Forbes magazine has become the most successful business magazine in the world. A conservative leader, he devised the bold tax cut plan for New Jersey that is creating new jobs and economic growth. He was appointed by Ronald Reagan to lead Radio Free Europe, which played a crucial role in the fall of Communism. He and Sabina, his wife of 24 years, are raising five daughters."
Mr. Forbes: "I'm Steve Forbes. America has the potential for the greatest economic boom and spiritual renewal in our history. But we're being held back by Washington politics as usual. It's time we move forward. Start with a low flat tax, put term limits on politicians and restore control of our schools to parents. Let's return opportunity to all Americans. Do that and our best days are ahead."
Announcer: "Steve Forbes for President. A true vision, an honest voice."
ACCURACY -- This commercial includes some hyperbole. While Mr. Forbes runs a successful magazine, it grew mostly under his father, the late Malcolm Forbes. Mr. Forbes did help devise the Whitman tax cut, but it is not solely responsible for the state's growth. Scholars debate whether Radio Free Europe played a major role in the fall of Communism.
SCORECARD -- The commercial introduces Mr. Forbes as a plain-speaking conservative who has accomplished more than running a magazine, and it succeeds in connecting him to issues that are popular among primary voters.

HEADLINE: Making Volunteerism Easier For Busy Workers of Today

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 24

 BODY:
From Atlanta and Miami to San Diego and Seattle, a new brand of youthful volunteerism is flourishing, nurtured largely by a network of organizations devoted to providing varied and flexible opportunities for busy young professionals to serve their communities.
The movement began in 1986 in a living room on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where six friends gathered to discuss their frustrations with established volunteer agencies in New York City. Their meeting led to the formation of New York Cares, a clearinghouse designed to connect service-minded New Yorkers with dozens of projects around the city. 
 Nine years later, New York Cares has a mailing list of 13,000 volunteers, and its model has been replicated in 26 cities. The groups report a total membership of more than 75,000 people, most of them 25 to 45 years old, and they have created a national umbrella organization, known as City Cares of America, to help form new groups and spread successful ideas.
Experts on philanthropy credit the network with countering a declining interest in volunteerism among young working Americans who seem to have neither the time nor the inclination to serve their communities.
The groups make charity work attractive to such people by simplifying the process of volunteering and removing the concept of guilt. If someone wakes up on a Saturday morning in a mood to help paint an elementary school, all he or she has to do is show up. If he has to head into the office, or chooses to play tennis instead, no one calls to harangue him.
"We don't put the kind of restraints on people that other places do by saying you have to volunteer two hours a week," said Kathy Behrens, executive director of New York Cares. "We want you to volunteer when you're able."
That is what lured Sarah L. Zimmerman, 34, to Hands On Atlanta five years ago, when she moved here to take a job as the associate director of news and information for the Southern Baptist Home Mission Board.
"I travel a lot for work, and I don't want to make a commitment to be someplace the third Friday of every month," Ms. Zimmerman said while sorting cans of creamed corn and tomato soup at a food bank on a recent evening. "If I don't show up for a month, no one's going to think that I let them down."
With such flexibility, the charity network is tapping the energies of an age group that began to turn away from volunteerism in the late 1970's and early 80's, as women joined the work force and young people delayed marriage and family life, said Virginia A. Hodgkinson, vice president for research at Independent Sector, a Washington group that encourages philanthropy and volunteerism.
"Usually, if you're a parent, you have schools and churches and other organizations that start you volunteering," Ms. Hodgkinson said. "But there really weren't enough vehicles for these young professionals until these groups brought them into the community. If we hadn't had them, we may really have seen a decline."
Instead, adults between 25 and 44 are the most active volunteers, according to Independent Sector. In 1993, for instance, 48 percent of American adults 18 or older said they had volunteered at least once in the past year, while 55 percent of those from the ages of 35 to 44 had volunteered. While volunteerism among all adults has fallen since its peak around 1990, when the recession gave charity work more urgency, volunteerism is at higher levels now than it was in 1988, when Independent Sector began monitoring it.
The emergence of the City Cares network reflects deep changes in society and the world of charity work.
"The person who volunteered in the past doesn't exist anymore," said Philip L. Collyer, executive director of Greater D. C. Cares. "That was an individual who worked in the home and had some extra time. Everybody is working now outside the home and has far less discretionary time. Yet they still have a need and a want to support the community."
Most of the groups are growing rapidly, usually with only word-of-mouth advertising. In the smallest city involved, Greenville, S.C., membership is growing 10 percent per month. Hands On Greenville, which began only 20 months ago, now has 400 members.
At Hands On Atlanta, this month's calendar includes 187 projects, including park cleanups, tutoring programs and soup kitchens. The projects are available on every day of the month -- there were several traditional Thanksgiving dinners for the homeless -- with most scheduled for evenings and weekends for the convenience of working people.
Started in 1989 by a group of 12 friends, Hands On Atlanta now has a $1 million budget, 17 paid staff members and a mailing list of 11,000 volunteers.
They include people like Jill A. Barker, 30, an accountant who spends her Thursday nights running a mentoring program for sixth graders at Paul D. West Middle School in East Point, just south of Atlanta. Last week, her seven charges raced around the library pulling books and magazines off shelves to research articles for a magazine they were producing.
"It's amazing what a little individual attention will do," Ms. Barker said. "Last year, I had a kid who was constantly being suspended from school but would show up for every single Hands On Atlanta meeting."
Kelly Williams, a 12-year-old who was writing an article about computers, explained her interest. "In Atlanta public schools, they need to calm those kids down because it seems like they're not getting an education," Kelly said. "Here you get more help. My mom didn't want to bring me to Hands On Atlanta at first, but I told her it was very important."
The key to the success of the groups is simple. They make volunteering easy, meaningful and fun. Because the groups insist on direct involvement in the community, as opposed to stuffing envelopes or selling raffle tickets, they provide instant gratification for volunteers. The projects also double as singles clubs for the socially conscious and have led to a number of marriages.
"People look forward to it," said Nicole M. Kelly, the founder and executive director of Hands On Greenville, "because they know they're going to see their friends at the Read to Me program this week or they think, 'Maybe I'll see that cute guy at the park cleanup again.' "
To those who contend that such a casual approach diminishes the impact of volunteerism, Ms. Kelly replies that occasional volunteerism is better than none at all.
"There are 400 people at least in Greenville who simply would not volunteer if they did not have this organization," Ms. Kelly said.
The groups provide bridges to community service by designing volunteer projects and advertising them to members in monthly newsletters, or in some cases, by sending volunteers to events conducted by established charities. Many City Cares projects are traditional -- things like soup kitchens, literacy tutoring and housing rehabilitation -- but others fill a void.
San Diego Cares provides moving crews for people with AIDS who have to relocate frequently as their assets diminish. Volunteers at Hands On Miami read bedtime stories to children in shelters. In an annual campaign, New York Cares collects winter coats every December -- 71,000 last year -- for the poor.
The groups raise money from corporations, foundations and individuals, and most now collect about half of their budgets from a single day of mass volunteerism when participants collect pledges for the number of hours they work. About 7,500 people participated in the Hands On Atlanta Day on Oct. 7, raising more than $400,000, said Michelle Nunn, the group's executive director.
Leaders of several of the groups said they had occasionally been treated warily by more established charities, which might view them as competitors for both donations and volunteers. "Ultimately, for the community's good, people will learn to collaborate," said Cori L. Snyder, acting executive director of City Cares of America. "But a little competition is good for everyone."
As the groups continue to grow in size and sophistication, their focus may also broaden, with projects designed more for permanent improvements than short-term relief.
"We're a lot more interested now in systemic change," said Ms. Nunn, 29, the daughter of Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is a longtime proponent of national service for young adults. "Before, it was enough to bring some children to a picnic. Now we want to know whether we can really change people's lives."

DRUG RING TENSIONS SPAWN VIOLENCE
Tensions among some of New York's most powerful Colombian drug rings have spawned a series of murders and kidnappings in Queens, even as violent crime is dropping almost everywhere else in the city, the police and Federal agents say. Coming after the arrests of six of the top seven kingpins of the Cali drug cartel in Colombia, the surge in violence suggests that discipline is eroding in the upper levels of the Colombian cocaine distribution system that supplies New York, New Jersey and much of the Eastern Seaboard. [Page 1.] 

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF AN ABUSED CHILD
 The police said the bruises and scars that covered Alisa Izquierdo's body made clear that she had been physically and sexually abused for some time before she was found dead on Wednesday in her family's apartment on the Lower East Side. Even those who have dealt with many cases of child abuse said the horrific details of her torture had left them shaken and outraged. As her mother, Awilda Lopez, was arraigned on second-degree murder charges, details of Alisa's life and history of abuse began to come into sharper focus. [1.]
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
RICH AND POOR FEEL BUDGET CUTS
 New Yorkers speak in many voices when asked how the city governments' retrenchment has affected them. But interviews with three dozen of them from a variety of economic and social backgrounds produced some significant common threads. Many poor and working-class people said they had seen a sharp decline in services. While many middle-class residents said their lives had changed little because they use few city services, those with children in the public schools shared the concerns of less-affluent New Yorkers. And there were bitter complaints about the subway system. [27.]
 
KICKING THE HABIT OF NEGLECTED HOUSING
 Before she moved to 281 St. Ann's Avenue in the Bronx, Mary Mays led a life in relentless quest for the fleeting nirvana of countless crack dens. But since May she has lived with other recovering addicts in Mott Haven who rely on themselves and each other for the strength to stay sober. But they might have to return to their old ways of living until their landlord fixes the damage from two recent fires and responds to their repeated complaints about crumbling walls, smoky boilers and shoddy repairs. Their landlord is the City of New York. About New York by David Gonzalez. [27.]
 
PURPORTED APHRODISIAC TAKES FOUR LIVES
 Four men in New York City died between January 1993 and this spring and a 17-year-old required hospitalization for an erratic heartbeat when they ate a purported aphrodisiac sold at city grocery stores and tobacco shops, Federal officials said. The substance was supposed to be applied to the genitals but was not labeled, and when the victims ate it, they began vomiting and their hearts beat erratically, the officials said. [26.]
 
REGION
 
BIG CROWDS, LITTLE CASH
 As the holiday shopping season got its official send-off, store managers in the region and around the country were already slashing prices, dressing their employees in animal costumes and generally pulling out all the promotional stops in what is shaping up as the most difficult retailing environment in years. And while the gimmicks may have drawn crowds, they did not seem to draw out much cash. [Business Day, page 37.]

E.P.A. Cuts Inspections As Its Budget Is Reduced
The E.P.A. has canceled hundreds of inspections for pollution because of budget cuts imposed by Congress. Agency officials say the reduction in inspections is likely to intensify if Congress imposes even deeper reductions. A Republican-backed bill would cut spending on environmental enforcement by more than 20 percent. 
 The Republicans say there is not enough money to fix every environmental problem. The argument will be a prominent part of the budget talks between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. [Page 1.]
 
The Dow Sets a Record, Yet Again
Blue-chip stocks advanced to a record high for a third consecutive session, in light trading. The gain was fueled, analysts said, by strong overseas markets and a surge of money into mutual funds. Stocks jumped at the opening and remained in plus territory the whole day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.23 points, to 5,048.84. For the week, the Dow rose 178.47 points. [41.]
 
Better Japanese Bank Earnings
Japan's 11 major commercial banks reported strong increases in earnings for the six months ended Sept. 30, aided by a low cost of funds and lucrative bond trading. But they warned that results would worsen in the second fiscal half, with some banks reporting losses. [38.]
 
Clinton Lists Budget Priorities
The White House readied for next week's budget talks by sending Congress a "set of priniciples" that the President would demand in a balanced-budget agreement. [1.]
 
The Federal deficit fell 27.4 percent in October, the start of the Government's fiscal year, from October 1994. [47.]
 
Treasury Prices Rise
Treasury prices ended higher in a quiet session. Traders took their cue from strong buying in Asia and Europe. The 30-year Treasury bond yielded 6.24 percent, down from 6.27 percent on Wednesday. [47.]
 
Boeing's Profits Motivate Strikers
The real issue at the center of the Boeing strike appears to be a conflict over the workers' share of the company's large profits. On the same day that workers rejected a contract, senior executives became eligible for stock options, in some cases worth $5 million a person. The machinists say they want their share of Boeing's good fortunes. [6.]
 
KFC's Troubles in India
Indian officials closed the first KFC restaurant in New Delhi, after inspectors found two flies in the kitchen. The flies are really an excuse to crack down on KFC, a unit of Pepsico, which has become a lightning rod for Indian economic nationalism. [4.]
 
New York City Unions Divided
New York City's municipal labor unions are bitterly divided over an agreement that would cover 140,000 non-uniformed city workers, and the leaders of three of the largest union locals vow to fight ratification. [25.]
 
Counting on 100 Million People
The 34th Street Partnership in Manhattan is trying to attract new businesses by establishing that 100 million people do indeed visit Herald Square each year. [25.]

Dollar Ends Week Stronger
The dollar edged higher against leading currencies, settling at 101.41 Japanese yen and 1.4193 German marks. [40.]
 
Corn Prices Surge
Corn prices surged in Chicago after the Government reported larger-than-expected weekly export sales, suggesting that rising prices were not deterring foreign buyers. [40.]

HEADLINE: To Tally Foot Traffic, Study Midriffs;
Counter Clicks for Each One, as New York Swarms Blindly By

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
High noon in Herald Square, and the concrete landscape seethes with people of every size, shape and description. Some stride boldly, some flow in schools like fish, some bubble by in baby carriages. Hundreds rush by each minute.
Lawrence Howard stares straight ahead, his brow furrowed in the intense concentration common to billiard parlors. In his hand, he holds a small clicker. As each person passes, his right thumb snaps down. Click . . . click, click, click . . . click. Babies are counted, dogs aren't. Bicycle messengers are clicked if they are on the sidewalk but not if they're on the street. 
 "I try to look straight ahead and only at the middle of the body," Mr. Howard said as he struggled to cope with a "platoon," a swarm of people sent spilling across an intersection by a green light.
Counting people, not money, might be the ultimate New York phenomenon -- though often they amount to the same thing. Mr. Howard, on the job earlier this month, was counting for the 34th Street Partnership, a business improvement district interested in luring new and more prestigious businesses to Herald Square and the busy shopping area around it.
The initial purpose of the partnership was to establish that 100 million people -- the number that has always been claimed -- do indeed visit Herald Square each year. That task accomplished, counters have been canvassing specific spots, developing data to encourage new businesses to come and existing ones to expand.
Pedestrians are counted for many reasons in New York, a city with more of them than any other in America. Transportation planners count pedestrians when they do safety studies and make roadway improvements, when they decide the size of crosswalks, design new subway stations and position parking lots. Urban planners consider pedestrian activity in zoning and other decisions. Businesses count pedestrian traffic to make location decisions. And business improvement districts -- private organizations made up of businesses in a particular neighborhood -- use the counts to lure others to their districts.
The value of foot traffic is made strikingly obvious by average annual rents of $150 per square foot in stores adjacent to key subway entrances and $70 to $80 a half-block away, real estate professionals say. With so much at stake, banks and businesses often require precise, documented counts.
HMV, the record superstore, recently opened in Herald Square to take advantage of the potential for walk-in customers. Kmart is building its first Manhattan store in the Penn Station area. Cambridge Members, a Korean-owned men's clothing superstore, recently almost doubled its space at 33d Street and Broadway, to 15,000 square feet. Conway's, the bare-bones discount retailer, also chose Herald Square for a new store.
"The more people in the area, the greater the likelihood that more people will stop in," said Stephan Bassett, a Conway's executive. "It's as simple as the more the merrier."
Actually, from the people counter's point of view, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. From now till Christmas -- the busiest shopping time of the year -- Mr. Howard and his fellow counters will be off the streets. "It's too crowded to work," he said.
During much of the postwar shift to the suburbs, cars passing potential mall sites were more interesting to counters than were urban walkers. But David Milder, president of Danth Inc., the consultant helping the partnership interpret its numbers, said that the retail potential of suburbia had "maxed out," and that national chains were scrambling back into cities.
"Cities and downtowns are all about people," he said. "That's their competitive advantage."
The counting itself is mind-numbing work that nonetheless requires keen attention. Mr. Howard, who works off and on as one of four counters on each corner of one of the world's busiest intersections -- Avenue of the Americas and 34th Street -- has no time to give directions. But to his own astonishment he remembers faces, even saying hello to one man whom he remembered clicking off several days before. Counters work episodically, returning to the same locations again and again to reduce their margin of error.
Mr. Howard takes three five-minute counts, then adds them together and multiplies by four for the hourly rate. The most crucial rule is to count only people walking in one direction, to avoid counting anybody twice -- even as people dart by at a rate of two a second at peak hours.
Most counters are graduate students making $7 an hour. Mr. Howard, a zoning specialist for the partnership, counts personally to keep a finger on the district's pulse.
Daniel A. Biederman, the partnership's president, first grasped the importance of people-counting when the Rockefeller Brothers Fund asked him to make over Bryant Park in 1980. He sought out William H. Whyte, author of the 1989 book "City: Rediscovering the Center," for advice. Mr. Whyte had already counted people in the decrepit, drug-riddled park, and found that a lot of people used it.
But it was a complicated case. Mr. Whyte's counting revealed that two to two and a half times as many pedestrians walked on the north side of 42d Street, even though the sidewalk is wider on the park side. Some people were clearly put off by the park's woebegone appearance.
Redevelopment of the park went ahead, Mr. Biederman said, because calculations of the masses of people in the immediate area strongly suggested that a green space could draw them in. The park now often draws 5,000 people on a nice day, five times as many as it did 15 years ago.
There are many other uses for pedestrian counts. Earlier this month, the Regional Plan Association released a glowing report on the prospects for downtown Brooklyn, based in part on the 100,000 daily visitors to the Fulton Mall, the area's main shopping district. The Times Square Business Development Association issued a report last year on Eighth Avenue's surprising potential for nonpornographic retail development, based in part on the numbers of pedestrians counted.
Professionals say the most accurate counts are the most expensive: those made by examining aerial photographs under microscopes. Other counting methods include time-lapse photography, used by Mr. Whyte in some locations.
Planners also use estimates based on computerized analyses of census, utility, transportation and other data. But experts insist that only actual counts can be trusted, though "most people don't do it because of the tremendous cost," said Herbert Levinson, a pedestrian consultant based in New Haven.
In particular, there has been no citywide count since the late 1970's, when the Regional Plan Association did one. As a result, officials for city agencies and business groups say, there is no standard reference -- which means some areas' claims are questioned by others. For instance, according to the Times Square Business Improvement District, 1.5 million people visit Times Square daily. That would make it more than four times busier than Herald Square eight blocks south, a degree of magnitude Mr. Biederman questions. "There's a lot of puffery in these numbers," he said.
Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square group, said that the 1.5 million figure, used in the district's brochures, was not the result of an actual count but rather represented estimates derived from adding the hundreds of thousands of people in the neighborhood riding on subways and buses, working in offices and staying in hotels. "It's as close as you can get without actually being out there counting," she said.
But some say that more, and better, counting is exactly what is needed. "The city should commission a traffic engineer to go out and do pedestrian counts," said Lee Phillips, president of the Phillips/Norwalk Company, a retail planning consultant.

HEADLINE: Session Is Short and Quiet, But Treasury Prices Go Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday in a quiet and abbreviated session.
Without fresh economic data, market participants took their cue from strong buying in Asian and European markets early yesterday before the opening of the New York market. Most trading desks were thinly staffed as many participants extended the Thanksgiving holiday to a four-day weekend. 
 Prices held steady throughout the session. Many market investors do not want to buy in any meaningful amounts before seeing additional proof of a weakening economy and some progress between Congress and the Clinton Administration toward an agreement for a Federal budget package and an increase in the debt ceiling.
The market is hoping that after an agreement, the Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 , to 10815/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.24 percent from 6.27 percent on Wednesday.
Trading in the New York cash market halted early, at about 2 P.M., on the recommendation of the Public Securities Association, which represents firms that buy and sell debt securities.
Next week, the market faces added supply as the Treasury sells $30.25 billion of new two-year and five-year notes in addition to its regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, which will total $28 billion. In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auctions, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.48 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.69 percent.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said she did not see supply as a major obstacle because of the market's bullish mood. "We got through the refunding without many major setbacks," she noted, referring to the Treasury's sales of 3-year and 10-year notes this week.
Ms. Rupert said the technicals of the market remained positive, "and besides we usually see month-end buying and we expect to see more of that."
Some traders speculated that yesterday's buying was prompted in part by expectations that a slow start to the holiday shopping season would hinder growth and restrain inflation, giving the Fed an opportunity to cut rates again to stimulate the economy.
"Next week we get housing starts," Ms. Rupert said, "which has been a significant number for the market." Also due next week are a report on durable goods orders for October, a report from the National Purchasing Management Association and auto and truck sales numbers from American auto makers.

HEADLINE: Federal Deficit Fell 27.4% In a Month of Budget Debate

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Federal deficit in October, the start of a new fiscal year, was 27.4 percent lower than in the corresponding month a year ago.
The amount of the deficit was smaller than analysts had expected, but Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting service in Lexington, Mass., said the October decline mainly reflected smaller appropriations approved by Congress during the budget stalemate. 
 "You can't spend much without the appropriation bills," she said. "They'll make up for it."
The Treasury Department said today that spending in October exceeded revenue by $22.8 billion. The deficit in October 1994 was $31.3 billion.
The deficit for the full fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 was $163.8 billion, the lowest since 1989, when it was $152.5 billion.
The deficit hit a record $290.4 billion in the fiscal year 1992 before it started to decline. It was $255.1 billion the following year and fell to $203.2 billion last year.
The Clinton Administration estimates that the deficit will decline slightly this fiscal year, to $162.8 billion.
Analysts have said the lower deficits in the last few years are a result of a healthy economy that has created jobs -- and more taxpayers -- combined with spending limits.
The Government collected $95.6 billion in October, compared with $89 billion in the month a year ago. It spent $118.4 billion, down from $120.4 billion. The deficit is the difference between receipts and expenditures.
Interest on the national debt amounted to $21.6 billion for the month and is projected to total $349.3 billion for the entire year.

HEADLINE: Rich or Poor, Most Feel Cuts in City Services

SERIES: SHRINKING THE CITY: Citizen's Voices

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Antoinette Leonard says her high school has become so overcrowded that in some cases 39 students are packed into a class. Alvin Berk worries that a decline in tree-pruning by city crews will lead to the death of handsome old trees in his neighborhood. But Rocio Proano says the city services she cares most about, particularly the public library, have actually improved -- despite a year of extraordinary spending cuts by the city and state.
New Yorkers speak in many voices when asked how the governments' retrenchment has affected them. But interviews with three dozen New Yorkers from a variety of economic and social backgrounds did produce some significant common threads. 
 Many poor and working-class people, who depend heavily on city hospitals and other assistance from the city, said they had seen a sharp decline in services. Many middle-class New Yorkers, on the other hand, said their lives had changed little because they use few city services -- although some did worry about how the cutbacks were affecting people less fortunate than them.
Middle-class New Yorkers with children in the public schools shared the concerns of less-affluent New Yorkers about ballooning class sizes and generally diminished school resources. And many people who commute on the subways and buses bitterly complained that service was declining while the fare had gone up.
The interviews took place in three Brooklyn neighborhoods -- upscale Park Slope, working-class Flatbush and middle-class Mill Basin -- and they revealed a broad range of views, some of them unexpected.
"Mister, you could eat off my sidewalk," said Sonja Henney, describing the Sanitation Department's work on her block in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. "My business is booming, and I believe I couldn't pay for a better education for my two children." Miss Henney is a day-care supervisor and sends her children to city schools. "So I really can't complain," she added.
But another woman, a retired teacher's assistant in the public schools, did. She has taken in six foster children, who range in age from 4 months to 12 years. The city has stopped paying for baby sitters to help foster parents, and the woman, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her name be withheld, said it had cost her dearly.
"If I have to take one of the kids out to a doctor, I have to take all six kids," she said. "And they do not pay for the car fare. I get no assistance, and it's not right."
What follows are reactions to city and state budget cuts from eight other New Yorkers.
 
Shrinking the City: Citizen's voices.
 
Antoinette Leonard
 She is a junior at Midwood High School. The math textbook she was given in September has no cover, and some students have been closed out of advanced placement classes. Her math class has 39 students, her Spanish class has 36 and advanced placement biology has 35.
"They were smaller last term," she said. "There were 24, 25 kids in most of my classes." Midwood has about 3,500 students but only 5 guidance counselors -- one for every 700 students, Ms. Leonard noted. "When you go to see a guidance counselor, they ask you for your number, not your name."
"The Mayor and the President say that New York has the lowest graduation rates," she said. "But then they spend all their money on weapons. Why aren't we spending more money on education?"
 
Rocio Proano
 She is pleased that the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library has expanded its hours (though the Brooklyn system is deferring maintenance expenses and making other cuts to maintain its hours). And she is happy that her subway stop, Grand Army Plaza, is being rebuilt. Those are the government services on which she said she most depends.
"Actually, I think city services are better," said Ms. Proano, who talked briefly while hurrying to catch a subway train on a recent afternoon, and who did not say what her occupation was. "I think the stations show a lot of improvement, and crime is down, from what I hear. So that counts for something."
 
Alvin Berk
 A university administrator, he is chairman of Community Board 14, which includes the neighborhoods of Flatbush and Midwood and parts of Kensington.
"There's been a lot of nibbling around the edges," he said. "One thing that you see is tire carcasses all over the streets because the Sanitation Department stopped picking up discarded tires with the garbage. Now you have to bring them to a central place in each borough, and no one knows where those are."
"Trees aren't being pruned," he added. "The limbs break during storms, sometimes damaging property. Certainly, it is going to make the city a less attractive place to live."
"The community boards' budgets have been hurt seriously," he continued. "They were cut 19 percent last year, and for many boards that has been carried over to this year. A lot of boards have lost staffing. We reduced our staff from three to two. The complaint-taking capability of community boards is being jeopardized, and that means that community boards are less able to track agency performance."
 
Norman Henkin
A retired lawyer, he said he had noticed no changes in the services on which he depends, like the police, sanitation and subways. But he worries that the city and state cutbacks have hurt the poor.
"I think it stinks," he said. "I'm a rich man, so it doesn't affect me. But poor people are starving." Asked what the city should do to remedy this problem, Mr. Henkin quickly volunteered to do his part.
"I think they should increase taxes," he said, "especially on people like me."
 
 Barbara Byrd-Bennett
She is superintendent of Community School District 17, which includes parts of Flatbush and Crown Heights. The district has 27,000 students in 27 schools.
"I can see firsthand the effect in the schools," she said. "Larger class sizes, less money for resources. The number of students that guidance counselors serve has increased. I have fewer security guards and security aides. I have fewer dollars to purchase updated hardware for computers for our students."
"I have kindergarten classes with 28 to 30 students," she said. "I have fourth-grade classes with 34, 35 students. When you have increased bodies, you need new furniture, new desks. You have to buy furniture for kids, but there is no money for that. When we talk about equity in education, we just don't have it."
 
Francois Jacqueline
 A Flatbush resident, he works as a teacher's assistant at Westinghouse High School in downtown Brooklyn. He was particularly dissatisfied with the care his pregnant wife received at Kings County Hospital Center, a city hospital. When she was hospitalized there a few months ago, he said, she had to spend 12 hours in the emergency room before she was assigned a bed.
"The services there are not proper," he said. "They don't respect the patient." The cutbacks, he said, are "very bitter medicine. The rich get richer and the poor, like me, get poorer."
 
Clive Rose
He is a hospital nurse from Flatbush, and he said the service cutbacks have had no effect on his life. Though his children's public school classes are somewhat larger, they do not seem bothered by it -- and so neither is he. Because he drives to work, Mr. Rose said he was unaware of any changes in subway and bus service.
"I never really use the services," he said, "so it hasn't really affected me yet."
 
Edward Martin
He lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side near Columbia University and teaches English and history at the Berkeley Carroll School, a private school in Park Slope.
"I haven't seen much change in my neighborhood, around Columbia, because we didn't have much in the way of services to begin with," he said. But then he noted one big exception: the subways.
"There's no doubt that the trains are more crowded, they run less often and they definitely seem dirtier," he said. "The fare is going up and the service is going down."
 
Shrinking the City
 Future articles in this series will continue to detail the effects of budget cuts on a number of city agencies.

HEADLINE: Haitian President Is Hinting That He Might Not Step Down

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 24

 BODY:
In an ambiguous speech delivered in Port-au-Prince to some of his most loyal supporters, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appeared today to endorse their longstanding demands that he ignore a pledge he made to the United States and remain in office for three more years.
"If you want three years, I will not turn my back on you," Mr. Aristide said in an address at the end of a weeklong conference on national unity. 
 But the Haitian leader hedged his comments, adding, "If you want elections, I will not turn my back on you." Elections to choose his successor are scheduled in three weeks.
He also told the several hundred delegates at the meeting that he wanted to consult with leaders of opposition parties and business groups before making a final decision. "Neither myself or you make a whole," he told his supporters.
"My mission is a fragile one," he also said. "I try to weigh every word I say."
Making their own position clear, the delegates, who had earlier passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the President not to step down, erupted into cheers and began to chant "Three more years! three more years!" according to people who attended the conference, held at the National Palace.
Under the Haitian Constitution, Mr. Aristide cannot succeed himself in office, and is scheduled to step down on Feb. 7. Last week, Rene Preval, a former Prime Minister under Mr. Aristide and close friend of his, registered as the candidate of the governing Lavalas Movement, which immediately made him the front-runner and appeared to end growing speculation that an election might not be held. Thirteen other candidates are in the running.
Mr. Aristide, who spent three years in exile in Venezuela and the United States after being ousted in a military coup in September 1991, has served only two years of the five-year term to which he was elected in December 1990. As a result, many Lavalas members have argued that he should be allowed to remain in office to make up for the time he lost.
That position, however, conflicts with guarantees Mr. Aristide made to the Clinton Administration in Washington shortly before 20,000 American troops entered Haiti in September 1994 to restore him to power. Standing with Mr. Clinton at his side, Mr. Aristide promised publicly to leave office in February 1996, a pledge he has repeated, under American pressure, many times since his return.
In recent weeks, though, the once-cordial relations between Mr. Aristide and his benefactors in Washington have cooled somewhat. More than $4.5 million in American aid to Haiti, for instance, has been put on hold because the Aristide Government has failed to make progress on a program to privatize state-owned companies, and an additional $100 million may also be in jeopardy.
Mr. Aristide's remarks today followed almost two weeks of intermittent street violence, which erupted after he delivered a fiery eulogy at the funeral of a close relative slain by gunmen. In that earlier speech, Mr. Aristide called on his supporters to "go to the neighborhoods where there are big houses and heavy weapons," and criticized the American-led United Nations peacekeeping force operating here for not disarming what he called "the big men with the heavy weapons."
Since then, at least 10 people have died and more than a score have been wounded or injured in street clashes.
Mr. Aristide's remarks came one day after he met with President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, in Port-au-Prince. A spokesman for the American Embassy, Stanley Schrager, said that Mr. Lake's visit "was not related to the recent disturbances" but that he assumed "they talked about the presidential election and everything else."
Evans Paul, a former Aristide ally and Mayor of Port-au-Prince who broke with the President after parliamentary elections this summer, has charged that the Lavalas Movement is trying to make the presidential election meaningless by creating a climate of insecurity in which voting and campaigning are impossible.
But in an indication of the confused state of Haitian politics, Mr. Paul has also joined those who have suggested that Mr. Aristide remain in office for three more years. In an interview last month, he said that was the best way for Haiti to preserve stability and guarantee economic and political development.

HEADLINE: New Delhi Journal;
Fowl Fight Over Flies Sends India Into a Stew

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Since health inspectors arrived two weeks ago at Kentucky Fried Chicken's first restaurant in the Indian capital and filed a report that was used to justify closing the outlet, wags here have had a name for the episode: the Tale of Two Flies.
Other Indians are not sure whether to laugh or cry. 
 Either way, the travails of Colonel Sanders' beachhead in the land of tandoori chicken have been the occasion for a thoroughgoing tamasha, the Indian equivalent of a brouhaha.
The flies -- two flies, precisely, in the part of the kitchen used to thaw frozen chicken -- were cited by the city's Health Commissioner in ordering the restaurant's license canceled for "unsanitary conditions."
Unlike in China, where Mao Zedong's directive "Away with all pests!" once set millions to swatting flies, the fly has never been hard pressed in India. The Indian restaurant has been something of a home-away-from-home for flies, a fact cited by many Indian newspapers in their coverage of the controversy. M. D. Nalapat, a columnist writing in The Sunday Times of India, even suggested that Kentucky Fried Chicken should have been "given an award," not shut down, "because only two flies were found."
But flies, as many Indians have said from the start of the controversy, have been more in the way of an excuse than a cause of Kentucky Fried Chicken's problems. Like Coca-Cola when it was driven out of India by Government order 20 years ago, KFC, as it is called, by friend and foe alike, has become the latest lightning rod for a form of Indian economic nationalism.
The "Chicken War," as it is often called in Indian newspapers, began three months ago, when Pepsico Restaurants International, the Dallas-based parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut, opened the first of 60 fast-food outlets it plans for India in the next seven years. The first fried chicken outlet, in the southern city of Bangalore, drew immediate fire from the economic nationalists, who persuaded the Bangalore city government to withdraw the restaurant's license.
In Bangalore, the reason given was that chicken samples taken from the restaurant contained dangerously high levels of monosodium glutamate, said by Indian opponents of Kentucky Fried Chicken to be carcinogenic. The Indian executives who manage Pepsico's restaurants obtained a court injunction staying the city's action, reopened in five hours, and won a high court ruling this month reinstating the restaurant's license. But by then the Bangalore dispute had been overshadowed by the dispute in New Delhi.
By opening the chain's second outlet in the capital, KFC executives were effectively challenging the lion in his den, since the Delhi regional government is controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, principal standard-bearer in Indian politics for Hindu nationalism and its economic component. In the period leading up to a general election across India next spring, the party's national leaders have staked out their opposition to foreign investment in consumer industries. Their mantra has been suitably catchy: "What India needs is computer chips, not potato chips."
Even party leaders seem unsure whether they can fire public passions sufficiently to unseat the governing Congress Party, which broke the tablets of Indian socialism when it ushered in a new era of market economics in 1991. The Hindu middle class from which the nationalist party draws its support flocked to the Bangalore and the New Delhi restaurants, with lines curling into the street. In a Times of India survey, 67 percent of the respondents said that Kentucky Fried Chicken had been "unfairly singled out" when far worse conditions are tolerated in many Indian restaurants.
Perhaps most surprising, considering India's own spicy cuisine, Colonel Sanders's recipes have come in for enthusiastic reviews. Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known novelists and critics, wrote a piece in The Hindustan Times recalling how he came across Kentucky Fried Chicken during a university teaching stint in Hawaii 20 years ago and found it as tasty as tandoori chicken -- the heavily spiced, spit-roasted chicken brought to India in the Middle Ages by invading Mogul conquerors.
"Why they call it junk food, I had no idea," Mr. Singh said.
For now, KFC executives say they will press ahead with their $80 million investment program, starting with a court challenge in which the company will seek restitution of its New Delhi license. Sandeep Kohli, the 38-year-old managing director of Pepsico Restaurants in India, said the company will argue that standards in the New Delhi restaurant are superior to virtually all of New Delhi's 20,000 other restaurants, at least half of which operate without licenses or inspections of any kind.
"Ours is by far the cleanest kitchen in this part of the world," he said.
Other commentators have suggested that this is no year, and New Delhi no place, to be trumpeting the superior virtues of tandoori restaurants, at least from the standpoint of hygiene. In July, the city was shaken when a prominent young politician, Sushil Sharma, a former leader of the Congress Party's youth wing in the capital, was arrested and charged with shooting his wife and attempting to burn her body in the tandoor oven of a Government-owned restaurant. For several months after the episode, tandoori restaurants in the city reported a sharp falloff in trade.

HEADLINE: Lots of Cash Pays Off, a G.O.P. Candidate Finds

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Nov. 21

 BODY:
If George Herbert Walker Bush was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr. was born with a complete place setting.
Money -- by the bucketful -- is at the core of Mr. Forbes's candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination. It may not buy him love from the voters, but it is certainly buying him attention, to say nothing of a respectable standing in the polls. 
 In the nine weeks since he announced his candidacy, Mr. Forbes has spent $7 million of his personal fortune to bombard New Hampshire and Iowa and other pivotal states with a television and radio advertising campaign months ahead of the states' Presidential nominating contests. It is more intense than the blizzards of advertising that most candidates run on the eve of the actual voting.
Because he rejected Government money to help finance his campaign, Mr. Forbes is free of Federal spending limits, and he is well on his way to far exceeding the total amount most of his rivals have budgeted for advertising in those early states.
Such saturation, so early, by a single candidate is unheard of in Presidential politics. But it seems to be paying off for Mr. Forbes. Though he is still in single digits in most polls, he has pulled even with or ahead of every candidate except the front-runner, Senator Bob Dole, in New Hampshire or Iowa -- sites of the first two important contests. He is drawing attention away from Mr. Dole's rivals during the crucial run-up to the primaries, as they all are vying to break from the pack. He is not helping Mr. Dole either: his commercials relentlessly attack the Senator on issues like term limits.
"I think I'm getting real value for my money," Mr. Forbes, who is known among friends as a penny pincher, said with satisfaction here at a breakfast meeting with Republicans.
Three influential Governors who are backing Mr. Dole agreed that Mr. Forbes, long a behind-the-scenes player in Republican politics, should not be underestimated. "Who's got the most momentum in this state right now? Forbes," Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire said before he endorsed Mr. Dole. "He's talking in specifics much more than conventional wisdom, and people like that."
Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who withdrew from the Presidential race in late September, said, "Why is he doing better than the also-rans? He is a new face. And he is the only one who can legitimately claim to be an outsider."
And Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, marveling at how Mr. Forbes' advertisements have saturated his state, said, "I've been through four campaigns for Governor, and I used to have a hard time seeing my ads. With Forbes, I see six in one day. And I almost never watch TV."
Indeed, it is impossible to turn on a television here without seeing the 48-year-old Mr. Forbes, in his matter-of-fact, plodding delivery, describing his proposals on the flat tax, term limits or health care in a mix of nine commercials thus far. On WMUR, the leading television station in New Hampshire, for instance, the Forbes campaign is paying for about 80 commercials this week at a cost of about $50,000. In addition, the campaign is spending nearly as much in other broadcast and cable stations in the state -- and even more in Iowa and for some national commercials.
By contrast, candidates who abide by spending limits have a cap of just over $600,000 for the entire New Hampshire primary. Mr. Dole has yet to broadcast a television commercial in New Hampshire this year, but others have had far more modest advertising campaigns than Mr. Forbes: Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Morry Taylor, a tire-wheel manufacturer.
The Forbes commercials are not flashy affairs: they are meat-and-potatoes, full of facts and figures. They were produced by Our Town Films of New York, which has done work for Forbes magazine but is not known for political advertising. But the scripts are by a coterie of campaign veterans that includes Carter Wrenn and Tom Ellis, longtime confidants of Senator Jesse Helms, R. Marc Nuttle, who ran Pat Robertson's Presidential campaign in 1988, and John McLaughlin, a pollster.
Mr. Forbes plays down his wealth by noting that other candidates have spent more than he has. But he neglects to say that the others started months, if not years, earlier than he did. He insists that people are responding to his message.
"When people come up to me they don't talk about 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,' " Mr. Forbes said in an interview as his van rolled from here to Concord. "Ideas -- that's what they identify with you."
In fact, Mr. Forbes has been hammering so hard on his signature flat-tax proposal that it has given voters an issue with which to connect him. With a flat tax, taxpayers would fork over 17 percent their earnings.
Advocates say the flat tax would be simpler to administer and would distort business decisions less than the current, complicated tax code does. But opponents say it would be hard on the poor and on middle-class people who rely on deductions such as for home mortgage interest.
Mr. Forbes concedes that if he were not a millionaire, his ideas would not be heard. Though he has a sparse organization and is pouring almost all his money into advertising, Mr. Forbes' cash gives him other advantages: He plans to spend $1 million for an intense effort to gather enough signatures to get on the primary ballot in New York.
Dismissing critics who note that Mr. Forbes' poll numbers are not as strong nationally as they are in Iowa and New Hampshire, William A. Dal Col, Mr. Forbes' campaign manager, said that all he would have to do is buy more commercials on the networks, "If I bought some time on the three majors, I'd take care of that in a week."
Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Forbes' pollster, is also delighted to have a client who is not encumbered by spending limits. "For 20 years, we've had these Watergate laws that have stifled the issue discussion," he said. "Forbes is rewriting the rules -- it's revolutionary."
The ultimate question is whether a blank check can buy a candidate more than a short-lived blip in the polls. Former Gov. John B. Connally of Texas spent $12 million in the Republican primaries in 1980: he got only one delegate. But unlike Mr. Forbes, Mr. Connally did not concentrate his spending on commercials.
Then there is former Representative Michael Huffington, who spent $29 million last year, mostly in advertising, to try to win a Senate seat in California. He lost to Senator Dianne Feinstein, but by a margin of less than two percentage points.
Mr. Forbes runs even more of a risk than Ross Perot in using his own money to finance his campaign for President because Mr. Perot scored points with voters as a self-made billionaire.
Perhaps that is why Mr. Forbes -- who prefers to be called "Steve" -- is doing his best to portray himself as a commoner despite the estimated $400 million he inherited from his family's publishing empire.
But he tripped over his patrician roots in an interview when he remarked that he liked Big Macs and Whoppers. "The nice thing about Whoppers is you can at least console yourself that some of that is on the recommended list: the lettuce, the tomato," he said. But he pronounced it toe-MAAAH-toe.
Michael Murphy, Mr. Alexander's chief adviser, dismissed Mr. Forbes as having "reached his ceiling -- he's never been above the margin of error." That may be true, but there is little evidence that Mr. Alexander is doing any better.
It might also be that Mr. Forbes' advisers are right -- and that people do like his message. Tom Horgan, a college administrator in Amherst, N.H., said he was torn between Mr. Alexander and Mr. Forbes, but was intrigued enough by the Forbes commercials to go hear him speak this week. "He was much more dimensional than his advertising would indicate," said Mr. Horgan, who is 42. "Some people might think he's a Johnny-one-note. He talks a lot about economics. But it is a message that gets through. Lamar Alexander doesn't have a message that gets through."
Mr. Forbes said that to prove that there is grass-roots support for his candidacy, he has begun soliciting contributions, and plans a big fund-raising bash at the Waldorf Astoria on Dec. 13. He insists that his own spending on the race "won't be higher" than $25 million.
But his campaign manager, Mr. Dal Col, is confident he can squeeze more out of Mr. Forbes if need be. "Let's put it this way," he said. "If we're second in New Hampshire and I need more money, do you think there will be any doubt?"

Japan Banks Post Big Rises In Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Japan's 11 major commercial banks, aided by a low cost of funds and lucrative bond trading, today reported strong increases in earnings for the six months ended Sept. 30 but warned that results would slow in the second fiscal half, with some of the institutions likely to fall into the red.
The banks made little progress in reducing their big supply of bad loans in their first half but were expected to take big write-offs at the end of the current fiscal year. Nine of the 11 plan to write off all their loans to Japan's seven troubled housing lenders, and some said they would do so even if it meant reporting a loss or skipping a dividend payment -- steps the banks have been loath to take. 
 "Even including loans to housing loan companies, we will be able to dispose of problem loans by the end of this fiscal year," said Takeshi Yano, senior managing director of the Mitsubishi Bank.
By the Government's estimate, the nation's banks are saddled with bad debts amounting to 37.4 trillion yen, or about $370 billion, with half that amount unrecoverable. Some analysts, however, have said the bad debts could be twice that.
The 11 big commercial banks are Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sumitomo, Sanwa, Sakura Mitsubishi, Fuji, Tokai, Asahi Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa and Hokkaido Takushoku. Their operating profits soared in the first half because they were able to obtain inexpensive funds in the short-term money market -- interest rates were as low as four-tenths of 1 percent -- and buy long-term Japanese Government bonds paying as much as 3 percent in interest.
Compared with the corresponding period in 1994, operating profit more than doubled at Daiwa and Hokkaido Takushoku, rose about 75 percent at Sakura and Fuji and increased about 50 percent at Tokai, Asahi and Sumitomo.
The rate at which the banks wrote off bad loans slowed from the half a year earlier, causing pretax profit to rise even more than operating profit at several of the institutions. The 11 banks wrote off 1.24 trillion yen in bad loans in the latest half, down from 3.39 trillion yen a year earlier.
For the full fiscal year, many banks expect earnings to fall sharply, and in some cases expect to report losses, as they write off larger portions of their bad loan portfolios.
The Bank of Tokyo and Fuji said they expected earnings to decline. Daiwa -- already reeling from a scandal in which a trader lost $1.1 billion through unauthorized bond trades in New York -- said it might post a loss, depending on the amount of bad loans it decided to write off.
Hokkaido Takushoku said it expected to report a pretax loss of 190 billion yen for the fiscal year after writing off 250 billion yen in bad loans. The loss would come despite a cost-cutting plan that will close 30 branches, cut as many as 300 jobs and employ capital reserves to dispose of the bad loans.
In contrast, Sanwa, which wrote off 251 billion yen in bad loans during the first half, said it expected pretax profit to rise 32 percent in the full year. And Dai-Ichi Kangyo said it expected a 66 percent gain in pretax profit.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Asia and Europe; Many U.S. Traders Off for Day

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against most leading currencies yesterday in Asia and Europe. Many American currency traders were taking a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
 Without their American counterparts, even European and Asian dealers struggled to find reasons to trade. 
 "Everyone is in a holiday mode," said John Nasti, director of foreign exchange at Barclays Group. "It just seems to be the same thing: London opens in a narrow range and the U.S. follows suit."
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 101.41 Japanese yen, up from 100.76 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 1.4193 German marks from 1.4090 marks and to 1.1437 Swiss francs from 1.1369 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5595 from $1.5625.
Many financial markets in the United States and Japan were closed on Thursday for national holidays; Japan celebrated Labor Thanksgiving Day.
Speculation that Germany's central bank could soon cut a key interest rate pushed the mark lower against other European currencies and against the dollar, dealers said.
 Yet some doubted a rate cut would come soon in Germany. "From what I can see, they're saying they'll cut rates, but not imminently," an American trader said. "But the market is not playing the long term."
 The dollar also got a modest lift against the yen as the Japanese currency slipped against the mark and other European currencies.
 The yen was "sold against some of the European currencies," said David Gilmore, a partner with Foreign Exchange Analytics.
He said dealers were betting that Japanese securities houses would buy the French franc, the British pound and other currencies on behalf of some clients looking to invest cash that had just been freed up.
Dealers reported a flurry of dollar buying against the yen as the dollar crossed 101.15 yen. Some market participants who had bet the dollar would not get that high had to buy to minimize their losses.
 But the dollar's rally against the yen stalled near the 101.55 level, where a pile of sell orders from overnight Asian trading sat awaiting completion.
 "There were some sell orders there left over from Tokyo," one trader said.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
LaFontaine Isn't Eager To Rejoin the Islanders

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The way it sounded, Pat LaFontaine, trade rumors swirling about him, would show up if the Islanders were to reacquire him in a trade. But he would probably not be too happy about it.
LaFontaine, who joined the Islanders after playing for the 1984 United States Olympic team and became a fan favorite on Long Island, forced a trade from New York in October 1991, when the owner, John O. Pickett, and Bill Torrey, then the general manager, refused to renegotiate his contract. 
 He likes Buffalo. A lot. He has a huge contract. He has to like that a lot.
"The way I look at it is, you move and you grow and you learn from those experiences," LaFontaine said today about his relationship with the Islanders, who tied the Sabres, 1-1, here tonight. "That's something that was a long time ago. I had said all along that it was the best for both parties. And really, I have no regrets. I feel good about what happened and what transpired.
"I still go back and visit the Island. We have a lot of close friends on the Island. But right now, I'm a Buffalo Sabre. I have an obligation to my teammates. My home is here. And I'm enjoying my time. I haven't asked for a trade."
But LaFontaine also said he realizes that hockey is a business. And he has seen what the Sabres have done this season -- namely, rid themselves of salaries. LaFontaine, who missed almost 16 months of play after injuring his knee in 1993, will make $4.3 million this season, $4.6 million the next and $4.8 million the two after that.
"I think if an organization, because of economic reasons, would like to move on, that's a situation where, hey, if you're needed somewhere else, that's where you go," LaFontaine, 30, said.
But Sabres General Manager John Muckler did not sound as if he were looking to transfer anyone. While conceding that he had talked to General Manager Don Maloney of the Islanders today, Muckler said that local newspaper reports of a trade involving LaFontaine had been "blown out of proportion."
LaFontaine's agent, Don Meehan, said he would be surprised by a trade with the Islanders.
"You can never say never," he said. "But there are a combination of factors why I don't think it's going to happen. No. 1, Pat's happy in Buffalo. No. 2, I don't know that Buffalo wants to trade Pat. No. 3, Pat had no intention of playing for John Pickett earlier and I see no reason why he would want to play for him now. And No. 4, he's got a contract that is very substantial."
But the Islanders desperately need a marquee name -- almost as badly as they need a center. And LaFontaine fits both bills.
 
SLAP SHOTS
 Count out the Calgary Flames' holdout center, JOE NIEUWENDYK, as far as a trade for KIRK MULLER goes. A person familiar with the situation said that Nieuwendyk, 29, wants no part of playing for a rebuilding team. Nieuwendyk's agent, HERB PINDER, said as much on Friday.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Levels Playing Field

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am concerned that a quotation attributed to me in "Not Just a White Man's Game: Blacks in Business Master the Art of Networking" (Business Day, Nov. 9) may have been misinterpreted. 
 The quotation was: "The African-American mind-set reflected a need to say, 'I did it myself.' . . . It may be one of the fallout aspects of affirmative action, feeling guilty that we have been handed things, so we want to do it ourselves."
I strongly support affirmative action and believe it is necessary to help level the playing field of economic opportunity. However, the assault on affirmative action by the conservative right has reframed the debate. Affirmative action, instead of being viewed as a partial remedy to past and present discrimination, is itself attacked as discriminatory.
Under this logic, it has been suggested that affirmative action is a disservice to African-Americans because it taints our accomplishments as "handouts." In the business circles that Black Enterprise magazine covers, this is understood by both black and white businesspeople to be the racially polarizing political rhetoric that it is.
The importance we place on access to equal opportunity is most notably reflected in our decision to pull the Black Enterprise-Pepsi Golf and Tennis Challenge out of California because of its governor's repeated attacks on affirmative action and minority set-asides. As executive director of this event, I moved it to the Doral Golf Resort and Spa in Miami.
During an economic boycott a couple of years ago the city of Miami learned of the influence and economic power of the African-American business community. This same community will work to preserve affirmative action as long as access to economic opportunity continues to be denied to so many.

HEADLINE: MAKING MICROSOFT SAFE FOR CAPITALISM

 BODY:
James Gleick's "Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism" (Nov. 5) makes it sound as if Microsoft were doing something wrong by being a strong competitor and by creating innovative software that customers decide to buy.
The PC software business is incredibly competitive. Prices decline even as products improve dramatically. The Internet is creating even more opportunities for competition. Microsoft must continue to innovate or we will be history. This is not paranoia; it is simple fact. 
 Gleick asserts that the quality of Microsoft's products has been "incidental to" our success. This is outrageous. Excel and Word have received industry awards because they are great products. No company in our business can sell products that don't excite users and receive positive reviews.
Contrary to Gleick's assertion, there was never any deliberate attempt to sabotage any competitor's software application. Windows's success depends on making a very broad range of applications compatible. Windows is a great and open platform. In fact, we spend a huge amount of our resources working with other software companies to make sure their products run well on Windows.
Perhaps most troubling is Gleick's uncritical acceptance of our competitors' self-serving claims about business practices and ethics. There is nothing illegal -- or unethical -- about being relentless in improving existing products or creating new ones.
Lastly, Gleick's call for Federal action would be bad news for everyone. The notion that any new work we do should be controlled by a Government agency and given away free for others to copy makes no sense from either a legal or economic perspective. The personal computer marketplace is one of the great American success stories precisely because it has developed on its own, indeed flourished. It is the envy of countries around the world and should not be subjected to burdensome Government regulations.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Republican Socialism

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
IF THERE IS ONE proposition upon which all Republican politicians can agree, it is that the Government should butt out of the market. The budget bills passed by the Republican-controlled House and Senate earlier this month testify to the G.O.P.'s faith in the invisible hand. Explicit industrial policies, like tax incentives for small businesses in poor neighborhoods, are as unfashionable as they have ever been; implicit ones like affirmative action are beyond the pale. People who want money must go out and get it for themselves.
There is one important exception, however. The reduction in capital-gains taxes for individuals and businesses that Congress agreed to recently -- widely viewed as a rest stop on the way to no capital-gains taxes at all -- is a textbook case of the Government intervening in the economy. That's not how Republican politicians have packaged it, of course. Lower the capital-gains-tax rate, runs the party line, and you take the Government out of the market, allowing it to work its magic. 
 But is this really true? If you believe in the free market you want to minimize the effect of Government policy on economic decisions. And in this respect the capital-gains-tax cut makes a bad situation worse.
 MOST AMERICANS DO NOT enjoy taxable capital gains, and so are not directly influenced by capital-gains-tax rates. But those who do enjoy them -- and they are, by and large, America's affluent -- make an important economic decision. They choose where to invest their capital. Steve Forbes, the candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination who is now leading the charge to eliminate capital-gains taxes, illustrates the nature of this decision nicely. According to disclosure forms recently filed with the Federal Election Commission, Forbes was paid $1,350,000 in 1994 as president of Forbes Inc. While that may seem like a lot, it is chump change when compared with Forbes's large, well-diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Some of Forbes's investments, like his holding of Missouri Pacific Railroad bonds, were clearly chosen because they paid handsome income and dividends. Others, like his shares in the Templeton Growth Fund, which makes risky plays mainly in foreign countries, were chosen because they offered the possibility of big capital gains. The important question now is: how does Steve Forbes decide to invest his next dollar? Does he pursue interest and dividends or capital gains? Does he buy a few more Missouri Pacific Railroad bonds or a few more shares in the Templeton Growth Fund?
As it now stands, Steve Forbes pays a tax rate of 39.6 percent on his returns from his Missouri Pacific Railroad bonds but only 28 percent on his returns from the Templeton Growth Fund. There already exists an 11 percent difference between the highest income-tax rate and capital-gains-tax rates. Should the capital-gains-tax cut for individuals now proposed by Congress become law, the 28 percent rate will drop to 19.8, and Forbes will hand over to the I.R.S. fully twice as much of his returns from the bonds as from the international growth fund. In effect, the United States Government will be saying to Forbes: we prefer more strongly than ever that you roll the dice on those foreign equities, and here's our inducement.
Isn't this exactly the sort of Government interference believers in the free market seek to avoid? Free-marketeers want Forbes to use his ample talents to ferret out investments that are smart on their own terms -- the sort that lead to the economic growth that enriches us all. Lowering the capital-gains tax transforms his every investment decision into a quest not for real growth but for the sharpest tax angle.
In general, the greater the disparity between the upper income-tax bracket and the capital-gains rate the more the Government directly interferes in the investment decisions of the well-to-do, and causes them to make investments that they would not make in a truly free market. Never mind questions of fairness or equity. Anyone seriously interested in minimizing the Government's effect on the economy should push not for lowering the capital-gains tax but for raising it to match the highest marginal income tax rate. The capital-gains-tax rate that least distorts investment decisions is 39 percent. On the other hand, if you believe that the Government can make magic in the market by cutting capital-gains taxes, there is no reason to stop at a zero percent capital-gains tax. We might as well go further and pay people for their capital gains. Then we could have even more of whatever benefits the tax cut brings.
 THE COST TO THE TREASURY of the new Republican industrial policy will fall somewhere between $33 billion and $51 billion over seven years, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The benefits are vague. Obviously a capital-gains-tax cut will help the rich get richer, though that is not how it is being sold to the electorate. The tax cut is being sold as an engine for economic growth. Its proponents speak freely of the animal spirits in the American ether waiting to be unleashed: lowering capital-gains taxes will create a new incentive for all those potential entrepreneurs who previously couldn't see the point of starting their businesses. ("Just found out about the capital-gains-tax cut. Guess I'll start that microchip company after all.") There are obvious problems with this theory of human behavior. One is that it fails to explain even the behavior of the theorists. The chief effect a tax cut will have on Steve Forbes, for instance, will not be to cause him to search for his inner entrepreneur but to rearrange his portfolio and hire a few more accountants so that he can keep more of his unearned income.
The other argument on behalf of Republican industrial policy is that it is a good thing to divert capital into capital-gains-intensive ventures. The tax cut will certainly achieve this result. Once it becomes law there will be more real-estate and stock-market speculations than before. Expect rich people everywhere to sell their Missouri Pacific Railroad bonds and buy more Bolivian equities. But as anyone knows who has gazed upon the empty skyscrapers thrown up during the mid-1980's construction boom, driven by real-estate tax breaks, all investment is not socially productive investment. There is no reason to believe that the quest for capital gains will be any less wasteful than other Government-induced economic behavior. If the Government pays rich people to take stupid risks with their capital, rich people will oblige.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL VIEW;
Something New Under the Sweltering Sun

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
THE CLASSICAL-MUSIC business used to work pretty much like our school systems. People began in the fall, slowed down around holidays and went home at the end of the spring. The school calendar is a remnant of agrarian years, when children were turned loose not to frolic in local shopping malls but to help their parents in the fields.
Music was driven by other concerns. After a hard season of playing and listening, relief was in order. Musicians took summer jobs, taught, played out of town, did nothing. Listeners put their fingers in their ears and went to the beach. The two parties would have had trouble getting together even if they had wanted to. Concert halls weren't air-conditioned, and sweaty suffering in the name of art, while a virtue at Wagner's Bayreuth, had its limits elsewhere. 
 Concert-free summers, I'm afraid, are forgotten idylls. People were talked into finding the outdoors and music amiable companions. Hence the rural festival. Cooling systems have made concert halls into urban refuges from the heat and stench of August. Avery Fisher Hall has many problems, but its air-conditioning gives divine performances: think of a Haydn quartet reconstituted in British thermal units.
Economics have largely caused musical June to bleed into musical July and then into musical August. Players in major orchestras are paid year-round and need something to do. Managements need concert income. Dark theaters cost money. Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, reminds us that an inactive New York State Theater in summer can greet the New York City Opera and Ballet companies with a million-dollar deficit before their new seasons have started.
Lincoln Center has approached the summer music business as an applier of balm. Soothe the weary; placate the put-upon; do it quietly -- this has been its mandate. Home on the range may be stingy with discouraging words, but it has nothing on the Mostly Mozart Festival, a venture aware that listeners fresh from the July broil of the subway will brook no further agitation.
The feel-good esthetic has infiltrated the Center's contemporary culture as well. Take Serious Fun. What a repugnant name, a Uriah Heep among festival titles. Serious Fun sheathes music's cutting edge in euphemism. It tells us that what we are going to hear is substantial but that we shouldn't worry about its getting under our skin. Serious Fun is an eloquent microcosm of summers at Lincoln Center, or it has been until now.
Something new is about to happen: Lincoln Center Festival 96, an urban bouillabaisse of the performing arts, a connoisseur's potluck designed to wake the summer palate. Cunningly devised by my former Times colleague John Rockwell and planned to run between July 22 and Aug. 11, this mix of sweet and sour, whole grain and puree, dares New York to wake up and think at a time of year in which it may not want to.
Samuel Beckett's 19 plays done by Dublin's Gate Theater are hardly a lie-down on some Amagansett beach. Morton Feldman is not a Sousa march on the Fourth of July. Japanese gagaku parts radically from barn-theater revivals of "Carousel" upstate. Virgil Thomson's "Four Saints in Three Acts" is not "La Traviata" in the park.
All is not lost for the timid listener. Offered, too, are events calculated to reassure the forces of reaction while surreptitiously teaching them things they don't already know. How many Mostly Mozart-goers have heard the sound of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and "Missa Solemnis" on period instruments? John Eliot Gardiner, his Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique and the Monteverdi Choir will demonstrate. How many Beethoven lovers know just how obsesssive a composer their hero was? Mr. Gardiner's forces and Kurt Masur's New York Philharmonic will tell them: the first with the nascent opera "Leonore" in concert, the second with the opera "Leonore" finally became: "Fidelio."
 THE ARGUMENT FOR THIS festival, the one that lurks beneath the practicalities, takes the form of a hope: that New York and its visitors are ready for heavy-duty stimulation during the dog days of a New York summer. Yes, Edinburgh does very nicely at such things, but Edinburgh is never 90 degrees in the shade.
Mr. Rockwell and his team have done their job well. The balances are good: common-denominator programming, spice added, to go with an amalgam of freshness, color and abrasiveness. What better metaphors than these for life in this wonderful if exasperating city.
So the courtship has begun. The suitor's pitch sounds persuasive, but the suit is at a disadvantage, not knowing precisely where the object of its affections is. Who is going to come to these events now that they have been gathered with such laborious care and industry? I wonder if Lincoln Center knows much more than I do. It is a grand experiment in any case, and I want to know what the equation will yield.
Deep in my heart, I wish that the whole thing would go away, that music would lock up for the summer and find its own beach to lie on. The information explosion is just that, an explosion. Explosions hurt things, culture included. But the Lincoln Center Festival 96 is upon us, whether I like it or not; and if it has to be, let's be grateful that so much of its thoughtfulness and adventure has survived the weight of bureaucratic pressure. Nonprofit organizations thrive on caution. and this festival takes a few chances. I wish it well.

 BODY:
IN September, after Hurricane Luis howled through the island of Dominica, bashing crops, knocking down trees and pushing the Caribbean into a casual seaside inn, the innkeepers went to work cleaning up and repainting.
The 11-room Castle Comfort Lodge -- homey and comfortable but no castle -- came through shiningly. Water had flowed into the lower level but the rooms were soon livable again, the facade fresh white and the porch overlooking the sea as pleasant as ever. 
 But the telephone kept ringing with questions from anxious reservation holders. The owner's wife, Ginette Perryman, could only shake her head.
"People were worried," she said, "about hurricanes in February." The hurricane season ends on Thursday.
The Caribbean is reaping a whirlwind of worries in the wake of September's hurricanes and lesser storms. Though most of the damaged islands are ready for visitors, two weeks before the winter season begins, the storms' effects continue. According to the American Society of Travel Agents, 48 percent of 425 travel agents surveyed in a poll in late October said reports of damage had caused a drop in Caribbean travel.
"It's the worst season we've experienced since the 1930's in terms of the number of storms," said Michael Youngman, the Caribbean Tourism Organization's sales director. "It was an incredibly bad season."
Even islands that escaped major storm damage are having problems, largely because of air-service curtailment. "Nature took good care of us," said Mike Myers, the owner of Saba Deep Dive Center, alluding to the minor damage to his island. "The irony now is, we've been economically devastated because the airport on St. Maarten has been closed to tourism." Saba's air service is dependent upon St. Maarten's international airport, which reopened to tourists on Nov. 1.
With air service to the region still curtailed and wholesalers still somewhat leery of the hardest-hit islands, travelers to the Caribbean will have to work harder to get there.
Some travelers are turning to Caribbean Connection Plus, of Trumbull, Conn., (203) 261-8603, which develops and sells packages to island-hoppers and is urging clients to route trips through San Juan, where connections can be made with inter-island airlines, whose prices are more competitive.
The company president, Carol Banner, is promoting a new package, "In Search of Volcanoes," to add to its other packages like "In Search of Sharks." The volcano package features islands with extinct, dormant and live volcanoes and little or no hurricane damage: St. Eustatius, Martinique, Grenada and either Montserrat or Dominica, depending on seismic events. Montserrat's volcano is bellowing steam, ash and, on occasion, rocks. Scientists advise not to sightsee near the volcano, though the island is open to tourism.
According to travel wholesalers, winter bookings indicate that the beneficiaries of September's disasters include Aruba, which is outside the hurricane zone; Barbados, which was virtually untouched; and Jamaica, St. Lucia and the Bahamas, which were not hit. All are ready with new attractions. Aruba recently opened Tierra del Sol, an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course, the island's first. Aruba also has a new 413-room Marriott Resort and Casino.
Barbados has a new 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course at the Royal Westmoreland resort in St. James. Jamaica and the Bahamas have new Superclubs all-inclusive resorts: the 400-room Breezes Bahamas and the 124-room Breezes Montego Bay. In January a Superclubs competitor, Sandals, will open the 196-room Sandals Royal Bahamian on Nassau.
St. Lucia now has nonstop air service from Kennedy International Airport on the recently privatized BWIA International Airways. St. Lucia's popularity was growing even before the storms, with 47,997 American tourists traveling there from January to June, a 13.7 percent increase over the same period last year. BWIA has also started twice-a-week service to Tobago from New York and Miami, and in December and January will fly nonstop once a week from Miami to St. Kitts.
And there is a fresh gambling attraction in the Bahamas. Marriott's Crystal Palace resort on Nassau has installed a sports betting bar called Sports Book. Next door is Phil's Sports Bar and Deli, where gamblers can watch the action on 10 32-inch television screens and snack on kosher pickles -- perfect for sports lovers who loathe the sun.
Following is an island-by-island report:
 
Anguilla
Anguilla Tourist Information Office, 775 Park Avenue, Huntington, N.Y. 11743; (800) 553-4939 and (516) 271-2600
Hurricane Luis pounded Anguilla with winds gusting to 200 miles an hour, but the small island stood fast, thanks to rigorous construction codes introduced after a 1960 hurricane. Hurricane Marilyn's rain, Anguillans say, merely freshened the foliage.
One of the northernmost islands in the Lesser Antilles, some 16 miles long and no more than three and a half miles wide, Anguilla has some of the Caribbean's glossiest hotels and 35 fine beaches.
Popular spots like Johnno's beach bar at Sandy Ground set up generators and were open for business within days after Luis, and Anguillans all over the island have been working to prepare for winter.
Cap Juluca, (800) 323-0139 and (809) 497-6779, fax (809) 497-6617, its 98 rooms in 18 striking, stark white beachside villas on Maundays Bay, has two absurdly romantic seaside restaurants: Chattertons and Pimms. Main dishes at Pimms, reopening early January, include shellfish lasagna ($20), grilled crayfish ($35) and rack of lamb with black olives and rosemary sauce ($33).
Cap Juluca expects to reopen Dec. 15 after renovations and repairs to cosmetic damage and beach erosion caused by Luis. A 790-square-foot luxury double room will be $595, a three-bedroom villa with private pool $2,775 a day, not including the 18 percent tax. All rates include Continental breakfast.
The elegant 53-room Malliouhana Hotel, (800) 835-0796 or (809) 497-6111, fax (809) 497-6011, overlooks the milelong Meads Bay. The hotel's spectacular beach, which was eroded by the storm, is slowly rebuilding itself. Malliouhana's landscaping suffered greatly, but the gardens are being recreated. Double rates are $480 in a garden room. An oceanside double is $575. The hotel reopened Nov. 17.
At La Sirena Hotel and Villas, (800) 331-9358 or (809) 497-6827, on Meads Bay, two-bedroom deluxe villas for four are $410 a day in winter; a standard two-bedroom villa is $295. Doubles in the 20-bedroom hotel start at $230 for two people, plus 18 percent tax. This congenial hotel, on an excellent beach, is a very good value.
Across the island at Shoal Bay East, Uncle Ernie's beach restaurant, (809) 497-3907, has rebuilt and is serving rum punches and grilled fish, chicken and ribs (ribs or chicken with coleslaw and French fries and a beer are less than $10; fresh fish with a drink is $12).
Shoal Bay beach, near the top of any listing of the Caribbean's best, is wider than ever after the storm.
 
Antigua
Antigua Department of Tourism, Suite 311, 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 541-4117
By late September, the island's hurricane-whipped hillsides were greening. Most major hotels expect to be repaired and open for the winter season if they are not open already.
Antigua, scalloped with harbors and coves, made its mark as a sailor's heaven. In the 18th century Britain's West Indian fleet caught its breath here.
English Harbour, which sheltered the ships in the hurricane season, is a deep notch on Antigua's southeast coast, the home of Nelson's Dockyard, named for the fleet's premier sailor, Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson. The harbor's old wood and brick dockyard buildings survived the hurricanes with hardly a scratch.
Today scores of sailing ships gather in Antigua each spring for an intense week of racing and partying. The Antigua Race Week, April 28 to May 4 next year, brings together serious and not-so-serious sailors and attracts more than 200 racing yachts. Hotels, rental cars, airlines -- all are booked far ahead for that time.
For sailors without boats, Nicholson Yacht Charters, which has offices in the United States, (800) 662-6066, fax (617) 661-0554, is located in English Harbor and is the agent for a fleet of 80 to 100 yachts. Every boat survived the hurricanes. The vessels range from trim, wooden yachts with teak decks and clipper bows to roomier, more modern boats.
Chartering the 41-foot sloop Lost Horizon with a British captain and a mate-chef costs $3,850 for two people and $4,830 for four, with meals but not drinks. The charter costs cover seven 24-hour periods.
Attractive lodgings are available near the sailing action. Within the dockyard, now part of a national park, are two popular inns. The 14-room Admiral's Inn, (800) 223-5695 and (809) 460-1027, fax (809) 460-1534, with its old brick, hand-hewn beams and wrought-iron chandeliers, weathered the storms. The dining room is in a romantic setting at the water's edge. Rates for a double range from $108 to $132, plus 7 percent tax and 10 percent service. (The island's hotel tax might rise to 8.5 percent in late December).
The Copper and Lumber Store Hotel, (800) 275-0877 or (809) 460-1058, fax (809) 460-1529, in a 1783 building, has 14 suites or studios, each named after one of Lord Nelson's ships. Some are furnished with antiques; each has a kitchen and living room. Winter rates start at $195, plus 7 percent tax and 10 percent service charge.
On 10 acres of the national park, the Inn at English Harbor, (809) 460-1014, fax (809) 460-1603, offers 28 elegant rooms on the beachfront and on a hillside with a panoramic view of the dockyard. Some beachfront rooms were damaged by the hurricanes but have been redone. On the Terrace Restaurant and Bar, there is candlelight dining; breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea are served at the Beach Bar and Restaurants at water's edge. Double rates from Dec. 20 to mid-March start at $270, plus 10 percent service and 7 percent tax. Current rates range from $120 to $190 for two people, double occupancy.
The Falmouth Harbor Beach Apartments, (800) 223-5695, fax (809) 460-1534, which were undamaged, are close to English Harbor on a small private beach with Pigeon Point Beach nearby.
The 23 studio apartments have kitchenettes, ceiling fans and private patios or balconies. Supermarkets, restaurants and bars are within walking distance. The studios start at $120 a day, plus tax and service; room rates include the use of some water-sports equipment.
 
 Aruba
Aruba Tourism Authority, 1000 Harbor Boulevard, Weehawken, N.J. 07087; (201) 330-0800 and (800) 862-7822
Like its neighbors, Bonaire and Curacao, Aruba lies outside the hurricane belt that envelops most of the Caribbean.
Miles of powdery white-sand beaches edge the island, past a sprawl of hotels and casinos -- the casinos, along with its beaches, are Aruba's main attraction. The 11 casinos range from a small, casual gambling house to glittering palaces in the luxury hotels. And its beaches are among the best in the Caribbean. In the clear aquamarine sea windsurfers race ahead of brisk prevailing winds.
In recent years Aruba's tourism has burgeoned, thanks in part to gambling -- blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, mini-baccarat, slot machines and Caribbean stud poker, reputedly invented in an Aruban casino. Government surveys show that casinos lure about half the visitors to the small, desert-like island with rocky red hills, less than 20 miles north of Venezuela.
The island's largest gambling house and the newest sit near two of the best beaches, Palm and Eagle, in a seven-mile swath along the west coast.
The new casino, which opened this summer, is the 10,700-square-foot Stellaris in the Aruba Marriott Resort in Palm Beach, some two miles from the capital of Oranjestad, (800) 223-6388, or (29 78) 69000, fax (29 78) 60649. There are 26 gambling tables and 223 slot machines.
The resort faces 600 feet of the Caribbean along Palm Beach. The 413 rooms, with private balconies, are on eight floors. There is a free-form swimming pool with waterfalls, a health club, exercise classes and volleyball. Winter rates for two range from $230 to $380 a night, plus a 11 percent service charge and a 5.5 percent room tax.
The Royal Cabana Casino, Eagle Beach, near Oranjestad, (29 78) 79000, is expanding but already has 320 slot machines and 33 gaming tables with blackjack, baccarat, roulette and craps.
The casino is a companion to La Cabana All Suite Beach Resort, (212) 251-1710 in New York State, (800) 835-7193 outside New York, fax (29 78) 75474. The resort, on Eagle Beach, has 803 suites, a fitness center with squash and racquetball, three swimming pools, five tennis courts and programs for children and teen-agers. All suites have a whirpool, kitchenette, balcony or patio. For most of the winter, double rates will start at $205 a night, not including tax.
Sports betting is done Las Vegas-style at the Grand Holiday Casino, (29 78) 67777, fax (29 78) 65555, 230 L. G. Smith Boulevard, inside the Holiday Inn Aruba on Palm Beach. Bets -- from $2 to $1,000 -- are placed on horse races seen on television and on baseball, basketball, football, golf, tennis and other sports events.
The trade winds that sweep Aruba have also swept in fleets of windsurfers. A favorite place for the boards is to the north of the island at the Fishermen's Huts area, where the water is shallow and calm.
Windsurfing and hotel packages are offered by the California-based Vela Windsurf Resorts (800) 223-5443, fax (415) 525-2086. The weekly rate for the Marriott package starts at $1,450 a person, double occupancy, including equipment, accommodations, tax and service. For beginners, the price is $1,350 and includes one free lesson and use of beginner equipment.
Windsurf Village, 462 L. G. Smith Boulevard, Malmok, about three miles northwest of Oranjestad, is a 40-unit inn across the road from a Fishermen's Huts launching area. The accommodations, in four buildings, range from basic rooms with kitchenettes to two-bedroom apartments. Private windsurfing lessons are $50 an hour. The village's seven-day winter package, booked through Sailboard Vacations, (800) 252-1070, fax (617) 829-8809, starts at $699 a person, double occupancy, with tax, windsurfing gear and Continental breakfast. The rates apply from Dec. 20 to June 16.
 
The Bahamas
Bahamas Tourism Center, 150 East 52d Street, New York, N.Y. 10022; (212) 758-2777
The 700 islands begin 52 miles east of Florida and end about 50 miles north of Haiti. In between there are casinos, golf courses, colorful diving spots, quiet villages, jet skis -- and long stretches of empty beaches.
New Providence, home of the capital, Nassau, has the brightest lights. Recently, most major hotels on the island have changed hands and are undergoing or have had face lifts.
On Paradise Island, connected to Nassau by a bridge, more than 800 slot machines blink around the clock in the casino at the new 1,147-room Atlantis Paradise Island, (800) 321-3000, fax (305) 893-2866. For children and aquatic types, a kitschy water theme is carried out through mock caves, grottos, a quarter-mile Lazy River Ride and a 3.2-million-gallon aquarium with 132 species of tropical fish.
Doubles start at $185 a night midweek, $265 weekends, plus 10 percent tax and a $10 surcharge.
The 30,000-square-foot casino has 44 blackjack tables, among other games.
Greens fees at the hotel's 18-hole golf course, with five holes seaside, are $60 for guests, $100 for non-guests.
On New Providence, the newly renovated Radisson Cable Beach Casino and Golf Resort (809) 327-6000, fax (809) 327-6987, has an 18-hole golf course and 700 rooms, some decorated in bright pinks, yellows and greens. The hotel offers an all-inclusive plan through its Splash program: the nightly rate range from $390 to $410 for two people, with meals, wine and greens fees.
The largest casino in the Bahamas -- 35,000 square feet and 750 slot machines -- belongs to the Nassau Marriott Resort and Crystal Palace Casino, which is next to the Radisson.
The country's first sports betting bar, Sports Book, is a new attraction at the hotel, (800) 222-7466 or (809) 327-6200 for reservations, fax (809) 327-6735, where a $30 million renovation is muting its screeching purples and reds to softer tropical colors. There are 743 rooms and 94 corner suites, all with balconies.
The hotel's midweek winter room rates start at $119 for a double; the rate Thursday to Saturday starts at $139. Tax is an extra 10 percent.
At the more secluded South Ocean Golf and Beach Resort, (800) 241-6615, fax (809) 362-4728, the 250 rooms have balconies or patios. Its own dive shop, a P.G.A.-rated golf course, tennis courts and a good beach on the other side of the island from busier Cable Beach are other attractions. Winter double rates start at $165, plus 8 percent tax and $2.35 a day a person for maid service.
On clear nights, Florida's lights beam to Grand Bahama, home of the city of Freeport, a golfing center and port with a Floridian air.
The 956-room Bahamas Princess Resort and Casino, Freeport, Grand Bahama Island, (800) 223-1818, fax (809) 352-4485, has domes, arches, pools, waterfalls, a 20,000-square-foot casino and two 18-hole golf courses. Winter doubles start at $120 a night, plus 8 percent tax and a nightly $7.50 service charge. Greens fees are $56 for guests and non-guests. Five-night golf packages start at $510 a person, double occupancy, with a daily round of golf, cart, tax and gratuities.
In the Abacos islands in the northern Bahamas, there are villages, long stretches of quiet beaches and convenient snorkeling.
The upscale Green Turtle Club and Marina, (800) 688-4752 or (809) 365-4271, fax (809) 365-4272, is on Green Turtle Cay, three and a half miles long and a half-mile wide. The resort has 25 rooms, three suites, seven efficiency units and seven villas. The marina can accommodate yachts up to 150 feet long. Winter double rates, effective Jan. 2 to April 14, start at $149 a room, plus a 15 percent tax and service charge. The rate from Dec. 22 to Jan. 1 is $184 a room.
High cliffs on one side and curved beaches on the other characterize breezy Long Island in the south. The Stella Maris Inn, (800) 426-0466 or (809) 338-2050, fax (954) 359-8238, offers access to scuba diving, snorkeling, bone, reef and deep-sea fishing. At Conception Island, one of the dive spots, a wall descends 6,000 feet.
The inn -- 60 units in an assortment of buildings, villas and cottages -- sprawls on a hill with views of the Atlantic and Caribbean. Winter doubles start at $130, plus $18 tax, which includes sailing, boat cruises, daily excursions, bicycles and light entertainment. A five-night all-inclusive scuba package, $2,078 for a couple, includes a flight from Nassau or Fort Lauderdale.
 
Barbados
Barbados Tourism Authority, 800 Second Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 986-6516 and (800) 221-9831
The British arrived in the early 1600's and set about turning the jungle into lucrative sugar plantations. Barbados belonged to Britain until 1966 and is still British in tone, especially in its attention to old houses and gardens.
The symbols of sugar's glory days are the island's great houses, where the plantation owners or their agents lived. Some remain today with the original design more or less intact. One of the island's important historic houses, 300-year-old Sunbury, was lost this year to fire, not to hurricane winds, which mostly bypassed Barbados.
The Barbados National Trust stars the most notable structures in its annual Open House program, a highlight of the winter season. The houses are different every year, and range from 17th-century great houses to opulent modern villas built by expatriates, most not ordinarily open to the public.
The tours will run next year from Jan. 10 to April 3, on Wednesdays from 2:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M., with one house open each Wednesday. Reservations: (809) 426-2421, fax (809) 429-9055. Admission to each costs $6, including a drink and a tour of the gardens.
One of the island's most important historic houses, St. Nicholas Abbey, (809) 422-8725, a Jacobean house built in the mid-1600's, is open year-round. The abbey, in St. Peter Parish, has Dutch gables and a herb garden, and a displayed inventory of the old plantation's assets, including a list of slaves by name with their values. Open weekdays 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. Entry fee: $2.50.
A short drive away is the shell of Farley Hill House, recently gutted by fire. The site is now a national park, (809) 422-3555, with a splendid view of the island's entire northeastern rim. There is no entrance fee for pedestrians, but those arriving by car are charged $3.
The National Trust recently opened Tyrol Cot Heritage Village, (809) 424-2074, Codrington Hill, St. Michael, built around an 1854 Palladian-style house, made of coral stone. Tyrol Cot was most recently the home of Sir Grantley Adams, who led Barbados' struggle for independence. His wife, Lady Adams, lived in the house until her death in 1990. The village is a museum of the folk architecture seen in small traditional Bajan dwellings, the moveable chattel houses, early wooden versions of mobile homes. Each is a copy of a traditional design, perfected in 1930. Visitors can see artists and potters at work in the village, open week-days 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Entry fee: $5.
The National Trust is also caretaker of several gardens, including the tropical Andromeda Gardens, (809) 433-9384, spread across a slope near the scenic Atlantic east coast. Verdant with hibiscus, orchids, cactuses, palms and ferns, and an indigenous tree, the Bearded Fig, the gardens overlook a fishing village, Tent Bay. Entrance fee: $5, children $2.50.
Welchman Hall Gully, (809) 426-2421, was a series of caves until the roofs fell in. On the grounds, once part of a plantation of citrus and spice trees, visitors can take a relaxing walkon shady paths. Open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Entrance fee: $5, children $2.50.
The National Trust sells a package of tickets to 16 historic sites and other attractions through its Heritage Passport Program; $35 for 16 attractions or $18 for five.
The island can also be toured on free organized Sunday hikes: 6 A.M., 3 P.M. or 3:30 P.M, full moon walks, 5:30 P.M. For information, call the National Trust.
 
 Bonaire
Bonaire Government Tourist Office, 10 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 900, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 956-5911 and (800) 826-6247
Small, quiet Bonaire, near Aruba and Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles, is among a handful of the world's best diving spots. Diving, snorkeling and windsurfing are the lures for most visitors. Bird-watching, especially flamingo watching, is a bonus.
 A few things set Bonaire apart. A well-regulated Marine Park protects its entire coastline, ringed by reefs. Divers find spectacular, pristine coral gardens, walls and sponges teeming with parrotfish, trumpetfish, reef squid and angelfish.
 Many of the best sites are accessible to snorkelers in extremely clear water. Spearfishing is banned and permanent moorings are set up for yachts. Certified divers pay a fee of $10 for a one-year Marine Park permit, which allows access to the 80 dive sites, all marked by buoys.
 Bonaire is unusual in its wealth of shore dives. One spot, Windsock, also excellent for snorkeling, lies virtually at the foot of the airport runway. Another, Alice in Wonderland with its Garden Eel colony, is just steps off the main road. The obvious attraction is practically unlimited diving at minimal cost, since boat charters aren't required.
 The Salt City dive trip can be combined with bird-watching. Flocks of flamingos wade through the briny shallows of the solar salt works' ponds, where striking pyramids of salt rise from a lunar landscape. Bonaire's flamingos number nearly 10,000 in breeding season, almost as much as the human population. Some flamingos can be seen from the road.
 flamingos and wild parrots can also be seen in Washington-Slagbaai Park on the dry, hilly northern end of the 100-square-mile island. The park is open from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily but not holidays; $3, $1 for children.
Klein Bonaire, an uninhabited cay less than a mile off Bonaire's west coast, is ringed with dive sites -- 24 in all, starting at depths of only 20 feet, including Knife, notable for snorkeling, and the lush Carl's Hill.
 Windsurfing is most popular at Lac Bay's shallow, protected waters on the southeast coast. Windsurfing and kayaking rentals are available through Windsurfing Bonaire, (800) 748-8733. Board rentals are $20 an hour, $50 a day, $225 a week, rising to $240 on Jan. 1. A two-person kayak is $35 a day.
 Most divers going to Bonaire buy packages through their hotels.
 Captain Don's Habitat, 103 Kaya Gobernador De Brop, (800) 327-6709, fax (305) 371-2337, offers diving 24 hours a day and accommodations in 72 units: suites, cottages and oceanfront villas with kitchens, living rooms and decks or patios. There is a pool and open air restaurant. Night shore diving is available from a flood-lighted pier. Two snorkeling reefs run parallel to the beach. Five-day/four-night dive packages begin at $455 a person, double occupancy, including three boat dives and unlimited shore diving.
The Sand Dollar Beach Club, (800) 288-4773, fax (407) 774-9322, 79 Gobernador North Debrot, has 84 condominiums ranging from studios to three bedrooms done in pastels, wicker and rattan. There is a dive and photo center, a pool with bar, a minuscule sand beach and baby-sitting services, and the Green Parrot Restaurant on the waterfront. A children's program includes snorkeling. A studio rents for $160 a night.
 At the tiny Sunset Inn, (800) 344-4439, fax (305) 225-0527, with a terrace overlooking the Bay of Kralendijk, there are two suites and five rooms; some have kitchenettes. Within walking distance of town, the inn is next door to a dive center. Rates start at $55 a night.
 
 Cayman Islands
Cayman Islands Department of Tourism, 420 Lexington Avenue, Suite 2733, New York, N.Y. 10170; (212) 682-5582
The three islands, Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, have magnificent underwater scenery in a pellucid sea, unroiled by this year's hurricanes.
Among the many compelling sights, at Stingray City in the North Sound, divers consort with Southern Stingrays that swim in daily to feed and play.
As recently as the early 1960's, visitors ploughed through swarms of mosquitoes and unpaved roads to reach the underwater views. Divers today have no need to rough it. More than 40 dive operators cater to every skill level.
Accommodations range from plush hotels to simple guesthouses.
The new 340-room Westin Casuarina Resort, (800) 228-3000, fax (809) 949-5825, on Grand Cayman's Seven Mile Beach has a dive shop, gardens, fountains and waterfalls. Guest rooms have French doors and balconies overlooking the sea. Winter double room rates vary from month to month; February starts at $275, plus 20 percent tax and service.
The 236-room Hyatt Regency (800) 233-1234, fax (809) 949-8528, on West Bay Road in Grand Cayman has a dive shop, water sports and one of the island's two golf courses. The resort is a short walk from Seven Mile Beach. Double room rates start at $300. Dive packages are offered in conjunction with Red Sail Sports, a fully equipped water-sports operator, (800) 255-6425 or (809) 949-8745, fax (809) 947-5808. A three-night package for certified divers is $579, the Scuba School three-night package is $679.
For the real dive nut, Sunset House, (800) 854-4767, fax (809) 949-7101, lies on Grand Cayman's shore, near a reef, a mile south of Georgetown, the capital. A casual seaside spot, it has 59 rooms, some with sea views. Three-night double occupancy dive packages start at $362.50 a person, plus $40.50 tax and service. Room-only rates start at $125 a night, plus 20 percent tax and service.

On Little Cayman, dirt roads meander through the mangroves. The island is home to iguanas, the 202-acre Booby Pond Nature Reserve, thousands of red-footed boobies and 100 pairs of magnificent frigate birds.
Offshore, Bloody Bay Wall starts in 20 feet of water and drops deep into the oceanic blue of the Cayman trench. Snorkeling is possible over the dropoff. Divers can venture through tunnels and rifts, starting in the shallows, and move down and out to spectacular stretches of wall diving.
At the casual Little Cayman Beach Resort, (800) 327-3835 or (809) 948-1033, fax (809) 948-1040, at Blossom Village, there are 32 rooms, a dive shop and photo center. Rooms have air-conditioning, ceiling fans, satellite television but no phones. Molly the Manta is a frequent visitor during night dives. A five-night all-inclusive double occupancy dive package covers four days of diving, meals, drinks and three boat dives a day: $1,159.
On Cayman Brac, a bluff stretches the length of the island. There is a 180-acre parrot reserve and below the waves, sheer walls and plentiful marine life. The Divi Tiara Beach Resort, (800) 367-3484, fax (809) 948-7316, has 59 rooms, a pool and a Peter Hughes Dive and Photo Center.

 Curacao
Curacao Tourist Board, 475 Park Avenue, Suite 2000, New York, N.Y. 10016; (212) 683-7660 or (800) 270-3350
At first glance, Curacao -- which lies outside the hurricane zone -- appears to have been misplaced. So much pastel Dutch colonial architecture should not exist on a dry island 40 miles north of Venezuela.
Curacao's architecture is unique in the Caribbean. From the narrow streets of Willemstad, the capital city, to the cactus-studded countryside, the former mansions and plantation houses of Dutch colonists evoke the past.
In offshore waters, snorkelers and divers find action along a coral reef.
The seat of government for the Netherlands Antilles, the island is part worldly-Europe, part small-town Caribbean.
Willemstad is split by the narrow Santa Anna Bay and has long had a split personality as well. Upscale Punda, "the point," was once the city's commercial center and home to the island's Dutch Protestant elite. The island's significant Jewish population built their elegant neo-classical homes in neighboring Sharloo, now an up-and-coming business district.
The two sides are joined by a floating bridge. After several decades of neglect, Otrobanda has been making a comeback. Old waterfront buildings have been turned into small shops and restaurants.
In Punda, the pastel merchants' buildings, gracefully gabled, have always housed shops on their ground floors. Today they sell everything from expensive jewelry and linens to budget clothing and electronics, tax-free. Along the waterfront, Venezuelan merchants sell fresh fish and vegetables at the floating market.
Among the architectural treasures, the graceful Mikve Israel-Emanuel synagogue, 29 Hanchi Snoa, (5999) 611067, in Punda, dedicated in 1732, is said to be the oldest continuously operating synagogue in the western world. It's home to the Jewish Historical Museum and both are open weekdays, 9 A.M. to 11:45 A.M., 2:30 P.M. to 4:45 P.M. Museum entry fee: $2. Services start at 6:30 P.M. Fridays and 10 A.M. Saturdays.
Old City Tours, (5999) 613554, offers walking tours of Otrobanda and Scharloo conducted by a knowledgeable architect. Tickets are $5, including a drink.
The Curacao Tourism Development Bureau, (5999) 616000, in a renovated old mansion at 19 Pietermaai, (5999) 616000, offers information and maps for self-guided tours. Open weekdays 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Outside Willemstad, more than a dozen former plantation houses (landhuis) have been restored and given new life as guesthouses, restaurants and government offices.
Northeast of town, Landhuis Brievengat, (5999) 378344, a popular night spot, is a place to linger over early evening drinks and, on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, dance until late. You can sample the local Amstel beer, $2.25, brewed from distilled seawater, or a cocktail made from Curacao liqueur, flavored with orange peel, $3. A museum exhibits antiques and household artifacts; open 9:15 A.M. to 12:15 P.M. and 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. Monday to Saturday, entry $1.
In the western countryside, near popular beaches, Landhuis Kenepa, (5999) 640244, also known as Knip, is a promotion center for Afro-Curacaoan culture. The house was built in 1700 and a century later was the scene of an important slave uprising. Open 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. weekdays and Sundays. Entry fee: $2.
Off the protected southern beaches, there is good snorkeling along the rocky ledges that define the coves. Among the better spots are Kas Abao, the calm waters of sheltered Lagun, rustic Port St. Marie and Vaersenbaai.
Curacao's dive reputation is growing. The eastern third of the sheltered southern coast lies in a protected Underwater Park, which offers a variety of dive levels.
Peter Hughes Diving, (800) 932-6237, fax (305) 669-9475, based at the Princess Beach Hotel, 8 Martin Luther King Boulevard, has daily boat dives. A two-tank dive is $55, including tanks, weights and belts; unlimited shore diving is $33 for three days, two night dives a week are $35 each.
 
 Dominica
 Consulate of the Commonweath of Dominica, 820 Second Avenue, Suite 900, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 599-8478
 Rising from a sapphire sea, rugged green mountains define the landscape of Dominica, an island carpeted by virgin rain forest and crisscrossed by mountain streams with waterfalls. Such scenic splendors have attracted increasing numbers of hikers, divers and bird-watchers in recent years.
 The 290-square-mile island lies between Guadeloupe and Martinique; its 71,000 residents live mostly in the capital city of Roseau on the west coast. Hurricane damage was mainly to crops. Much of the mountainous interior is reachable only on foot and most hikes require a guide. The hike to the spectacular 150-foot Trafalgar Falls, in the south central part of the island, begins with an effortless 10-minute walk from the road, which becomes more difficult as the path disintegrates into a trail of man-size boulders, swirling streams and moss-covered rocks. A recent rock slide has blocked part of the waterfall from hikers.
 A trip to the Syndicate Nature Trail offers an unusual walk through virgin rain forest, where visitors often spot the endangered Jaco and Sisserou parrots.
 Volcanic action created Dominica, and beneath the surface the island still bubbles and gurgles in fumaroles and steaming springs. Boiling Lake, one of the world's largest, is a 200-foot-wide cauldron of milky liquid simmering in a volcanic crater in the southern section of the island. The hike to the lake is an eight-hour bone-crunching trek nearly straight up and over ridges that drop 200 feet on both sides, then into the Valley of Desolation, a landscape of bubbling mud and sulfurous vapor, and finally, up to the edge of the lake.
 Guided trips to Trafalgar Falls, Boiling Lake and the Syndicate Nature Trail are offered by Ken's Hinterland Adventure Tours, (809) 448-4850, fax (809) 448-8486. The price for a trip to the Syndicate Nature Trail and Trafalgar Falls is $100 for one to four people. The trip to the falls usually includes a stop at Titou Gorge, a rushing river nearly enclosed by stone walls overhead. The hike to Boiling Lake costs $120 for one to four people.
 Most scuba diving is done off Scotts Head on the southern coast. The tops of the reefs, where the coral was weakest, were damaged by Hurricane Luis, according to Billy Lawrence, an instructor for Dive Dominica, but deeper down the coral is intact. Dive Dominica, affiliated with Castle Comfort Lodge, (809) 448-2188, fax (809)448-6088, just south of Roseau, runs two-tank boat dives for $70, usually leaving at 9 A.M. and returning about 1 P.M. Night dives are $45.
 The Castle Comfort, next to the dive shop, is a friendly 11-room lodge with island-style cooking. Hurricane winds and water pounded the inn and blew the leaves off trees but did no structural damage. Rooms have been repainted and are back in order. A seven-night hotel-and-dive package, including 10 dives, breakfast and dinner, airport transfers and taxes, costs $799 a person, double occupancy.
 A new attraction for nature lovers is expected to open sometime next month at the base of Morne Anglais, a mountain southeast of Roseau. The family-run Exotica Resort (809) 448-7895, fax (809) 448-3855, has eight cottages built of hardwood trees that grow on the island. River bathing is nearby, along with rain forest hiking trails. An elfin woodland grows at the top of Morne Anglais, 3,683 feet up. Double rates will start at $172, including tax and service. Children under 12 will not be charged. For a week's stay there will be a 10 percent discount, two weeks 15 percent. The resort plans to operate a shuttle into Roseau, about a 10-minute drive away.
 
Dominican Republic
 Dominican Republic Tourist Office, 1501 Broadway, Suite 410, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 575-4966 and (800) 752-1151
 Entire villages could fit with ease into some of the Dominican Republic's immense resorts, which sprawl over nearly 1,000 miles of coastline and 250 miles of beaches. On the north coast, smaller hotels emphasize two of the country's favorite pastimes: whale-watching and windsurfing.
 The Dominican Republic covers two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola; unlike Haiti, which occupies the rest, the country is politically stable. Santo Domingo, the capital, has 11 casino hotels, but the behemoth resorts lie outside the city. Near the town of La Romana east of the capital, guests at Casa de Campo, (800) 877-3643, fax (305) 858-4577, can golf on two 18-hole courses, swim in 14 pools, swing racquets on 13 clay courts, play polo on four fields, lie on a beach half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide, or visit a mock 16th-century Mediterranean village on a nearby hill, where artists work. Casa de Campo sits on 7,000 acres with nine restaurants and seven bars and open air lounges
 The resort has 300 "casitas," rooms with airy decor and private balconies, and a group of two- to four-bedroom villas with living rooms, kitchens and terraces or family rooms. Casita double-room non-inclusive rates start at $180 a night, plus 23 percent tax and service charge. The all-inclusive casita-and-golf packages are $252 a person, double occupancy.
 In the country's easternmost region, the Punta Cana section has 27 miles of splendid wide white beaches and an offshore reef. The Bavaro Beach Resort, (800) 858-0606, fax (809) 686-5859, is virtually a small city. It includes an 18-hole golf course, a three-mile beach, and almost 2,000 rooms in five hotels. The Bavaro Golf hotel, suitable for families, offers visitors two- and three-bedroom apartments equipped with small refrigerators for $100 a person a night.
 The Bavaro Palace hotel has a casino and 595 deluxe rooms, most with ocean views. The decor is Caribbean bright with wicker and rattan. The Palace's all-inclusive daily double rate: $236 a person. Double rates at the other hotels -- Bavaro Beach, Bavaro Casino and Bavaro Garden -- start at $145, including breakfast and dinner, tax and service. The all-inclusive price is an extra $25 a person a day, covering all meals, drinks, entertainment, non-motorized water sports and golf.
 Although the 350-room Punta Cana Beach Resort, (800) 972-2139, fax (809) 541-2286, is smaller than the Bavaro, it has its own international airport, five restaurants and three bars. It lies on 105 acres near the large National Park of the East, which has remote beaches and caves. Working with the Parks Department, archeologists and environmentalists, the resort recently created a 150-acre nature path around 11 springs.
 The rooms, some in two- and three-bedroom villas, are decorated in soft pastels with wicker and rattan furniture. Double rates start at $144, including breakfast and dinner, tax and service, windsurfing, snorkeling and kayaking.
 On the north coast, in a scenic bay, Cabarete attracts windsurfers from Europe and elsewhere but it has kept its out-of-the-way tone. The morning breezes are gentle and good for novices; experts prefer the afternoon winds, which often build up to 25 knots. The prime windsurf season is May to mid-September. In winter, the wind is less consistent and the waves bigger.
 Cabarete has an assortment of small hotels, condos and guesthouses. The California-based Vela Highwind Centers, (800) 223-5443, fax (415) 525-2086, offers windsurf packages starting at $375 a person a week, double occupancy, including tax.
 The Bay of Samana on the country's northeast corner attracts whale-watchers between January and March, when more than 1,000 humpback whales swim to the bay for breeding. The secluded Hotel Gran Bahia, (809) 538-3111, fax (809) 538-2764, is on a cliff with dramatic views over the bay. Its main building was once a Victorian mansion. The hotel has 108 rooms, 8 suites and 8 villas. Rooms are decked out in wicker with balconies or terraces. Graceful stairs lead to adjacent beaches. Double all-inclusive rates start at $100 a person.
 
Grenada
 Grenada Board of Tourism, 820 Second Avenue, Suite 900 D, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 687-9554
Grenada rises from a coastline of curves and deep notches to green volcanic mountains. The island is known for its white sand beaches and its capital, St. George's, home of the Caribbean's favorite spice market. Sailors are partial to the island because of its good mooring spots and its proximity to the Grenadine islands, stretching north to St. Vincent, which make ideal destinations.
 Sitting on a promontory above three extinct volcanic craters, St. George's is one of the region's prettiest harbor cities, a mix of French colonial with red fish-scale tile roofs and graceful English Georgian.
 Steep hills offer views over the city to the almost landlocked harbor. The best way to see St. George's is on a leisurely two-hour stroll starting at the Carenage, a pedestrian walk around the horseshoe-shaped harbor. The early-18th-century Fort St. George, guarding the harbor's mouth, is now a police station.
 The Market Square, near the harbor, is a social hub and home to the spice market, open Monday through Saturday. Nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and tumeric scent the air in covered sheds, where vendors offer spice jars starting at about $2. There is also a profusion of fresh produce, bananas, oranges, lemons, limes, mangoes, sorrel, eddoes, cassavas and coconuts.
 Grenada's best beaches are in the southwest, on the leeward side, where the sea is calm. Grande Anse stretches two miles. Scuba World, (809) 444-4371, fax (809) 444-4800, based at the Grenada Renaissance Resort, rents equipment for water sports, including windsurfing boards or Sunfishes for $16 an hour.
 On a hillside overlooking Grand Anse at its south end, the Flamboyant Hotel, (800) 742-4276 or (809) 444-4247, fax (809) 444-1234, has one-bedroom suites and two-bedroom cottages in addition to hotel rooms; each of the 39 units has a veranda. The hotel has a beachside cabana, bar and restaurant. Winter double rate in a one-bedroom suite: $135.
 Sailing is the focus at the Secret Harbour Resort, (800) 437-7880, fax (813) 530-9747, overlooking Hartman Bay on Grenada's south coast. The 20 air-conditioned suites have verandas, Italian-tiled bathrooms and refrigerators. The beach is small, but the winter rate for a double -- $225, plus 18 percent -- includes the use of Sunfish and windsurfing equipment.
 The hotel is owned by the Moorings, (800) 535-7289, fax (813) 530-9747, a large charter company with a full-service marina on the bay and a fleet of sailboats available with or without crew. Its "Yachting Get-a-Way" package includes three nights on a 50-foot crewed yacht and four nights at the resort. The double rate is $1,595 a person, including all meals on the yacht, breakfast and dinner on the days spent at the resort, a scuba lesson, an island tour, the use of water sports equipment and taxes. Tips for the crew are extra.
 
Guadeloupe
 French West Indies Tourist Board, 444 Madison Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022; (900) 990-0040 (50 cents a minute)
 On Guadeloupe, storm winds and water uprooted trees and set off mudslides but did no significant damage to hotels and restaurants or to the offshore islands, Les Saintes and Marie-Galante. So it is still possible to sample what is said to be the Caribbean's best cooking, a combination of French and zesty Creole stroked with flavors from East India.
 Guadeloupe is a department of France, and on the two islands that form it -- the mountainous Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre, with its rolling hills and white sand beaches -- the food is rich and tropical and the wines are French.
 Food specialties include boudin Creole (spicy blood sausage); pate en pot (a thick, Creole soup); accras (crispy, herb-seasoned codfish fritters flavored with the tiny titris fish); colombo (a piquant chicken curry); stuffed land crabs with garlic and spices; a hearty red bean and rice casserole; and fresh mango, papaya, bananas, and guava. The restaurants' wine selections may not rank at the top of Parker's list, but the choices work with the food. Ask the restaurant staff to help you choose. You can't go wrong with moderately priced Beaujolais or Maconnais table wines.
 In Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe's business center, the atmosphere is welcoming at Cote Jardin, (590) 90.91.28, fax (590) 90.79.57, a restaurant at the Marina, furnished with wicker and tropical plants. The dishes include foie gras, salmon marinated in lime juice, lobster tails, sweetbreads, assorted Caribbean fish, beef filet with truffles, and a large selection of dessert pastries made with fresh fruit. Dinners for two with wine range from $75 to $115 and up. Open noon to 2:30 P.M.; 7 P.M. to midnight.

Open 11 A.M. to 3 P.M., 6 to 11 P.M. Closed Sunday evening.
 La Fregate, (590) 90.80.03, fax 85.87.18, a popular brasserie and ice cream parlor, is opposite the Pointe-a-Pitre Marina, a meeting place for the boating crowd. Snacks and full breakfasts are served in a relaxed atmosphere. The menu offers stuffed conch tartare, mussels and French fries, ice cream. $25 to $80 for two. Open daily from 5:30 A.M. to midnight.
 Considering the island specialties, it's fortunate that visitors can work up an appetite hiking in Guadeloupe's magnificent National Park, a tropical forest in the heart of Basse-Terre where trails lead through lush foliage to high peaks overlooking extraordinary vistas and cascading falls. More than 300 species of tree can be seen. While making the 40-minute drive from Pointe-a-Pitre, on Grande-Terre, to Basse-Terre along the modern Transcoastal Highway, Route D23 (La Traversee), stop at the Cascade aux Excrevisses, a waterfall with an inviting cool pond at its base. The National Park has no gates and no entrance fee. Call (900) 990-0040 for free maps and brochures in English.
 
Jamaica
 Jamaica Tourist Board, 801 Second Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 856-9727
In Jamaica, scenery seems to have run amok. Hundreds of miles of coastline alternate between beach, wetland and limestone cliffs. In the Blue Mountain/ John Crow Mountain National Park, Blue Mountain Peak soars to 7,402 feet.
 The central mountain range is the source of hundreds of rivers, streams and waterfalls. Custom-designed hiking, canoeing, birding or botany tours can be arranged with Sense Adventures, telephone and fax (809) 927-2097. The cost of a tour is from $50 to $100 a person a day.
 Day outings from Ocho Rios include a trip to Port Antonio's Blue Lagoon and rafting on the Rio Grande with Tropical Tours, (809) 952-0400. The air-conditioned bus travels along the scenic north coast to Portland's Blue Lagoon for snorkeling, boat rides and lunch, then into the Rio Grande Valley and a two-and-a-half-hour rafting trip to St. Margaret's Bay. Fruit and drinks are served on the bus. The all-inclusive cost is $70 a person.
 The terrain creates many variations of micro-climate and flora, a diversity echoed in the culture and accommodations -- from small eco-lodges to opulent hotels, including the growing all-inclusive resorts. Almost half the hotel rooms are in all-inclusives or hotels that offer inclusive deals. Even budget-priced resorts have now upgraded the basic room-meals-drinks-tips package to include water sports, gyms and saunas, among other extras. Two international chains, Superclubs and Sandals, offer a glut of sports and frills for one all-inclusive price.
 Superclubs' premium hotel, for couples and singles older than 15, is the Grand Lido, (800) 859-78737 or (809) 957-4013, fax (809) 957-4317.

 The 180-room Braco Village Resort, (800) 654-1337, fax (516) 223-4815, midway between Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, is the newest -- thus the most inclusive -- resort on Jamaica.

Martinique
 Martinique Promotion Bureau, 444 Madison Avenue, 16th floor, New York, N.Y. 10022; (800) 391-4909
 Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn inflicted minor damage on the hotels and restaurants of Martinique, a part of the French Antilles with a predictable passion for excellent food and wine. And although the heavy rain hurt the banana and pineapple crops, it did not harm Martinique's reputation as the flower island.
 Martinique's flowers are showcased in the serene Balata Tropical Botanical Park, (596) 64.48.73, with 195 species of tropical plant, an orchid arbor and 60 varieties of palm. Hummingbirds flit in and out of the hibiscus, bougainvillea and frangipani scent the air, and white and red anthuriums, the trademark flower of Martinique, abound. The park is a 20-minute ride north of the capital, Fort-de-France. You will want to have your taxi wait, so plan to pay $60 round trip. Open 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Admission is $7, $3 for children.
 Les Ombrages, (596) 53.31.90 and (596) 53.32.87, is a botanical and floral trail in the northern tropical rain forest, a half-hour's drive north of St.-Pierre.

Montserrat
 Montserrat Tourist Information Office, c/o Medhurst & Associates, Inc., 775 Park Avenue, Huntington, N.Y. 11743, (800)-646-2002
 Small, green Montserrat, a British Dependent Territory in the eastern Caribbean, has always specialized in tranquillity. But that changed last summer when the island's southern volcanic hills became active. Clouds of white steam rose from hot volcanic vents along with showers of ash, which blackened the sky and fell on the town of Plymouth. South Montserrat is at Orange Alert One, the halfway mark on the alert scale, and more ash explosions are expected. Scientists are keeping watch. Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn swept past the island, washing over beaches and blowing away some of the lush vegetation but causing relatively little structural damage.
 Volcanic explosions over thousands of years have sculptured the 12-by-7-mile island into green-forested hills and mountains above black and gray sand beaches. Many luxurious villas -- vacation houses and investment ventures for Americans and others attracted by the island's quiet charm -- have sprouted in the highlands.
 Most of the villas are in the northwest, scattered on hillsides at the opposite end of the island from the volcano, in what is considered a safe zone. Their patios overlook the green mountains or the calm Caribbean. Most have swimming pools, well-kept lush gardens and modern appliances. Rental agents can arrange for cooks. Tradewinds Real Estate, (809) 491-2004, fax (809) 491-6229, has weekly rentals from $1,050 to $2,500; Neville Bradshaw Agencies, (809) 491-5270, fax (809) 491-5069, from $1,000 to $3,000, and West Indies Real Estate Ltd., (809) 491-8666, fax (809) 491-8668, from $1,250 to $6,500. Prices go down drastically in low season, between April 15 and Dec. 15. For example, a two-bedroom villa offered by Tradewinds costs $1,400 in high season, $750 in low season.
 For enjoying the peaceful mountain trails, one of the appealing options is cycling. Island Bikes, (809) 491-5552, fax (809) 491-8752, rents 18-speed mountain bicycles and offers guided tours along scenic routes for less confident as well as experienced riders. A guide is not essential but novices who bike without a guide should stick to the road.
 The trails go through forested mountain terrain; one drops 1,200 feet, starting at Windy Hill. The routes vary from black-topped roads to goat trails. Some are old footpaths and some are stone-bedded plantation roads overgrown with plants. The terrain ranges from semi-desert to rain forest. The rarest routes are flat. Rentals start at $12.50 for two hours. A day's rental is $25, four bikes for one day is $68. Price for a guide is $35 for a half day, $50 for a day for up to four people.
 
 Puerto Rico
 Puerto Rico Tourism Company, 575 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 599-6262 and (800) 223-6530
 Puerto Rico is famous for sun and sand but word of its fine golf courses has spread more slowly. Golfers can play in the shade of mango, palm, and guava trees at nine courses less than an hour from San Juan. And when they tire of the greens, the beaches and sun, they can head for a casino. There are 15 on the island.
 The more adventurous may prefer to head west, to Rincon, where the island's most elegant small hotel, the Horned Dorset Primavera, (809) 823-4030, fax (809) 823-5580, on the coast road, has added the eight-bedroom Casa Escondida, which it calls "a quiet retreat within a quiet hotel," to its original 22 rooms.
 The inn is a two-and-a-half-hour drive or a 25-minute flight from San Juan. The attentive service, enveloping tranquillity and delicious food have inspired some better-heeled golfers to stay there and fly daily to the Dorado and Cerromar Beach courses. Others choose to play 18 holes for $10 weekdays or $12 weekends at the Punta Borinquen course, (809) 890-2987, in the Ramey area, a favorite of President Eisenhower, about a half-hour away. The Horned Dorset Primavera's double rates start at $340, excluding 10 percent tax and service.
 About a 45-minute drive west of San Juan, in Dorado on the north coast, the Hyatt Regency Dorado Beach Resort, (800) 233-1234 or (809) 796-1234, fax (809) 796-6560, Highway 693, and the neighboring Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Resort, (800) 233-1234, fax (809) 796-6560, have four of Puerto Rico's best golf courses. Each was designed by the course architect Robert Trent Jones. Much of the challenge in playing all four courses comes from avoiding ponds and palm trees -- and factoring in the vigorous sea breezes.
 The Dorado Beach's low seaside buildings and extensive landscaping make it the most congenial of Puerto Rico's large resort hotels, although an increased emphasis on attracting conventions and recent room renovations suggest the Dorado is losing its distinctive 1950's island character.
 During high season, guests pay $80 at the Dorado's West Course and $100 at the East Course for 18 holes; nonguests pay $120 and $130. Cart rental is an extra $20. The double rates at the 298-room Dorado start at $489 with breakfast and dinner, plus 9 percent room tax and 15 percent on meals. The meal plan is mandatory.
 The recently renovated 506-room Cerromar is connected to the Dorado by paths and a shuttle. Guests can play tennis on 14 courts. Families with children will be interested in the Cerromar's 1,776-foot River Pool with waterfalls and slides, which is also a popular day-trip destination for San Juan families.
 Cerromar offers three-night winter golf packages, starting at $779 a person, double occupancy, including 18 holes a day on a choice of four courses. Double rates start at $310, plus 9 percent tax. The price for 18 holes at Cerromar's two courses: $80 for guests, $100 for nonguests, plus $20 for cart rental.
 The Palmas del Mar Resort, (800) 468-3331 or (809) 852-6000, fax (809) 852-6320, with a casino, sits on the Caribbean coast at Humacao, southeast of San Juan on 2,750 acres with 3,000 palm trees. The golf course was designed by Gary Player, and has a fiendish 14th hole, with a 200-foot drop. The resort's 230 rooms and suites are in the hotel, the inn and in villas. From Jan. 3 to Feb. 9, the three-night golf package, with four days of golf, starts at $1,244 for two.
 Even the most devoted golfer eventually leaves the course, which is probably why most Puerto Rican hotels with golf courses also have casinos. The Dorado recently renovated its casino; the casino at the Cerromar is being more than doubled.
 At the 672-room Caribe Hilton, (800) 445-8667 or (809) 721-0303, fax (809) 722-6750, Los Rosales Street, San Juan's oldest luxury hotel, double rooms that usually go for $365 to $449 in high season may go for $100, including free meals and booze, for anyone willing to play four hours a day, betting $100 or more per hand. For special gamblers' rates, rooms must be reserved through the casino, (809) 724-0912. The Caribe Hilton's beach, pools and excellent location near the heart of Old San Juan make it the best casino hotel for travelers who don't plan to spend all their time gambling.
 In Isla Verde, the 389-room El San Juan Hotel and Casino, (800) 468-2818, or (809) 791-1000, fax (809) 253-0178, (800) 468-6659, has an opulent lobby, several large pools, a sand beach, bathrooms with television sets -- and lots of intent, high-rolling players. The rates vary according to availability of rooms, but expect to pay from $320 to $475 for a double. Serious gamblers seeking special rates should call the director of marketing, Elaine Siegel, at the casino.
 
 Saba
Saba Tourist Office, Post Office Box 6322, Boca Raton, Fla. 33427-6322; (407) 394-8580, (800)722-2394
At first glance, Saba seems unimpressive, a five-square-mile volcanic scrap rising 2,851 feet, with 1,200 residents and one beach, which disappears in winter. But below the sea, the island is clearly in the big leagues.
Since 1987, the crystalline waters of the entire coast down to 200 feet plus several underwater pinnacles offshore have been protected by the Saba Marine Park. Marine scientists say the structure of the park is unusual: There are few large, shallow reefs fringing the island but rather a narrow shelf of coral-encrusted volcanic boulders and areas of reef separated by volcanic sand channels and ridges.
Underwater, as well as on land, Saba survived September's hurricanes with minimal damage. A Marine Park spokesman said some of the abundant soft corals and sponges were torn from the reefs, which would be noticeable to divers familiar with Saba's waters but probably not to first-time visitors.
In the Marine Park, erosion and past volcanic activity have formed overhangs, tunnels, alleys and caves. In the complex array of holes and gaps, divers find a multitude of reef fish, moray eels, lobsters and the odd nurse shark.
The gradual slope of Tent Reef, in the Marine Park off the southern part of Saba, is a forest of sea fans, boulder corals and barrel and tube sponges. It is not unusual to encounter eagle rays and large groupers. In shallower parts of the reef, a large overhang plays host to numerous squirrelfish, hinds and snappers. The roof of the overhang is a patchwork of colorful sponges where tiny blue neon damselfish take shelter.
Depths of more than 1,500 feet are found between the island and some of the shallower dive sites. Two-thirds of a mile offshore, underwater pinnacles reach up to within 90 feet of the surface. Divers see assemblages of hard and soft corals on pinnacles, which are a rest stop for many large open-ocean fish and numerous reef fish. Often a large hawksbill turtle will paddle by and disappear behind the large coral heads.
The Marine Park has 36 permanent mooring buoys within the protected area, giving access to the dive sites and preventing anchor damage. The park office is at Fort Bay, the island's main harbor area. Open 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. weekdays, 8 A.M. to noon Saturday, 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. Sunday.
Saba Deep Dive Center, (599) 46-3347 and fax (599) 46-3397, leads dives each day at 9 A.M., 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. The rate for a single-tank dive is $45, double tank $80 and triple tank $110, including all equipment except wet suit. The price does not include the Marine Park's fee of $2 a dive.
Two other dive shops have similar prices: Sea Saba Dive Center, (599) 46-2246, fax (599) 46-2362, and Wilson's Dive Shop, telephone and fax (599) 46-2541.
The park's snorkel trail, for experienced swimmers only, can be reached from a beach at Well's Bay from May to October. In other months, ground swells pull the sand from the beach.
 
 St. Barthelemy
French West Indies Tourist Board, 444 Madison Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022; (900) 990-0040 (50 cents a minute)
Soon after Hurricane Luis roared through small, trendy St. Barthelemy, the island began repairing, replanting and rebudding. St. Barts is more or less ready for winter, cachet (though not every hotel and restaurant) intact.
St. Barts lies between Antigua and Virgin Gorda, two major sailing centers. The capital, Gustavia, has a harbor with mooring and docking facilities for yachts.
The island is known for its upscale accommodations in small hotels, inns and villas. Rooms in the places that are mentioned below can be reserved through their United States agent, West Indies Management Company (Wimco), (800) 932-3222, fax (401) 847-6290. The prices, which include tax and service, are for the 1996 high season (but not around Christmas, when rates are higher).
Francois Plantation, built on the Colombier hillside, has spectacular views from the pool at the hotel's highest point. The 12 colorful, Caribbean-style bungalows, each with a small patio, are in a garden with pergolas, trellises, earthenware pots and winding paths. The complex has one of the island's best French restaurants. The wine cellar is stocked with French bottles selected by the owner. Each room has queen-sized four-poster mahogany beds. There is a four-night minimum stay. Double room rates start at $300, including an American breakfast.
La Banane sits in a garden 100 yards from Lorient Beach. The nine-room inn, with two small pools, is known for its nightly cabaret. The rooms have plantation-style furniture and terraces. The restaurant is open for dinner. Double room rates start at $340 a night, including airport transfers and full breakfast.
The newly painted and landscaped Carl Gustaf, a luxury suites hotel, overlooks Gustavia harbor. Each of the 14 suites has a terrace and most have a private plunge pool. Beds are king-sized. Suites have a minibar, kitchen, two phone lines, fax and 24-hour room service. The fitness center has a sauna. There is a swimming pool, a shuttle to the beach, a restaurant and a piano bar. The two-bedroom suites cost $1,000 a night for four people, the one-bedroom suite $750, including airport transfers and Continental breakfast served in the suite.
Rental villas range from unassuming one-bedroom beach or hillside retreats to luxury estates awash in frills.
The one-bedroom villa called Villa Ven, cooled by fans, has a view of the Grand Cul de Sac area and the ocean. A marble-floored veranda leads to the living room via arched French doors with white wooden shutters. The kitchen is at one end of the living room. The bedroom has French doors leading out to the terrace. Tennis, beaches and windsurfing are a short drive away; Gustavia is a 15-minute drive. Children are not accepted. The cost: $1,750 a week, plus 7.5 percent service charge.
On the hillside above St. Jean, the Villa Rel has been newly redecorated in white. A housekeeper tends the three bedrooms, two baths, living room and dining room. There is a pool. Monogrammed bathrobes and matching towels are included in the cost, $3,900 a week plus 7.5 percent service. Children are welcome.
 
St. Croix
United States Virgin Islands Department of Tourism, 1270 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 332-2222
After Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the people who live here recall, the island was so devastated it looked burned or bombed. In contrast, hurricanes Luis and Marilyn merely toppled large trees, thinned the foliage and damaged buildings. St. Croix's attractions -- good beaches and a wealth of sports, golf included -- are ready for visitors. Virtually all hotels are open, tourism officials say. Some of the best beaches are at Sandy Point in the southwest and at Buck Island, a National Monument that is part of the National Park system, 1.6 miles off northeast St. Croix.
The Carambola Golf Club, (809) 778-5638, at the Westin Carambola Resort in the island's northeast, lost almost 300 trees on its 18-hole course to the hurricanes but there was little damage to the fairways. Hotel guests pay $57.50 a person for an 18-hole round, cart included, nonguests $72.50.
The Westin Carambola Beach and Golf Resort, (800) 228-3000, fax (809) 778-1682, situated on 28 acres along Davis Bay, opened the first of this month after repairs. The hotel has 151 rooms in 25 two-story villas. The rooms have large louvered windows, mahogany furniture, terra cotta floors, air-conditioning and ceiling fans. There are nine tennis courts, a pool, three restaurants and a free shuttle to the 18-hole golf course, (809) 778-5638. For one or two people in a room, rates are $235 to $330, plus 18 percent for tax and service.
Of the 154 rooms at the Buccaneer Hotel, (800) 255-3881, fax (809) 778-8215, built on 300 acres east of Christiansted near Gallows Bay, 50 are on the beach; the three beaches enlarged by the hurricane. The hotel has two swimming pools and eight tennis courts. Double rates start at $210, plus 8 percent tax. The price includes breakfast and snorkel gear. For the 18-hole course, guests pay $44 a person in greens fees, including cart, or $300 for a week of unlimited golf.
Among St. Croix's winter golf packages is one at the pink stucco two-story Hibiscus Beach Hotel, (800) 442-0121, fax (809) 773-7668, on Pelican Cove. The hotel has a seaside open-air restaurant and bar. Its 37 beachfront rooms in six buildings have patios or balconies. A four-night package costs $599 a person, double occupancy, including a rental car, daily greens fees and cart, and two rounds of golf at Carambola.
Sailing options include trips out of Christiansted Wharf and Green Cay Marina near Christiansted. The usual objective of an outing is snorkeling among the parrotfish, French angelfish and other marine life at Buck Island National Monument, (809) 773-1460. In addition to a sheltered sandy beach, Buck Island has a hiking trail and a snorkeling trail in a lagoon along a coral reef.
A Christiansted Wharf cruise captain, John Macy, phone and fax (809) 773-4482, offers a daily Buck Island tour, 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M., on a 42-foot catamaran for $55 a person, including lunch and rum punch. A two-hour sunset sail around the harbor costs $20 a person, including rum punch.
Capt. Heinz Punzenberger, (809) 773-3161, fax (809) 773-4041, pilots his 42-foot trimaran from Green Cay Marina to Buck Island twice daily. The first trip, 9 A.M. to 2 P.M., costs $45 a person, including snorkel equipment, beer and soft drinks; the second trip, 2 P.M. to 5:30 P.M, is $40 a person.
 
 St. Eustatius
St. Eustatius Information Office, Caribbean Connection Plus, Post Office Box 261, Trumbull, Conn. 06611; (203) 261-8603
Once one of the busiest ports in the Western world, St. Eustatius is now known for quietude, diving and a preoccupation with the past. There's a volcano, the Quill, and it too is quiet; a rain forest grows in the crater. The eight-square-mile island lies 38 miles south of St. Maarten, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Luis. St. Eustatius escaped with damage mainly to vegetation and some eroded beaches.
Among the island's more spectacular dive sites, Grand Canyon is a series of volcanic fissures pouring sand into the ocean depths. At Double Wreck, where two old shipwrecks are covered with coral, divers can see hordes of fish, including flying fish, large barracuda, stingrays and grunts.
Oranjestad, the historic capital of St. Eustatius, is situated in two parts: the Lower Town, beside a gray-black sand beach that Luis diminished, and the Upper Town on the cliff above. Most of the Lower Town has been in ruins for nearly 200 years.
Divers and snorkelers may explore the ruins of partly sunken old yellow brick warehouses by the Lower Town. Coastal erosion has exposed more ruins just offshore in clear, shallow water. Pottery shards, broken clay pipes and, on rare occasions, blue glass beads from slave-trading days can be found on the beach or in shallow water. A diver who has recently explored the waters said the force of the hurricane had exposed pottery shards and pieces of bottles long buried in the sand.
Dominating the bay from a commanding site in the Upper Town are the ruins of Fort Oranje with large cannons. The fort returned a salute on Nov. 16, 1776, to the brig Andrew Doria, flying the Grand Union Flag, the precursor to the Stars and Stripes. This is regarded as the first salute to a flag of the new United States by officials of a foreign power. The island was a source of supplies to the colonists during the American Revolution, and this -- as well as the cannon salute -- angered the British, who wreaked destruction during their occupation of St. Eustatius.
The small Museum of the St. Eustatius Historical Foundation, (599) 382288, 3 Wilhelminaweg, at the top of the cobblestone bay path in the Upper Town, is a former merchant's house that was taken over by the British Navy. The museum has displays on the island's shipping era and on the pre-Columbian period. Open weekdays 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., weekends 9 A.M. to noon. Entrance fee $2.
Dive Statia, (599) 382435, fax (599) 382539, in Lower Town, offers a two-and-a-half-hour introductory diving course for $80, which includes a boat dive and use of gear.
Hotel dive packages start at $575 a person double occupancy, including seven nights, six two-tank dives, breakfast and taxes. Among the accommodations, divers like the relaxed atmosphere at the new family-owned Kings Well Resort, phone and fax (599) 382538, on a cliff overlooking Oranje Bay with a beach below. There are only three guest rooms now, but five more are scheduled to open next month. The double room rates range from $50 to $90, including full breakfast; 7 percent tax is extra.
 
St. John
United States Virgin Islands Department of Tourism, 1270 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 332-2222
Of the three United States Virgin Islands, St. John had the least damage from this fall's hurricanes. St. John is sought out mostly for the scenic wonders of the Virgin Islands National Park, which covers almost two-thirds of the island.
Visitors can arrive only by sea; the nearest airport is on St. Thomas, which lies a few miles to the west of St. John. The island's main town, Cruz Bay, at its western end, has regular ferry service to the Red Hook Wharf on St. Thomas, a 20-minute ride.
Before beginning an island trek, you can pick up free trail maps at the National Park visitor's center, (809) 776-6201, at the park entrance on the north side of Cruz Bay. Open daily from 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. There are 22 hiking trails within the park covering 20 miles in all. The most popular guided hike is the 2.2 miles to Reef Bay, on the south of the island, starting from the side of a hill and descending 800 feet to the bay and exploring sugar plantation ruins in the valley. Reef Bay has a pleasant but rocky beach. The hike is led two or three times weekly, leaving the visitors' center around 9:45 A.M. and returning by boat about 3:30 P.M. The cost is $14 from Cruz Bay, which is the price of the taxi ride (which will vary by starting point) and the boat ride back.
The most popular beach is probably Trunk Bay in the northwest, but snorkelers who know the island prefer the less-crowded beach at Salt Pond Bay, near the Ram Head hiking trail. The coral reefs lie just offshore.
St. John's most luxurious landmark, Caneel Bay, is closed for extensive post-hurricane renovations, including installation of custom-made furniture. The resort is scheduled to reopen June 1.
The National Park Service estimates a million people visit the park yearly; the great push comes in winter, when prices are higher. The lodging prices listed here, for two people, do not include the 8 percent tax.
Scheduled to reopen Feb. 1, after repairs, Cinnamon Bay, (800) 539-9998, fax (214) 871-5444, a concession along a beach on parkland, offers 26 bare campsites at $15 a night all year, 60 tents for $70 in winter, and 40 one-room cottages 15 by 15 feet, $90 in winter. Guests are issued a portable propane stove and the tents and cottages have charcoal grills on the patio. There is an open-air restaurant that serves three meals daily, plus a general store.
Stanley Selengut's popular eco-lodgings, (800) 392-9004, fax (212) 861-6210, offer several options. The 114 canvas cottages at Maho Bay Camps start at the beach and climb the hill. The cottages, which sleep up to five, have cooking equipment, linens and electricity. The price: $95 a night. Just above the Maho Bay cottages, Harmony Resort sits on a hill with views of the beaches. Built of recycled materials and solar powered, the 12 studio apartments have kitchenettes, microwaves and decks. The rates: $150 to $180 a night. At Estate Concordia, a Selengut apartment complex on the island's southeast shore, five new eco-tents, overlooking Salt Pond Bay, sleep five or six people on twin beds and sofa beds. The tents have lofts, kitchen equipment, private baths, screened windows and access to a resort's swimming pool. The double rate is $95.
Nature lovers who prefer a full-service hotel can stay at the 285-room Hyatt Regency St. John, (800) 233-1234 or (809) 693-8888, on Great Cruz Bay, just south of the town of Cruz Bay. The hotel plans to reopen Jan. 2 after repairs. The resort has a quarter-acre swimming pool, a 1,200-foot beach, six lighted tennis courts and three restaurants. High-season rates start at $340 for a double.
 
St. Kitts and Nevis
St. Kitts and Nevis Department of Tourism, 414 East 75th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; (212) 535-1234 or (800) 582-6208
Graceful old plantation homes called great houses,built for sugar moguls, dot St. Kitts's countryside. Today, some are attractive inns in a setting of hibiscus, bougainvillea and African green monkeys.
Two miles from St. Kitts by sea, on smaller, quieter Nevis, clouds mist the top of 3,596-high Nevis Peak, a companion to St. Kitt's 3,711-foot Mount Liamuga. Nevis has its own assortment of historic inns.
Hurricane winds and water swept both islands, raking sand from beaches and shredding greenery, but the historic inns stood firm. Most are on wind-cooled hillsides; some are closer to beaches. To the prices listed, add 17 percent for tax and service.
The stylish Golden Lemon Inn, (800) 633-7411, fax (809) 465-4019, at Dieppe Bay, St. Kitts's northwest corner, has 32 rooms, some in the great house, others in two-story villas each with its own small swimming pool. There is a large pool as well. An easy path leads to the black sand beach. Hurricane winds stripped Golden Lemon's beachfront foliage but new greenery began growing soon afterward. Double rooms in the great house start at $290, including full breakfast. Villas start at $365. A package including breakfast and dinner is $335 for a room in the great house, with a four-night minimum.
The 18th-century Rawlins Plantation, (800) 346-5358, fax (703) 548-5825, sits on a hill at St. Kitts's western end with a view of Saba and St. Eustatius. There are 10 guest rooms furnished with English antiques in 10 cottages, including the honeymoon suite in the old sugar mill. The dozen acres contain a swimming pool and grass tennis court. The co-owner, Claire Rawson, a trained chef, cooks French and island-style for the restaurant. Rooms have no television, phones or air-conditioning. Double rooms with breakfast and dinner, plus afternoon tea and laundry: $390. Storm damage was minor here.
Ottley's Plantation Inn, (800) 772-3039, fax (809) 465-4760, above the village of Ottley on the Atlantic side of St. Kitts, reopened last month, repaired and repainted after Hurricane Luis. The 15 air-conditioned rooms are mostly in the great house with colonial decor, attractive prints and paintings, the others in cottages. The inn has a spring-fed swimming pool, ocean and mountain views and first-rate multicultural cooking. Double room rates from $310 to $420 a night, including breakfast and dinner. The inn will send a video to prospective guests.
On Nevis, the Nisbet Plantation Beach Club, (800) 742-6008 or (809) 469-9325, fax (809) 469-9864, sits on a beach at the island's northern end, with 38 rooms and a handsome beach pavilion for breakfast and lunch. The 1778 great house was the home of Fanny Nisbet, the wife of Admiral Horatio Nelson. The decor is colonial. Double rates, including breakfast, dinner, tea and laundry, start at $355. Tax and service is 19 percent. Hurricane Luis stripped Nisbet of a few dozen coconut palm trees (since replanted).
In the Gingerland area in Nevis's east, African green monkeys roam the grounds at the 96-acre Golden Rock Retreat, (809) 469-3346, fax (809) 469-2113, where the 16 rooms are in seven cottages and a 19th-century sugar mill. The grounds lie at an altitude of 1,000 feet with a swimming pool, tennis court and nature trail. Doubles with breakfast and dinner start at $255; without meals $195. Dinners are $40, plus tax and service.
The family-run Hermitage, (809) 469-3477, fax (809) 469-2481, dating to 1740, has 14 rooms in 12 cottages furnished with canopied beds. Hammocks swing on the porches. The inn's eight acres lie 800 feet above sea level with a stable, swimming pool and tennis court. Double rates start at $325, including breakfast, tea and dinner.
The deluxe Nevis Four Seasons Resort, (800) 322-3442, fax (809) 469-1112, reopened Nov. 9 after repairs to its pool deck, pier and ballroom; the beach should be rebuilt by the end of November. Double rates start at $550.
 
 St. Lucia
St. Lucia Tourist Board, 820 Second Avenue, Suite 900 E, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212)867-2950
St. Lucia is known for magnificent mountains, a rain forest and inclusive resorts, which were introduced only a few years ago and now include most of the hotels. This year the island was among the lucky number that escaped the hurricanes.
St. Lucia's rugged cone-shaped mountains rise abruptly from the sea. Gros Piton is 2,619 feet high, Petit Piton 2,461 feet. Lying at the foot of the mountains, the town of Soufriere is the staging point for what is touted as the world's only drive-in volcano and the bubbling Sulphur Springs. The steaming springs are part of a volcano that last erupted thousands of years ago. Nearby are the Diamond Botanical Gardens and Mineral Baths, offering a close look at St. Lucia's beautiful flora.
The rain forest covers 19,000 acres of lush mountains and valleys. Tours were resumed recently, having stopped last year after the trail was wrecked by a tropical storm.
Barefoot Holidays, (809) 450-0507, fax (809) 450-0661, offers a rain forest tour for $40, a trip of about four and a half hours, including a three-hour hike.
A daylong bus and boat trip, including a visit to Soufriere, the volcano, Sulphur Springs, Diamond Falls, banana plantations and fishing villages, is $70, including lunch on the boat.
Independent touring is easier this year. Reconstruction of St. Lucia's scenic west coast road, underway for three and a half years, ended in July; Soufriere and the Pitons are now more accessible.
The hotel room prices listed here include food, drink, sports, tax, service, and airport transfers.
The Jalousie Plantation Resort, (800) 392-2007, fax (809) 459-5366, sits between the two Pitons, with 114 rooms, four restaurants and three bars and lounges. There is a pool with swim-up bar, four tennis courts, a squash court and a new par-three golf course. The health club includes an aerobics studio and gym. Water sports include sailing. Room prices start at $600 for two people.
The pink Sandals St. Lucia, (800) 726-3257, fax (305) 667-8996, with a crescent-shaped beach on the west coast, is on 155 acres. The 273 rooms are in the main hotel and hillside villas. The resort, for couples only, has five restaurants, a fitness center, a nine-hole golf course and a pool with a waterfall, swim-up bar and bridges. Activities include tennis, volleyball, horseshoes, snorkeling, kayaking, water-skiing, windsurfing and scuba. Weekly rates for two people start at $3,670.
On a cove at St. Lucia's northernmost tip, the 100-room Le Sport, (800) 544-2883, fax (305) 672-5861, was designed for health and beauty devotees. Saunas, loofa rubs and hydro massages are among the options, and archery and fencing are among the sports. Rooms for two start at $500.
The recently redone East Winds Inn, (800) 223-9832, fax (212) 599-1755, sits on eight tropical acres and a palmy beach along La Brelotte Bay on the northeast coast. The inn has 26 rooms in 13 cottages, a pool, a beachfront bar and restaurant, a French chef, snorkeling, canoes and a library. Double room rates start at $490.
The 238-room Wyndham Morgan Bay, (800) 822-4200, fax (809) 450-1050, is on Choc Bay just north of the capital. The resort offers waterskiing, snorkeling, sailing, tennis and a fitness center. The guest rooms have private balconies and terraces and most have sea views. Double-occupancy rates start at $430, for a room with a garden view.
 
 St. Maarten
St. Maarten Tourist Office, 675 Third Avenue, 18th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017; (800) 786-2278
On the island split between Dutch St. Maarten and French St. Martin, the Dutch side was especially hard hit, partly because of its more intense development.
Repairs are continuing. Many shops and restaurants are open; the island Government expects 60 percent of hotel rooms to be ready for guests by the end of this month. The harbor is open to cruise ships.
As on the French side, St. Maarten has scenic beaches, turquoise water and volcanic mountains.
In Philipsburg, the capital, American culture dominates, the dollar is accepted and nearly everyone speaks English. Front Street, the southernmost of the city's three main east-west streets, is full of jewelry stores specializing in gold and gemstones. As in New York's Diamond District, shoppers should compare prices. (On a visit in August, nearly all stores advertised 50 percent off gold, but the prices were higher than in New York.) The Front Street shops weathered the storm, and most are open.
The anchor store, Little Switzerland, on Front Street, (599) 5-23530, which is expected to reopen by the end of the month, sells an impressive range of European designer jewelry as well as china, crystal, watches and other luxury items, from Hummel figurines to Chanel and Fendi fragrances.
The vendors will bargain, and prices will vary. In August, a pair of small earrings of opals mounted in 14-karat gold cost $138 at one store; at another, Gurlink, 33 Front Street, (599) 5-30356, a similar set with similarly fiery opals was $68.
Take precautions to verify the authenticity of diamonds by asking for a receipt and written money-back guarantee. It may be a good idea to charge the gem rather than pay cash so that you have recourse through your credit card. Most shops are open from 8 or 9 A.M. to noon and from 1 P.M. to 6 P.M.
One open hotel is the 600-room Maho Beach Hotel and Casino, (800) 223-0757, fax (212) 969-9227, where 400 rooms are available and the others are expected to open mid-December. Double room rates start at $225 plus 20 percent tax and service. The hotel is near the airport.
In Philipsburg at 35 Front Street, the 54-room Holland House, (599) 5-22572, fax (599) 5-24673, is near shopping and casinos. Winter double room rates start at $145 for two people, plus 20 percent tax and service.
A smaller resort that expects to be open for winter is the secluded Oyster Pond Beach Hotel, (800) 777-1700, fax (599) 5-76585, with 20 rooms and 20 suites near Dawn Beach. Double rates start at $170, plus 20 percent tax and service.
Holland House and Maho Beach are among four offering a Stay Seven, Pay Five rate Dec. 20 through April 15, 1966. The rate, available through travel agents, allows guests to stay seven nights for the price of five.
 
 
St. Martin
French West Indies Tourist Board, 444 Madison Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10022; (900) 990-0040 (50 cents a minute)
Unlike Dutch St. Maarten, which has been Americanized, the sensibility on French St. Martin is Gallic. With strong support from France, St. Martin responded quickly and effectively to the damage left by Hurricane Luis. At least 76 percent of the 2,554 hotel rooms are expected to be ready for winter, tourism officials say. Rental villas sustained relatively little damage.
St. Martin's specialties are beaches and restaurants. In the community of Grand Case, which is noted for good dining spots, the storm washed away several seaside places and damaged some terraces, but other restaurants fared well.
The survivors include Bistro Caraibe, at 81 Grand Case, phone and fax (590) 29.08.29, which has fish specialties, including salmon with herb sauce, for $19, and breast of duck on toasted goat cheese and a salad bed for $10. There is a selection of French wines by the glass for $3. Dinner for four with wine costs $100.
Down the street, La Creperie le Soleil, (590) 87.92.32, offers a ham, cheese and tomato luncheon crepe for $7.
Other restaurants that are open include Cha Cha Cha, 61 Grand Case, (590) 87.53.63; Pizzeria la Californie, 134 Grand Case, (590) 87.55.57; Hoa Mai, Belvedere Hotel, Cul de Sac, (590) 87.32.52; Le Porto Fino, Grand Case, (590) 29.08.28, and a new one, Sunny, 151 Grand Case, (590) 29.23.75.
Among the storm casualties, the beachside food shacks, called lolos, were washed away and are being rebuilt for the winter season. The shacks sell grilled chicken, sausage and shrimp. Cost of a meal: about $8.
In Marigot, a pleasant place for lunch, La Vie en Rose, (590) 87.54.42, fax (590) 87.58.26, on the corner of Rue de la Republique and Boulevard de France, fronts on the harbor. Bistro fare is the rule, with plenty of seafood. About $20 a person with wine.
Beaches that are officially open for swimming include Plum Bay, Baie Rouge, Petite Plage, Friars Bay, Galion Beach, Pinel Island and Orient.
The reopening date for the island's most stylish resort, the 80-room La Samanna, had not been set as of early November by its management, Rosewood Hotels and Resorts. A spokeswoman for Rosewood said the hotel would be closed at least through the end of 1995. For an update on the opening, call (800) 854-2252.
 
 St. Thomas
United States Virgin Islands Division of Tourism, 1270 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 332-2222
In mid-September Hurricane Marilyn left St. Thomas, the commercial center of the United States Virgin Islands, in shambles. But just six weeks later, after heroic efforts by emergency workers, Charlotte Amalie's deep harbor was once again ready for cruise ships. The inauguration was celebrated on Oct. 31 by 1,150 passengers arriving on the Celebrity liner Zenith.
The visitors listened to steel bands, drank free rum punch, shopped, took sightseeing tours, attended a fair hosted by the Committee to Revive Our Culture and swam at Magens Bay, one of the island's best beaches, a glorious U-shaped bay on the island's north side.
Afterward, according to an island public relations representative, the cruise ship passengers gave St. Thomas high marks. Luckily, the passengers didn't have to check into a hotel; the island's habitable hotel rooms will be housing relief workers until Dec. 15, said Beverly Nicholson, director of the St. Thomas/St. John Hotel Association.
Among many hotels, there is uncertainty about reopening dates. Originally, island officials had announced that 60 percent of hotel rooms would be open by Dec. 15. By early November, the percentage had dipped to 40 to 50 percent because of a shortage of repair supplies.
The hotels that have announced they will be fully open by Dec. 20, said Mrs. Nicholson, include Secret Harbour Beach Hotel, (800) 524-2250; Emerald Beach, (800) 528-1234; Island Beachcomber, (800) 982-9898, and Sapphire Beach Resort, (800) 524-2090. Elysian Beach Resort, (800) 524-4746, says it will also open on that date. The 171-room Bluebeard's Castle, (800) 524-6599, will open Jan. 18. The renovated 290-room Stouffer Renaissance Grand Beach Resort, (809) 775-1510, will reopen early next summer with a shortened name, Renaissance Grand Beach Resort; it suffered major damage to its beachside rooms, lobby and landscaping.
As for the island's natural assets, all the beaches are open, said Mrs. Nicholson. "Nature has a wonderful way of taking over," she said.
 
St. Vincent
St. Vincent and the Grenadines Tourist Office, 801 Second Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 687-4981
A 4,000-foot volcano, La Soufriere, caps the landscape on St. Vincent, but the chain of the Grenadines is best known for excellent sailing. The 32 islands and cays stretch 75 miles, with beautiful deserted beaches, coves and offshore reefs.
The lush 35-acre Young Island, 200 yards off St. Vincent's southern coast, is home to Young Island Resort, (800) 223-1108, fax (310) 440-4220, with 29 cottages and yacht charter packages. The cottages have adjustable louvered walls, ceiling fans, rattan furnishings and refrigerators. Winter double rates start at $430, including breakfast and dinner but not the 17 percent tax and service charge. Guests can also combine two nights on a yacht and five nights at the resort. From Dec. 18 to Feb. 28, the weekly rate begins at $3,300 for two. The yachts sleep two couples plus crew.
Young Island Resort's sailing destinations include Bequia, nine miles south of St. Vincent, with clear blue-green water and a protected bay. From Bequia, it's seven miles to picturesque hilly and clubby Mustique, with good snorkeling.
Eleven miles south of Mustique, there is a new yacht anchorage on Canouan Island at the Tamarind Beach Hotel and Yacht Club, (800) 223-1108, (809) 458-8044, fax (809) 458-8851, which opened in January. Facing the sea, the rooms have ceiling fans and balconies. Double rates are $300 a day, plus 17 percent tax and service, and include meals, airport transfers and the use of small sailboats and other water-sports gear.
Among St. Vincent's yacht renters, Barefoot Charters, (809) 456-9526, fax (809) 456-9238, on Blue Lagoon offers weekly charters on bare boats -- yachts rented without a crew -- starting at $2,660 a week for a 41-foot boat with two cabins and two heads; $2,380 from Jan. 7 to 31. A captain costs $100 a day; a cook, $75 a day.
The Lagoon Marina and Hotel, (800) 742-4276, phone and fax (809) 458-4308, has two 44-foot sailboats for charter; winter prices are $400 a day or $2,800 a week for a skippered boat. The price does not include a cook, which is $40 a day extra, plus $20 a person a day for provisions.
The hotel has an open-air bar and restaurant and 19 simply furnished rooms with balconies. The double rates are $95, plus 17 percent tax and service.
The 32-room Sunset Shores Beach Hotel, (800) 223-6510, (809) 458-4411, fax (809) 457-4800, sits on three acres with gardens, a pool and a view of Young Island. The rooms have private patios. Double rates start at $140, plus 17 percent tax and service. An extra $38 a person buys breakfast and dinner.
 
Tortola
British Virgin Islands Tourist Board, 370 Lexington Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 696-0400
Calm waters, steady winds and many anchorages give Tortola some of the world's best sailing. Storm winds swept the island but left little damage. The smooth waters make the British Virgin Islands ideal for novice sailors -- and nervous passengers. Secluded coves and deserted beaches all around are idyllic destinations. More than 50 other islands in the British Virgin archipelago are scattered nearby in crystalline waters. Tortola is the largest island, 30 square miles topped by 1,780-foot Mount Sage. The capital, Road Town, is the hub of activity, which is mostly low-key.
Tortola is a base for crewed charter boats and bare boats. Cruising between islands normally takes only a couple of hours. Among destinations, charter captains recommend White Bay, with its fine white sand, on the island of Jost Van Dyke. Other pleasant day stops: Great Harbor on Peter Island and The Caves on Norman Island, which offer snorkeling through beachside sea caves accessible right off the boat.
Some of the best overnight anchorages are Soper's Hole and Cane Garden Bay on Tortola and Great Harbor on Jost Van Dyke. While in Great Harbor many people head for Foxy's, (809) 495-9743, an open-air beachside restaurant and bar, where the owner, Foxy Callwood, often sings calypso and local bands perform. The specialty is grilled fish, and there are beach barbecues on Fridays and Saturdays. Dinner for two is about $40, drinks about $3.50 each.
Among smaller boats, the 40-foot sloop Cheers can sleep four. During winter, a seven-day sail for two costs $3,850, including meals prepared by a chef, and drinks. For six nights aboard the 65-foot trimaran Promenade, 10 people pay $13,500, including on-board meals and drinks. Scuba is $25 a dive. The rate drops by about $1,300 for each couple fewer. The 105-foot Cuan Law, a trimaran, sleeps 20. Cabins are often rented on an individual basis. Double rates for an air-conditioned stateroom with private bath and meals: $2,860 for six nights. The boats can be booked through Virgin Island Sailing Limited, (800) 233-7936, fax (809) 494-6774. At least three months' advance booking is recommended.
A large yacht-charter operation, The Moorings, (800) 535-7289 or (809) 494-2331, with its flagship base on Tortola, has 180 sailing yachts, ranging from 32 feet to 76 feet. In winter, a 50-foot boat will cost $940 a day; a 32-foot boat, $330 a day.
Sailing courses are given by the Offshore Sailing School, (800) 221-4326, fax (941) 454-1191, at The Moorings' 43-room Treasure Isle Hotel in Road Town, on a hillside overlooking the harbor. The sailing course, which includes seven nights at the hotel, one dinner, lessons in a classroom and aboard a boat, is $1,495 a person, double occupancy.
 
Trinidad and Tobago
Trinidad and Tobago Tourist Board, 7000 Boulevard East, Guttenberg, N.J. 07093; (800) 748-4224 and (201) 662-3403
It is said that Trinidad has more of just about everything -- more roots, culture, festivals, music, birds and butterflies -- than other islands in the Caribbean. The roots come from around the world, and the birdlife is rich -- 433 species or so -- because Trinidad skirts South America. On less-developed Tobago, diving is accessible and good.
Trinidad's most famous festival is its big, boisterous Carnival, which peaks on Fat Tuesday, Feb. 20 next year, with an explosion of music and dancing in the streets. But pre-Carnival events and other festivals erupt year round -- some in the capital, Port of Spain, some in villages and smaller towns. Many festivals have no fixed dates, others are rescheduled at the last minute. The one relatively quiet time is the six weeks of Lent.
Much of the music is steel pan, played on a carefully tuned steel drum. A band of five or more players beats out a calypso, jazz or classical tune. Beating a pan means moving the whole body, making it a form of dance as well as music.
Port of Spain's lively Carnival-like air intensified last year when its central plaza was landscaped with trees, grass, walkways and built-in chess tables and renamed the Brian Lara Promenade after a young cricket star. (Cricket is an island passion.) On some Friday evenings there's a performance here on an open-air stage -- steel pan bands, stand-up comedians, performing dogs. In the nightclubs, musicians perform virtually until dawn, validating Port of Spain's image as a city that doesn't sleep.
Among the most popular spots, the smoky Mas Camp, phone and fax (809) 623-3745, at 19-23 French Street in Woodbrook, west of Port of Spain, usually has live entertainment with a Trinidadian flavor. Calypso singers perform on Wednesdays. The types of music include soca, a livelier version of calypso. Go in late evening; the music ends around 4 A.M. Entry fee is $2 to $3. A Carib beer, brewed on the island, costs $1.
For Creole food, try an old favorite, Veni Mange, (809) 622-7533, in a small house in the St. James district decorated with batik and paintings by Trinidad artists. The dishes, which vary with the season, include pumpkin fritters, callaloo soup, red snapper and coconut mousse. Lunch is served Monday to Friday, dinner only on Wednesdays. Lunches average $10, plus $1.20 for a rum punch or $1 for a Carib beer. Dinner has a set price of $10, plus 15 percent tax.
When bird-watchers go to Trinidad, they head for the veranda and mountain trails at Asa Wright Nature Center and Lodge, 1,200 feet high, about seven miles north of Arima and a 90-minute drive from Port of Spain. Turquoise-billed toucans and bearded bellbirds are among the species seen at the nature center, along with tufted coquette hummingbirds. A day visit to Asa Wright, phone and fax (809) 667-4655, is $6, including a tour of the reserve. Reservations are needed. The double rate for an overnight stay in one of the 24 rooms is $210, including tax, meals and afternoon tea.
On Tobago, the reefs off the village of Speyside on the island's eastern tip, a straggle of small houses between the mountains and the sea, seem almost untouched. But the famous Buccoo Reef, at the island's western end, is now sadly degraded. The offshore water is one of the few places in the world where manta rays are common close to shore.
Two Speyside inns have their own dive shops. The more dive-focused of the two is the casual, new 22-room Manta Lodge, (800) 544-7631, fax (809) 660-5030, owned and run by a professional diver. The beach is across the road. Double rates start at $90, plus 20 percent tax and service. Seven-night packages with 10 dives start at $767 a person, double occupancy, including tax and airport transportation. The charming 38-room Blue Waters Inn, (800) 742-4276, (809) 660-4341, fax (809) 660-5195, is built on 46 wooded acres. Swimming is along a beach on a private cove. Double rates start at $121, including tax and service.
 
 Turks and Caicos
Turks and Caicos Tourist Board, Post Office Box 594023, Miami, Fla. 33159; (800) 241-0824
More than 200 miles of barrier reefs surround the Turks and Caicos, prime spots for scuba diving and snorkeling. Eight islands and more than 40 small cays lie in the archipelago, graced with sandy beaches, secluded coves and shallow reefs. The waters are clear, the reefs pristine, the marine life healthy and abundant.
The archipelago lies 30 miles southeast of the Bahamas. The most developed of the islands is Providenciales, known as Provo, which has a variety of lodging, dining and entertainment choices.
The same barrier reef that attracts divers also breaks the surf, creating calm turquoise bays along miles of virtually vacant white sand beaches. On Provo, 14 miles of beach run the length of the northern coastline. Beaches are public from the low-tide line to the dune line. There are no public restrooms, but most beachside hotels don't mind visitors stopping by for a few minutes of shade and a drink.
Provo's most popular beach is the two-and-a-half-mile stretch in front of the resorts on Grace Bay. The most crowded area, good for strolling, jogging and people-watching, is near Club Med Turkoise. Seclusion can be found nearby at Grace Bay's eastern end. Leeward Beach on the east end of Provo is peaceful, deserted and offers powder-white sand, coconut palms, small rocky cliffs and stone jetties.
The major diving areas lie at the western sides of Provo, West Caicos and Grand Turk and the eastern side of South Caicos. Walls richly blanketed with soft corals and vibrant sponges start at 35 to 60 feet below the surface and plunge as much as 7,000 feet into an abyss.
On Provo at Turtle Cove Landing, Flamingo Divers, (809) 946-4193 or (800) 204-9282, specializes in small groups, no more than 12 divers on a 30-foot boat. They schedule regular trips to the popular dive sites, including the plunging walls at North West Point, a 45-minute boat ride from Provo. Here, plumes of black coral trees and dark strands of deep-sea gorgonian decorate the Black Coral Forest. Colorful fish life abounds, especially at the Amphitheater. Shark Hotel is a good place to spot reef and black tip sharks and view a stand of pillar coral. The price is $60 for a two-tank dive, including weights, soft drinks and snacks. There are discounts for three or more days of diving.
Dive packages are also available at Provo's major hotels. Dive Provo, at the Turquoise Reef Resort and Casino, (800) 234-7768 or (809) 946-5040, has a new program that teaches divers how to identify fish. Divers attend a fish-watching seminar and later -- equipped with a reference book, chart, slate and waterproof notes -- search the reef. Their findings are sent to the Reef Environmental Education Foundation. The price is $50 a person. The progam is included in the resort's dive packages, which cost $484 a person for three nights and two days of diving. The resort's three-story hotel has 228 rooms, a few suites, an open-air lobby, a large pool and a small casino.
At the deluxe new Royal Bay Resort and Villas, (800) 822-3900, fax (305) 670-4948, on Provo, the dive/ water sports program includes help for beginners. The dive operator, Provo Aquatic Adventures, (800) 967-3483, fax (305) 351-9740, offers a $90 diving course that includes pool instruction and a guided open-water dive. The resort's 200 rooms, some in villa suites, have ocean views from private balconies, coffee makers and telephones with fax capability. Double room rates start at $210. Dive packages start at $709 a person, double occupancy, for four nights, with three diving days.
One of Turks and Caicos's marine species is being successfully farmed. After 10 years of research, the unusual Caicos Conch Farm last spring harvested its first crop: 70,000 pink-lipped shellfish. Situated on Provo's Leeward Channel, the farm, telephone and fax (809) 946-5849, raises the conch, which have been overfished, in tanks, pens and a pasture. Guides lead tours Monday to Saturday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tickets are $6.
 
 Virgin Gorda
British Virgin Islands Tourist Board, 370 Lexington Avenue, N.Y., New York 10017; (212) 696-0400
Like its neighbor Tortola, Virgin Gorda is a sailor's delight. Lying in clear, tranquil waters, the island has deluxe cruising grounds for people who prefer sailing with eyes glued to land.
The Baths in Devil's Bay National Park is the island's most popular attraction, though not the first choice of people who crave seclusion. Its shallow pools, caves and grottoes, formed by giant volcanic boulders, make it a fine place to swim and snorkel.
Most boat charter companies are based on Tortola, the most populated of the British Virgin Islands. But Virgin Gorda has a selection of bare boats -- yachts rented without a crew -- and an assortment of sea-oriented resorts.
Some resorts offer land-sea packages, such as the upscale Biras Creek with 32 suites and a two-bedroom villa, (800) 223-1108 or (809) 494-3555, fax (310) 440-4220. Built on a 140-acre peninsula, which can be reached only by boat, Biras Creek overlooks North Sound, a popular anchorage, protected by reefs and islands. The resort expects to reopen Jan. 19 after renovations and post-hurricane repairs by its new owner, who grew so fond of vacationing here he bought the place. Biras Creek's suites will have a new design, and Italian tiles will decorate the oceanfront pool; a new building will house an activities center with a conference room and library. Suites have furnished patios and private open-air garden showers. Hurricane Luis slowed the renovations by a month.
Little Dix Bay, the island's premier resort, also suffered some water damage during the hurricane. It has taken advantage of the need to close temporarily by undertaking a complete renovation, which will include new furniture. It will reopen on March 1.
The eight-day Sailaway package at Biras Creek includes a five-night hotel stay and two nights on a 45-foot crewed yacht sailing to other islands. The double rate starts at $3,775, with meals and the use of Boston Whalers, small sailboats and bicycles. A 17 percent tax and service charge is extra.
For people who like dropping anchor near a hotel, the Bitter End Yacht Club and Resort, (800) 872-2392, fax (312) 944-2860, with 100 rooms in 50 villas along a mile of waterfront at the north tip of Virgin Gorda, charters bare boats to experienced sailors. The resort's villas, built of natural wood, have thatched roofs and wrap-around porches. All rooms look out on the water. For a recently refurbished 30-foot Freedom, the weekly price for two is $3,360, including cleaning service, meals at the hotel and the use of a dock or one of 65 moorings in calm North Sound near the resort. The price is the same for seven nights in a hillside villa. The Bitter End adds a daily $12 service charge a person and the 7 percent tax. The price also includes unlimited use of a fleet of small sailboats, kayaks and Boston Whalers. Before sailing away, guests must pass an hour-and-a-half check-out sail with an expert. The seven-night room package includes an introductory sailing course or, for an extra $150 a person, a more intensive three-and-a-half-day course through the Nick Trotter Sailing School. The Bitter End rents its moorings to nonguests for $15 a night, including garbage pickup and a pre-dinner launch service.
Misty Isle Yacht Charters, (809) 495-5643, fax (809) 495-5300, charters four yachts and two power boats. Bare-boaters should make reservations three months in advance for the peak season. The weekly price for a 35-foot sailboat that sleeps four is $2,190; a 50-foot yacht that sleeps 10, $4,290. Additional charges include daily boat insurance of $20 plus a refundable security deposit. A British Virgin Islands cruising permit is $2 a person a day. A National Parks Trust fee for use of moorings is $10 a week for five people or fewer; $15 for eight or fewer. The company will provide a captain for $90 a day extra, plus provisions. A cook is $70 a day.
Among the sailing excursions, the Dogs is a group of islets and rocks with fine snorkeling northwest of Virgin Gorda. Because of possible swells, it's not a place to anchor overnight.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In: Black Rock;
A Bit of New England In a Troubled City

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
NINE days ago Bridgeport lost the battle to jump-start its economy when the Connecticut Senate refused to approve a gambling casino for the city. But in the process, its need for job development was vividly exposed.
The city's resilience in the face of some 40 years of economic and social decay, signaled by municipal recovery from the brink of bankruptcy in 1991 to a $4 million surplus in fiscal '95, as well as the state's resolve to assist in its future, continue to be reassuring to owners of the fine old homes in desirable neighborhoods that come as a surprise to those who only know the city because of its well-documented problems. 
 "It's a common misconception that Bridgeport is not on its feet now," said Charles Brilvitch, the city historian. "The turnpike goes through the worst part of the city, giving people the wrong impression. They don't see neighborhoods like Black Rock."
Black Rock is the city's wealthiest section, a peninsula bordering the Town of Fairfield. Named for the stony shore that some residents liken to Maine, Black Rock is physically separated from the rest of the city by the Connecticut Turnpike. Largely hilly and wooded, Black Rock is dense with venerable, spacious houses, dozens of them in historic districts and priced at little more than half the cost of similar homes on Fairfield County's Gold Coast.
Other positives include magnificent water views, convenient shopping in Fairfield, and a strong sense of community. But because it is a part of Bridgeport, many home buyers say no when real estate agents suggest Black Rock.
Negatives include Bridgeport's image, which some Black Rock residents sidestep by using Black Rock, not Bridgeport, as a home address; a public school system whose grade-school pupilsbarely reach the Connecticut Mastery Test's competency level and property taxes that are among the highest in the state. At the rate of $67.80 per thousand dollars of assessment, taxes on a house selling for $375,000 are $8,618.
None of that stopped David E. A. Carson, president and chief executive officer of the Bridgeport-based People's Bank, from moving to Black Rock from West Hartford 12 years ago. He chose a white colonial house in Black Rock even though he had his pick of any Gold Coast community. "We had just become empty-nesters, looking for not too big a house," Mr. Carson said. "This one met all our requirements, and it has a million-dollar view of the water." Weather permitting, he takes his racing shell out for morning rows in the harbor.
"Black Rock is the friendliest community we have ever lived in," he said.
Houses descend in size and price as they get closer to the turnpike and Bridgeport proper. "They are ideal for young families," said Joseph Formato, president of Century 21 Coastal Realty in Fairfield. While houses can be found for under $100,000, "there are no slums in Black Rock as in the rest of the city," Mr. Formato said.
T HE neighborhood does have the more than 400-unit P. T. Barnum subsidized low-income housing project on Wordin Avenue, which is now being completely renovated. The development is next to the Longfellow Elementary School. Black Rock children who do not attend Fairfield Country Day in Fairfield, Greens Farms Academy in Westport or other private schools outside Bridgeport go to Black Rock School for kindergarten through second grade, Longfellow for grades 3 through 8, and Bassick High School. Bridgeport has 44 public schools, almost 21,000 students and no junior highs.
"Our enrollment grew by 600 kids this year," said James A. Connelly, Superintendent of Schools, "which is typical of the past five years. A lot of them are immigrants."
S.A.T. scores are significantly below both state and national averages, but Mr. Connelly said that "we have three magnet schools in the elementary grades for literature, languages, math and science, and three more for the high school -- academic for advanced college placement, marine science and business."
St. Anne's, a pre-K through grade 8 parochial school in Black Rock, charges $1,750 a year. Citywide there are six Roman Catholic elementary schools and one high school.
"Black Rock buyers are not usually from outside the region," said Barbara Franzen, an agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Fairfield. "They come from Fairfield and Westport, want the water and are familiar with Black Rock as a uniquely beautiful waterfront enclave. There's very little for sale because people love it and don't move."
Love, however, is not the only reason for staying put. "Where would they go?" asked Mr. Brilvitch. "They might sell a fantastic house in Black Rock for $200,000, but what will that buy elsewhere?" The typical Black Rocker is childless or able to afford private schools, immune to Bridgeport-bashing, and in for the long haul.
David Grimshaw is one of a number of writers and artists who have been attracted to the neighborhood. Mr. Grimshaw, who moved in seven years ago, is president of the Black Rock Community Council, a group of about 600 families and businesses that, among other things, has upgraded the facades and sidewalks on Fairfield Avenue's commercial strip and converted a former residence for elderly women into the Burroughs Community Center. It also conducts ongoing discussions about seceding from Bridgeport.
"We pay very high taxes, commensurate with the higher prices of our homes compared with the rest of Bridgeport," said Mr. Grimshaw, "and we feel that our tax dollars are spent in other parts of the city more than here."
Black Rock could attempt to become an independent community, or rejoin the Town of Fairfield, from which it was annexed to Bridgeport in 1870. "We would need state and city approval," said Mr. Grimshaw, indicating that it would be a highly adversarial procedure. Connecticut has no mechanism for dealing with secession.
Black Rock's relationship with Fairfield began in 1681, when the Unquowa Indians of Black Rock sold their land to the Town of Fairfield. For the next 140 years Black Rock flourished as a port, but the hurricane of 1821 blew away a protective island land mass and sent shippers scurrying to safety in Bridgeport Harbor -- the second deepest in the state after New London.
In 1836 Bridgeport incorporated as a city, and by 1870 it was a thriving industrial hub looking to annex Black Rock to develop it residentially for Bridgeport's industrial tycoons. Black Rock's landowners gladly accepted the annexation, sold off parcels at prime prices and got the city to build them some new roads.
An aura of wealth and good times expanded when, in 1874, George Wells built the George Hotel, a 400-room waterfront resort on Grover Hill. The Bridgeport Yacht Club opened in 1895, and Black Rock Harbor blossomed as a boating center.
"By the beginning of the 20th century Victorian hotels were going out of style," said Mr. Brilvitch, "and the George Hotel land was more valuable as house lots, so it was torn down in 1902. Redeveloped residentially through the 1920's, the area was typical of so-called high class developments -- there were restrictive covenants against Jews" -- which could explain why there are several denominations of churches in Black Rock reflecting waves of Swedish, Hungarian, Irish and Italian immigration, but no synagogues, although they exist elsewhere in the city.
THE Black Rock Yacht Club, opened in 1926, took in 30 members this year, according to Dr. Arthur Samuelson, admissions chairman. Limited in number to 250, members pay initiation fees of $3,500 and annual dues of around $1,350. The club has two tennis courts, a pool, restaurant, and about 80 moorings. There are no slips, because "we are wide open to southwest seas and wind," said Dr. Samuelson.
The Fayerweather Yacht Club, formed in 1919, has almost 1,000 members, 125 moorings, a restaurant, and only a two-month waiting list. Initiation costs $500 and dues are $175 a year.
One of Connecticut's major seasonal tourist attractions, Captain's Cove Seaport, is on Black Rock Harbor. It offers full marina services, a 500-seat dining room, craft shops, entertainment, a fish market, and tours of the H.M.S. Rose, a replica of an 18th century British frigate.
Bridgeport residents need only a $5 parking sticker to be admitted to several public recreation areas, including the beach at Seaside Park, tennis at Glenwood Park, and Beardsley Park, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and contains a zoo and carousel. The municipal 36-hole Fairchild-Wheeler Golf Course charges $5 a day in addition to the sticker. Black Rock's sole public park is St. Mary's by the Sea Wildlife Refuge.
A sampling of restaurants includes Black Rock Castle, an Irish pub filled with Celtic music and the aroma of shepherd's pie. The Blood Root Restaurant and Feminist Bookstore is vegetarian, sells books, and caters mostly to women, "but a certain kind of man feels comfortable here," said Selma Miriam, an owner. Home on the Range serves breakfast and lunch, but at 6 P.M. switches to dinners to go. Grilled lamb with roasted vegetables and couscous costs $9.
Cultural attractions in downtown Bridgeport include the Greater Bridgeport Symphony Orchestra, the Barnum Museum -- dedicated to Bridgeport's circus impresario and onetime Mayor -- and the Discovery Museum for children.
"Black Rock's socio-economic life has remained stable in spite of Bridgeport's ups and downs," observed Jack Collins, third-generation owner of the Collins Pharmacy on Fairfield Avenue. "It's one of the few places in Fairfield County where young adults can afford to live where they were born."

FOR THE BIRDS: In the late 1960's a large fir tree in Black Rock provided shelter for four South American parakeets that escaped from a crate at Kennedy International Airport. Before it blew down in a storm a few years later the tree housed 25 nests harboring up to 300 birds that eventually ranged up and down the East Coast. Today, hundreds of the bright green birds remain in Black Rock, nesting each year to the delight of visiting bird-watchers and picture-takers. Residents, often upset by the birds' raucous screeching, say they have not had the heart to implement a program devised to eradicate the birds.

HEADLINE: Women Recovering From Compulsive Gambling, Step by Step

BYLINE: By MARY REINHOLZ 

 BODY:
ON a recent Friday evening five women gathered at a wooded psychiatric complex not far from the bright signs off Sunrise Highway and Route 110 in Amityville. After a ritual reading of a 12-step program's goals and purposes, they began speaking quietly of their compulsion.
One by one they described how gambling in its myriad forms became a habit at church-sponsored bingo parlors; at bars with the state's new video keno game, Quick Draw, or at candy stores and supermarkets, where they bought instant lottery tickets. 
 "Gambling was in my family, whether it was bingo or horses or numbers," said Alice M., 54, of Selden, a one-time compulsive blackjack player who organized the first "women's room" of Long Island Gamblers Anonymous with Pat J. of Farmingdale.
Pat J., also 54, calls herself "a compulsive bingo player" who dabbled in horses and played the slot machines in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. She has not gambled "for two and half years."
The group, which began meeting on Oct. 13, meets on Fridays at 7 P.M. in Robbins Hall on the 83-acre grounds of South Oaks Hospital, a center for treating addictions. The hospital donated space for the group because it is a host for recovery programs, said Dr. Sheila B. Blume, a psychiatrist who is medical director of the alcoholism, chemical-dependency and compulsive-gambling programs.
Dr. Blume added that women in Gamblers Anonymous across the country have had difficult times in establishing "permanent core groups," largely because men who are identified as compulsive gamblers outnumber women 2 to 1.
"Men are mostly addicted to gambling," Alice said. "But more women are getting into it now, because it's become the thing to do and is so easily accessible. All you have to do is look at the buses going to Atlantic City."
She and Pat J. decided that the time was right to start a group because women had complained that they would be "intimidated" in meetings that men dominated, they said.
"Gamblers Anonymous was started 38 years ago, but it is still geared toward middle-aged married men," except in areas like Las Vegas, said Judy L., 35, an unemployed legal secretary who took a train from Brooklyn for the third meeting in Amityville, on Oct. 27.
Judy is single and has tried unsuccessfully to start Gamblers Anonymous groups for women in New York City, she said, adding that last year she spent $35,000 on gambling from the sale of her late parents' house to play mostly "card games" in her neighborhood, in Atlantic City and aboard cruise ships. "It was the excitement, the glamour, the feeling of being a big shot," Judy said. "I'd get a rush being at a table surrounded by men and sometimes beating them at their own game."
Judy said after the meeting that she has been in debt to loansharks and had started gambling as a teenager, "because I was unhappy at home." She has been alternating between periods of abstinence and binges since joining Gamblers Anonymous 12 years ago and sporadically attending meetings. Lately, she said, she has been going to meetings in Rockville Centre and Bohemia.
"I haven't gambled for 47 days," she told the group.
Micki, in her 60's, pronounced herself "abstinent since Oct. 12," after years of compulsively playing Lotto and, more recently, Quick Draw.
"I was still playing it when keno came out," Micki said. "It's in the bowling alley where I go in Suffolk. Now I see girls going into bars to play, and guys' pushing and promoting Quick Draw and keno, which I now call electronic crack. And I want to tell them, 'Stop, don't get into it.' "
Dr. Blume said she strongly supported the group, noting that one-tenth of the compulsive gamblers receiving help are women. "Most of the people in G.A. are high rollers who have incurred debts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars," she said. "Most women don't have that kind of money. Most are bingo players. They may play six nights a week, using up their retirement funds and pensions, not buying new clothes and eating minimally. But they are not usually reached by G.A., although they fit the diagnostic criteria for compulsive gambling."
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association lists compulsive gambling as an impulse-control disorder. In advanced stages, it includes returning to gamble after a loss to "get even" or to "chase losses," and committing crimes like forgery, theft and embezzlement. Exact figures are hard to come by, Dr. Blume said, but she estimated the percentage of compulsive gamblers at 1.5 to 3.0 percent of adults, "with an unknown number of teen-agers."
Rachel Volberg, a sociologist and president of Gemini Research in Roaring Spring, Pa., specializes in studying gambling. Ms. Volberg said it would "overstate the issue" to picture all pathological gamblers as white-collar criminals.
She said gambling more commonly affected gamblers' families and workplaces.
Ms. Volberg also disputed the idea that female compulsive gamblers were mainly bingo players. She said gambling patterns had changed in the 1990's. In some regions, she added, the ratio of compulsive gamblers ranges from "10 men to 6 women."
An even greater number of problem gamblers do not meet the "clinical diagnosis for pathological gambling," Ms. Volberg said, adding:
"Women are involved in many forms of gambling, slot machines, some of the table games. Women are often more comfortable playing blackjack than poker. And they are definitely into what's been euphemistically called gaming videos, or video-lottery terminals, video poker, video keno and blackjack. The gaming machines appear to be more dangerous in terms of the number of people who get into trouble with them."
Dr. Blume said two general groups become addicted to gambling, "the action seekers, often men, and the escape seekers, who are more often women."
"Men are more likely to start as winners," she said, "while women are more likely to start gambling at a time of difficulty in their lives such as an abusive relationship, and gamble as an escape.
Compulsive gambling will increase "until our policy makers admit there's a problem, even though that gets in the way of their looking to gambling to generate revenues without taxation," Dr. Blume said.
Alice, a former bookkeeper who suffers from chronic depression and alcoholism, said she began gambling in hopes of making extra money after her marriage broke up in 1978. She played bingo five nights a week and went to play the slot machines in Atlantic City, she said, adding:
"Toward the end I got into blackjack. I would stay at the tables for 28 hours and go to work in the morning. It got to the point where I would lose my paycheck and couldn't pay my bills. But I lost most of my money on the Cash 3 and Pick 4 numbers games of the New York State Lottery. I kept figuring the next time I'd win. You look at the idea that your luck is going to change."
In 1993, Alice, who now receives welfare, spent 28 days at South Oaks. She had therapy and attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings.
Lloyd A., chairman of the Long Island Intergroup of Gamblers Anonymous, a business group, welcomed the women's group. "Only six or seven women" attended the 30 or so mixed meetings a week that the organization sponsors in Nassau and Suffolk for 600 members, he said.
"I don't know why," Lloyd said. "Maybe they're not admitting it. It's an easy disease to hide. But more women across the country are coming into the program, and a lot more today are becoming trustees."
Modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous was founded in Los Angeles in 1957 and now has 12,000 members worldwide, said Karen H.
Karen, an international executive secretary, was "one of two women" when she attended her first meeting in Los Angeles 10 years ago, she said, and she is now the "only woman" in her regular support group there. "But I don't see that as a problem," Karen said. "People will use any excuse to go back to gambling such as there are too many guys and not enough women."
Others contend that female gamblers' groups, like women's groups in Alcoholics Anonymous, address special needs. "It's been difficult for women to feel comfortable or accepted, especially in rooms where there are high rollers and businessmen who spend thousands of dollars with a throw of the dice," said Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the Compulsive Gambling Center in Baltimore. It is host to residential 12-step programs where women sometimes outnumber men.
Ms. Lorenz said she often became involved in court cases to obtain reduced sentences for compulsive gamblers charged with crimes like forgery and embezzlement. She said female gamblers generally tended to commit lesser offenses like passing bad checks, although one woman from New York for whom she helped to obtain a reduced sentence, a 41-year-old former bookkeeper, embezzled $265,000 from her former employer over two years to support her gambling. She tried to commit suicide three times while facing Federal charges in 1993, Ms. Lorenz said.
The woman, Susan F., was released on probation last month, after having served an 18-month sentence, with 6 in prison and 12 in treatment.
"It was at the joker poker machines in my neighborhood where I went over the edge," Susan said. "You can lose anywhere from $600 to $1,000 in the blink of an eye. Most of the time I gambled knowing I wasn't going to win. Most people gamble out of boredom or because of problems at home. They're looking for a dream world. Gambling doesn't do the physical damage of alcoholism. But the psychological effects are devastating. What you're doing basically is playing Russian roulette with your life."
Information on the new group is available from Alice M. at 698-6936.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen Golf GL;
Born in Mexico of German Stock

BYLINE: By LEONARD M. APCAR 

 BODY:
STOPPED at an intersection the other day, I came face to face with an immaculate little Volkswagen Beetle, the kind you used to see everywhere and hardly ever see now. I pointed it out to my children as if it were a museum piece on wheels.
It is hard to believe it has been 25 years since Volkswagen's heyday in America. In its prime, the Beetle outsold the best-selling cars of today, like the Ford Taurus and the Honda Accord. 
 VW likes to brag that it is still the best-selling European make in the United States, but its sales are about a fifth of what they once were. There are so many more competitors now. But even when Volkswagen had the market at its fender and demand for small cars soared, the company lost ground. The Japanese simply offered more stylish, more sturdy and better-equipped small cars -- and sold them for less.
One often-forgotten fact is that VW was the first foreign auto maker to build cars in this country in recent years. In a bid to prove that it was serious about the United States car market, and fighting the effects of a rising German mark, it moved into a building in Pennsylvania that Chrysler had never used.
But by 1987, the factory was closed. Customers had whispered about differences in the quality of German-made models compared with those assembled in America. Sales continued to sink.
Then, three years ago, just as VW was ushering in restyled 1993-model Golfs and Jettas, labor and manufacturing troubles struck its assembly plant in Mexico, by then its chief source of cars for North America. The problems cut off shipments to the United States for months, and the industry all but wrote off Volkswagen in America.
I, too, hadn't thought much about VW until a group of us rented a dark blue, sparsely equipped Golf in Europe this year and drove it more than 1,400 miles in a week on both the country roads and high-speed routes of France and Italy. The company considers the car's 1.8-liter engine, with 75 horsepower, too anemic for America, but it delivered solid performance with a five-speed manual gearbox. The car was responsive in shifting, steering, braking and acceleration.
Inside, wind noise was remarkably moderate for a small car, the seats were surprisingly comfortable and leg room was more than adequate for adults. The hatchback's cargo bay -- which is larger than some full-sized trunks -- swallowed everything the three of us had. I cannot recall hearing even a rattle. (And this from a rental car.)
Could a Volkswagen built in Mexico for Americans be this smooth?
After driving a nearly identical 1995 Golf GL, the answer is yes. There are noticeable differences between the German-made Golf and its North American cousin -- mostly for the benefit of Americans' tastes. But Mexican labor did not come up short in the quality of assembly. Doors and trim fitted nicely on the pearl red metallic test car, which felt solid and handled smoothly. Compared with Japanese makes, however, like the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, VW's quality is still lagging, according to surveys of owners by J. D. Power & Associates.
In this price bracket, the Japanese make supremely competent cars, of course. What VW offers is, at its heart, a quintessentially German car: chracteristically Teutonic in its decor and a bit rowdy under the hood. At $13,575, the base-model GL is pretty complete. Anti-lock brakes are a $775 option; a sunroof costs $590 and an automatic transmission is $875. The Golf GL is now sold in America only as a four-door hatchback; the popular Jetta is essentially a Golf with a trunk.
In the past, VW was criticized for designing one car and selling it virtually unchanged around the world. But for American tastes, the Golf sold here had cup holders (Ach du Liebe! These Americans actually drink in their cars?), a fancier audio system with more speakers and a throaty bass, a larger four-cylinder engine, a center console with a lockable storage bin and a convenient button to pop open the hatch.
There are also three significant touches on the American car that are not found on most of VW's rivals. One is a standard-equipment security system that sets off an alarm and disables the engine if anyone tampers with the ignition, doors, hood, hatch or radio. One reason for the system is to help reduce the cost of owning a VW. For years, certain models were costly to insure because they were so frequently stolen.
There is also a standard power lock system that allows you to lock or unlock one door or all four doors and the hatch from either of the two front doors. With the turn of a key, the system also sets the car alarm and a tiny red light flashes -- accompanied by a toot of the horn -- to indicate that the car is buttoned up and the alarm is on.
And finally there were daytime running lights, a safety feature that is spreading to more and more cars in an effort to make them more visible and reduce collisions. Anytime the ignition is on, both front and rear lights are lit. One drawback is that the device is so new that well-meaning folks will stop to tell you that your lights are on. One benefit is that as of January, New York law requires auto insurance companies to provide premium discounts for all vehicles equipped with the feature.
The Golf's 1995 instrument panel was well laid out except for two goofs. With a passenger-side air bag there was no room for a glove box, even though the European version had dual air bags, a glove box and storage shelfs under the dash. The cup holders on the version sold here, clearly a grudging concession by German stylists who wouldn't think of sipping coffee in a car, blocked access to a small storage cubby. The center console and the wide side pockets in the front doors, with thoughtful removable liners, only partly compensated for the missing glove compartment. (On 1996 models, VW found a way keep all the other features and carve out a glove box.)
To serious German car designers who value performance and simplicity, the bows to American taste must seem like pandering. But Volkswagen is trying mightily to mount a comeback in America and there are results: its sales are up smartly; its products are appealing, and the quality is improving. The company is even preparing to bring back a successor to the Beetle, the Concept 1, restyled with 90's flare. That should arrive by the year 2000, about 50 years after the first Volkswagen came to America. By then, the Beetle may truly be an antique.

HEADLINE: Black Mark for a 'Good Citizen'

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to business ethics, few American corporations have a better image than the H.B. Fuller Company of St. Paul, a leading manufacturer of industrial glues, coatings and paints. Awards, honors and inclusion in various socially conscious mutual funds attest to its standing as a good corporate citizen.
But that reputation is being clouded by the company's handling of a stubborn image-staining problem: the illegal abuse of its shoemaker's glue by homeless Central American children, who have become addicted to the product's intoxicating but dangerous fumes. 
 Some child welfare advocates, led by Covenant House in New York City, have demanded for years that the company add a noxious oil to its glue to discourage abusers. The company has resisted that approach -- possibly because it might reduce the glue's effectiveness, possibly because the smell would be irritating to legitimate users. Fuller will say only that it is doing all it reasonably can to prevent abuse.
Now this simmering dispute may boil over into something more serious for the company's image, and for its shareholders. Lawyers will decide by the end of the year whether to press ahead with a wrongful-death suit against Fuller on behalf of the family of a Guatemalan teen-ager who died in 1993. The legal team is also weighing the expansion of that suit into a class action, said one of the lawyers, Scott Hendler of Austin, Tex. By some estimates, tens of thousands of Central American children sniff some sort of glue.
Officers of Covenant House's Latin American subsidiary are "anxious that we go forward with this case," Mr. Hendler said, "because they are absolutely convinced that Fuller's glue was responsible for the boy's death and that Fuller has been negligent in dealing with this problem."
William Belknap, a Fuller spokesman, would not respond to specific questions but provided a one-page statement. "We are a law-abiding company with a long history of concern for product safety," it said. "We make and sell only legitimate products for legitimate purposes." The statement also listed briefly the steps the company has taken in recent years "to reduce the likelihood" of its glue being abused, including substituting a slightly less toxic formulation and curbs on retail sales in Honduras and Guatemala.
The Fuller experience provides a textbook example of the thorny moral equations that lie beyond the simple arithmetic of the bottom line. But few agree on what lessons it offers: Does it teach that those who pursue the "good citizen" label too aggressively leave themselves vulnerable to attack? Or does it simply underscore how important it is for a corporate citizen to live up to its self-created image?
And Fuller does repeatedly present itself as a good citizen. Year after year it sprinkles its annual reports with statements proclaiming that it has a commendable corporate conscience. In 1992, for instance, its "mission statement" said the company "will conduct business legally and ethically, support the activities of its employees in their communities and be a responsible corporate citizen." In material sent to shareholders, it chose as one benchmark for its overall performance an index of socially responsible companies, thus underscoring that that is a peer group it considers important. And it has endowed a chair in business ethics at the University of Minnesota.
Fuller, of course, is not the only company to be accused of not living up to its own good-citizen image. In September 1994, the Body Shop International P.L.C., the cosmetics retailer whose advertisements stress a commitment to natural products, high environmental standards and philanthropy, was accused of exaggerating its adherence to those principles. And the founders of Ben and Jerry's Homemade Inc. have been tweaked frequently for preaching corporate democracy while practicing a more autocratic management style.
Nor is glue-sniffing a new issue for the makers of solvent-based adhesives. The Testor Corporation added a noxious ingredient to discourage abuse of its hobby glue in July 1969. And Henkel, a German chemical company that competes with Fuller, stopped making certain toxic glues in Central America last year.
But Fuller, which dominates the Central American market with its Resistol brand of glue, seems to have been singled out for more than its share of recent criticism, one industry consultant said. For four years, protesters have demonstrated outside Fuller's annual meetings, often in Minnesota's cold and rain. And some have bought Fuller shares and tried to get their complaints on the record at those meetings.
"If they had a lesser reputation they would be less of a target," said William Broxterman, president of Chemquest Group, a consulting firm in Cincinnati.
Timothy Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, which coordinates the work of 275 religious investors with about $50 billion in assets, agreed that a high profile in the corporate citizenship arena can invite attack. "But as I see it, the hazard is not in acting in a socially responsible way," he said. "The hazard is in over-marketing yourself as a saint."
Whatever the lesson one draws, however, the Fuller case should be required reading for corporate directors, said Lawrence Bear, a New York University professor and co-author of the textbook "Free Markets, Finance, Ethics, and Law." As Professor Bear sees it, "the question of how directors ought to act in circumstances like this is a terribly serious one, because when it gets out of hand, it gets into court."
Even if Fuller loses the wrongful-death suit, it would be unlikely to affect, in any meaningful way, the bottom line of a company with more than $30 million in profits on $1 billion in revenues. But if it is expanded to a class action, the impact is more difficult to predict, since that step would make the case more difficult for the plaintiffs and more potentially damaging for the company.
The litigation will also be an important test for Fuller's reputation not only at home but in Latin America. In 1994, fully 27 percent of its operating profits of $66 million came from Latin American operations.
The company -- no relation to Fuller Brush -- has deep roots. Founded in 1887 by Harvey Benjamin Fuller as a one-man wallpaper-paste shop, it now has operations worldwide. Its glues -- in more than 10,000 varieties -- hold together everything from cars to cigarettes to disposable diapers. The company was run for years by Elmer L. Andersen, a former Minnesota Governor, whose son Anthony L. is now chairman.
HOW did the Fuller dispute become so bitter? Most participants agree that the answer lies in the events of the summer of 1992, when Fuller's board adopted a resolution that seemed to be a victory for the company's critics.
For years, the directors had been under pressure by a loose alliance of child advocacy groups concerned about the hazards of glue-sniffing among the homeless children of Central America. Those young glue-sniffers are widely called "resistoleros" -- for Fuller's Resistol -- regardless of which brand they actually abuse. As that summer began, a national television news magazine was preparing to feature Fuller's product as part of the glue-sniffing problem.
Then, on July 16, 1992, the board abruptly but unanimously voted to stop selling Resistol adhesives in Central America. As the company explained in its 1992 annual report: "Faced with the realizations that a suitable replacement product would not be available in the near future and that the illegitimate distribution was continuing, the Board of Directors decided that our Central American operations should stop selling those solvent-based Resistol adhesives that were commonly being abused by children."
Local newspapers quoted Mr. Belknap as saying that until an alternative was found, "we simply don't believe it is the right decision to keep our solvent product on the market."
Mary Swenson, a member of the informal Coalition on Resistoleros in St. Paul, said her group was "ecstatic." "We had a party," she recalled. "We had champagne."
But jubilation soon turned to anger. By October 1992, the advocates had learned that Fuller had not stopped selling Resistol in Central America -- and did not intend to. It no longer sold the glue to retailers and small-scale users in Honduras and Guatemala, but it did sell large tubs and barrels of it to industrial customers in those countries, and to a broader list of commercial and industrial users in neighboring countries.
According to the company's statement, it has since taken other steps to address the abuse. It has changed the product's formula, dropping the sweet-smelling but highly toxic solvent toluene and substituting the slightly less toxic chemical cyclohexane. It has tried to develop a water-based glue, which is not intoxicating. It has studied the issue "thoroughly and carefully" and has contributed to community programs for homeless children in Central America.
But those who expected Resistol sales in Central America to stop in 1992 describe those steps as mere image-polishing. Bruce Harris, the director of Latin American programs for Covenant House, asserts that Resistol is still readily available to children in Nicaragua and El Salvador and, to a lesser degree, in Costa Rica. "If they are genuinely concerned about the children," he asked, "why haven't they pulled out of all the countries -- as their board mandated?"
Mr. Harris is not alone in wondering about the gap between the board resolution of 1992 and the company's subsequent action. Indeed, among experts in business ethics, that remains the biggest mystery.
"They shot themselves in the foot," said Mr. Smith of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, who nevertheless gives Fuller high marks for corporate conduct. The company has been praised for a high level of corporate philanthropy, including giving 5 percent of its profits to charity in each country where it operates. Moreover, the company has committed itself to safe environmental practices worldwide -- practices "often more stringent than local government standards," Fuller said in an S.E.C. filing last year.
ALICE TEPPER MARLIN, executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities, a leading advocate for socially responsible corporate conduct, agreed that that the 1992 episode damaged Fuller's credibility. "If a company seems to go back on its commitments, they have sowed such distrust that it makes it very difficult to proceed," she said. "And that is the board's responsibility."
Mr. Belknap, the Fuller spokesman, said none of the company's directors would comment about their handling of the issue, which he said has not been the subject of any other board resolution since the July 1992 action. "I'd have to say that the position statement I provided you with is consistent with the thinking of our board," he said. "I can't really go beyond that."
Whatever happens with the threatened litigation, the dispute has certainly tarnished the company's once-pristine reputation as a good citizen. The attacks are coming on several fronts, including accusations that its paints made and sold abroad exceed United States limits on lead and a quarrel over the company's role as a big supplier of glue to the tobacco industry.
According to Mr. Harris and Ms. Swenson, paints purchased from hardware stores throughout Central America were tested in a St. Paul laboratory. The test results, which were provided to The New York Times, show high levels of lead in many, of the samples, including some but not all that are identified by the group as being Fuller products. Even though selling such paint is legal in Central America, critics point out that high lead levels are a known hazard, especially to children.
Asked about the group's accusation, Mr. Belknap said, "We have publicly stated at our annual meeting that all of our products are within the U.S. standards for lead in paint." He would not respond to questions about whether Fuller's Central American paints have always conformed with United States lead standards, and if not, when the formula was adjusted.
Given this history of mutual mistrust and frustration, it is not surprising that the Fuller dispute ultimately wound up in lawyers' hands. On Jan. 3, 1995, Mr. Hendler and a co-counsel, Michael Brickman of Charleston, S.C., filed their wrongful-death claim against Fuller in state court in Dallas.
The case was filed in Texas to stop the clock until Mr. Hendler could determine that the statute of limitations for such cases was three years in Minnesota, his preferred venue because he wants to take the case right to Fuller's home town. He then obtained court permission to withdraw the case in Texas, but must refile it in Minnesota before the first week in January.
A class action against Fuller is "something that is under consideration," Mr. Hendler said, adding, "We are still evaluating certain factors, such as how much of their product was out there, how many children are affected, and the extent of the impairment caused in the children who use the glue chronically -- that's the most significant factor."
But, according to Mr. Smith of the Interfaith Center, Fuller's board may soon face another test in the treacherous world of corporate citizenship, regardless of what Mr. Hendler decides about his lawsuit. "Fuller is a major seller of adhesives to the tobacco industry," Mr. Smith noted. "They are selling glues that go into a lethal product. That is another corporate-responsibility issue that Fuller's shareholders will be raising this coming year."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Giving Thanks For Signs Of Growth

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
As the Dow Jones industrial average smashed through 5,000 last week, it was the cyclical stocks -- the ones most vulnerable to a weak economy -- that were leading the way. That was a sharp reversal of recent months, and a repudiation of the growing suspicion among economists that the economy was sliding toward a recession next year or the year after.
It was not just that the cyclicals did best. They were virtually the only movers. Most major indexes other than the Dow were having a blah week. The Standard & Poor's 500, the most-watched indicator of large stock performance, fell a bit. Smaller stocks suffered more, and technology stocks -- the erstwhile leaders -- fared poorly. After hitting amazing highs on Monday, even the Internet stocks turned south. 
 The week's entire Dow move -- a rise of 58.89 points -- was accounted for by seven of the 30 stocks: General Motors, Alcoa, Caterpillar, DuPont, Goodyear, United Technologies and Union Carbide. Among the Dow stocks that fell were Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble and McDonald's.
What significance does that have? Maybe, as some muttered, it was just a handful of fund managers bidding up some recent laggards. Or maybe the real news is in the relative weakness of much of the market.
But if the strength in cyclicals continues, it could be an indication that traders are not worried about a weakening economy, despite all the talk of consumers being tapped out, and of a Scooge-like Christmas. Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Capital Investments International, argues that investors are looking forward to a Fed easing that will insure that recession is averted.
Mr. Barbera points to one of the more interesting economic ideas to emerge this year, one that raises the possibility that much of the economic debate in recent years has been totally off base. Leonard I. Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that the number crunchers have underestimated real growth and overestimated inflation by as much as 2 to 3 percent a year, because they failed to estimate accurately the improvements resulting from technological advances.
In a Working Paper published by the Philly Fed, entitled "Is U.S. Economic Performance Really So Bad?" Mr. Nakamura concludes inflation has been overestimated far more than others have thought.
He may overdo it. The way he sees it, the medical inflation numbers have been drastically overstated because new technology allows doctors to do things they couldn't before. But that doesn't change the fact that health care does cost much more than it used to. Even so, he seems to have a point, at least in overall direction if not in exact numbers.
If he is right, then such trends as declining productivity and falling real income turn out to be false, and you can quietly dispose of all those papers seeking to explain them. "This new picture of the U.S. economy is one consistent with the fact that U.S. technology in medicine, computer science, entertainment and finance is premier in the world, and that technology is improving with awesome speed," Mr. Nakamura writes. And Mr. Barbera notes that if the Fed's governors take that estimate at all seriously, they can conclude that there is no real inflation in the economy, and therefore no reason not to ease credit.
It also is consistent with a market that is up 36 percent in a year. And it is a nice thought for a Thanksgiving weekend.

HEADLINE: The Merger Downside

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a state Senator representing parts of Brooklyn, I have closely followed your coverage of the pending merger of the Chemical and Chase Manhattan banks and the impact it is likely to have on financial services for my district and all New York City ("Stalking the Next Big Takeovers," Investing It, Nov. 5). 
 The merger -- from banks and retail chains to hospitals and H.M.O.'s -- is a common thread running through the economic history of the 1990's. The industries most inclined to merge are service oriented, and that gives me great concern.
The merger trend is not based on expanding the economic base or expanding services but, instead, on increasing the bottom line. Bigger is better, and dead weight should be trimmed. If this teaches us anything, it is that economically disadvantaged communities, those most in need, are going to bear an undue brunt of the burden when the fat is trimmed. After all, business goes where the money is -- not necessarily where the needs are. From health care to retailing to banking, merger means a diminution of services with the poorer neighborhoods most likely to feel the impact.
The Federal Community Reinvestment Act was adopted to insure that financial institutions put money back into the communities where they do business and which they are supposed to serve. It was supposed to be part of the answer to rebuilding our inner cities, but it has had some sorry aspects. Under the merger scenario, a real bank, one at which you walk in and visit with a teller and a loan officer, is being increasingly replaced by an automated teller machine, which allows the bank to comply minimally with the law, and, at the same time, cut employees and the cost of doing business.
I have an urgent sense of a clear and present danger whenever I read of another merger in banking, health care or any service industry. I see a loss of jobs and a loss of services. It is hard enough to get a loan or a credit card with human help in a "brick and mortar" bank. How then can an A.T.M., while in compliance with the law, perform any type of service remotely approaching those that are most in demand, let alone those in advanced lending and financial planning?
The branch bank represents the heart of a community. Everyone from the small-business owner, the individual saver and the retiree goes to the local bank. I doubt that an A.T.M. can read a business plan, evaluate a loan agreement or pass on a car loan.
I will be devoting a great deal of time to this issue when the New York Legislature convenes in January. How will the banks fulfill their public service obligations and how will regulators make sure the banks meet their responsibilities? Banks, retailers, hospitals and H.M.O.'s are members of the community; they should act like it.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Donald A. Yacktman -- Yacktman Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHEN the technology stock bubble bursts, as it eventually must, what group of stocks will take the market lead? If the country is indeed in the late stages of an economic expansion, as many economists suggest, the big consumer stocks may be poised to have their day. These stocks tend to hold up well even when growth slows, because people always buy certain items, like food, shampoo, underwear and cigarettes.
For Donald A. Yacktman, the manager of the Yacktman Fund, such a shift in market sentiment would be good news. Though he disdains investing based on market and economic cycles, he employs a style of investing that tends toward big consumer goods companies whose stocks are undervalued. 
 "The common thread I see today is consumer and retailing," Mr. Yacktman said, naming RJR Nabisco, Fruit of the Loom, Toys 'R' Us and Wal-Mart as examples.
What if consumer stocks don't break out soon?
"Part of our strategy is having patience," said Mr. Yacktman, who started the Yacktman Fund three years ago after steering Selected American Shares to oversized gains for a decade.
In its brief life, the Yacktman Fund has had a mixed record, in part because it waits out sharp swings in the market instead of chasing hot sectors. Mr. Yacktman, 54, runs the fund much as he speaks, in a methodical manner.
He held on to shares in Philip Morris after April 1993, when panic selling punished the stock after the company announced it was cutting its Marlboro cigarette prices.
Today, Philip Morris is the Yacktman Fund's top holding. The stock closed at $89 last week, nearly double its price two years ago, but Mr. Yacktman still considers it cheap. "There is concern about litigation, and that's held the price down," he said.
The fund suffered from its loyalty to that stock and other big consumer names in 1993. It lost 6.6 percent that year, compared with a 10.1 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. The tables were turned last year, when the fund beat the S.& P. by 7.5 percentage points.
Which brings the fund up to 1995, a mediocre year thus far. A lack of technology stocks has held back its performance. "We rarely do well in explosive markets," Mr. Yacktman said. "As the market goes up, we're trying to get defensive."
These days, he is selling stocks that seem overvalued, among them the pharmaceutical kingpins: Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer. "We're starting to sell off stocks that have become very popular and fully priced," he said, "and putting the money into cash or more undervalued securities."
 He avoids technology stocks, "because I want to put money into businesses that stand the test of time, and technology has a lot of Roman candles." He also steers clear of auto, railroad, steel, chemicals and paper stocks, cyclical stocks that do well in an economic expansion.
None of those would survive his first test: a high return on tangible assets. When examining returns, he focuses on a company's assets, inventory and receivables rather than its capital or equity. "We look at the assets that are needed to run the business, not how the business is financed," Mr. Yacktman said. He estimated that the 37 or 38 companies in his portfolio are two or three times more profitable than the average United States company by this measure.
Then he looks at the company's management. As he sees it, management's first mandate is to protect and build the business. Any extra cash should be used for acquisitions; then to buy back stock, build cash or pay off debt, and finally to pay dividends.
His third criterion is a low purchase price, which forces him to buy on a company's weakness, perceived or otherwise. But in spite of the bull market and the huge inflow of money into the fund during the last two years, he has found plenty to buy.
"Between now and mid-December is the apex of the tax-selling season, when people get rid of the stocks they perceive as bad," he said. "The secret is to separate the wheat from the chaff."
Within the last month, he said that he had been buying profitable companies at depressed prices, including Fruit of the Loom; Toys 'R' Us; Reebok; Franklin Quest, a Salt Lake City company that makes day planners and promotes time management seminars, and United Asset Management, which owns money management firms.
 One of his largest holdings is Fruit of the Loom, "which is on everyone's hate list," he said. The stock, which sold for $50 more than two years ago, has sunk to $18.125 a share. Yet "the core of this company is fine," he said, despite some bad acquisitions and cyclical problems with cotton prices.
He called the company the lowest-cost producer with 40 percent of the underwear and T-shirt market and more than 20 years of rising operating profits. As long as the company focuses on its basic businesses, its profitability will return, he said.
Another favorite is United Asset Management, a Boston company that owns 43 pension fund management firms, some of which also run mutual funds.
He figures the company has an after-tax cash flow of $165 million. Of that amount, capital expenses run $5 million and dividend payments just over $30 million. That leaves $130 million, making United "a real cash machine," Mr. Yacktman said.
With after-tax earnings of $5 a share, and a share priced at about $37, the company's yield is equivalent to a bond yield of 13.5 percent, by his calulation.

At the Urban Lumberyard, Material for Building Many a New Life

BYLINE: By THOMAS H. MATTHEWS 

 BODY:
The trucks leave six days a week in the early morning with two-by-fours and Sheetrock, flooring and doors to help create new beginnings all over the city. And before the sun is high, many of those sky-blue trucks are returning, ready for another load.
By then, the urban lumberyard on 11th Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets is full, with men in worn jeans and flannel shirts sipping coffee and waiting for their orders, making their own new beginnings. 
 They come to Metropolitan Lumber from many nations -- Ireland, Poland, Nigeria -- many of them learning their trade after arrival in New York.
"I never had a hammer in my hand until I came here," said Peter Tryniszewski, who came to New York from Warsaw five years ago and now is a supervisor for Professional Construction.
Some say they will eventually have to decide whether to return home with their earnings or to stay and build a new life. But today, there is an old wall to be knocked down and a room expanded.
John McBride came from Northern Ireland a year ago with an engineering background but no business connections. He met some fellow Irishmen in a bar, and a day after arriving he had a job. He says he is making three times as much money as he would at home.
"I was going to stay for just a year," he said, "but I think I'm going to stay on for another."
Business for Metropolitan Lumber, which opened in 1979 and has a hardware store across the street, is better than last year, but not by a lot, said its owner, Bob Gans.
"There's more optimism on a business basis than a year ago," he said. "People are more willing to invest in the future, and to do that they have to refurbish."
Metropolitan has another store on Spring Street, as well as three stores in Queens. The newest one opened in Long Island City in March. Mr. Gans said that business had still not fully recovered from the construction recession of 1989 but that it had been on an upswing since 1994.
One factor contributing to slow recovery is Home Depot, the hardware superstore. Some of Metropolitan's customers admitted that they used Home Depot because it can be cheaper. However, many said that geography plays a more important role when they decide which lumberyard to use.
"If you're working in Manhattan, you use this place," said Mr. Tryniszewski. THOMAS H. MATTHEWS

HEADLINE: Budget Balancers Must Keep Hard Times in the Equation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Both the Republican seven-year plan and the Clinton 10-year plan for balancing the budget are based on certain economic projections. Although I am not privy to the exact economic forecasts, I very much doubt that either envisions a severe economic recession. Should that occur, the timetables are irrelevant. 
 Despite the statement of Robert E. Lucas Jr., latest winner of the Nobel award for economics, that "the economy is in excellent shape," I respectfully interpose a vigorous dissent. Yes, the latest reported unemployment figure is 5.5 percent, the lowest in many years and significantly below the 6 percent that was the trigger point for a rise in inflation.
But that 5.5 percent is fundamentally flawed. It does not jibe with the more reliable statistic of the third quarter of 4.99 million new unemployment claims offset by only 341,000 new jobs created. Even if we optimistically assume that half the 4.99 million were rehired, the simple arithmetic is frightening.
Yes, the stock market has gone wild with about 60 new highs for the year. Remember that the Dow Jones was at a record level at the 1987 crash (I do not expect such a debacle).
As for consumer spending, despite enormous discounts affecting the bottom line and unheard-of 13-month to 14-month interest-free credit terms on certain big-ticket items by a few large chains, retail sales fell last month. This is ominous since two-thirds of our economy is powered by consumer spending.
It is imperative that both the Republican and Democratic parties take a conceptual approach to balancing the budget. They must recognize the difference between a cost and an investment.
Just one example: Funding for the military, however necessary up to the point of the perceived threat to our security, is both a cost and inflationary since it does not put salable items on the shelf except for export.
But accelerating the pace of low-cost housing is an investment since it puts people back to work in an industry that has tremendous synergism. It reduces the cost of unemployment benefits, relief payments and housing for the homeless. It not only restores dignity to the unemployed, but it also increases the tax-paying base and the pool of consumers.
It is obviously cost-effective. With the proliferation of layoffs at every level, it is sorely needed to prevent recession.

HEADLINE: OVER THERE;
Why the Yanks Are Going. Yet Again.

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
IT was widely assumed, in the aftermath of the cold war, that America's commitment to European security would diminish. What the United States had done for Western Europe after World War II with the Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO, the European Union would do for its neighbors in Eastern Europe in the aftermath of Communism. The notion had a certain intellectual allure, as well as obvious financial benefits for America. But it was finally laid to rest in Dayton, Ohio, last week by the Pax Americana that put a stop to the slaughter in Bosnia.
The peace, hammered out over 21 days of sometimes burlesque negotiation, is inevitably uncertain because it is an attempt to build a Bosnian state of no obvious cohesion on a terrain still raw with the wounds of war. The shouting and maneuvering in Ohio could easily degenerate into shooting and mayhem in Bosnia. 
 But in the manner of its making and in the plans for its enforcement, the settlement does contain one certainty: America's burden is about to grow because, in the end, the fall of the Soviet empire and the Balkan war that followed have exposed the critical weaknesses of the European Union and Washington's unique powers of suasion in the old and the new Europe. Whatever Congress may think about President Clinton's commitment to send 20,000 United States troops as an indispensable one-third of a NATO force to police the peace, the evidence of enduring European dependence on American leadership now appears overwhelming.
It was not supposed to be this way. Rather than call on American muscle for the third time this century in the face of war on the continent, Europe had hoped to mark its emancipation by settling the latest Balkan conflict itself. A half-century of growing cohesion and prosperity seemed to have prepared the Europeans. When Yugoslavia began its bloody disintegration in June 1991, Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, announced that "the age of Europe has dawned."
Accompanied by the Dutch and Italian Foreign Ministers, and supported by a Bush Administration eager to leave a European war to those most directly affected by it, Mr. Poos then waded into the Balkans. In essence, the three men bore the message of Jean Monnet, the European Union's founding father: "Faire l'Europe, c'est faire la paix" -- "To build Europe is to build peace." The Balkan leaders listened carefully, signed the first of countless cease-fires, and went straight back to war.
 
Good Intent vs. Power
 The Europeans persisted. Envoy followed envoy, plan followed plan. But their efforts were always undermined by the fact that the European Union is a trading giant and a military midget. The 15-member Union could provide soldiers in United Nations uniform to donate rice; it could not provide heavily armed soldiers to back tough policy decisions. Its defense arm, the Western European Union, still amounts to very little; and diplomacy, unbacked by the credible threat of force, is a vapid thing, particularly in the Balkans, where borders were always drawn in blood.
To see Carl Bildt, a former Swedish Prime Minister who this year became the European Union's envoy to Bosnia, beside Richard C. Holbrooke, America's chief Balkan mediator, was to perceive the gulf between good intentions and power.
Mr. Bildt, a lonely figure, paced the streets of Sarajevo with his briefcase and complained that he needed "a phone card" to contact a West Eurpean capital. Mr. Holbrooke was flanked by generals, whose titles he would readily exalt to impress his Balkan interlocutors, and supported by all the high-tech paraphernalia of American intelligence and military might.
Moreover, as ever, the Europeans were divided. European Union remains an oxymoron.
Old alliances, forgotten through the postwar years of peace, resurfaced with the arrival of war on the continent. Germany tended to side strongly with Croatia and Bosnia's Muslims -- a sympathy evident in Bonn's extraordinary unilateral decision to recognize Croatian independence in December 1991 -- whereas France and Britain were moved by old ties to Serbia, their ally and friend through two world wars.
"As long as I'm alive, France will never make war on Serbia," Francois Mitterrand said while he was President of France. He liked to recall how Frenchmen fought shoulder to shoulder with the Serbs during World War I. Such bonds made repeated Serb atrocities hard to perceive because there was a psychological block to believing them.
The old Europe was also very much alive in the Balkans. The barracks of the Bosnian Serbs are still adorned with posters warning of the dangers of "Deutschmocracy" and bearing images of the swastika. In Zagreb, by contrast, "Danke Deutschland" -- "Thank You Germany" -- became a second national anthem after Germany bulldozed the rest of the European Union into recognition of Croatia.
Such extreme sentiments made it almost impossible for Germany, by far the most powerful West European state, to act forcefully in the Balkans. Its presence was too sensitive. Indeed the necessity, and thus the strength, of the German-American alliance, rooted in Germany's commitment to NATO as the anchor for its defense and vehicle for any military projection, has been one of the enduring lessons of the latest Balkan wars. More than any other two nations, Germany and the United States have seen eye-to-eye on the conflict; this in turn has tended to limit Europe's diplomatic potential and make Washington's involvement inevitable.
The wars of Yugoslavia's destruction have also shown the allure of the many-faceted American dream. In states emerging from Communism, American merchandise and might still have a beacon-like power. America is a vivid idea, Europe a vague notion or a troubled memory.
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, who once worked as a banker in New York, was seduced by America's glamor and financial power. Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, cleaved to the United States as the bulwark of the tolerant values being flouted by "ethnic cleansing." Croatia's Franjo Tudjman saw that America could be the source of the military assistance and diplomatic support he needed to take on the Serbs. All of them craved acceptance by Washington; all of them held "Europe" in mild derision.
This was the backdrop to the Clinton Admininistration's very belated, but ultimately decisive, intervention in the Bosnian conflict over the last four months. The American success has provoked much carping in Europe, particularly from the French. Mr. Holbrooke has been accused in Paris of claiming as his own a plan devised a year ago by Alain Juppe, now France's Prime Minister. The French representative in Dayton complained of being cold-shouldered. A French senator, alluding to the death of more than 50 French peacekeepers in Bosnia, lambasted America last week for grabbing the "Bosnian treasure from soil soaked in the blood of Frenchmen."
The complaints amount essentially to sour grapes. America succeeded because only America could. That is the harsh lesson of four years of war in the Balkans. America remains a European power -- not just a member of NATO, but its cornerstone; any attempt to disregard that fact amounts to an invitation to disaster.
The Clinton Administration long flirted with that disaster. Its policy, until last summer, was to look the other way while mouthing velleities about the Europeans' resistance to the use of NATO air power. Europeans, with peacekeepers on the ground, had a point when they repeatedly complained of the American desire "to fight to the last European."
 
Misplaced Hope
 The Administration's shifting descriptions of the war betrayed Washington's incoherence. Serbian genocide against Muslims became a "problem from hell" and an intractable feud marked by "atrocities by all three of the major parties" -- by implication, too intractable to do anything about.
Behind all this, there lurked fears, stoked by the Pentagon, of involvement in a Vietnam-like quagmire. But there was also something deeper: the notion that Europeans could take care of themselves now, or at least that they were no longer so dependent on American leadership.
Bosnians paid a terrible price for this belief. Moreover, the NATO alliance almost came unstuck. "It took some time to realize that we are still part of the balance of power in Europe," said Mr. Holbrooke. "We are needed now to counteract tribal nationalism and bring stability in the vast land mass from the eastern German border to the western Russian border, where so many overlapping territorial claims and potential conflicts lurk."
This American realization came too late to save the Muslims of Srebrenica or the Serbs of the Krajina. But, in all likelihood, American troops will now go to Bosnia to police the peace -- symbols of a renewed commitment whose necessity has been painfully learned. Meanwhile, German money for reconstruction will pour into an area where one of the few things shared and respected across the battle lines throughout a long war has been the Deutschmark.
This shared undertaking is indicative of the main forces at work in post-Communist Europe. Far from receding, American military and political leadership has become more necessary. Its natural complement is German economic might. Beside these realities, talk of building the European Union into a political and military power as well as a trading bloc seems largely illusory.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Capitalist Democracy Marx Could Recognize

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
ON Halloween, a holiday not usually celebrated in Russia, Gennady Burbulis, a centrist member of Parliament who was once a close adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin, was host to an open-bar reception in Parliament that got a little raucous by last call. One guest, a candidate in the elections to be held next month, refused to obey a security guard's order to leave and was thrown through a glass door, leaving a trail of blood and shards all over the carpet and couches.
Democracy is rarely a pretty sight, but there is something distinctive about the conduct of Russia's elected -- and un-elected -- representatives. At times, Russia's legislature looks a little like a cross between the Board of Aldermen under Boss Tweed and a gunslingers' saloon in the old West. There are 5,000 candidates competing for the 450 seats at stake in the December elections, and so far in the campaign, there is little to suggest that the new legislature will be any more dignified than the old. 
 But perhaps one of the reasons that deputies and their aides behave themselves so wantonly is that this is how they were taught in Soviet schools to view American-style democracy.
 
Gangster Chic
 Just as today's Russian mobsters consciously mimic the clothing and swagger of American gangsters in 1930's movies, officials in the legislative branch of power seem to be acting out the most primitive caricatures of capitalist corruption and decadence dreamed up by Communist party propaganda.
So do many officials in the executive branch of government. And so do some of the new capitalists.
A section in a Soviet 10th grade textbook, "New History," first published before World War II and reissued with minimal changes until 1985, lays out how a good Communist should envision capitalism. Titled "The Subordination of the State to the Financial Oligarchy," it explains how "the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small group of magnates has made the United States of America into a classic model of corruption and bribe-taking."
There are times when it seems as if the architects of post-Communist privatization are using their old primers as a how-to book. Last week, the Russian giant Uneximbank, an institution said to be favored by the Kremlin -- and particularly Mr. Yeltsin's security chief, closest adviser and drinking buddy, Aleksandr Karzhakov -- won an auction to buy 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel.
Uneximbank had been given the task of organizing the auction, and won it even though it bid only half as much as a competing company. In fact, its bid of $170.1 million was only $100,000 above the minimum price.
All newly privatized companies are equal in the new Russia, but when it comes to tax breaks, some are more equal than others. The natural gas company, Gazprom, which still sometimes behaves like the Government ministry it once was, is deeply beholden to its former boss, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomydin, who defends its interests with proprietary concern. Despite drumbeat pressure on the Government from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to increase its revenues, Western economists estimate that Gazprom pays only half the taxes it should.
 
A Role Model
 America, or the Marxist-Leninist interpretation of it, remains Russia's model. "Unfortunately, our democracy is now at a stage that America experienced at the end of the 19th century," said Boris G. Fyodorov, a former Minister of Finance who is the leader of the liberal "Forward Russia" party in Parliament. "Too many people are for sale, votes are sold, and people are using their positions for personal gain."
The Soviet textbook made this observation: "Theft, speculation and wild outbursts deeply penetrate American political life." What, then, happens here?
In the lower house of Parliament, members debate, of course, and pass legislation. But deputies and their aides also engage in fistfights on the chamber floor. There are drunken brawls in the cafeterias, all-night minibar parties, and the Speaker of Parliament recently had to plead with deputies to check their weapons at the security desk. The ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, never one to fear cartoonish behavior, outdid himself recently by punching a female legislator who tried to break up a brawl on the chamber floor. He also grabbed her by the throat and pulled her hair.
Under Russian law, members of Parliament have immunity from prosecution, which has encouraged shady businessmen and outright thugs to run for office -- not to make laws, but to escape them. Of the many businessmen running, some have clearly bought their places on the lists. (Vladimir Pribylovsky, a candidate of the Beer Lovers Party, admitted cheerfully that his party had sold three spots to rich businessmen as a way of raising campaign funds. Experts say the practice is quite common, though difficult to prove.)
Police officials say that out of 5,000 candidates running this season, about 100 have some kind of criminal record. In fact, many of these are former dissidents, or people convicted under Communist-era laws against homosexuality, business, free travel or distribution of bibles. And in what may be a sign of progress, Parliament recently voted to expel Sergei Mavrodi, the mastermind of the infamous MMM pyramid scandal who was charged with tax evasion and fraud and had been immune from prosecution.
Still, even legislators known for their seriousness defend their less inhibited colleagues. "Don't they drink in the United States Congress?" said Sergei N. Yushenkov, a member of the party Democratic Choice of Russia and Chairman of Parliament's Defense Committee. He suggested the problem was a few bad apples, and that some Russians are just not used to freedom.
And there is an argument that drinking on the job helps diffuse tension. Unlike the United States Congress, the Russian legislature -- with even Mr. Zhirinovsky's help -- was able to pass the President's draft budget for 1996 without closing museums and shutting down government agencies.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Once a Communist, Always a Pol

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LECH WALESA'S defeat in the Polish presidential election at the hands of a telegenic "former Communist" raises in the starkest terms yet the question of what, if anything, that label really means.
Former Communists have taken power in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Russia, and had prevailed in Poland's 1993 Parliamentary elections. But the fall of Mr. Walesa, the man most associated with Communism's demise, had special poignancy for many who had struggled against The Party. 
 It is not that anyone expects the new President, Aleksander Kwasniewski, to restore censorship, a state-run economy or a single-party political system. And few doubt that Mr. Kwasniewski, who won by a narrow margin, will continue Poland's drive to join NATO and the European Union.
But the victory of Mr. Kwasniewski, and others of similar biography in central Europe, marks the return to power of an elite.
By the 1980's, people like the 41-year- old Mr. Kwasniewski joined the party because it was a prerequisite to the career they had chosen. The slogans of Lenin and Marx were easily shed later; Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian Communist, could become Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian nationalist.
"The party was the trade union of people in power," said Aleksander Smolar, a Solidarity activist who was chief of staff to Poland's first non-Communist Prime Minister. "They were very pragmatic, these professionals of power. And this is where we can see the continuity now. It's what you call old boys' networks."
The term "former Communist" is thus more personal than political. The simple dichotomy of the 1980's -- dissidents vs. the old regime -- no longer applies. Now, former Communists end up on all sides of the defining issues, which are nationalism and the pace of economic reform.
In Hungary, they are an essential element in a governing coalition that, after some hesitation, has plunged ahead with economic reforms. Bulgaria and Romania's former Communists are less enthusiastic about the rigors of the market. In Slovakia, the opposition to a Vladimir Meciar, the Communist turned nationalist, includes a party composed largely of former Communists. In Russia, former Communists like Boris Yeltsin are seen as bulwarks against both unreconstructed apparatchiks and the fascist, ultra-nationalist right wing.
"What matters for American interests is whether the people elected will continue the reforms or not," said one American official. "Kwasniewski has said all the right things. He should be judged on what he does."
Shortly after Mr. Kwasniewski's election, another President who had won with much less than a landslide called with some advice. "The door is open for you, but you've got to walk through it, and that means you've got to broaden your base," Bill Clinton said, according to an American official.
Mr. Kwasniewski alluded to how much had changed since 1989, when he was Minister of Youth Sports. "We made the right decision in 1989," he told Mr. Clinton. "And now, our priorities are NATO and the European Union."

HEADLINE: A Onetime Rebel Is Handed a Cause As Likely Successor to Billy Graham

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
For years, a lively conversation could be provoked in some Protestant circles with a question about one man's mortality: After Billy Graham, who?
Anyone who asked knew that the 20th century's most famous evangelist was still preaching well past retirement age. But sooner or later he would have to surrender the stage. 
 On Nov. 7, his 77th birthday, Mr. Graham finally moved to quell the speculation. His organization, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, named his eldest son, Franklin, to the new post of first vice chairman, designating him as his father's successor should the evangelist choose to step down as chairman and chief executive.
The decision promises continuity for an organization that took in more than $88 million last year, money it used for publishing, broadcasting and staging "crusades," the mass evangelistic rallies that are Mr. Graham's trademark. Franklin Graham, 43, a member of the association's board since 1979, said in a telephone interview from Boston, where he had a speaking engagement, that he "would make very little to no change" in the organization. "I want to focus on evangelism," he added. "That's what this organization does."
Still, the elevation of the younger Mr. Graham -- who favors jeans and cowboy boots and likes to relax by taking spins on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle -- is emblematic of a broad but gradual change under way among the nation's 40 million evangelical Protestants.
A new generation of leaders is on the rise, a group whose public appeal is often marked by a deliberately informal personal style and an inclination to innovate to win new audiences for an old message.
Evangelicals, said Mark Noll, a professor of history at Wheaton College, gained a heightened level of cultural influence in American life on the shoulders of leaders who reached adulthood in the 1940's, Billy Graham foremost among them. "Right now, that generation is just about passing," he said.
Photographs of Billy Graham from that period show a strikingly self-confidant preacher, a man given to dramatic, declaratory gestures, holding his Bible aloft and jabbing an index finger at his audience. Mr. Graham knew his calling early on, becoming a full-time evangelist within five years of his graduation from Florida Bible Institute in 1940. He tasted secular recognition in 1949, courtesy of highly favorable coverage in William Randolph Hearst's newspapers.
In those days, as now, he wore well-tailored suits and soon was mixing easily with Presidents, none of which hurt him with his middle-class contemporaries, a generation that valued hard work, liked a good appearance and respected political institutions.
Franklin Graham, by contrast, has built a reputation as a reformed rebel. He tells interviewers about an adolescence marked by smoking, drinking and disdain for school, a period of personal turbulence ended when he became a born-again Christian at age 22. Some academic observers say his story could resonate well with a generation that grew up in the post-1950's era, with social upheaval, political crises and economic uncertainty.
Through a spokesman, Billy Graham declined a request for an interview. "It's a contingency plan for corporate succession," said the spokesman, Larry Ross. He added that Billy Graham has no plans to retire, because "nowhere in the Bible does he see any of God's servants retiring."
Franklin Graham sounded a similar note. "I think Daddy at his age still wants to continue to preach, but he realizes that he cannot go on forever and he just wants to make plans for the future." That he would succeed his father administratively was something they had discussed in the past, "but not in any detail," he said.
Franklin Graham's rise within the Billy Graham Association was not a foregone conclusion. Last June, when his father collapsed as a result of a bleeding colon during an appearance in Toronto, officials who were hosts to the event called in a Canadian evangelist, although Mr. Graham had told an aide that he wanted his son to preach in his place.
William Martin, a professor of sociology at Rice University, said the incident may have persuaded Billy Graham to settle the succession question. "As long as this was unsettled, there was a greater chance that parties would form and strengthen themselves," said Dr. Martin, author of "A Prophet With Honor" (William Morrow, 1991), a biography of Billy Graham.
Dr. Martin said he thought Franklin Graham already had significant support among the association's directors, because he was seen as a theological conservative who would keep the organization true to his father's design.
In addition, Dr. Martin said, Franklin Graham helped his own cause in recent years by becoming a part-time evangelist, after long resisting doing so.
For much of his adult life, Franklin Graham has put his energies into Christian charitable work overseas, as president of Samaritan's Purse and World Medical Mission, which deliver medical supplies and personnel to such places as Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. The two organizations have a combined budget of $22 million this year, mostly from contributions, and employ 128 people in Boone, N.C., a small city in the Appalachian Mountains.
Mr. Graham lives there, too, up an unmarked gravel road, in a large, but plain house that he shares with his wife, Jane Austin Graham, and three of their four children. The oldest child, William Franklin Graham 4th, is a junior at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.
Only in recent years, at the urging of one of his father's associates, has Mr. Graham begun to preach publicly like his father. He chose the obscurity of Juneau, Alaska, for his debut in 1989. Currently, he preaches, without pay, at events sponsored by the Billy Graham Association.
"I know when to wear a coat and tie," he said. But he added, "I think our country has changed in the last 20 years. We are a lot more informal as a nation. I want to fit the audience I'm speaking to."
Last month, he published his autobiography, titled "Rebel With a Cause: Finally Comfortable Being Graham" (Thomas Nelson), whose cover shows Mr. Graham, sitting on a porch rail, wearing a black leather jacket.
It is a picture, said Leonard I. Sweet, dean of Drew University Theological Seminary, bound to appeal to an under-45 crowd for whom a certain informality can connote integrity. In addition, he said, the image of the onetime rebel may have a special appeal with people in their 20's, who have "been marketed to death," and distrust anything they deem inauthentic.
Franklin Graham "de-converted from Christianity for a while," Dr. Sweet said. In terms of his public appeal, he said, "when he came back in, it was a lot stronger than he ever would have if he had just stayed in it."
Among some prominent evangelicals Mr. Graham's age, however, the image is not entirely unique.
One of his friends, the Rev. Greg Laurie, a Riverside, Calif., pastor, has developed his own mass evangelism events and gained a growing reputation in the process. In an interview last year, sun-burned from a ride on his own motorcycle, Mr. Laurie described a rather aimless adolescence made straight by his becoming born again two decades ago.
In a half-filled stadium later that day, he peppered his theologically conservative message with references to music and movie stars (asides that he said earlier he had carefully culled from "People" magazine and various television shows to find common ground with his listeners).
Others in this younger generation of evangelicals, cognizant of changing popular tastes, have introduced pop rhythyms into religious music to appeal to people raised on rock, and have launched various spiritual support groups to impart a sense of community to middle-class suburbanites anxious for just that.
Thus, praise choruses, sacred lyrics set to rock tunes, can now be heard in any number of congregations, among them Willow Creek Community Church in suburban Chicago, whose worship services, attracting about 14,000 people a week, have brought its pastor, the Rev. Bill Hybels, national recognition.
Praise music, along with gospel and classic hymns, also plays a prominent role in the stadium-filling gatherings of the Promise Keepers, a religious men's movement that combines inspiration and male bonding, begun by Bill McCartney, a former University of Colorado football coach.
But while academic authorities credit people like Mr. Hybels and Mr. McCartney with influence in contemporary American religion, they nonetheless say that no one now appears likely to achieve the fame and impact of Billy Graham. Not even his son.
In part, that results from far more choices that both religious and secular people have for their leisure time. In the 1950's, Dr. Martin said, "when Billy Graham came to town, it was the biggest thing that anyone could imagine."
But these days, he said, the very people at the core of Mr. Graham's constituency have many religious alternatives to mass evangelism events. They can go to megachurches like Willow Creek; the men can attend a Promise Keepers rally; parents can tune into James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio programs, which blend religion and child psychology, and the politically inclined can join the Christian Coalition, Pat Robertson's conservative organization.
"It's important to remember that Billy Graham is not an office that must be filled when someone leaves it," Dr. Martin said.
Franklin Graham said he knows that. Once he succeeds his father as the Billy Graham Association's chairman and chief executive, he said, he will run the preaching events as a team effort, bringing in men his age to share the work.
"I am not Billy Graham," he said. "I cannot step into his shoes. No one could do it. But can we continue preaching the Gospel? Sure, we can. Can we keep preaching crusades? Sure, we can. People will keep coming to hear."

HEADLINE: Unions Try To Deter The Flight Of Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Seeking to slow the exodus of factory jobs, top union officials in the Northeast are urging their states to join forces to punish corporations that move operations to low-wage states and countries.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. presidents of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and eight other states are pushing for laws that would forbid states to sign contracts with such companies and prohibit public-employee pension funds from investing in them. 
 Denis Hughes, assistant to the president of the union in New York, said, "The idea is to help the economy of this region prosper by using the states' resources."
Business leaders and some state officials said they doubted the proposal would get far, with Republicans holding the governorships in 7 of the 11 states.
But the president of the New Jersey labor group, Charles Marciante, who is spearheading the drive, expressed confidence that the legislation could be enacted in many Northeastern states. "These companies are just bailing out of the the Northeast totally and leaving these states in a destitute condition," he said.
At a labor convention last week at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City, Mr. Marciante helped persuade the other presidents to press sympathetic legislators to propose such laws in their states early next year. Frank Montanaro, chairman of the Northeast coalition of labor groups and head of the Rhode Island unit, said, "We're saying that we should impose economic sanctions. It's kind of following the South Africa model of sanctions."
Business groups bitterly oppose the idea, asserting that this threat of sanctions would in fact harm the Northeast's economy by discouraging companies from investing in the region. "Anytime you start talking about imposing sanctions in one region, you're certainly not making a friendly, hospitable climate for business," said Daniel B. Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, a coalition representing 6,000 companies.
Donald Scarry, an economic adviser to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, said the proposal "will send out an announcement of negativity to the businesses when no one needs it."
But the labor leaders maintained that companies would continue to be attracted to the region because it has so much skilled labor.
Under their proposal, each of the 11 Northeast states would set up its own Industrial Retention Commission to investigate any company that announced plans to close a factory or lay off a large number of workers. If a commission concluded that such a company was motivated by a desire to pay lower wages or benefits, then the state -- and all other Northeastern states that had passed the legislation -- would impose the sanctions.
If companies were transferring operations to states promising lower taxes or more state benefits, that might also be used as grounds for sanctions, labor officials said.
But if the commission found that a plant was closing for what the union leaders called legitimate reasons, such as declining orders, the company would not face sanctions.
"Certainly companies have a right to go wherever they please," Mr. Marciante said. "We're just saying, you also have the right to deny them the state's largess."

HEADLINE: Job Discrimination in Europe: Affirmative Laissez Faire

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
As a Nigerian-born chef working in Britain, Richard Olufeko has encountered plenty of workplace discrimination, including being demoted and then dismissed two years ago from a London restaurant in what a Government equal-opportunity board later ruled was an act of blatant racism.
But when it comes to redressing discrimination, Mr. Olufeko is wary of American-style affirmative action plans, where jobs can be seen to go to people because of their race or sex. Although he has some reservations, he broadly supports Britain's system, which outlaws employment discrimination generally, but bars the use of quotas or any preference programs to help end bias in hiring and promotion. 
 "It's important to have a certain number of black people in a workplace to provide representation and encouragement," Mr. Olufeko said. "But we have to be careful here. When you try to force people to do something, it often backfires."
Affirmative action is not yet as hotly debated in Europe as it is in the United States. But as their populations become more racially and ethnically diverse, and as women demand greater economic opportunities, many European countries are being forced to deal more directly with employment discrimination.
And while they are still grappling with how to address the issue, there is a growing consensus among governments, employers, unions and groups representing minorities and women that the American model of aggressive affirmative action creates more problems than it solves.
The European approach, which has generally involved governments' financing training programs, encouraging employers to step up recruitment and taking legal action in discrimination cases, has yielded some successes. The successes have come mostly in increasing the proportion of women hired by national and local governments. But progress in changing employment patterns in corporate Europe has been much slower, and little effort has been directed at increasing minority opportunities in either the public or private sector.
"The mentality is such that if you want to make progress toward equality you have to adopt means that are acceptable to people," said Catherine Comtet-Simpson, a lawyer with the International Labor Organization in Geneva. "If you engage in discrimination to find remedies to discrimination, it would not be accepted. In the U.S it was accepted, and perhaps it went too far."
People who study employment discrimination say that women in Europe are badly underrepresented outside of traditional female jobs like those of cashier, nurse and teacher, and that the underrepresentation is particularly acute in the upper ranks of big corporations.
Women in Europe are also paid substantially less on the average than men for the same work. The International Labor Organization said the disparity ranges from 20 percent to 50 percent depending on job category and country. In France the average differential is 30 percent, the group said.
About 85 percent of the 53,000 employees of Marks & Spencer, the British retailer, are women, But none of the company's top 17 executives and only two of its 32 divisional directors are women. The company said the proportion of women in its senior executive ranks is increasing.
In Britain, men and women from racial and ethnic minorities are twice as likely as white people to be unemployed, although officials said job discrimination is just one reason for the disparity. In London, where members of minority groups constitute roughly 20 percent of the population, the Metropolitan Police force is 97.3 percent white, although the department said applications from nonwhites are increasing as it steps up recruitment efforts.
Even where Europe does have programs that give preference to women and minorities, they are coming under intense legal scrutiny.
In October the European Court of Justice, which applies the legal directives adopted by the European Union to cases in the member nations, struck down a program in the German city of Bremen that required municipal agencies to give preference to women over men in job categories where women were underrepresented, assuming the women had at least equal qualifications.
The court held that the program violated a 1976 European Union directive that requires equal treatment for men and women in employment, even though the directive provided for exceptions in cases where a measure was intended to remove existing inequalities.
In its ruling, the court said, "Rules which guarantee women absolute and unconditional priority for appointment or promotion go beyond promoting equal opportunities and overstep the limits of the exception."
Lawyers and government officials said it was still unclear how broad a precedent the ruling set.
But people who study employment discrimination in Europe said the ruling fits into what has become the predominant approach to the issue.
European labor experts said there are many differences between discrimination problems in Europe and those in the United States. For one thing, affirmative action programs in the United States were developed largely in response to longstanding patterns of discrimination against a large black population. In European nations other than Britain, the issue has so far been framed primarily in terms of sex, in part because minority populations are relatively small.
Most European countries have outlawed employment discrimination on the basis of sex, but only Britain has a statute extending equal opportunity to race. Even in Britain, however, employers are not required to monitor the racial composition of their work forces, and few do. Most employers believe that asking job applicants or employees their race could be construed as discriminatory.
For the most part, efforts in Europe to bring equal opportunity to private industry center on providing education and training programs to women and minorities to help them compete for jobs. In many countries, government has taken more of an advocacy role when it comes to filling jobs in the public sector, often through programs intended to recruit more women.
In the Netherlands, Ms. Comtet-Simpson said, a Government program raised the number of women in certain categories of civil service positions to more than 25 percent in 1994, from about 1.3 percent in 1990, although there was little change in the higher-ranking positions.
The European systems generally allow a job-seeker to bring legal action against employers when he or she feels that a job or promotion has been denied because of discrimination. In the last several years the penalties that can be levied on employers who are found to have discriminated have been increased, giving the laws some financial bite for the first time.
In Germany, a 1980 anti-discrimination law limited financial compensation so strictly that it became known as the stamp law, because the biggest awards available to women barely covered the cost of mailing the necessary documents.
The legislation was changed in 1985 to allow maximum compensation of one month's pay. Last year the limit was increased to three months' pay, said Peter Hanau, director of the Research Institute for Social Law at the University of Cologne.
Even with the increased compensation, relatively few women take legal action because it is so hard to prove discrimination, Mr. Hanau said.
Indeed, even while they shy away from quotas, strict monitoring and other features of American affirmative action programs, Europeans involved in the field acknowledge that their less aggressive and less confrontational approach is working much more slowly.
"The evidence indicates slow progress, but it has to be seen in the context of what is happening overall in society," said Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Britain's Commission for Racial Equality.
"While it is painfully slow and allows discrimination to continue, we are able to move race relations in a more productive way than in the States," he said.
Experts said that in the current climate in Western Europe it would be hard to generate additional support for programs to promote the hiring of more women and minorities -- much less to impose job quotas or other preference programs. Unemployment is stubbornly high. And immigration is on the rise in France and Germany, among other countries, bringing growing support for right-wing nationalist political parties.

PLEASANT SURPRISE
 
Exports Whittle the Deficit
Exports spurted ahead in September, cutting the trade deficit to the lowest level of the year. The deficit with Japan narrowed for the sixth month in a row, and the one with China, which was getting worrisome, also contracted. The strong exports suggest that third-quarter economic growth will come in well above expectations. If the export trend continues next year, it could drive the economy into its fifth year of expansion. Exports rose by $1 billion in September; a rule of thumb is that $1 billion of exports keeps nearly 20,000 Americans at work.
 
BUDGET SHOWDOWN
 
The Government Reopens
Government workers streamed back to work after a six-day shutdown, but they may stream out again next month. Congress and the White House reopened the Government by patching up their differences and agreeing on spending only through Dec. 15. But that merely delayed an all-out debate on taxes and spending. Meanwhile, the shutdown cost the Government $700 million or more, largely to pay Government workers for lost work, the White House said. Tourists at least were pleased that national landmarks reopened.
 
GAMBLING
 
Casinos Lose, Too
Gambling has exploded into a $482 billion economy, but casinos sometimes find themselves on a bumpy ride. Harrah's Jazz Company, which was seen as something of an economic angel in New Orleans, abruptly suspended construction of what would have been one of the biggest casinos in the world and filed for bankruptcy protection. Far from creating jobs, the company laid off 2,500 casino employees. And Hilton Hotels, which planned to split up its hotel and casino operations into separate companies, waffled about its intentions after its president, who had been a lawyer in Nevada, quit. Barron Hilton, the chairman of the company, was quoted as saying that in thinking about a spinoff, he had "an open mind" and saw several "pros and cons."
 
EASTERN EUROPE
 
Ex-Communist Ruler in Poland
Poland is getting a new president, an ex-Communist, but economic policy is not likely to veer much. Aleksander Kwasniewski, a Communist-turned-social democrat, won the election over Lech Walesa, gathering 52 percent of the vote. That would have disturbed investors once, but a former Communist has served as Prime Minister, and the economy is headed for its fourth year of robust growth. Foreign investment is flowing in unabated. Mr. Kwasniewski promises to continue market-oriented policies.
 
CHRYSLER'S DRAMATICS
 
An Opening for Kerkorian
The friction continues at Chrysler, at which Kirk Kerkorian appears to be in a good position to put an ally on the board. An opportunity opened up when Joseph E. Antonini, the former head of Kmart, quit the auto maker's board, saying he was influenced by the controversy between Mr. Kerkorian, Chrysler's second-largest shareholder and leading critic, and the board. The resignation sent up Chrysler's stock.
 
AIRCRAFT
 
Down Time at Boeing
Striking workers at Boeing dug in their heels and voted to continue their walkout, now in its eighth week. They decisively rejected a contract offer that union leadership had unanimously recommended. The longer the strike goes on in the fourth quarter, the worse Boeing earnings will be hit. So analysts are busy cutting earnings estimates, and even preparing for a loss. But the strike only delays production, so Boeing should make up the ground later. When the 32,000 striking workers do return, there will be plenty of work to do. Earlier this month, Boeing got $12.7 billion in orders for 77 planes from Singapore Airlines.
 
MULTIMEDIA
 
From the Desk of Bill Gates
Another month, another media blitz for Bill Gates. This time it's for his book, "The Road Ahead," which comes complete with a CD-ROM. Viking is spending $1 million to promote the book, its lead title this fall. "We don't take anything for granted," says a Microsoft executive who is involved in the project. Mr. Gates received a $2.5 million advance for the book and money from subsidiary rights sales. Proceeds from the sale of the $29.95 book are to be donated to help finance technology in classrooms.
 
MOVIES
 
'Toy Story,' Chapter One
Mr. Potato Head is one of the familiar old faces in Disney's "Toy Story," but otherwise the computer-animated film shows off the best in up-to-the-minute Hollywood technology. The film, which opened this week, also inaugurated what is sure to be a mind-boggling marketing blitz. Disney itself is spending an estimated $20 million on promotion, and enlisted advertiser partners like Frito-Lay and Burger King to spend additional $125 million on their own promotional ploys. That marketing force, plus deliriously favorable reviews, could make "Toy Story" the hit of the holiday season. Burger King alone plans to distribute 35 million figurines and 15 million puppets based on Woody, Buzz and other stars of the show.
 
LAW
 
The Plaintiffs Wins -$89.14
It used to be that class-action suits often would end with plaintiffs winning small awards, and their lawyers walking away with millions of dollars in fees. But homeowners who took out mortgages from the Bank of Boston discovered a new twist. In the case of Dexter J. Kamilewicz, he spotted a $91.33 charge from his escrow account for lawyers, and got $2.19 in back interest. And to boot, he never knew he was part of class action represented by lawyers. Now the matter is back in court, and Congress is noticing. One bill to be introduced would protect plaintiffs, rather than defendants, against the excesses of lawyers.
 
ACADEMIA
 
Move Over, Cliff's Notes
Computers have obviously made a big mark on campus. One of the latest inroads lets students buy ready-made term papers, in the few minutes it takes to thumb through a catalogue, pick up a phone and read off their credit-card and fax numbers. A typical eight-page paper already on file costs about $50, while custom research goes for $200. There is even a CD-ROM available with abstracts of paper for sale. Companies in the budding industry profess that the papers are meant strictly for research, and certainly not for plagiarism. "That's absolutely, positively forbidden," says the head of one term-paper service. One student says the service responds to that well-known "worried feeling, when you'd have a 10-page paper due, and you haven't done anything for it."

HEADLINE: Safer Streets? We'll See

 BODY:
New York City is embarking on a new era of traffic control. Police officers are replacing civilian agents at busy intersections. Helicopters prowl the skies in search of the dreaded gridlock. Soon, the Department of Transportation will unveil a plan to clean up "high-fatality" areas like Columbus Circle and Queens Boulevard. Most of these ideas have been tried before, which does not mean they are not worth revisiting.
The police surrendered the job of directing traffic to civilian agents in the 1970's as an economy move. Now many civilian jobs have been eliminated, also as an economy move, and the police are back. The battle against gridlock has actually been a long guerrilla war, in which the city alternately threatens, punishes and bribes motorists to keep them from blocking intersections between lights. 
 The city has been promising to target "high-fatality areas" since 1899, when a realtor named Henry Bliss became the first person ever to be run over by a horseless carriage. New Yorkers will not be surprised to hear that the car was a cab.
The latest traffic reform initiative will depend on what Transportation Commissioner Elliot Sander calls a "marriage" between his department and the police. The divorce rate in these ventures tends to be astronomical. But Mr. Sander says the two bureaucracies have been cooperating well on everything from improving traffic flow to enforcing anti-dumping regulations.
Critics on the New York City Council claim the new traffic control plan does not pay enough attention to pedestrian misbehavior. The Brooklyn Democrat Noach Dear, head of the Council's transportation committee, is calling for an anti-jaywalk initiative. This is not the first, or even the 20th time that a politician has demanded that officials do something about the local citizenry's tendency to walk wherever they feel like walking.
But after a century of complaints, the city has not yet managed even to make most jaywalking illegal. In New York City, crossing at the corner on a red light is indeed a crime. But crossing in the middle of the block is simply a colorful local custom. Even Mr. Dear does not want the police ticketing every pedestrian-voter who walks on red, no matter how far it might go toward balancing the city budget. He prefers an education campaign.

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING;
No Centennial Hoopla in This Sport

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
A century ago this Thanksgiving Day, the molecules that produced motorsports' amoebic event -- six cars, a race course and a sponsor -- came together along the lake front in Chicago.
The first automobile race in the United States was won by Frank Duryea in a car that he and his brother, Charles, had built. That contest -- 54 miles from Jackson Park to Evanston, Ill., and back again in snow and freezing temperatures -- took more than 10 hours to complete. 
 Pace laps run faster than that nowadays, but even a century ago, racing had its sales-pitch component up to speed. Everyone involved was hawking something. The Duryeas were promoting their horseless carriages; R. H. Macy, which also sold cars back then, entered a German-made Benz and would have won had its driver not hit a trolley and a sleigh. And The Chicago Times-Herald, the race sponsor, wanted to create an event to sell newspapers -- the forerunner of made-for-TV sports.
The National Football League and Major League Baseball are great at throwing birthday parties. Auto racing is not so great at it, which in itself can tell you something about its history.
You probably could have guessed that Americans have been racing automobiles for 100 years or so. It's a sport that didn't need a Dr. Naismith, just two cars -- at which point it was as inevitable as the first traffic accident.
Besides, centennials of this sort too often turn self-important or gassy or both (see Ken Burns, parts I through IX). And in dealing with an activity that has compiled a human casualty count at least into four figures, maybe too much retrospection is not to be encouraged.
No peril of that with auto racing, though, because few running it seem in much of a commemorative mood. The ruling powers celebrated this 100th milestone in their own fashion -- speeding past it like a blown pit stop signal. They were so good at ignoring it, they even passed up a chance to make money off of it.
Leo Levine, whose excellent 1968 tome, "Ford: the Dust and the Glory," currently brings $500 for a first printing, a few years back decided that this centennial thing was a sure-fire marketing missile. So he drew up a logo and went looking for partners to join him in licensing ventures.
Levine is now batting .500 as a for-profit historian. The city of Chicago expressed some interest, he said, and one foreign automaker chipped in a few dollars. But the sanctioning bodies? Levine couldn't get a nibble.
While other sports have de facto caretakers for their history and tradition -- football has the N.F.L. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association; golf, the United States Golf Association -- auto racing has always been so loosely confederated that none of its several sanctioning bodies (most of which came into being after World War II) can claim the role. Not that any of them seem eager to claim it, of course.
The group that comes closest is Nascar, one of the most successful sanctioning organization in the United States. But racing's version of George Halas, Bill France Sr., did not arrive until the late 1940's. France, in forming Nascar, brought order to the chaos of stock car racing, where previously all you needed to collect the winner's share of a race promoter's purse was a faster car and a small firearm.
From organizing the races along the sands of Daytona Beach, Fla., France's group has grown into an empire that reaches all the way down to dozens of local short-track racing programs. Now, it turns out they are too busy to celebrate.
"With all the racing series we're running nowadays, there really isn't a lot of time left over to set up something like that," Kevin Triplett, a Nascar spokesman, said apologetically when asked why Nascar failed to note the centennial.
Nascar's newest creation, the SuperTrucks, symbolize another factor tending to blur racing's view of its past. No other sport save yachting is so sharply defined by technology, and the wheel (competitively speaking) must be constantly reinvented for reasons relating to safety, economics and popularity.
The SuperTrucks drew sellout crowds almost everywhere this year in their inaugural season, and CBS has already doubled the number of truck races it will televise next year, from two to four. The SuperTruck, Nascar's child prodigy, is the offspring of demographics (more and more Americans own utility vehicles) and television (truck events rarely exceed 90 minutes, and are split by that old racing tradition, a "halftime").
But as soon as they become too expensive or not popular enough, the SuperTrucks will be put into the crusher and recast. In just 100 years, economic Darwinism has seen Duryea's carriage evolve into dozens of subspecies -- dragsters, monster trucks, off-road racers, midgets, sprinters, Indy racers -- while dozens more have become extinct.
It has kept the sport thriving, but it also dulls one's sense of history when the equipment and the playing fields keep changing.
Only CART, literally the adolescent among major sanctioning groups in the United States, bothered to come up with a centennial logo and dedicate a page in its press guide to The Chicago Times-Herald race.
Speaking of that newspaper, that's probably why this centennial thing never got out of the garage: no sponsor. A real symbolic one would do. How about calling the first century the Hooters 100?

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: 570 Lexington Avenue;
The Aura Is of Another Era -- But So Is the Space

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT is said so often, it is practically a mantra: There are not enough large blocks of contiguous space available in good midtown buildings. It is why some developers are ready to put up new buildings, why landlords are tightening up on concession packages, why would-be subletters are ratcheting up rents on big chunks of excess space.
But landlords with a plethora of small spaces are in no such catbird seat. According to ReLocate, which tracks vacancies, there are 488 spaces of 5,000 to 20,000 square feet available in Class A buildings between 50th and 59th Street alone. Add in available sublets, and there are 604 spaces looking for tenants. 
 On the surface, that should spell glum news for 570 Lexington Avenue, that 50-story landmarked bastion of tiny spaces that has just come back on the market. Although the 51st Street building served for decades as headquarters of the mammoth General Electric Company, by today's standards its small floors -- about 17,000 square feet in the base and 3,000 square feet in the tower -- are unlikely to lure any major corporation.
"Our floor plates are below even the bare minumum for a big company," said David R. Greenbaum, president of the Mendik Company, the building's managing partner.
And yet, Mr. Greenbaum and his colleagues exude optimism. Mendik and Quantum Realty Partners, which together own half of the building (Columbia University owns the other half), are pumping $40 million into renovating and marketing it. And they have been spurning drugstores, apparel stores and other would-be tenants for the building's retail space, in hopes of landing, say, a white-tablecloth restaurant.
"We could have rented the retail space six times over, but we are holding out for the right use," said Mr. Greenbaum. And what, exactly, would that use be? "An elegant store that would fit in with the types of office tenants that don't want to be in a plain vanilla, glass curtain-wall building." And what are the chances of snagging such tenants? "We expect to be fully leased in less than 15 months."
The jazzy Art Deco building does have many things going for it. It has visiblity -- indeed, the Landmarks Preservation Commission once called it "one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era." It is right by the 51st Street subway station and a few blocks from what will soon be the northern entrance to Grand Central Terminal.
ITS tight security system, based on magnetic-stripe cards that allow only authorized people to use the elevators, is a plus, as are the individual air-conditioning controls on each floor. And, Mendik is asking annual rents in the $30's-per-square-foot for the lower floors, and in the mid-$40's for the towers -- rents that, many brokers say, are barely market rate for the area.
Still, the building has formidable drawbacks. It is ridden with columns, and its floor-to-ceiling heights could never support the dropped ceilings or raised floors that high-technology users need. And, convenient as it may be, Lexington Avenue and 51st Street is simply not as prestigious an address as, say, 712 Fifth Avenue, at 56th Street, or Carnegie Hall Tower, at 152 West 57th Street, both known for small spaces and high-profile tenants.
"The street is a problem," said Robert L. Billingsley, an executive vice president of the Colliers ABR brokerage. "It is noisy, it is congested, and it simply does not have the cachet of Park or Fifth."
Apparently, some tenants do not care. Mr. Greenbaum says he has nine deals, covering about a quarter of the building's 435,000 square feet, ready for signing. The first tenant, the law firm of Seiden, Stempel & Bennett, will move into about 6,000 square feet on the 14th floor in December.
"The ownership is stable, the building is convenient to the courts, our view is great, and we're not stuck with all that windowless interior space that you get on a big floor," said Jay Gordon Seiden, a partner.
The building also may have timing on its side. The recovering economy has meant more new small companies, more big companies looking to open small branches in midtown, and more law and accounting firms looking for elegant homes.
"This building is hitting a seam in the market," said Peter R. Friedman, who heads his own brokerage. "Once it gains momentum, it will easily fill up."
Indeed, Mendik is hoping that, if just a few prestige tenants sign on, the deluge will come. For now, its marketing program stresses the appeal of occupying an entire floor in a restored landmark, and of tower floors where elevators open directly into the space, much as in an elegant penthouse.
But once the leasing ball starts rolling, Mendik plans to rely heavily on ads that simply superimpose the names of new tenants on a silhouette of the building. The expectation is that those tenants will have even more drawing power than the building.
Brokers say the approach could work. "People with big egos, who don't want to be a tiny tenant on someone else's large floor, and people who want views, they're going to love this building," said Jeffrey A. Lichtenberg, executive managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company.
IT seems a rosy prospect for a building that, but two years ago, seemed to have a quite different destiny. Built in the early 30's as a headquarters for the Radio Corporation of America, the building quickly became the main New York home for G.E., one of RCA's owners. But in 1974 G.E. moved its headquarters to Fairfield, Conn., and the building began emptying out.
G.E. did not abandon the building. In the mid-80's it spent $20 million to restore the building's lavish marble and metal fixtures and orange-brick facade. And in 1985 the building, with its signature crown of lacy radio-wave figures, got landmark status.
Still, G.E. continued to move its people out. By the 90's, two-thirds of the building was vacant. So in 1993, preferring a tax deduction to the deed on empty space, G.E. donated the building, then valued at $40 million, to Columbia University.
At first, Columbia, whose Morningside Heights campus was reaching saturation, talked about holding classes, seminars and cultural programs in the building. It even talked of turning part of it into a Columbia Club, complete with overnight rooms, squash courts and dining facilities.
Instead, scarcely a year after taking title, Columbia negotiated a deal with the Mendik/Quantum partnership to renovate and market the building. Columbia executives remain mum about their reasons, but Mr. Greenbaum theorizes that they were responding to the nascent economic recovery.
"They decided this was an asset whose potential should be maximized," he said.
Mendik and Quantum, which is operated by the financier George Soros, are similarly mum about the division of duties and equity involvement. But it is clear that Quantum has supplied most of the capital, Mendik is providing the sweat equity and Columbia, which retains 50 percent of the building, remains a passive investor.
The partnership has done some mid-course strategic corrections of its own. For a time, it talked of turning the tower floors into condominiums, and building an entrance on 51st Street for the residential tenants. It scotched that plan because "the upfront investment seemed too steep," said Bernard H. Mendik, Mendik's chairman.
So the partnership is spending its money on restoring the building to its former gleam. It has stripped away metallic paint and dropped ceilings, thus uncovering original aluminum fixtures and a vaulted ceiling vestibule. It has commissioned look-alike floor tiles and marble pieces to replace old ones that had worn down or cracked, and it is buffing up the metal G.E. clock on the 51st Street corner wall.
It has even added a few things that the original architects, Cross & Cross, had designed but that were never installed. "The chandeliers in the lobby, the metal grillwork in the back wall, it's all new, but it follows the first building plans," said Mr. Mendik. "In the height of the Depression, people just ran out of money, I guess."
And, of course, there are some added fillips as well. There are sconces on the facade now, and back lighting behind old fixtures in the elevator cabs. An old reception area south of the Lexington Avenue entrance is now a 2,300-square-foot store looking for a tenant. Mendik even redesigned the subway entrance on the corner.
THE partnership is in a good position to pay for all the work. The building is debt-free, and both Mendik and Quantum are in sound fiscal health. And G.E. continues to pay rent on about 40 percent of the building's space through the end of 1996.
Now all that remains is getting a good buzz circulating about the building. On Oct. 17 the partnership held a cocktail party in the lobby. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jennifer Rabb, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, came, and so did several hundred brokers.
"For the last 20 years, unless you were doing business with G.E., you had no reason to ever visit this building," Mr. Greenbaum said. "Now we're ready to reintroduce it to the community."

 BODY:
IN THE WORLD OF WEAVERS, Lenore Tawney is almost legendary. During the 1950's and 60's, she invented techniques that transformed the craft and made weavings that looked like airy sculptures. Then four years ago, at the age of 84, Mrs. Tawney developed serious vision problems. She also made a discovery: a cache of her best early work, which had been missing for 15 years, had turned up in a friend's attic in New Jersey.
That work, appropriately called the Attic Collection, is one reason for the renewed interest in her work. In fact, she is busier now than ever with her own exhibitions. Two solo shows opened this year in Pittsburgh and in Chicago. Five others, from Honolulu to Amsterdam, are planned for the next 18 months. 
 "I've always liked to travel," said Mrs. Tawney, who plans to attend all the openings.
For the moment, it's the show at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, which opens in May, that's consuming most of her attention. It will exhibit for the first time most of the 48 pieces in the Attic Collection. "I've been working intensely to finish the knots and braids and other details on these works so they can now be exhibited," she said.
These pieces were misplaced in 1976, after she was evicted from her studio in lower Manhattan and sent them to be stored at the Quakertown, N.J., home of the ceramist Toshiko Takaezu. They were found only in 1991, in Ms. Takaezu's attic.
The collection covers Mrs. Tawney's entire career at the loom, from 1955 to 1976, and includes pieces that demonstrate how she used the techniques she invented, called the open warp and the open reed, to change the texture and shape of weaving in the 1950's and 1960's. There are also examples of her Surrealist collages and constructions in boxes from the 60's and 70's.
Mrs. Tawney is probably the only one who knows exactly which works are going where, and she is supervising the packing and shipping of everything. Greeting a visitor to her all-white studio in the Chelsea section of Manhattan recently, she was dressed all in white -- shirt, pants and a beret, which covered most of her reddish hair. She exudes energy and seems taller than her five feet and decades younger than her years. Only occasionally is it apparent that she sees dimly now.
Her most familiar pieces are gossamer in texture, as delicate as a spider web. In the 1950's, however, her weaving was anything but fragile: the colors were often gaudy and the textures robust as she experimented with color and fibers. By 1961, in her first solo show, at the Staten Island Museum, the colors were neutral -- black, white, straw -- and the new elongated pieces were as airy as fish nets.
"It was the beginning of the art fiber movement," said Jack Lenor Larsen, a New York textile producer. One of Mrs. Tawney's finest works from this period is "Dark River," a subtly curved, narrow weaving of parallel vertical threads. In it, she transformed an abstract image into that of a figure of a cloaked woman, crowned with a wig of braids. At 14 feet, the weaving is so tall that its owner, the Museum of Modern Art, has never exhibited it.
 THE ATTIC COLLECTION CONTAINS A similar work, "Murmuring River," which is only nine feet tall. Among the other pieces is a 1974 weaving depicting an American flag in reverse as a protest to the Watergate scandal.
Leonora Agnes Gallagher, one of five children born and raised on the shores of Lake Erie and the Black River in Lorain, Ohio, knew her own mind from early childhood. Asked recently when she changed her first name, she said: "About the first grade. Why? Too many letters."
At 20 she left home for Chicago, where she became a proofreader for a legal publisher and took courses at night at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1941, she married George Tawney, a psychologist, who became ill and died 18 months later.
She moved to New York in 1957 and continued weaving until she was evicted from her studio. She then went to India and spent six months at an ashram. While there, she received a commission from the General Services Administration for a work for the Federal Building in Santa Rosa, Calif.
Rather than a weaving, she created a blue fiber work of 2,500 threads, each of which was tied to a canvas canopy near the ceiling. The 16-foot linen strands are knotted at the end to drop like threads of rain over the enormous lobby. " 'Cloud' took me right off the loom," Mrs. Tawney said, "and there I was hanging from the ceiling."
While her work has taken many forms, thread remains at its core. "Every one of my boxes is full of thread, and there is thread in my collages too," she said. "We wear fiber and are closer to fiber than almost anything else. It's our diapers -- and our shrouds."
 Personal and literary explorations of the less visible (and therefore more conjectural) half of life by a gifted critic and acutely intuitive memoirist.

Poetry
THE ANNALS OF CHILE. By Paul Muldoon. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $21.) Easier of access and more emotionally direct than his previous work, these poems are also more arcane and allusive -- especially the long autobiographical sequence "Yarrow," an account of the birth of the poet's imagination.

AUTOPSY ON AN EMPIRE
The American Ambassador's Account of the Collapse of the Soviet Union.
By Jack F. Matlock Jr.
Illustrated. 836 pp. New York:
Random House. $35. 
 IN 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Jack F. Matlock Jr., the former United States Ambassador in Moscow, asked Mikhail S. Gorbachev if he now felt that he had moved too slowly in granting the Soviet republics real autonomy, the implication being that if he had moved faster he might have been able to save the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gorbachev replied: "Jack, I can see you are a professor now, because your question is academic. In some abstract sense, it is probably right that I moved too slowly, but I did not have the luxury of living in the abstract. I lived in a harsh world of political reality. . . . Even as it was, when I began to talk of a federation in early 1990, most of the Central Committee was in opposition. I had to fight them all the way. I simply did not have a free hand and should not be judged as if I had."
Mr. Gorbachev's words should be engraved above the desk of every Westerner who presumes to give advice to other countries. All too often, those of us -- journalists in particular -- who are acutely sensitive to the tight constraints under which our own governments operate assume other leaders can do whatever they please.
This is a mistake that Mr. Matlock is careful not to make. "Autopsy on an Empire" is one of the most scrupulously sober, intelligent and fair-minded analyses of the Soviet collapse yet to appear; and coming from a man who from 1987 to 1991 was closer than any other Westerner to the heart of the events he describes, it also has enduring value as a historical document. Mr. Matlock's personal reputation is probably the highest among recent American ambassadors to Moscow, and his book will deservedly enhance it.
On the Bush Administration's Moscow policy, Mr. Matlock echoes criticism made elsewhere, but since his views are those of a Soviet expert and foreign service professional, they have more weight than most. He faults George Bush for excessive caution, a caution stemming less from ideology than from personal character.
Mr. Matlock says, first of all, that Mr. Bush did not respond with sufficient sympathy to Mr. Gorbachev in 1989-91, despite the immense changes he was trying to bring about and the immense difficulties he was facing. And while failing to give any real help to Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush also failed to react in time to the rise of Boris N. Yeltsin and to the demands of the non-Russian republics.
In Mr. Matlock's words, Mr. Bush "was uncomfortable with change. Even when it was for the better, he had difficulty recognizing the improvement at first. He always seemed just a step behind -- not so much that he endangered anything vital but enough to miss opportunities Reagan would probably have seized." However, as Mr. Matlock adds when discussing Mr. Bush's failure immediately to condemn the August 1991 coup: "This time President Bush was lucky. The self-styled emergency committee in Moscow began to disintegrate on the second day of its existence, not because of foreign pressure but because of its own fragility and incompetence."
Actually, it might be said that luck has helped both the Bush and Clinton Administrations in their dealings with Russia. Their policies have often been contradictory, alternately timid and overbold, obsessed with personalities (Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin) and, above all, responsive to short-term American domestic political pressures rather than long-term American interests. Luckily, Russia has been so weak internally and externally that so far there have been no really serious consequences for the West.
Mr. Matlock's principal intention is not to analyze American policy. Instead, he asks a question that must haunt many experts on the Soviet Union: "How could I make sense of my own life, devoted as it was to understanding the Soviet Union, if I could not understand the Soviet collapse?"
His "autopsy" on the Soviet Union is persuasive: "The deceased was a being of vicious habits that his physicians set out to cure. They managed to alleviate the patient's paranoia and curb his aggressive behavior, but the drugs administered undermined his immune system, and he eventually died from the spread of infections that would not be life-threatening to a healthy body. . . . The fact that the patient failed to survive the treatment should be regarded as a consequence of the patient's self-induced morbidity rather than the treatment administered."
Mr. Matlock shows great sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev in his efforts to keep the Soviet Union together. His portrait of the last Soviet leader is psychologically acute, even moving, but Mr. Matlock is also well aware of Mr. Gorbachev's shortcomings: his inability to tolerate strong figures around him; his reliance on the K.G.B., which eventually betrayed him; his longstanding failure to grasp the realities of economic reform.
Mr. Matlock does not believe that anything could have saved the Soviet Union. At best, he suggests, the Kremlin leaders might have preserved some kind of loose federation -- if they had accepted Baltic independence at an early stage, tried harder to maintain an alliance with the Russian democrats and kept a tighter grip on the K.G.B. But such a state would have been inherently unstable and, in my view, could not have long survived in any case.
While he condemns the brutality of the Soviet military intervention in the Baltic states in January 1991, Mr. Matlock wisely avoids the cold war hyperbole of some Western commentators. As he points out, the amount of blood shed in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on Mr. Gorbachev's orders was remarkably slight. (He might have added that it was slight not just by the bloodstained standards of Russian history but also by comparison with the records of some West European democracies in defense of their colonial empires.)
My only real criticisms of Mr. Matlock's views center on his extensive epilogue, which deals with developments in the former Soviet Union since 1991. These are not his main subject, of course, but they are obviously on everyone's mind at the present time. There is every chance that the next Russian Presidential election, scheduled for June, will either lead to a more overtly nationalist presidency or be canceled, ushering in a decrepit Yeltsinite semi-dictatorship -- if Mr. Yeltsin can physically survive that long.
Mr. Matlock accurately portrays the combination of imperial nostalgia and practical weakness in Russia today. Yet he sometimes goes too far in blaming imperial ambition for Moscow's concern about Russians living outside Russia, minimizing legitimate national sentiments and the worries of the Russians in other countries. As the Yugoslav case shows, manipulation from above is effective only if it has genuine fears and hatreds to work on.
Fortunately, such feelings are at present very limited among the main Russian communities outside Russia. But should those feelings intensify, the West will have to address them, not simply dismiss them out of hand. This applies, to take one important example, to the Ukrainian-Russian dispute over the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, which the overwhelming majority of Russians regard not as an imperial outpost in Ukraine but as a Russian city -- San Diego, one might say, rather than Guantanamo Bay.
A connected point concerns Estonian and Latvian legal discrimination against the Russian minorities in those republics. To be sure, there are powerful justifications for the Baltic laws, but their negative impact on relations with Russia cannot be denied, nor should Russia's hostility be attributed simply to imperialism.
Although Mr. Matlock correctly observes that Latvia's legal barrier to most Russians' rapidly obtaining Latvian citizenship has "infuriated many Russian democrats who had defended Latvia's right to seek independence," he may not fully realize the enormous damage this and similar laws have done to those democrats, as well as to Western prestige in Russia. Discreet Western pressure on Estonia and Latvia has, in fact, been very effective in getting them to moderate their laws, but this accomplishment has been completely lost on most Russians. As far as they can see, Western governments have been almost entirely silent about the civic rights of the Baltic Russians, while exerting intense public pressure on Russia to remove its troops from the Baltic states. More than any other question, the Baltic policy of the West has strengthened the Russian impression that the Western powers are hypocrites, using the language of universal values to trick Russia into strategic concessions.
Another issue pushing the Russians in an anti-Western direction is that of NATO expansion to Eastern Europe. Curiously, Mr. Matlock does not mention this in his book, but in May, in a joint letter to Warren Christopher signed by him and a group of other senior former United States officials, Mr. Matlock and his colleagues wrote that "in our view, this policy risks endangering the long-term viability of NATO . . . and convincing most Russians that the United States and the West are attempting to isolate, encircle and subordinate them, rather than integrating them into a new European system of collective security." It is a great pity that in formulating policy in this and other fields, United States administrations do not bend more to the advice of professionals like Mr. Matlock and less to the pressure of a variety of ignorant and partisan domestic lobbies. But then, such criticism is decades old at least, and all the indications are that things are getting worse, not better.

HEADLINE: A Gospel Session Honors Beethoven

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE 

 BODY:
THE Prayer Tabernacle Choir of Bridgeport will perform a swinging gospel rendition of the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" with the Greater Bridgeport Symphony on Saturday at the Klein Memorial Auditorium.
"We love singing it -- we sing it every Christmas. And with an orchestra, oh my, it's just something. The trumpets! It brings a lot of joy," said Bishop Kenneth H. Moales Sr., founder of the Prayer Tabernacle Church of Love and its choirs in the city's East End. "It's a new sound of gospel with the full orchestra live," he continued, "rather than with all the technology of producing gospel artists; very few of them have sung with a live orchestra." 
 How did a gospel choir and a symphony orchestra connect?
The executive director of the orchestra, Jena Maric, said that her organization "realized over the years where we've had concerts with jazz and ragtime, that it was a natural progression to another form of American music."
"I actually heard them perform in the late 1980's with an orchestra; I was very impressed," Ms. Maric continued. "The next time I heard them was with Judy Collins at Fairfield University. They were very effective. The audience loved them. They have a genuine impact."
The Prayer Tabernacle Choir will be featured in the concert's second half, the first half being devoted to the glittering "Scheherazade" by Rimsky-Korsakov.
The Prayer Tabernacle Choir is one of several that have evolved from the original youth choir started by Bishop Moales in 1968 when he founded the church.
"We started out just as a choir of the community for the young people to have something to do Saturday afternoons," he said. "It's been a vehicle for those who did not have an alternative to the streets. Many have learned to play instruments. We also involve the arts, creative arts and dance. We go sing in the prisons. Every Saturday our young people's choir feeds 200 to 300 people. We have approximately 170 young people. We even have a gospel nightclub called High Voltage where we serve non-alcoholic drinks. And we see that everyone gets home."
Bishop Moales's current project is starting a school in the East End. "It's going to be a regular academic Christian school that gives special emphasis to the arts," he said. "We are committed to turning this community around spiritually, socially and even economically." The school -- pre-kindergarten through sixth grade -- is expected to open in the fall of 1998. The Bishop, who is 50 years old and the father of three grown children, was born and raised in Father Panik Village, which he described as being "the highest-crime community in the city at one time."
Bishop Moales's work in Bridgeport has not gone unnoticed. In September he was made a bishop of the Pentecostal Church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. His church in Bridgeport is headquarters for a region overseen by him which encompasses North Carolina, Ohio, New York and Connecticut.
In addition, he was recently elected president of the 60-year-old National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.
The number for tickets and more information about the Greater Bridgeport Symphony Concert is 576-0263.

HEADLINE: After Yonkers Blast, Heartache And Shifting Blame for Evacuees

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
BEHIND the cordoned-off streets, the flashing lights and a steady stream of officialdom were 2,000 personal stories of residents -- many poor and elderly -- who were put out of their homes for 10 days this month in what is believed to be the largest evacuation effort ever in Westchester County.
"We've seen a lot of hardship, a lot of heartache right at the beginning of the holiday season," said Roger Denman, a 20-year resident of Buena Vista Apartments, where an explosion in the electrical service room of the sprawling complex set off a series of power failures, which left residents unhurt but without shelter. 
 "People who can ill afford it have lost so much," Mr. Denman said.
In addition to taking a personal toll, the explosion has raised questions about whether building codes and oversight responsiblities for Government-subsidized structures like this one are strict enough.
Commissioner Vincent J. Masucci of the Yonker Bureau of Housing and Buildings, said that as an engineer he "never would have designed a complex of this size with a power supply only in one room."
"Maybe the Government was trying to save money, but in the long run they did not," the Commissioner said. "I'm just thankful that no one was hurt and there wasn't a more serious spread of fire."
The apartments were constructed in the early 1970's in part with Federal funds. The state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal now oversees the 18-story, 450-unit complex, which is managed by a private firm, Buena Vista Associates, a limited partnership. Since the explosion, questions have arisen over whose responsibility it is to inspect utilities at the site.
The power failure occurred on Nov. 9 after most of the families that live here had settled in for the night. Gladys Smith, 72, a retired nurse's aide, said she was watching television when the lights in the 450 apartments flickered and the complex went dark.
At the time, Mrs. Smith and neighbors like Sharen Branch and her two young children were not aware that the electricity had surged through the building's water mains and melted seals, causing a flood and forcing utility workers to shut off gas, heat and water.
Nor did residents know that it would be a week and a half before they could return to their homes -- and probably at least a month until the gas would be turned on again.
For Mrs. Smith, who immigrated to the United States from Liberia 37 years years ago, the wait to return home would be even longer. In the confusion, she lost her blood-pressure medicine, and visits back to an emergency office set up in a school close to the complex only frustrated and weakened her. In tears a week after the evacuation, she left the emergency office by cab for her son's home, resolved to wait until after Thanksgiving to return.
"There's no heat, no stove even to make myself a cup of tea," she said. "There may be no place like home but not under these conditions."
For Ms. Branch, who did return, the homecoming was not as she expected. The apartment was cold, and she sat in the living room the first morning back dressed in a coat and boots.
She said the turkey dinner she promised her two sons would have to wait because while she was away she used up what little savings she had traveling back and forth from her mother's apartment in the Bronx to Yonkers each morning to put her children on the school bus. Besides, she said, the stove no longer worked.
Meanwhile, Yonkers officials sorted through the explosion's aftermath, shipping the electric switching gear to a private investigative firm to determine the cause of the explosion and whether there had been foul play.
But Commissioner Thomas J. Lorio of the Yonkers Fire Department said his department did not suspect arson. Other tests to determine whether firefighters at the complex had been exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls -- the toxic substances known as PCB's previously used in the manufacture of electrical equipment, which are believed to cause cancer -- came back negative. The main switch gear for the complex, which was grounded to the water pipes, apparently shorted out, sending current 65 feet along the main and into the street.
James Lafferty, a senior housing inspector for the city, reported that except for investigating run-of-the-mill tenant complaints, the city had never inspected the power supply room.
"No local inspections were required, or for that matter allowed," Mr. Lafferty said, explaining that it was the job of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
But a spokesman for the state said that the division only has oversight responsibilities and that inspections were up to the locality.
"The city is looking for a scapegoat, and it's not us," said Harry G. Ryttenberg, the spokesman.
Other city officials and Consolidated Edison said it was up to the private management company to maintain the building.
They explained that public utility and municipal inspections are made only when buildings are constructed.
But Councilwoman Symra D. Brandon said the responsibility for ongoing maintenance should never rest with a private company, especially when state and Federal financing was involved.
"How can a management firm properly oversee itself?" she said. Ms. Brandon represents the First District, which includes Buena Vista Apartments.
Kenneth Davis, property manager for Buena Vista Associates, would not say when the electrical supply room was last inspected. And Devorah Fong, a spokeswoman for the company, could also not confirm when a routine inspection was last made. "In normal daily operations, I suspect," she said.
Richard Tyrrell, Yonkers' chief electrical inspector, said that special infrared scanners, which are usually owned only by electricians, are used to inspect electrical equipment and detect loose wires or what is known as "fatigue" in electrical connections.
But Mr. Tyrrell said that an inspection would not have necessarily prevented the explosion. "A rat could have gotten in there," he said.
It was the second power blackout at the complex in six months, said Denise Payne, a tenants' association leader.
The first one lasted about 12 hours, the second 10 days, she said.
"What if there is a third?" she continued. "And will we survive that one?"
City officials said last week that they were also asking themselves "what if" questions.
"We saw major damage, a catastrophe," said Commissioner Albert R. McEvoy of the Yonkers Police. "We need to plan ahead in case this happens again."
Although city agencies, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army worked together throughout the 10 days to help return people to their homes, the disaster has prompted officials here and in other municipalities to review procedures for such emergencies in the future.
Commissioner McEvoy and other city officials plan to critique the evacuation proceedings and will prepare a manual on handling future emergencies.
In White Plains, the Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, Daniel Hickey, said emergencies often prompted municipalities to review procedures.
"We have plans in place, and we've seen several large apartment fires here where we had to evacuate people, but never of the magnitude of the one in Yonkers," he said. In White Plains, a propane truck exploded on Interstate 287 last year, sending a fireball onto neighboring property and forcing the evacuation of families nearby.
In Mount Vernon, Ray DeRizzio, Director of Emergency Services, said that even though that city had detailed plans for emergencies, most municipalities had limited resources and would be forced to call in the county or even the state a large-scale disaster.

HEADLINE: Downsizing Portends Coming Discontents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As one of the 77,800 A.T.& T. managers who received a voluntary separation package, I urge Russell Baker to relax (column, Nov. 18). Many business units whose employees received their "packages" have been informed that the employees cannot be spared. Some who accept the offer will have their acceptances overridden by higher management, which is their prerogative. It is estimated only 10 percent of the managers who received offers will be let go. 
 I agree with Mr. Baker in his assessment of the state of American capitalism. Statistics may tell a rosy tale of increased productivity, but much of that arises from a fear of falling behind by workers who are more fearful of losing their jobs now than ever.
Funny Mr. Baker should mention the guillotine, for in the great inequity that all this Republican redistribution of wealth is accomplishing, no doubt there is being sown the seeds of some massive future revolt. The French Revolution, remember, was not so much a revolt of the peasantry as of the disaffected middle class.
Making companies responsible for released workers' unemployment benefits, retraining costs and health care for a full year might make them think before leaping into the downsizing pool next time.

HEADLINE: Texas Replaces Food Stamps With Food Cards

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 26

 BODY:
While Congress and the White House debate the future of welfare, Texas officials, trying to cut down on fraud and administrative costs, have expanded to the entire state a program that dispenses food-stamp benefits electronically.
The program, known as electronic benefit transfer, has been experimented with in Texas and seven other states as a way to reduce waste and fraud by giving recipients a plastic debit card rather than food stamp coupons. 
 Texas has been testing it since October 1994 and this month the program was expanded statewide, entirely eliminating food stamps printed on paper. About one million Texas households are now using the plastic cards at grocery checkout counters. Maryland is the only other state where the system is in use statewide.
"It's been a tremendous success," said John Sharp, the Texas State Comptroller who proposed the system in 1991. "The little card doesn't work at a downtown street corner that sells crack cocaine. It works in large groceries." Some smaller groceries that accepted stamps under the old system have been removed from the program, he said.
Since the system went into operation, purchases of groceries with food stamps have greatly increased, Mr. Sharp said. In the Dallas and Houston areas, such purchases jumped a total of $10 million in the first month after the system went on line, even though food stamp benefits had seen a slight decline.
Sue Keetch, an administrator with the state's Department of Human Services, said grocers in the Dallas area were happy with the new program because it was bringing in more revenue.
The cards are also being used by the 200,000 people who get benefits under Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the Government's main cash assistance program.
Because the system makes it difficult to trade food stamp benefits on the black market, officials say recipients are buying more food. Each recipient has an electronic account in which the benefits are automatically deposited each month. And no change is given after a purchase, which means that recipients never receive cash.
Mr. Sharp said the electronic records make it easier to detect fraud. Already, he said, the authorities have cracked several food stamp trafficking rings in Texas. These included a meat market that accepted the coupons and gave cash in return.
The state needed Federal waivers to test the system.
About 27 million people in the United States receive food stamps, with Texas distributing about 10 percent of the nation's estimated $24 billion in benefits. In Texas, the average food stamp allotment is $292 a month for a qualifying household.
Officials say the new system will save the state more than $10 million a year in administrative costs and save the Federal Government millions more by eliminating mass mailings, armored car shipments and the cost of shredding food stamps, estimated at $24 million a year.
"If you're going to talk about welfare reform, you ought to first get the hogs out of the creek," said Mr. Sharp, a Democrat. "There are a lot of people scamming the system."
Of the debate in Washington, he added, "Nobody up there is saying, 'Why don't you make the system work the way it ought to work.' "
Officials say the program also makes grocery check-out quicker and more efficient. "The cashiers are thrilled with the electronic process," said Kristy Ozmun, a spokeswoman for H.E.B., a large grocery chain based in San Antonio. "There's no paper to process through the system, so it eliminates all those steps along the way."
Recipients say the program is much safer than the old system and reduces the stigma associated with cumbersome paper coupons.
"It takes the guilt out of dealing with food stamps," said Perry Wise, a 37-year-old unemployed plant worker in Conroe, near Houston. "It's much speedier at the register and unless someone is looking over your shoulder they don't know how you are paying for your groceries."
Ms. Keetch added, "Now they don't have to rip coupons out of their book with everyone giving them the fish-eye."

HEADLINE: Scandal Puts Focus on Lingering Questions About Utah Congresswoman

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
As chairwoman of the Young Republicans, Enid Greene was given two minutes to speak at the Republican National Convention in Houston in 1992. Wearing a red power suit, the 33-year-old candidate for Congress from Utah seemed unusually self-possessed. "Should anyone stand between us and our goals," she warned her audience, almost spitting out her words with measured emphasis, "we will move them aside."
As she drew out each word, she held her hands together and then yanked them apart, showing the path this determined young Hannibal would clear over whatever Alps stood in her way. A whoop went up from the Utah delegation, where her future husband, Joe Waldholtz, hung on her every word, nodding in silent communion. 
 Representative Enid Greene Waldholtz's ambition has always been evident. Less clear has been how far she would really go to win elective office.
That is one of several questions being asked as Federal investigators sort out the couple's convoluted financial troubles, hidden by her husband's shuffling of various joint accounts. When Mr. Waldholtz vanished earlier this month for six days, he ignited a media frenzy that has produced a stream of reports of bounced checks, commingling of personal and campaign funds, and dubious campaign reports.
The central question is where Mrs. Waldholtz got the $1.8 million she spent to win her seat in Congress last year. Did she win fair and square, or did she use illegal money to surge ahead at the last minute? Before the election, she tap-danced through her answers, telling a television interviewer: "We're very blessed."
Today, no one describes Enid Greene Waldholtz as blessed. Her marriage is in shambles, and her political career may be, too. Once anointed by Speaker Newt Gingrich as one of the few freshmen with the potential to be a "real leader," Mrs. Waldholtz cowered in her office recently when the House debated important legislation banning gifts for members of Congress, a bill she had originally sponsored. Threatened with eviction from her Georgetown home, once owned by Henry A. Kissinger, for repeated failure to pay the $3,800 monthly rent, she is moving on her own to more modest quarters, her 3-month-old daughter in tow.
Mrs. Waldholtz blames her husband for her troubles, but several associates say they warned her more than a year ago that her finances were a mess. Her supporters say that Mrs. Waldholtz, a savvy, no-nonsense corporate litigator who represented banks when she was in private practice, was nonetheless blinded by love.
There is a sense of urgency in her district in Utah, and on Capitol Hill, for Mrs. Waldholtz to explain herself. Governor Michael O. Leavitt, who performed the Waldholtzes' civil wedding ceremony, said that she had "one shot" to make her case and that she should make it soon, or her political career would be over.
Although Mrs. Waldholtz has been cooperating with Federal authorities, she has so far avoided public disclosure. She skipped a self-imposed deadline to explain discrepancies in her financial reports to the Clerk of the House. Last week, she succeeded in getting her divorce proceedings sealed.
The couple's friends, and even opponents, say that Mrs. Waldholtz may well have been duped, at least initially, by Mr. Waldholtz, who pretended to be a rich political operator when they first met at a Young Republican convention in 1991. They say she probably did not know that when he showed up in Utah in 1992 to work on her first race for Congress, he had left Pittsburgh under a cloud of money problems, with both his employer and his family. He is still wanted in court in Pittsburgh to explain what he did with more than $600,000 he was supposed to have invested for his grandmother.
But after she married him, in August 1993, Mrs. Waldholtz also began having money problems. According to court records, her gardener filed a $3,600 lien on her house in December 1993, and her dentist sued her in February 1994 for an unpaid bill of $73. She accumulated parking tickets, with the city of Salt Lake taking her to court seven times to pay late fines; four of those times, she failed to appear.
 
A Successful Career With Roots in Utah
By this time, Enid Greene, now 37, was a comer in Utah politics. The third of five children of D. Forrest and Gerda Greene, she was the first of three who were adopted. (Her biological mother died in childbirth when Enid was born.)
The Greenes lived in San Francisco, where Mr. Greene, an investor, had a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. When Enid was 12, they moved back to Salt Lake City and their Mormon roots.
Enid was smart and energetic, finding early success on the high school debating team and in home economics. "There wasn't a thing she couldn't do," her mother said in an interview. Asked why her daughter had become a lawyer, her mother said: "When she was growing up, we saw a lot of girls losing husbands through divorce or death and, because they didn't have an education, she saw them go into waitressing and low-pay jobs. And Enid said, 'If that would ever happen to me, I would want to be able to hang onto the home my husband had provided for me and our children.' "
Enid Greene joined a top Salt Lake City law firm, but, as a single Mormon woman in her mid-30's, she was something of an outcast.
Some friends say that she lost her 1992 campaign for Congress in part because she was not married, but she had other problems as well. She came across as harsh and humorless. Before her rematch in 1994 against Karen Shepherd, the Democrat who beat her in 1992, she married and underwent a makeover.
"In '92, Enid was a single Mormon woman who was very aggressive, very strident, opinionated, hard-charging, very straightforward and bookish, with wire-rim glasses and curly tight black hair," said Bill Wachob, a Democratic media consultant based in San Diego who worked for Mrs. Shepherd.
"In '94," he said, "she was married, she gained weight, let her hair grow, took off her glasses. Although she was still articulate, she had no resemblance to the candidate of 1992. She would wear a nice pink sweater and pearls, and in her commercials she said, 'Some people say I should attack back, but I won't.' "
 
Bounced Checks And Many Warnings
Mr. Waldholtz, five years her junior, was the treasurer for his wife's 1994 campaign. Her associates say that is when his money problems became apparent.
"She was aware of Joe's financial improprieties by the summer of '94," said Steve Taggart, her former press secretary. "There were 50 or 60 bounced checks by then, and by June, there were 80 that we knew of." He added: "There were a zillion press reports about her problems, and she was obsessed with her press reports. You'd think she'd have had a clue by the 19th story."
By mid-June, Mr. Taggart and Kaylin Loveland, the campaign manager, told Mrs. Waldholtz about irregularities on her reports to the Federal Election Commission. Ms. Loveland said that Mrs. Waldholtz "assured me she understood what I was saying, and she said she and Joe would take care of it." Ms. Loveland wrote a memorandum that day and kept a copy, which she said she was not ready to make public.
When nothing happened, the two campaign workers met with David Hansen, a representative for the Republican National Committee, and David Jordan, the former United States Attorney for Utah, now a lawyer in private practice.
Mr. Jordan had a talk with Mr. and Mrs. Waldholtz. "Joe had lots of explanations for why things hadn't been done," Mr. Jordan said. "There were problems with the books; the records were hard to find or had been misfiled. At the end of the meeting, I told Enid that in my judgment, she needed to get a professional from outside and have them straighten out the books. I told her she shouldn't leave it to be done internally. She agreed."
By the end of the summer, Mr. Taggart and Ms. Loveland had quit, and Mrs. Waldholtz had heard from the state Republican chairman and even Governor Leavitt that her campaign had severe financial problems and that her husband should not be involved in her office. Still, she refused to act.
 
Trying to Explain An Influx of Money
By the end of August, she had raised just $280,000, and she was trailing in the three-way race. Then she startled many in Utah by pumping huge amounts of cash into her sagging campaign. First, she put in $880,000 plus a $15,000 loan; less than two weeks before the election, she put in $650,000 more.
Of the $1.8 million raised in the campaign, she reported furnishing more than $1.5 million of it herself.
The sudden infusion of cash drew questions immediately because she had spent only $313,000 on her 1992 race and still had a debt, and because she refused to say where the new money had come from. After the election, she hinted that it had been family money, then said it had come from her own money-management account.
Mrs. Waldholtz recently told Federal authorities that it had come from her father; she said he had swapped assets with her husband, although her husband apparently had none to swap.
David Owen, a friend and political consultant, said she would never "willfully defraud her father."
But David Magleby, a Democrat and the chairman of the political science department at Brigham Young University, said: "It doesn't add up. Was the father that dumb? How does someone that conservative, who has dealt with securities all his life, give money in that amount without checking it out?"
In the most recent account of the campaign funds, her lawyer said last week that Mrs. Waldholtz had known that her father was lending her and her husband more than $1 million, but she thought that money was to help her husband pay off debts, not for her campaign, which would be illegal. Federal election law says candidates cannot accept contributions of more than $1,000 from any individual. Moreover, they cannot spend more than half of any assets held jointly with a spouse.
The controversial contributions paid for television advertisements and a sophisticated direct-mail campaign. With that help, and a lift from the national surge for Republicans, Mrs. Waldholtz won, with 46 percent of the vote; Mrs. Shepherd won 36 percent, and Merrill Cook, an independent, won 18 percent.
For more than a year, the Utah press has been reporting irregularities in Mrs. Waldholtz's personal and campaign accounts, but Federal agents did not pick up the scent until late last month.
As recently as Nov. 1, Mrs. Waldholtz was defending her husband. "I will tell you most emphatically that there would be no truth to any allegation of wrongdoing by either my husband or me," she told The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper.
But when Mr. Waldholtz vanished on Nov. 11, Mrs. Waldholtz moved fast to distance herself from him. She filed a missing-person report immediately and filed for divorce two days later. She attributed her difficulties to what she described as her husband's endless deceits, saying she wanted him "tracked down, arrested and punished."
No one has been charged with any crime. Mr. Waldholtz turned himself in after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a $1.7 million check-kiting scheme, and he is talking to Federal prosecutors in preparation for a court appearance on Dec. 15. The authorities hope that he will testify against his wife.
"He has no credibility, but he has a Rolodex in his brain," Mr. Magleby said. "That's what the Justice Department is bargaining for -- names, dates and phone numbers" of people who know what Mrs. Waldholtz knew and when she knew it.

HEADLINE: A Family Struggle for the Soul of Times Mirror

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26

 BODY:
To understand the deep changes roiling The Los Angeles Times and its parent, the Times Mirror Company, four months after a management turnover that brought wrenching cutbacks to the paper and its staff, it is useful to look much further back, to a different turning point in the paper's history.
On March 5, 1961, the newspaper began a tough five-part series on the far-right-wing John Birch Society. But for those who knew the Chandler family, which controls the newspaper, it was more than an expose on some anti-Communist zealots. 
 The Chandlers had previously used The Times as a mouthpiece for their intensely conservative politics, and so the series was perceived as both a declaration of editorial independence and an attack by one part of the family, led by Otis Chandler, who had succeeded his father as publisher a year earlier, against a faction led by Philip Chandler, Otis's uncle and a stout supporter of the John Birch Society.
Philip Chandler resigned from the company's board eight months later, and Otis Chandler was on his way to a 20-year reign of rising profits, journalistic excellence and what many perceived as a liberal editorial agenda. According to former top editors and executives of the paper, Otis Chandler had mounted what amounted to a subtle kind of coup: he insured that the measure of the newspaper's success in its owners' eyes would be financial returns rather than the number of Republican politicians the paper helped elect.
Whatever understanding there was, however, is as much a part of history as the old series on the John Birch Society. As the newspaper's returns dwindled in the late 1980's, a trend accelerated by the downward spiral of the local economy, the conservative heirs of Philip Chandler have pushed for management changes and more influence over the paper's content. The first wish was granted earlier this year when Robert F. Erburu was replaced as chief executive by Mark H. Willes, the former vice chairman of General Mills; the second wish seems unfulfilled, at least so far.
Prominent in their absence from the fray, at least publicly, are Otis Chandler, now 67, his three sons and his two daughters. Prominent in his desire to appear ascendant is his cousin Jeffrey, Philip's son. Whatever the merits of Jeffrey Chandler's views -- he is a large shareholder but has no role in the company's management -- he is the only Chandler who is talking to all comers about the newspaper that has been the symbol of the family's achievements.
"As long as the paper was doing well financially and as long as the dividends were growing it was just a whole bunch of rich people clipping coupons," Jeffrey Chandler, 53, the owner of two radio stations in San Diego, said in a recent interview. "We were frustrated with the paper's slant, but it was always talk. There was never a plan to do anything about it. If a newspaper is supposed to reflect the opinions of its owners, it hasn't."
Now, he insisted, that is changing.
"We just want the paper brought back to the center, and I think you've seen less extreme positions already," Mr. Chandler said. "The family feelings were made known to both Willes and Erburu, that we simply weren't going to tolerate this stuff any more."
After suffering through five years of costly missteps and weak earnings -- Times Mirror had a $67 million loss in 1992, and its return on equity last year was 9.5 percent, compared with an industry average of 14.5 percent -- the company has undertaken cutbacks, layoffs and the summary closing of some operations, like New York Newsday. The company said the cost-cutting moves would result in $540 million in after-tax charges this year.
The Chandlers still control nearly 60 percent of Times Mirror's voting stock and have 4 family members on the 15-member board, including Bruce Chandler, another of Philip's four children. But no Chandler holds a major executive position. And no Chandler has held a senior executive position since Otis stepped down as publisher of The Times in 1980 and as chairman of Times Mirror in the mid-1980's.
Otis Chandler's only attempt to place a family member in contention for a top job ended 15 years ago when his eldest son, Norman, suffered a brain tumor that ended his career.
Mr. Willes said in a recent interview that his instructions from the board had been general rather than specific. "There wasn't a mandate in the sense of 'We expect you to come in and have this done by this date,' " Mr. Willes said.
He added, though, that "the board and management know substantial change is needed." And Shelby Coffey 3d, the newspaper's editor, said neither the board nor the family had exerted any pressure on him to alter the paper's news coverage or its editorial policies.
It seemed sudden, but in fact Times Mirror's transformation and the rise of the more conservative side of the family had been proceeding quietly for a decade, ever since Otis Chandler was first pushed aside by the more conservative Chandlers, according to former editors and executives at the paper.
Indeed, one of the most conspicuous aspects of the recent changes is that Otis Chandler has all but disappeared from the company and even this city; his creative impulses are now channeled into his museum of vintage cars in Ventura County. In his few public comments he has abandoned the defiant attitude that once drove The Times and has maintained an air of quiet acceptance.
Reached at a new home in Bend, Ore., Mr. Chandler said he was too busy moving furniture to talk. But in a recent interview with The American Journalism Review, Mr. Chandler shocked some former colleagues and supporters by indicating that he had lost some of the fire he had brought to the newspaper years before.
Mr. Chandler has long been known for a note he wrote to Tom Johnson, his successor as publisher of The Los Angeles Times and now the president of CNN, saying, "Together we are going to push The New York Times off its perch."
But Mr. Chandler said in the interview that the vow was merely a tool "to rally the troops," as he put it, rather than a commitment. "Being a competitive person, maybe I got a little too arrogant, not only that we would be the best but that we would challenge the best," he said.
Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, said, "It's almost impossible for me to believe that what he's saying now is what he felt when he was doing the job."
One former top official of The Los Angeles Times who worked closely with Mr. Chandler and who insisted on anonymity, said: "We were astounded. It was totally inconsistent with what we knew and heard. But it tells you something about what is happening in that family."
Under Mr. Willes, the focus has shifted unmistakably to the bottom line. In fact, many believe he has humiliated Mr. Erburu with his criticisms of the company. "Hardly anyone paid much attention to return on capital," Mr. Willes said in a recent interview. "We were sinking like a rock in a number of places in the company."
In fact, Mr. Willes's cutting has raised the stock price, but some analysts are still concerned. Shares of Times Mirror closed at $31.25 on Friday, up sharply from a little more than $17 earlier this year. But now Times Mirror faces a deeper problem: Where is the company's growth going to come from?
"Cutting costs is necessary, but it will not make this an exciting growth company," said Peter P. Appert, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons. "They're going to have to shift toward growth at some point or the stock is going to head back down again."
And some Chandlers still want more change. Jeffrey Chandler would like to see an end to certain kinds of coverage, including product- liability suits by consumers against manufacturers, and assertions that some companies are placing heavily polluting factories in poor neighborhoods.
But there is no evidence that anyone on the editorial side of the newspaper is listening. The only indication of a rightward turn in the paper's policies was the endorsement last year of Gov. Pete Wilson, the Republican gubernatorial candidate. Many members of the editorial board opposed the publisher's decision to do so.
The decisive turns -- which in some ways set the stage for this year's executive changes -- began in the mid-1980's, when Otis Chandler was nudged aside as chairman of Times Mirror, according to former editors and executives at the paper, and persuaded to become chairman of the board's executive committee.
The coup was completed in 1989, when Mr. Erburu and conservative family members demanded that Mr. Johnson, Mr. Chandler's handpicked successor as publisher, fire the liberal head of the editorial page, Anthony Day.
Mr. Johnson refused, which led to his ouster. Shortly after, Mr. Day was replaced.
Otis Chandler and his wing of the family were losing influence. After Otis's son, Norman, suffered his brain tumor, another son, Michael, was left with severe head injuries from an accident while auto racing. He now holds a position in circulation in Orange County. A third son, Harry, 42, holds a midlevel job at The Times, but his mother said his real passion was film production, which he still pursues through an outside production company.
Harry Chandler offered in a brief telephone conversation to explain his views, but he did not return subsequent telephone calls.
Marilyn Chandler, Otis Chandler's former wife, said: "The problem is that Otis retired rather early. It's good to have a family member down there keeping an eye on things. I wish we had more."

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL DEPLOY ITS SPY SATELLITES ON NATURE MISSION

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
With the cold war a fading memory, the nation's spy satellites are beginning to turn some of their attention to nature.
In addition to peering at the usual military targets, they are monitoring such natural phenomena as clouds, glaciers, sea ice, deserts and tropical rain forests to gather clues about long-term global climatic change and ecological threats. 
 At the urging of Vice President Gore, and with the support of Congress, the new program is directing spy satellites to study about two dozen ecologically sensitive sites around the world. Ultimately, it is to monitor about 500 sites. Scientists are programming the satellites to study diverse habitats vulnerable to environmental shifts and damage, including some that are unusually remote and forbidding.
"In terms of turning swords into plowshares, this is about as good of an example as I can think of," said Dr. Jeff Dozier, dean of the school of environmental science at the University of California at Santa Barbara and a member of the program's management team.
The data will be archived for future generations of scientists and will remain secret for now to conceal the abilities of the nation's reconnaissance systems, the scientists said. Intelligence experts always try to hide the exact abilities of their surveillance systems so foes are less likely to know how to evade and counter them. And in any event, the data will be most interesting in future decades because it seeks to reveal trends over time.
The program picks areas of the Earth that are thought to be particularly revealing of changes in the natural world and repeatedly photographs them on a fixed schedule, seasonally in some cases. Data are to be collected for decades, in theory revealing subtle ecological shifts that might otherwise be missed. For example, Mount Kilimanjaro in northeast Tanzania near the Kenya border is to be scrutinized for signs that the Earth's rising levels of carbon dioxide are changing its high forests.
The monitoring effort is led by Medea, a taciturn group of about 60 scientists in academia and industry who advise the nation's intelligence agencies on the use of secret data to study the environment. Medea stands for Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis. The group was founded after the cold war to aid re-evaluations of the nation's sprawling intelligence enterprise and has championed an environmentalist agenda.
"We want to make sure that the scientist working in 2020 has available a lot of relevant information," Dr. Gordon J. MacDonald, Medea's chairman and a geophysicist at the University of California at San Diego, said in an interview.
The new reconnaissance effort is run for Medea by the National Reconnaissance Office in the Pentagon and is coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency, which is apparently pleased with the broadening of its responsibilities.
"It's an exciting new issue to engage in," said a senior Federal intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Modest amounts of resources are producing interesting results. The other thing that makes it interesting is the high-level interest. It makes any producer enthusiastic if you've got eager customers."
The program is very different from the related effort to mine old spy-satellite photos for environmental data, a process the Clinton Administration recently began. That effort, featuring photos originally taken for military reasons, is often hit or miss in terms of ecological relevance. In contrast, the new effort directly targets nature and its subtleties.
So too, the program is different from recent intelligence gathering that studies natural phenomena for clues to the deeper roots of war and focuses on such things as drought, population growth and lack of arable land.
Medea scientists say spy satellites have several advantages over standard environmental studies. Coverage is wider and cheaper than that done by armies of scientists on the ground and can aid in spotting trends. Moreover, spy satellites can often assess faraway areas virtually inaccessible by other means.
The scientists add that spy satellites are better than civilian remote-sensing craft, like Landsat or Spot, which orbit the earth for the United States and France, respectively. Military craft can zoom in on ground targets, letting scientists learn more. Moreover, they say, these spy images can often aid civilian analyses.
"You can use the intelligence assets to make the interpretation of the civilian ones much more accurate," said Dr. Dozier of the University of California at Santa Barbara.
By definition, the vision of spy satellites is far more penetrating than civilian ones, though Medea scientists are barred from discussing such differences. It is well known that spy satellites not only take color and black-and-white photos but readings in hundreds of different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, using such instruments as space radars to see through forest canopies and desert sands.
Since the cold war's end, policy makers in Washington have heatedly debated how best to use the nation's huge investment in spy satellites, with some encouraging a broadening to include economic intelligence in aid of businesses and trade negotiations.
The Republican-led Congress has been generally supportive of Medea and its environmental efforts, ignoring scattered critics who say the programs are inappropriate and wasteful and should be eliminated. For the fiscal year 1996, the Administration requested $17.6 million for the environmental work, and appropriations conferees allotted $15 million.
Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington, and his colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee wrote in a minority report on the 1996 budget that the initiative "promises to lead to better understanding of long-term environmental change as well as better management of crisis situations involving natural and ecological disasters."
Steven Aftergood, a senior researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the environmental reconnaissance was "potentially a watershed in the reform of intelligence," adding, "It reflects an expanding definition of national security."
"There are people who will paint this as soft-headed environmentalism," Mr. Aftergood said. "But in fact environmental changes can be an important source of regional conflict, so I think it's a perfectly legitimate redirection."
Marc A. Levy, a political scientist at Princeton University who studies ecological politics, said he applauded the change of focus but doubted if it had political staying power.
"I'm worried that it will be vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of security politics," Dr. Levy said. "Like Star Wars and the B-1 bomber, these things come and go."
But scientists involved in the program say its overhead is so low and the potential gains so great that it is likely to exist for the foreseeable future.
Since the nation launched its first spy satellite in 1960, it has spent $100 billion or more to acquire and use spacecraft laden with cameras, telescopes and antennas that spy on the Earth. Today each spy satellite is thought to cost roughly $1 billion and a dozen or so are believed to be constantly at work.
The Medea group is conducting two dozen or so experiments to see how effectively these spy satellites can monitor natural sites. In many cases, the experimental areas are long-term ecological reserves around the country that are financed by the National Science Foundation, which provides money for basic research.
In the near future, the reconnaissance effort is to expand to take on hundreds of other domestic and foreign sites, with Federal civilian agencies helping nominate areas. Dr. Dozier said that Medea had so far selected about 260 candidate sites around the world and that eventually some 500 would be targeted.
These are some of the current candidates:
*Clouds off the California coast between Los Angeles and San Diego;
*The Mojave Desert in California;
*The Luquillo experimental forest in Puerto Rico;
*A mixed coniferous-deciduous forest in Pleshcheyevo, Russia;
*The Konza prairie in Kansas;
*A lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva, Costa Rica;
*The forested slopes of the Sumava Mountains, Czechoslovakia;
*The coastal zone around the Galapagos Islands, off Ecuador;
*Permafrost in Fish Creek, Alaska;
*Glaciers in Griegsletchner, Switzerland;
*The high slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.
Dr. Herman H. Shugart, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia, is now working on a Medea project to study Mount Kilimanjaro and other mountains in the tropics. The thesis is that the increases of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that are under way will first affect vegetation at high altitudes, causing it to become more verdant.
"If you're looking at the first place on Earth that might show a biological change, the place would be the highest vegetation zones you can find, and those puppies are found in tropical high forests," Dr. Shugart said.
"If this archival system works," he added, "then one day people will be able to say, 'By god, all those mountains are changing in the same way.' It gives you a chance to be creative about things that might matter."

HEADLINE: Retailers' Vision Of Full Registers Goes a Bit Awry

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
America went to the mall over the weekend, snooped around for bargains, nibbled on Mrs. Fields cookies and went home.
The post-Thanksgiving shopping traffic was heavy -- but spending was not, retailers and those who study them said yesterday. "We've had a lot of cruisers," said Vinny Castoro, an assistant manager at the Sears Office Center in the Paramus Park mall in Bergen County, N.J. "Time will tell if they'll come back and buy." 
 Apparel stores suffered the most and entertainment and consumer electronics enjoyed the biggest sales, although in nearly every category, shoppers compared prices, and many stores unloaded merchandise by slicing their profit margins.
Mall revenue was up 5.8 percent on Friday, compared with the day after Thanksgiving last year -- well below the 9 percent increase last year over 1993, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, which polls 24 malls nationwide each year.
Check-writing on Friday declined 4.8 percent in the 10,000 stores monitored by Telecheck Services Inc., a steep loss compared with last year, when it was up 5.7 percent from the previous year.
"This was weaker than I expected," said William F. Ford, the senior economic adviser for the service, which studies check acceptance. "It looks like consumers started out very cautious."
The Friday after Thanksgiving -- known as Black Friday in the retail industry by those who count on the season to turn their books the same color -- has become less significant in recent years because more shoppers are doing buying closer and closer to Christmas, seeking markdowns in a game of chicken with merchants. The retailers acknowledge this and keep their inventories smaller.
Still, retailing executives still pay close attention to Thanksgiving weekend, even though it is no longer their busiest, as a barometer of what the rest of the holiday season may produce. Many do 40 percent of their annual business between Thanksgiving and the end of the year.
Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, lowered his forecast on gains in same-store sales to a range of 3 to 4 percent, from 4 to 5 percent. "The most surprising thing is the depths of sales," Mr. Barnard said. "I've never seen 40 percent off before at this time and there are all kinds of additional incentives, like 'open a charge account today and and get an extra 10 percent off.' It's just wild."
While anything with the word "multimedia" on the package moved smartly, department stores were using discounts to get winter coats and dresses off the racks. Apparel made a meager 1 percent gain over last year, the mall survey found, while entertainment products boasted a 9.3 percent gain, energized by a range of products from "The Beatles Anthology" to movie-related items to software.
"The continued slump in apparel is a disappointment," said Mark Schoifet, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. "Everyone had their fingers crossed that this would be the year it would pick up, but it continues to be a major concern with mall operators nationwide."
Department store merchants, too, acknowledged that sales did not inspire them to do jigs in the aisles. "It went O.K.," said Philip B. Miller, chairman of Investcorp's Saks Fifth Avenue chain, adding that same-store sales were up 2.5 percent. "We had planned it a couple points higher," Mr. Miller said. "But I'm very sanguine about December because of the calendar." Christmas falls on a Monday, so the shopping season will be one day longer than usual.
Many retailers are counting on late shoppers; some said they hoped to gain because Hanukkah falls closer to Christmas this year than last. But their optimism may be blunted by factors like high consumer debt and shoppers who simply snub merchandise that is not on sale.
Throughout the country, stores ranging from Kay-Bee Toys, a Manville Corporation unit, to the Neiman Marcus unit of Harcourt General put their wares on sale. Even winter coats were discounted as much as 40 percent in many department stores.
Sears, Roebuck stores, however, appeared to be bustling throughout the country. "We had our best Thanksgiving weekend ever," said John Costello, senior executive vice president at Sears, although he declined to support that with hard numbers. "We don't expect same-store increases to approach the 8 percent December gain of last year, but we did hit our forecast," he said. Hot items included computers and accessories, as well as women's clothing, which has been the focus of the company's latest ad campaign.
Mr. Barnard confirmed that his researchers had found Sears stores packed in many areas, cash registers beeping happily. That the Paramus Park store was slow on Saturday seemed only to underscore the mercurial ways of shoppers that make forecasting hard.
"I think it's a very difficult weekend and people are going to have a tough time figuring it out," said Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores. "I'm not a big believer that this is the start of the holiday season. We had a good November so far, but December was not a good month last year after a spectacular November. So we'll wait and see."
As expected, computer and electronics stores like CompUSA and Radio Shack did better. "Friday and Saturday looked very good," said John Roach, chief executive of the Tandy Corporation, which owns Radio Shack. "At Incredible Universe, computer sales ran 30 percent higher than the prior Friday and Saturday," he said, the smile on his face evident even over a telephone line from Texas. "And at Radio Shack we had very strong sales in the toy area, up on the order of 25 to 30 percent over last year."
John Kale, general manager for sales and merchandise at Micro Center, a small computer-department-store chain based in Columbus, Ohio, said a new store in Dallas did $749,000 in sales on Friday, compared with a Houston store that opened on Thanksgiving weekend last year and took in $683,000. "In talking with some of the general managers yesterday, we were running between 8 and 13 percent ahead of last year," he said.
But even in computers, there was comparison shopping. Jeff Buenz, who was shopping at Fry's Electronics in Palo Alto, Calif., on Saturday, said, "I won't buy until some incredible deal comes up."
Wal-Mart discount stores appeared also to be an anomaly. Although executives refused to say anything about how their weekend went, retail experts said Wal-Mart stores were jammed from coast to coast.
Home furnishings, one area that analysts predicted would soar, seemed to flop on Friday -- the survey of mall shoppers found the category was down 2.3 percent from the similar period last year. Many home-specialty shops that were expected to be packed on Friday seemed instead like libraries.
And many shoppers may not just be holding off, but holding out. "If you don't know what your long-term budget is going to look like, you don't buy," said Marleen Ernstberger, a junior high school math teacher who left a Nordstrom store in Costa Mesa, Calif., empty-handed on Saturday. "You can only rob Peter to pay Paul for so long."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 8% in October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MCLEAN, Va., Nov. 26

 BODY:
Orders for industrial tools made in the United States rose 8 percent in October from the month before, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology.
While domestic customers raised their orders by 15.5 percent last month, demand from abroad fell 22.1 percent, the trade group's report showed. 
 Compared with October 1994, total orders rose 34.3 percent. The association said that orders for the first 10 months of the year were running 12 percent ahead of a year ago.
"We are happy to report that order activity in October has been stronger than most analysts were anticipating," Albert W. Moore, the association's president, said.
Economists follow orders and shipments of machine tools -- used to shape and assemble metal in products ranging from diesel engines to dishwashers -- to gauge industrial output, consumer demand and business investment.
More clues to the manufacturing outlook will come this week. The Commerce Department is to issue its report on October's orders for durable goods on Thursday, while the National Association of Purchasing Management is to release its November index of manufacturing activity on Friday.
The tools report showed that machine tool orders increased to $483.15 million in October, after rising 28.9 percent during September. Previously, September orders were reported to have risen 39.4 percent.
Machine tool shipments increased 12.9 percent in October, to $506.95 million. The backlog of orders, which tracks pent-up demand for tools, fell 1 percent, to $2.363 billion.

HEADLINE: Amtrak's Uphill Climb

 BODY:
Rail passenger service is the stepchild of America's transportation policy and the automobile culture Congress serves so slavishly. It took decades for urban transit systems to wrest even a penny of the Federal gasoline tax to help localities rationalize the way people get to and from work. Now Amtrak, the intercity people-mover struggling to gain its financial footing, is at the mercy of the highway lobby and their loyal legislators.
Congress must provide the financial security Amtrak needs. The passenger company, spun off from railroads that were allowed to concentrate on their viable freight business, deserves a sound financial base from a capital trust fund such as highway construction enjoys. So do rail customers, and so for that matter do motorists who seek open, uncluttered roadways. 
 It is a sad political fact that Amtrak -- already forced to reduce passenger service all across the country -- must beg Congress for this funding from the same half-penny of the gas tax that now goes to subways, buses and other forms of mass transit. Highway lobbies are so powerful that further inroads into the gas tax seem politically unachievable. Bud Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, says he will consider endowing Amtrak, provided the transit and intercity systems do not invade sacred highway funding.
That approach pits the various mass transit and intercity rail alternatives against each other while exempting highways from budgetary competition. Highway interests luxuriate in the myth that motor vehicles pay for their public costs in taxes at the fuel pump while the rail systems unworthily seek public subsidies.
Delaware's Senators, the Republican William Roth and the Democrat Joseph Biden, see the economics and the politics more charitably. They are two of Amtrak's steady commuting customers and have constituents who depend on Amtrak. Mr. Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, argues that no other nation tries to run its passenger rail system without subsidy. For those who recommend privatizing Amtrak, Mr. Roth argues that a dedicated capital trust fund is still needed.
A Roth-Biden amendment to the highway bill would have let states allocate a little of their highway tax allocations to Amtrak they way they do now for anti-pollution and anti-congestion projects. But as Mr. Biden observed the other day, that flexibility was rejected because "the cement folks and the asphalt folks" were appalled that states might "spend money on something other than laying concrete or laying down asphalt."
The House's rejection of the modest Roth-Biden proposal indicates that Amtrak's road ahead is curvy and uphill. Although outnumbered, legislators who understand the need for transportation balance should press for hearings to demonstrate Amtrak's and the nation's plight. Through sharing of user taxes or some other means, America needs to find a way to save this necessary resource.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Living In A Cocoon

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
If you are heading for college or graduate school and are sensitive about being male, female, black, white, Asian, young, old, married, unmarried, gay, straight, Catholic, Jewish, evangelical Protestant or a veteran, think about going to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. You will be protected there against offense to your group sensibilities.
That is the purpose of a new code of behavior proposed by the university's administration and its union of graduate student employees. It would punish as "harassment" a wide range of speech by faculty members or students -- including "epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping" -- that may offend groups. 
 Speech codes at universities had seemed to be on the decline. Several were held unconstitutional. So it is of more than parochial interest that an extraordinarily sweeping code should be proposed in this supposedly liberal-minded state.
The proposed code, circulated at the Amherst campus last month, would ban speech that offends "on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, marital status, veteran status or disability." The graduate students' union said it would add to that list "citizenship, culture, H.I.V. status, language, parental status, political affiliation or belief and pregnancy status."
Speech in those categories would be offensive if it "discriminatorily alters the conditions" of people's participation in the university. It would be judged by what a "reasonable" member of the one of the groups would think of the speech.
To enforce all this would be a complex apparatus of boards and panels. The university would train "volunteer advocates" to represent complainants and defendants. Penalties for students and faculty would range up to dismissal. The graduate students' union said there should also be "mandatory harassment education" at the Amherst campus.
Orwell is the name that comes to mind as one reads this proposal. It would create a totalitarian atmosphere in which everyone would have to guard his tongue all the time lest he say something that someone finds offensive. (The code would let anyone who heard a doubtful remark about some group bring a complaint, even if he was not a member of the group.)
Do the drafters have no knowledge of history? One wonders. No understanding that freedom requires, as Justice Holmes said, "freedom for the thought that we hate"? And if not, what are they doing at a university?
Conservatives who are on the look-out for Political Correctness will find the Amherst campus proposals a juicy target. (They might look to their own vulnerability, many of them, on the proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw flag-burning.)
Fortunately, faculty members across the political spectrum are rallying against the code. Daphne Patai, professor of Spanish and Portuguese, said many at the university understand that its job "is not to impose 'comfort' levels, that civility and suasion, not rules and regulations, are the way to shape the tone of a community."
Robert M. Costrell, professor of economics, said a student who was an unmarried mother might be offended by a statement warning that bringing up "large numbers of young men" in single-parent families could lead to "violence, unrest, disorder." The warning was given by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1965.
The chancellor at the Amherst campus, David K. Scott, responded to criticism by suggesting that a code was required by Federal Department of Education regulations. They threaten to withhold Federal aid from any university with a "hostile environment" in terms of race -- and similar gender rules are being prepared.
If so, the Federal regulations need revision. It is time to stop letting the elastic concept of a "hostile environment" menace freedom of speech, at universities of all places.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
'Mahagonny,' an Apt Metaphor For Political Chaos in Any Era

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

 BODY:
If politics is the systemization of all that is worst in us, then "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny" is the most political of operas. Its banners are all-purpose: equally appropriate to social democrats, libertarians or republicans. So basic are its appraisals of human frailty that any party will do. The message of "Mahagonny" is, unfortunately, in no danger of becoming obsolete.
The Metropolitan Opera brought back John Dexter's 1979 production of the Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht stage piece on Saturday afternoon. Its mythical evocation of New World free enterprise looks to faraway places but grows out of a specific environment, the economic and spiritual chaos of Germany in the 1920's. It was a time when Communism and Fascism were in the bloom of youth, when capitalism had reached comfortable maturity, when greed was enjoying its ripe old age and hope was on its deathbed. 
 The Weill-Brecht collaboration formulates an America (for though unspecified, this country it surely is) reminiscent of Franz Kafka's in the unfinished novel "Amerika." Both are Middle European fantasies fed by a few facts, a collection of fictional film images and many dreams. Place names like "Mahagonny" and "Pensacola" were chosen more for their euphony than for any geographic relevance. While Kafka's tone is quizzical and bemused, the opera greets the cruelty it confronts with an equally cruel stare.
Mahagonny is a gold-rush town rising almost instantaneously out of an unnamed wasteland and running on avarice and unregulated brutality. It houses no heroes, only victims and victimizers. Jimmy Mahoney, its male protagonist, is executed for the capital crime of having no money. Jenny, the object of Jimmy's attentions, is not one to let passion (or compassion) get in the way of self-interest. Jimmy's well-heeled friends could easily buy his freedom, but don't.
Brecht's socialist passions found a friend in Weill's sophisticated embrace of popular music. In abrasive harmonies and stern counterpoint, one hears vestiges of the composer's once-rigorous modernism, but this is predominantly the Kurt Weill of smoky bars and parades: long, sinuous, deceptively simple melodies that at their best soar with anthemlike power. The brass-heavy orchestrations tootle with paradoxical good humor.
The Dexter setting is appropriately working class, but it has a hard time occupying the Met's big stage. The proscenium is framed in dull-gray panels; a white curtain attached to a simple rod opens and closes on every scene. A bar, a cut-out palm, a platform, a few chairs constitute the prevailing rough-and-ready-ness.
There is too much simplicity and too little spectacle to fill up these vast spaces. One kept admiring the endless zeal of principals like Kenneth Riegel (Fatty), Timothy Noble (Trinity Moses) and Helga Dernesch (Mrs. Begbick) as they labored to ee-nun-cee-ate every English word of the David Drew-Michael Geliot translation. All of the principals seemed to find themselves belting to the limits of their techniques, hoping to reach the audience spaces in front of them. "Mahagonny" is grand opera but not inflated opera. It is happier on a smaller stage than this.
Jenny is not always the center of attention, but she is the center of "Mahagonny," personifying the city's amalgam of frailty, helplessness and moral indifference, all seductively wrapped in sensuality. Teresa Stratas's cancellation because of illness was a big blow to Saturday's performance. Sheri Greenawald took her place and sang with a diligence that was both earnest and devoid of charm. The scenes designed with Jenny's presence in mind sagged; most of the others flew nicely.
Gary Lakes sang Jimmy in his aggressive, tough-sounding tenor. Alan Held's Moneybags Billy filled the house easily and agreeably. Mr. Riegel, Mr. Noble and Miss Dernesch labored honorably and agreeably in their somewhat hostile surroundings. David Kneuss's stage direction remembers and reproduces John Dexter's visual sarcasms well. James Levine conducted an orchestra touched with saxophone, banjo and barroom piano. There was some splendid brass playing.
For one reason or another, Saturday's audience fled the house in a slow but steady trickle. The audience at the end was more than a skeleton crew, but not that much more.

HEADLINE: House Compromised to Pass the Highway Bill;
Billboard Economics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Senate's Highway Cave-In" (editorial, Nov. 21) omitted important factors about the outdoor advertising provision in the recently passed national highway system bill. 
 The technical clarification surrounding outdoor advertising in the commercial and industrial "nonscenic" portions of scenic byways is a victory for states' rights, rural economic development and scenic conservation.
The bill gives states the decision-making power to boost local economies in rural areas by allowing outdoor advertising in commercial and industrial zones. As many as 20 percent of the total jobs in rural, scenic areas depend on the travel-tourism dollar, and many small travel-related businesses depend on billboards to bring them customers. In these rural areas, small businesses use 90 percent of the billboards, with 70 percent advertising travel and tourism services.
Most scenic byways have breaks in continuity for incorporated towns, business zones and cities. For instance, Minnesota's Great River Road passes through St. Cloud, a city with a population of 51,000. West Virginia's Midland Trail passes by a chemical plant. The highway bill permits states to establish their own criteria for designating scenic byways that can exclude from designation segments that are not truly scenic. It is only in these segments that new billboard construction is permitted, and only if in compliance with state and local controls.
The billboard provision makes partners of business and scenic beauty in an effort to boost the economies of rural areas.

HEADLINE: A Multimedia Assault Takes Shape

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
Maybe it is his penchant for luring big-name talent like Kevin Wendle, a co-founder of the Fox television network and one-time producer of "Beverly Hills 90210." Or perhaps it is the way he boldly strikes deals for exclusivity when it just is not done. Halsey Minor is proof that the once-cozy Internet, with its roots in academia and the military establishment, is today steeped in the no-holds-barred competitive traditions of American capitalism.
With new electronic magazines popping up daily on the World Wide Web, there is a land-rush feel to the place, and Mr. Minor is intent on staking out his audience early. Mr. Minor, the 30-year-old chief executive of the C/net on-line computer magazine, begun in June, offers a telling example of the aggressiveness, energy and seed money that may be required to set down economic roots in God's little cyberacre. 
 What makes C/net different from other computer magazines on the Web is that the Web site is the leading edge of Mr. Minor's multimedia assault, a business strategy that he hopes will outflank rivals whose roots are in the print-and-ink world. Calling his computer information service a "network" (perhaps a bit prematurely), Mr. Minor is also offering a half-hour cable television show, "C/net Central," that runs several times a week on the USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel.
"Our category, computers, is going to be the most competitive, simply because it's the first to happen," Mr. Minor said.
Mr. Minor would not say just how much money he received from his principal investors, which include Paul G. Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, along with the USA Network, a unit of Viacom Inc. Nor will he say how much he has spent so far. But he estimates that it takes roughly $10 million to start a commercial on-line service and take it to profitability, which he hopes to do by the end of next year. Beginning a television network, by far the more expensive of C/net's two propositions, can require as much as $75 million.
The Web site has been the primary focus of C/net's new advertising campaign, which has sought visibility in places like the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where C/net ads have been plastered on 100 buses.
Yet in the end, no amount of hype will keep the audience if, when people find its Web site (http:/ www.cnet.com), there is nothing there to hold their attention. So while Mr. Minor is spending big sums to get people's attention, he is investing even more in a product that will hold their attention long enough to satisfy advertisers like Intel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard.
As do its counterparts in print, C/ net includes reviews of new computer products, like the newest hand-held computer; comparisons of the latest Web browsing software, and columnists like John Dvorak, an industry gadfly.
But as do all Web-based publications, C/net offers something print publications cannot: a reader can move quickly from one document to another by clicking on the various links attached to them. Also, the site can be continually updated.
Mr. Minor argues that these advantages will lure many high-technology companies. "We see an enormous opportunity to move revenue out of magazines and into on-line," he said, "particularly in this category: computers."
 Other on-line experts agree that the electronic media are beginning to encroach on the print industry's territory.
"Halsey is shrewdly going after" the traditional media, said Adam Schoenfeld, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a market research company in New York. He added that traditional media were reluctant to move to digital media "because it diverts resources from their core business."
But the publishers of the nation's large computer magazines counter any notion that they are somehow cannibalizing their own advertising revenues, insisting that their electronic publishing ventures were not hurting ad sales but helping them.
The CMP Corporation of Manhasset, L.I., maintains a popular Web site called Techweb, and Ziff-Davis has ZDNet, both of which depend on ad revenues. A third publisher, the IDG Corporation, has a number of smaller sites associated with single titles, like PC World magazine.
Techweb "has actually helped our print sales," said Mitchell York, managing director for Interactive Media at CMP, which publishes computer magazines like Computer Reseller News, Netguide and Information Week. "Companies want to know we have an on-line service. They're looking for that medium."
While the traditional publishers contend that publishing in two media helps them to sell ads, C/net has its own approach to multiple media programming with "C/net Central," the television show.
"On line is very much like TV," Mr. Minor said. "It includes all the same things -- the talent issues and production elements are all the same, and they're both ratings-based."
C/net executives hope the show will whet people's appetite for more in-depth information, available on the on-line service. While Mr. Minor started out thinking that revenues from television would account for the largest chunk of C/net's total, today he thinks of the television venture as a way to build brand identity for what appears to be a larger cash cow, the Web site, which also makes its money from advertising.
As a result, the company has slowed its original schedule for beginning a 24-hour computer cable network, though at least two new shows are planned for early next year. "On line is eclipsing our expectations, and television is meeting it," Mr. Minor said. Advertisers are attracted to the on-line service's ability to track precisely how many people view an ad and click on it for more information.
But in television, in contrast to the more crowded field of computer magazine publishing, there is less competition for "C/net Central." PCTV of Phoenix, Ariz., for example, produces computer shows, but it lacks the flashiness of "C/net Central," which is a sort of MTV for computer lovers. (The show features Richard Hart, a longtime television personality in the San Francisco area who is known for putting computerese into people terms.)
And competitive shows anticipated from Ziff-Davis and a partnership of Microsoft and Tele-Communications Inc. have never materialized. (Mr. Minor denies recent published reports that Tele-Communications may make an investment in C/net.) The challenge now is to find the right content.
For C/net's on-line venture, the challenge is to sustain its popularity.
To keep his site competitive, Mr. Minor spun off a new site earlier this month on the Web devoted to "shareware," where subscribers can locate and retrieve any of thousands of software programs and install them -- free or for a nominal charge -- on their own computers.
At the same time Mr. Minor signed a deal with Yahoo, a sort of Web yellow pages, that insures that only C/net's advertising is displayed on the Yahoo home page, to the exclusion of principal competitors like Techweb and ZDNet.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Governor Endorses Dole for President

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who has been a leader among the country's governors in pressing the Federal Government to transfer more power to the states, endorsed Senator Bob Dole today for the Republican Presidential nomination.
"He has been truly a friend of all of the governors this past year when he was working so hard in the United States Senate to carry the difficult message that we have to balance the budget, we have to reform welfare and we have to keep the economy moving," Mr. Thompson said. Earlier this year, Mr. Thompson had considered seeking the Presidential nomination himself. 
 Mr. Thompson's endorsement gave Mr. Dole, the front-runner for his party's nomination, the backing of 16 of the 30 Republican Governors, far more than any other candidate. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona have endorsed the Presidential bid of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas; Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee has endorsed Lamar Alexander, a former Tennessee governor.
Other Republican governors, like Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, have said they are close to endorsing Mr. Dole.
In accepting Mr. Thompson's endorsement, Mr. Dole said that he would be leaning on the Wisconsin Governor for political advice, and he hinted that he might consider Mr. Thompson as a running mate.
Mr. Dole declared that he wanted a Vice-Presidential nominee with a good political record who wanted a limited role for government, lower taxes, less Federal regulation and more responsibility for the states.
"Obviously, Governor Thompson fits most of those, probably all of those, and would probably be on anyone's list for Vice President and would have been an outstanding candidate for President himself," Mr. Dole said.
In recent months, Mr. Dole has floated the names of Gov. Pete Wilson of California; Dan Lungren, California's Attorney General, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as potential running mates.

HEADLINE: Trying to Stem Emissions, U.S. Sees Its Goal Fading

SERIES: THE AIR IN 2000 -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
For every step the United States takes to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that scientists say are warming the earth's atmosphere, it seems to be slipping two steps back from its goal.
Across the country, for instance, more than 1,100 companies have signed up to do as the American Express Company is doing at its 51-story headquarters in lower Manhattan. There, under an agreement with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the company has installed new energy-efficient lighting that saves it up to 40 percent on electricity bills. 
 Using less electricity means burning less coal and oil, and therefore emitting less carbon dioxide. Through this simple expedient, American Express has cut annual emissions by about 3,300 tons all told in New York and five other cities.
But a few miles away in Montclair, N.J., not long ago, vivid evidence of backsliding sat resplendently on the floor of Montclair-Bloomfield Motors: a red 1996 Ford Explorer, Eddie Bauer model, one of the gasoline-guzzling sport utility vehicles, vans, minivans and pickups made by all American car companies whose surging popularity is reversing longtime advances in fuel efficiency. The carbon dioxide emitted by about 700 Explorers -- less than half a day's production -- more than cancels out all of American Express's gains.
Do customers ever ask about carbon dioxide emissions when shopping for an Explorer? "Not once," said Ed Goldstein, the business manager of the Ford agency. "Environment is probably last on the list."
The net result of this sort of energy-use tug of war across the broader economy is that the United States is faltering in its effort to cut emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, as this country and other rich nations are pledged to do under a treaty signed at the 1992 United Nations conference on the environment in Rio de Janeiro.
The Clinton Administration attributes the shortfall mainly to higher emissions brought about by unexpectedly strong economic growth and reduced energy prices. The Administration has promised to take stronger action if its initial actions prove insufficient, but the United States could fall even further behind if the Republican-run Congress carries out plans to cut up to 40 percent of the money used mainly to stimulate private investment in energy-saving measures.
The Republicans display "great hostility" to the Administration's plan, Vice President Al Gore, the driving force behind the policy, said in an interview. And indeed, the conservative Republican chairman of a House subcommittee that deals with environmental issues, Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, says concern about global warming may just be "liberal claptrap."
 
Initial Effort
Even Opening Step Is Falling Short
This political byplay comes at a time when scientists around the world are more convinced than ever that emissions of carbon dioxide, the major contributor to the tons of carbon in the atmosphere, and certain other gases pose a serious threat.
A United Nations panel of scientists advising parties to the climate treaty, in a draft report now undergoing final review, recently concluded for the first time that human influences already have probably caused some warming of the atmosphere.
The 2,500-member group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, predicts that the warming will increase over the next century and beyond and that the resulting climate changes and rise in sea level are likely to cause widespread economic, social and environmental dislocation if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
Even before these latest findings, the 142 nations that are parties to the 1992 treaty had opened negotiations on stronger emissions-reduction measures. The aim of cutting emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 -- a nonbinding treaty goal to which the United States and other rich countries have voluntarily subscribed -- was never intended as anything more than a first step in a decades-long effort to deal with the risk of climate change.
Going beyond the first step now appears more daunting than ever in view of the stumbling of not just the United States, but most other industrialized countries as well. Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland say they expect to reduce carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2000, and Germany expects an 11 percent drop from 1990 levels by 2005. But eight other industrialized countries expect to join the United States, the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide, in falling short of the treaty goal.
It is a shaky initial example for the developing countries, which are not yet bound to any specific aims but whose emissions are expected to outstrip those of the rich nations in the decades ahead.
The Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, adopted two years ago as an executive branch policy, relies mostly on an array of voluntary measures by business, industry and homeowners to cut energy use and thereby carbon emissions. Its philosophy is exemplified by the program for stimulating investment in more efficient lighting, Green Lights, in which the Federal Government acts as catalyst, provider of reliable technical information and cheerleader.
For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency recruited American Express as a Green Lights participant. Because of the long-term savings in electricity bills, the company agreed. In another wrinkle of a sort encouraged by the Clinton plan, Consolidated Edison, the utility company, provided a one-time incentive rebate to American Express. The resulting energy savings by many such Con Ed customers obviates the need for the utility to build new power plants, saving money and emissions.
Green Lights began in the Bush Administration, and utilities in many parts of the country have been offering energy-saving incentives to businesses and consumers for some time, but both efforts are being expanded and encouraged under the Clinton plan. Companies now participating in or committed to Green Lights are expected to save 14.3 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, and the E.P.A. projects annual savings of 44 million tons by 2000. More than $3 billion in annual electric bill savings are also projected for 2000, along with a substantial reduction in other air pollutants.
There is "really no downside," said Martin T. Warfel, an American Express vice president.
 
Moderate Measures
Indirect Approach To Emissions Cuts
Many experts believe that these sort of "no regrets" measures are the way to go in the near term: reducing carbon dioxide emissions through energy-efficiency measures that make sense for other reasons. The experts do not agree on whether this will be enough to solve the problem in the long term.
In view of scientists' uncertainty about how serious the climate problem is, almost no one is advocating costly, Draconian action just yet, and no country has taken any.
The Administration's plan outlines more than 50 measures, many patterned on the Green Lights approach. They include awarding "Energy Star" labels to energy-efficient office equipment, appliances and computers, planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide, setting higher efficiency standards for home appliances, though Republican-sponsored legislation would place a moratorium on them and reducing emissions of methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, from farms and leaky natural gas lines.
Together the measures represent a long and varied menu of ways to reduce emissions. The plan projects a total Federal expenditure of less than $800 million from 1994 through 2000. This expenditure is designed to induce $60 billion in private investment over the same period, the fruits of which, the Administration calculates, would produce an annual reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to nearly 440 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2000 -- and a cumulative total of nearly $286 billion in energy savings between 1994 and 2010.
The emissions reduction, according to the Administration's original calculations, would bring total United States emissions back in line with the 1990 figure of something more than five billion tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent. But with faster economic growth and lower energy prices unexpectedly boosting emissions, Mr. Gore said, "we can fairly say" that the country will miss the 2000 target the way things are now going, even with no budget cuts.
 
Tough Issue
Lack of Consensus On Motor Vehicles
The glaring omission in the Administration's plan is its lack of any significant measure to rein in motor vehicle emissions, which account for a third of all the carbon dioxide spewed out and are growing faster than emissions from any other source.
Perhaps made gun-shy by its early failure to secure Congressional passage of an energy tax, the Administration included in the action plan only a few small measures to encourage less driving. It has proposed no gasoline tax or increase in Federal gasoline mileage standards, the two measures most often advocated to cut fuel use and emissions significantly.
Instead, the Administration entered a yearlong discussion with the automotive and petroleum industries and environmentalists that broke up in September after failing to reach a consensus. A major reason was opposition from industry to taxes or tightened gas mileage standards.
The Administration is considering what to do next about motor vehicles. "We don't view it as that the problem is intractable or that solutions don't exist," Mr. Gore said.
One possibility is to raise the mileage standard for light trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles, vans and minivans -- like the Explorer in Montclair. They have replaced station wagons as the big gas drinker in many driveways, wasting both power and fuel on short trips to school or supermarket.
Light trucks average only 20 miles a gallon of gas, while passenger cars average 28, yet the trucks have now taken over 40 percent of the domestic market, causing overall fleet mileage to decline. At the same time, more miles are being driven. Theresult is that automotive carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise.
But the prospects for raising the mileage standards are muddy at best, since Republican-sponsored legislation would prevent any such action.
The Administration is pinning many of its longer-term hopes on a collaboration between the Federal Government and the auto industry to develop, in the next decade, a prototype family-size car that would be three times as energy-efficient as today's.
There is wide agreement that it is critical to invest now in research and development along a broad front, including eventual alternatives to fossil fuels, before the next long-term investment cycles lock in obsolete technology.
In the case of the hoped-for "super car," some environmentalists note that the industry has not yet committed itself explicitly to producing any of the new vehicles. They say the project is an industry ploy to delay taking meaningful action on emissions.
Mr. Gore disagreed, saying, "You can be certain that such a vehicle will be produced when the ability to make it is demonstrated." He said he had considerably more optimism about this project than about shorter-term efforts to reduce automotive emissions. The prototype should be ready within eight years, he said, "maybe before."
In the meantime, political skirmishing over climate change continues. Representative Rohrabacher said last summer that he assumed global warming "at best, to be unproven and, at worst, to be liberal claptrap, trendy but soon to go out of style in our Newt Congress."
In recent interviews, he said that after reading and hearing more about global warming, "I'm now even more inclined to think it's liberal claptrap," adding that "far too many people in the Government and media are far too willing to listen to and amplify any claim of doom by someone who's wearing a white coat."
For his part, Mr. Gore said of the effort to reduce emissions that nobody "is under any illusions about how tough this is going to be."
"It's at the outer boundary of what is possible in our world," he added, "but it is possible." As the evidence of climate change "inexorably accumulates," he predicted, "the degree of difficulty in getting support for effective responses will decline."
 
The Air in 2000
A future article will examine the looming effects on global warming posed by China, with its vast coal reserves and rapid economic growth.

Blue Chips Keep Climbing, But Nasdaq Is Down Again
A rally in bonds helped to lift the Dow Jones industrial average to another record-breaking advance; it surged 22.04 points, to 5,070.88, its 63d record close for 1995. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.35 points, to 601.32, barely surpassing the record of 600.24 set last Tuesday. But the Nasdaq index continued to lag the blue-chip rally, easing 0.85 point, to 1,029.32. [Page D10.]
 
Bonds rose on reports of sluggish weekend retail sales and yesterday's report that sales of existing homes fell in October. [D17.]
 
Concerns About Intel's Sales
Intel's stock fell $3 a share, to $60, after a disclosure that a large customer could not pay its $470 million account and that Intel had converted part of that bill into a loan. Analysts grew concerned that slow sales by the client, believed to be Packard Bell, could hurt Intel's results. [D2.]
 
Home Resales Stop Rising
Sales of previously owned homes slipped 1.9 percent in October, the first drop in six months, the National Association of Realtors said. Still, October was the third consecutive month that sales remained at an annual rate of more than four million. Trade-up buyers are re-entering the market, which has recently been dominated by first-time buyers, the association said. [D2.]
 
Emissions Goal Is Slipping
The United States is faltering in efforts to cut emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, as it has pledged to do. Progress is being made in some areas, like energy-efficient lighting in office buildings, but there is backsliding elsewhere, such as in the fuel efficiency of sport utility vehicles. [A1.]
 
The Mark Falls on Rate Speculation
The dollar rose to a seven-week high against the German mark, aided by speculation that Germany's central bank would soon lower interest rates. [D9.]
 
Single Currency, Many Squabbles
A meeting of European finance ministers showed that, though the European Union is moving toward the creation of a single currency, the process will be fraught with backbiting and squabbles. [D7.]
 
Former Tobacco Executive Silenced
A judge maintained a temporary restraining order barring a former Brown & Williamson executive from disclosing corporate secrets. The executive, Jeffrey Wigand, has been at the center of a controversy since "60 Minutes" canceled an interview with him. [A20.]
 
Exclusive Pact Ending for Prudential
The American Association of Retired Persons plans to end its exclusive arrangement with Prudential Insurance when the pact expires. Prudential's 5.6 million association clients account for more than a third of its customers for health insurance. [D4.]
 
A G.M. Strategy Is Vindicated
To stem the erosion of sales in California, General Motors initiated a "value pricing" strategy in 1993. G.M. says the approach has helped to raise its market share in California to nearly 23 percent. [D4.]
 
Starting a New Studio
Mike Medavoy, the former chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, said he would form a new entertainment company with Sony Pictures and two other backers. [D8.]
 
Time for Action on Losing Stocks
Investors with long-term losses in their portfolios might want to dump those stocks this year. Or, to take advantage of a tax maneuver, today may be a good day to buy more shares if they think those losing stocks will rise. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D10.]

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Wake for Slain Child Is a Forum of Grief, Shock and Rage

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
They waited in line for an hour, sometimes longer, their anger palpable just beneath their grief. They formed a battalion of women, mothers from Bushwick, Brownsville and Manhattan.
Few of them knew 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, who was beaten to death last week, but they came to her wake anyway, a crowd 300 people strong, in an unorchestrated gesture of grief and outrage. 
 In a city where the deaths of abused children are not uncommon, Elisa's pain seemed somehow to overwhelm people -- and it seemed to affect most deeply the mothers of New York's poorer neighborhoods, who know just how difficult raising children in the inner city can be.
With their sons and daughters in tow yesterday, they raged against neighbors who heard but did not act, a family who knew but could not help, and a system that they said ignored telltale signs of a deeply troubled home life.
Many of those at the wake had themselves felt the pain of drug addiction, unemployment and domestic violence. But as mothers, they could not forgive -- or even comprehend -- what is said to have occurred in Awilda Lopez's home last week. Ms. Lopez is charged with murdering Alisa, her third oldest child.
"How can a mother kill her daughter?" asked Carmen Delgado, whose own son was shot to death on the streets. "I have a daughter myself and it's wrong, just wrong."
As they filed past the small coffin at the Ponce Funeral Home in Bushwick, Brooklyn, most of the mothers wept with little restraint; some of them gasped. Elisa Izquierdo lay with her white frilly dress, white stockings and white shoes, her face heavily made up to cover the bruises on her skin. Behind her a Barbie doll rested on the coffin's satin cover. A pile of stuffed animals, brown, white and black, spilled over the sides, resting playfully on Elisa's legs.
After walking by Elisa in her coffin, Carmen Luna held back her tears and spoke about the child's tug on the community of mothers. "No one here knows her, but she's like my little girl," Ms. Luna said. "She's everyone's little girl today."
Keisha Causell, who came all the way from Brownsville to get a glimpse of Elisa, reserved her harshest words for the child welfare system that was in charge of monitoring the Lopez family. She asked: "How many kids have to be returned to their family only to wind up here? She's just another file to them, not a human."
The system, Ms. Causell said, is broken and it should not have taken Elisa's battered body to fix it. "I know that and I don't have a Ph.D. or nothing," she said.
Others were there as testament to their own hurt and strength. Sandra Reyes said she also battled with drug addiction and lost her children for nearly two years. But with help from her mother and through her own determination the Bushwick mother got her life in order. "I felt her pain," she said, referring to Ms. Lopez. "But there is always a way for you to get out of whatever situation you are in." And where, she asked, was her family?
Friends and relatives also crowded the room through the night. Barbara Simmons, Elisa's teacher from the Y.W.C.A., came from Georgia, shattered by the news that her favorite student had been killed. She walked into the funeral home unprepared to see Elisa's frail body laid out. "She's not the flower I once knew so well," Ms. Simmons said, choking back her tears.
Relatives of Gustavo Izquierdo, who had cared for Elisa until his death, said they want Elisa to be buried with her father and were trying to resolve that with Ms. Lopez's family. "He loved her so much," said Maria Crespo, a friend of Mr. Izquierdo's.
But in the viewing room and the lobby, Mr. Izquierdo's family and co-workers kept to themselves, maintaining their distance from Ms. Lopez's family, who they said shared the blame for Elisa's death. Yet they, too, were full of regret that they had not been able to save her.
"I tried and I failed," said Elsa Canizares, who had attempted to get custody of Alisa after her father's death. "I tried but I failed."
While family and friends mourned inside, the women continued to arrive outside. They were unshakable in their belief that no crime is worse than the crime of a mother against her own child. "I have eight kids and I would never do anything like that to them," said Sandra Rosario, of Bushwick. "No matter how high she was on drugs, she knew what she was doing. The poor little innocent. A child like that has no devil inside her. The mother is the one with the devil inside."

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: IN BELGRADE;
The Serb's Hopes Rise As the Sanctions Fall

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 27

 BODY:
He started with a dream and a whisk, stirring the ingredients himself in a metal pot to make ketchup on a two-burner electric stove.
Now, three and a half years later, 41-year old Vojin Starcevic owns Polimark, a company that has 65 employees working in three shifts, seven days a week, producing 3.5 tons of ketchup a day on modern machines. 
 Polimark's dramatic growth is even more remarkable because it came while Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, was subject to economic sanctions.
The lifting of the sanctions by the United Nations Security Council last week should reduce Polimark's costs. Both tomato concentrate and the ingredients to make plastic bottles can now be legally imported, thus eliminating the bribes Mr. Starcevic said he has had to pay to get them into the country. And Mr. Starcevic dreams of exporting his ketchup, which he could not do under the sanctions.
But lifting the sanctions has created some paradoxes. Polimark, which took advantage of the monopoly market at home created by the sanctions, faces competition from European and American companies that can now come back.
"We are apprehensive," said Radovan Cokic, Polimark's marketing director. "But I would call that creative apprehension."
The sanctions on Yugoslavia went into effect in May 1992 -- one month after Mr. Starcevic started his company. They were lifted after the signing of the Balkan peace agreement in Dayton. The Yugoslav Government quickly announced a series of economic measures intended to make the economy more market-oriented. But many powerful politicians do not share Mr. Starcevic's entrepreneurial spirit, finding it easier to make money under the old socialist system.
At first glance, this country does not appear to have suffered undue hardship under sanctions. "We managed to live better under sanctions than most people do without them," said Ljubila Depeljkovic, 60, walking across the grass at her high-rise apartment complex, where boys were playing basketball.
Shops in downtown Belgrade are well stocked with fashionable clothes, food, computers and electronics equipment. People generally did not have to sell their possessions to get money, or to burn their books to heat their apartments, as they have, for example, in struggling Armenia in recent winters.
But everything is relative. Yugoslavs remember the days when they went to Italy to shop. And while consumer goods were smuggled in while the sanctions were on, selection was limited and the prices were high, especially for people without wages because the sanctions had shut down the factories where they worked.
Electricity was rationed. One young man said that often meant he could not read at night. And when Lijlana Mantrak took her newborn son home from the hospital last winter, it was 60 degrees in her apartment, she remembered, as she pushed him in a stroller bundled against the bitter cold.
In another paradox, the end of sanctions has brought lines -- not because of shortages, but because of plenty.
On each of the last two days, drivers have waited patiently in mile-long lines at gas stations. While sanctions were in effect, the stations were closed. Drivers bought gas from roadside vendors who had smuggled it into the country. They sold it at high prices, often after diluting it with water.That gasoline ruined many a car engine.
In addition to giving companies like Polimark a market opportunity, sanctions had another side effect. Many inefficient state-owned companies that were remnants of the system in operation before the breakup of the former Communist state have been driven to near-death. Before the sanctions were imposed, these state-owned companies accounted for about 90 percent of the gross domestic product; today, they account for about 60 percent, said Miroljub Labus, an economics professor at the University of Belgrade.
The measures announced by the Yugoslav Central Bank to stimulate the economy after the sanctions were lifted eased restrictions on imports and exports. They also devalued the dinar, the Yugoslav unit of currency, from one dinar to one German mark to three to one, close to the market rate. Almost overnight, that has put black-market currency vendors out of business.
An editorial cartoon on Monday in Nasa Borba, an independent Belgrade daily, showed the governor of the Central Bank in a small car towing a bus that was trying to go in the opposite direction. The bus carried several politicians, including Mira Markovic, wife of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. The cartoon indicated that the battered bus with flat tires had been headed toward Mongolia, considered a symbol of austere Communism.
Many Serbian politicians remain wedded to the past system, though, for political reasons and private economic ones.
Managers of state-owned companies owe their loyalty to the politicians who gave them their jobs. And the state-owned companies, even though grossly inefficient, get money from the state, which politicians siphon off for their own ventures.
Ms. Markovic has spoken publicly against privatization, and the Central Bank's economic package does not even mention privatization of the state-owned companies.
While he said that the economic program was a step in the right direction, Mr. Labus, the economics professor, added, "Our real problem lies with the state enterprises, and that has not been addressed at all."
The contrast between state and private industries is starkly visible at Polimark. It has leased space at Jugostroj, a state-owned manufacturer of refrigerated display units.
"Look at this," said Nikola Cicic, an engineer for 32 years with Jugostroj, as he pointed to display cases rusting in an open-sided shed adjacent to Polimark's spotless factory.
"Jugostroj is owned by the state so nobody cares," he said
Before sanctions, when Jugostroj was operating at full capacity, it had 1,100 employees, but only 500 were actually necessary, Mr. Cicic said. Sanctions have reduced production to a fraction of what it was, but there are still 700 employees, many of whom come in, get a company supplied breakfast, and then leave, he said.
As Mr. Starcevic, Polimark's owner, took a visitor on a tour of his factory -- after having him put on a spanking-clean white smock -- Mr. Cicic noticed how nicely Mr. Starcevic treated the workers. "He knows he depends on their willingness to work," Mr. Cicic said. And they must work to get paid.
Mr. Starevic once worked for a state-owned company that produced automobile tires. How did he go from that to making ketchup?
"Don't you believe in dreams? he said.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Fed Chooses No. 2 To Be Its Chief

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank today named Jack Guynn, its vice president and chief operating officer, to be its president and chief executive. The appointment ends a months-long search after the current president, Robert P. Forrestal, announced his retirement.
At a news conference where his appointment was announced, Mr. Guynn, 52, said the Fed's top priority must be fighting inflation. He added that while inflation had slowed during the last 15 years, it should be slowed further. 
 Mr. Forrestal will step down on Jan. 1 some 10 months before he turns 65, the mandatory retirement age for Fed presidents. Mr. Forrestal is capping a 12-year career as one of the nation's regional Fed presidents.
Mr. Guynn had been a leading candidate for the Atlanta Fed post, although Sheila Tschinkel, a senior vice president and director of research at the Fed branch, had been cited as a strong contender by some.
While Mr. Guynn expressed satisfaction with the 2.9 percent yearly inflation rate during the first 10 months of this year -- the same pace as the two earlier years -- he said he would like to see even smaller price increases.
"My main emphasis is on price stability," Mr. Guynn said. "Price stability is that point when price issues don't get in the way of basic business development."
Mr. Guynn said there was little chance of a rising wage-price spiral because scattered labor shortages earlier this year had dwindled.
Also, inflation may be even slower than it appears, he said.
The Atlanta branch is headquarters for the Federal Reserve Bank's sixth district covering Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana.

HEADLINE: HAITI ACCUSES U.S. OF HOLDING DATA RECOVERED BY G.I.'S

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 27

 BODY:
After landing in Haiti last year, American troops seized more than 150,000 pages of documents from the headquarters of the Haitian Armed Forces and the country's most feared paramilitary group. Now the Haitian Government wants the records back and accuses Washington of stalling.
The issue is becoming an increasingly sore point in relations between the two countries. 
 Haitian officials say the return of the documents is indispensable to their efforts to restore political stability in the country by disarming and prosecuting human rights violators connected with the former military rulers in Port-au-Prince.
American officials are divided over whether the Aristide Government is legally entitled to the documents, officials in Washington said today. The Pentagon insists that the documents belonged to the ousted military rulers, not the Aristide Government, and became American property when United States troops seized them last year.
The dispute over the documents has surfaced during a time of growing discord in relations between the Clinton Administration and Mr. Aristide. Advisers to the Haitian leader said he regarded Washington's unwillingness to return the records as one of the main causes of his Government's inability to halt a wave of violence, crime and political killings.
In a fiery, tearful speech Nov. 11 at the funeral of a cousin and close political associate who was slain by gunmen who have not been identified, Mr. Aristide criticized the United States and the United Nations for failing to disarm the remnants of paramilitary groups.
For their part, American policymakers have expressed concern that Mr. Aristide may choose to remain in office for three more years instead of stepping down in February, as he had pledged earlier.
Relations between the two countries have also been strained recently by Mr. Aristide's failure to carry out promised economic reforms, like privatization of state-owned companies, and the subsequent suspension of American economic aid.
The exact contents and size of the collection of seized documents have never been disclosed. But Haitian officials said the records are likely to contain data about the finances, membership and criminal activities of the Haitian Armed Forces and the paramilitary groups it supported, as well as information about the location of arms caches the Aristide Government says have been hidden around the country.
"The United States is not sharing the intelligence it has, and that is very frustrating," an adviser to Mr. Aristide complained earlier.
The United States, Haitian officials have charged, has been unwilling to hand over the papers because it fears the disclosure of information that is likely to embarrass American intelligence agencies.
In the past, American intelligence agencies have voiced suspicions of Mr. Aristide and have nurtured ties with the Armed Forces high command that overthrew the Haitian president in September 1991. One famous but now discredited Central Intelligence Agency report, apparently based on misinformation supplied by the Haitian military, described Mr. Aristide as mentally unstable and dependent on mood-altering antidepressant drugs.
Haitian Government officials and foreign diplomats said the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince does not appear to be opposed to handing over the papers and has in fact lobbied to secure their return in hopes of defusing the tension. The resistance to the turnover, those officials said, is coming mostly from Washington -- in particular, the Pentagon and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Administration officials express concern that the Aristide Government, or at least its more extreme supporters, might seek reprisals against supporters of the military rulers listed in the documents.
"I understand their impatience, but on the other hand there's a big volume of material," a senior State Department official said. "I don't think we're trying to stall."
Mr. Aristide's chief of staff, Leslie Voltaire, estimated that American troops seized more than 100,000 pages of documents from military headquarters shortly after they landed on Sept. 19, 1994. Other officials said that an American military raid on the headquarters of the main paramilitary group -- the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, or Fraph, -- on Oct. 3, 1994 netted an additional 60,000 pages.
Almost as soon as it was founded in 1993, Fraph became the most brutal and infamous of many Haiti's paramilitary groups, which are believed to have been organized, directed and financed by the Haitian Armed Forces. Human rights groups have estimated that at least 3,000 people were killed during Mr. Aristide's three years in exile and blame Fraph for many of those deaths as well as for thousands of other incidents of rape, torture, and arson.
After the October 1994 raid, American soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division told of finding gory "trophy photographs" pasted on the walls of the Fraph headquarters showing members of the group with the people they were killing or torturing.
Haitian prosecutors said they regard the 60,000 pages of Fraph documents as essential in building a criminal case against the group's founder, Emmanuel (Toto) Constant, who fled the country after the arrival of American forces and made his way, under circumstances that are still unclear, to the United States, where he was eventually apprehended. An immigration judge in Baltimore recently ordered Mr. Constant deported, but his lawyers are appealing that decision.
During Fraph's reign of terror, Mr. Constant, a former diplomat whose father was army commander during the dictatorship of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, often boasted of links to American intelligence agencies. According to press reports published shortly after the American invasion, Mr. Constant had earlier been a paid informant for the C.I.A. and was urged by the D.I.A. to engage in intelligence activities against Mr. Aristide.
An American official said "there may be legitimate national security reasons for withholding" the documents and expressed concern that their release could "encourage violence" in Haiti. Given the lack of an effective police force and the scheduled withdrawal of United Nations troops in February, there is a danger "these documents might be used to target people" in acts of vigilante justice, he contended.
Haitian Government officials said they learned of the existence of the Fraph documents only indirectly, as the result of a suit filed in the United States by a woman who had been mutilated in an attack by paramilitary units. Responding to a request for information that might relate to the case, an American Government lawyer disclosed the existence of the 60,000 pages.
"No one has ever offered an explanation for why the documents were taken out of the country," said Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who handles legal matters for the Aristide Government in the United States. "Obviously the faster they are returned, the more they can be useful in tracking down people who still maintain weapons and are now attempting to destabilize the Government."
 
47 Haitians Drown at Sea
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 27 (AP) -- As Haitians resumed risky sea voyages to reach American shores, 47 drowned off the north coast of Haiti, Radio Metropole reported today.
The private station said all those aboard a sailboat drowned Friday night when it capsized in the channel between Port-de-Paix and La Tortue Island in a storm.
Seven bodies were found washed up on a La Tortue beach, and 40 other people were presumed drowned, the station reported.
The refugees were to have boarded a larger craft bound for Florida.
United States Coast Guard cutters have intercepted and repatriated a growing number of Haitians in the last two months.
Coast Guard officials say the flood of Haitian refugees slowed after President Aristide returned a year ago. A recent resurgence was blamed on the country's failure to achieve economic recovery.

Clinton's Words on Mission to Bosnia: 'The Right Thing to Do'

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's remarks on Bosnia tonight, as recorded by The New York Times. 
 Good evening. Last week the warring factions in Bosnia reached a peace agreement as a result of our efforts in Dayton, Ohio, and the support of our European and Russian partners. Tonight I want to speak with you about implementing the Bosnian peace agreement and why our values and interest as Americans require that we participate.
Let me say at the outset, America's role will not be about fighting a war. It will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace agreement. Our mission will be limited, focused and under the command of an American general. In fulfilling this mission, we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians, especially children, and at the same time to bring stability to central Europe, a region of the world that is vital to our national interests. It is the right thing to do.
From our birth, America has always been more than just a place. America has embodied an idea that has become the ideal for billions of people throughout the world. Our founders said it best: America is about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
In this century, especially, America has done more than simply stand for these ideals, we have acted on them and sacrificed for them. Our people fought two world wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny. After World War I we pulled back from the world, leaving a vacuum that was filled with the forces of hatred. After World War II we continued to lead the world. We made the commitments that kept the peace, that helped to spread democracy, that created unparalleled prosperity. And that brought victory in the cold war.
Today, because of our dedication, America's ideals, liberty, democracy and peace, are more and more the aspirations of people everywhere in the world. It is the power of our ideas, even more than our size, our wealth and our military might, that makes America a uniquely trusted nation.
With the cold war over, some people now question the need for our continued active leadership in the world. They believe that, much like after World War I, America can now step back from the responsibilities of leadership. They argue that to be secure we need only to keep our own borders safe and that the time has come now to leave to others the hard work of leadership beyond our borders.
I strongly disagree.
As the cold war gives way to the global village, our leadership is needed more than ever because problems that start beyond our borders can quickly become problems within them. We're all vulnerable to the organized forces of intolerance and destruction, terrorism, ethnic, religious and regional rivalries, the spread of organized crime and weapons of mass destruction and drug trafficking. Just as surely as Fascism and Communism, these forces also threaten freedom and democracy, peace and prosperity. And they too demand American leadership.
But nowhere has the argument for our leadership been more clearly justified than in the struggle to stop or prevent war and civil violence. From Iraq to Haiti, from South Africa to Korea, from the Middle East to Northern Ireland, we have stood up for peace and freedom because it's in our interest to do so and because it is the right thing to do. Now that doesn't mean we can solve every problem.
My duty as President is to match the demands for American leadership to our strategic interests and to our ability to make a difference. America cannot and must not be the world's policeman. We cannot stop all war for all time but we can stop some wars. We cannot save all women and all children. But we can save many of them. We can't do everything, but we must do what we can. There are times and places where our leadership can mean the difference between peace and war and where we can defend our fundamental values as a people and serve our most basic strategic interests. My fellow Americans, in this new era there are still times when America and America alone can and should make the difference for peace.
The terrible war in Bosnia is such a case. Nowhere today is the need for American leadership more stark or more immediate than in Bosnia. For nearly four years a terrible war has torn Bosnia apart. Horrors we prayed had been banished from Europe forever have been seared into our minds again: skeletal prisoners caged behind barbed-wire fences, women and girls raped as a tool of war, defenseless men and boys shot down in the mass graves, evoking visions of World War II concentration camps, and endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair.
When I took office, some were urging immediate intervention in the conflict. I decided that American ground troops should not fight a war in Bosnia because the United States could not force peace on Bosnia's warring ethnic groups: the Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
Instead, America has worked with our European allies in searching for peace, stopping the war from spreading and easing the suffering of the Bosnian people. We imposed tough economic sanctions on Serbia. We used our air power to conduct the longest humanitarian airlift in history and to enforce a no-fly zone that took the war out of the skies. We helped to make peace between two of the three warring parties: the Muslims and the Croats.
But as the months of war turned into years, it became clear that Europe alone could not end the conflict. This summer, Bosnian Serb shelling once again turned Bosnia's playgrounds and marketplaces into killing fields.
In response the United States led NATO's heavy and continuous airstrikes, many of them flown by skilled and brave American pilots. Those airstrikes, together with the renewed determination of our European partners and the Bosnian and Croat gains on the battlefield, convinced the Serbs finally to start thinking about making peace.
At the same time, the United States initiated an intensive diplomatic effort that forged a Bosnia-wide cease-fire and got the parties to agree to the basic principles of peace. Three dedicated American diplomats: Bob Frasure, Joe Kruzel and Nelson Drew lost their lives in that effort. Tonight, we remember their sacrifice and that of their families. And we will never forget their exceptional service to our nation.
Finally, just three weeks ago, the Muslims, Croats and Serbs came to Dayton, Ohio, in America's heartland, to negotiate a settlement. There, exhausted by war, they made a commitment to peace. They agreed to put down their guns, to preserve Bosnia as a single state, to investigate and prosecute war criminals, to protect the human rights of all citizens, to try to build a peaceful, democratic future.
And they asked for America's help as they implement this peace agreement. America has a responsibility to answer that request, to help to turn this moment of hope into an enduring reality.
To do that, troops from our country and around the world would go into Bosnia to give them the confidence and support they need to implement their peace plan. I refuse to send American troops to fight a war in Bosnia, but I believe we must help to secure the Bosnian peace.
I want you to know tonight what is at stake, exactly what our troops will be asked to accomplish, and why we must carry out our responsibility to help implement the peace agreement. Implementing the agreement in Bosnia can end the terrible suffering of the people: the warfare, the mass executions, the ethnic cleansing, the campaigns of rape and terror. Let us never forget a quarter of a million men, women and children have been shelled, shot and tortured to death. Two million people -- half of the population -- were forced from their homes and into a miserable life as refugees. And these faceless numbers had millions of real personal tragedies, for each of the war's victims was a mother or daughter, father or son, a brother or sister.
Now the war is over. American leadership created the chance to build a peace and stop the suffering. Securing peace in Bosnia will also help to build a free and stable Europe. Bosnia lies at the very heart of Europe, next door to many of its fragile new democracies and some of our closest allies. Generations of Americans have understood that Europe's freedom and Europe's stability is vital to our own national security. That's why we fought two wars in Europe. That's why we launched the Marshall Plan to restore Europe. That's why we created NATO and waged the cold war. And that's why we must help the nations of Europe to end their worst nightmare since World War II now.
The only force capable of getting this job done is NATO, the powerful military alliance of democracies that has guaranteed our security for a half century now. And as NATO's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the mission. If we're not there, NATO will not be there. The peace will collapse, the war will reignite, the slaughter of innocents will begin again. A conflict that already has claimed so many victims, could spread like poison throughout the region, eat away at Europe's stability and erode our partnership with our European allies.
And America's commitment to leadership will be questioned, if we refuse to participate in implementing a peace agreement we brokered right here in the United States, especially since the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia all asked us to participate and all pledged their best efforts to the security of our troops.
When America's partnerships are weak and our leadership is in doubt it undermines our ability to secure our interests and to convince others to work with us. If we do maintain our partnerships and our leadership, we need not act alone. As we saw in the gulf war and in Haiti, many other nations who share our goals will also share our burdens. But when America does not lead the consequences can be very grave, not only for others but eventually for us as well.
As I speak to you, NATO is completing its planning for IFOR, an international force for peace in Bosnia of about 60,000 troops. Already more than 25 other nations, including our major NATO allies, have pledged to take part. They will contribute about two-thirds of the total implementation force, some 40,000 troops. The United States will contribute the rest, about 20,000 soldiers. Later this week, the final NATO plan will be submitted to me for review and approval. Let me make clear what I expect it to include and what it must include for me to give final approval to the participation of our armed forces.
First, the mission will be precisely defined with clear realistic goals that can be achieved in a definite period of time. Our troops will make sure that each side withdraws its forces behind the front lines and keeps them there. They will maintain the cease-fire to prevent the war from accidentally starting again. These efforts in turn will help to create a secure environment so that the people of Bosnia can return to their homes, vote in free elections and begin to rebuild their lives. Our Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that this mission should and will take about one year.
Second, the risks to our troops will be minimized. American troops will take their orders from the American general who commands NATO. They will be heavily armed and thoroughly trained. By making an overwhelming show of force they will lessen the need to use force. But unlike the U.N. forces they will have the authority to respond immediately and the training and equipment to respond with overwhelming force to any threat to their own safety or any violations of the military provisions of the peace agreement.
If the NATO plan meets with my approval I will immediately send it to Congress and request its support. I will also authorize the participation of a small number of American troops in a NATO advance mission that will lay the groundwork for IFOR. Starting some time next week they will establish headquarters and set up the sophisticated communications systems that must be in place before NATO could send in its troops, tanks and trucks to Bosnia.
The implementation force itself would begin deploying in Bosnia in the days following the formal signature of the peace agreement in mid-December. The international community will help to implement arms control provisions of the agreement so that future hostilities are less likely and armaments are limited while the world community, the United States and others, will also make sure that the Bosnian Federation has the means to defend itself once IFOR withdraws. IFOR will not be a part of this effort.
Civilian agencies from around the world will begin a separate program of humanitarian relief and reconstruction, principally paid for by our European allies and other interested countries. This effort is also absolutely essential to making the peace endure. It will bring the people of Bosnia the food, shelter, clothing and medicine so many have been denied for so long. It will help them to rebuild, to rebuild their roads and schools, their power plants and hospitals, their factories and shops. It will reunite children with their parents and families with their homes.
It will allow the Bosnians freely to choose their own leaders. It will give all the people of Bosnia a much greater stake in peace than war so that peace takes on a life and a logic of its own.
In Bosnia we can and will succeed because our mission is clear and limited and our troops are strong and very well prepared. But, my fellow Americans, no deployment of American troops is risk-free and this one may well involve casualties. There may be accidents in the field or incidents with people who have not given up their hatred. I will take every measure possible to minimize these risks but we must be prepared for that possibility.
As President my most difficult duty is to put the men and women who volunteered to serve our nation in harm's way when our interest and values demand it. I assume full responsibility for any harm that may come to them. But anyone contemplating any action that would endanger our troops should know this: America protects its own. Anyone -- anyone -- who takes on our troops will suffer the consequences. We will fight fire with fire, and then some.
After so much bloodshed and loss, after so many outrageous acts of inhuman brutality, it will take an extraordinary effort of will for the people of Bosnia to pull themselves from their past and start building a future of peace. But with our leadership and the commitment of our allies the people of Bosnia can have the chance to decide their future in peace. They have a chance to remind the world that just a few short years ago the mosques and churches of Sarajevo were a shining symbol of multiethnic tolerance, that Bosnia once found unity in its diversity. Indeed, the cemetery in the center of the city was just a few short years ago, the magnificent stadium which hosted the Olympics, our universal symbol of peace and harmony.
Bosnia can be that kind of place again. We must not turn our backs on Bosnia now.
And so I ask all Americans, and I ask every member of Congress -- Democrat and Republican alike -- to make the choice for peace. In the choice between peace and war, America must choose peace.
My fellow Americans, I ask you to think just for a moment about this century that is drawing to close and the new one that will soon begin. Because previous generations of Americans stood up for freedom and because we continue to do so, the American people are more secure and more prosperous. And all around the world more people than ever before live in freedom. More people than ever before are treated with dignity. More people than ever before can hope to build a better life. That is what America's leadership is all about.
We know that these are the blessings of freedom and America has always been freedom's greatest champion. If we continue to do everything we can to share these blessings with people around the world, if we continue to be leaders for peace, then the next century can be the greatest time our nation has ever known.
A few weeks ago, I was privileged to spend some time with His Holiness John Paul II when he came to America. At the very end of our meeting, the Pope looked at me and said, "I have lived through most of this century. I remember that it began with a war in Sarajevo. Mr. President, you must not let it end with a war in Sarajevo."
In Bosnia this terrible war has challenged our interests and troubled our souls. Thankfully we can do something about it. I say again, our mission will be clear, limited and achievable. The people of Bosnia, our NATO allies and people all around the world are now looking to America for leadership. So let us lead. That is our responsibility as Americans.
Good night and God bless America.

Prices of Treasury Issues Higher in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged higher in quiet trading yesterday after a report showed sluggish home sales last month.
Prices rose in early trading after the National Association of Realtors, an industry trade group, said that the number of previously owned homes sold last month fell 1.9 percent, to an annual rate of 4.07 million, the first decline in six months and less than the expected annual rate of 4.15 million. 
 Evidence that the economy is faltering increases the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates sooner rather than later, traders and analysts said.
"The more weak numbers we get, the more arguments" in favor of an interest rate cut when Fed policy makers meet in December, said Garth Nisbet, who manages $1 billion of bonds at Crabbe Huson Group in Portland, Ore.
Treasury prices were also bolstered by signs that this year's holiday shopping season got off to a slow start over the weekend.
"If we get indications that sales are no better than last year, it will be good for bonds," said Zane Brown, who oversees $10 billion of bond funds at Lord Abbett & Company in New York.
The International Council of Shopping Centers said sales rose 5.8 percent on Friday, smaller than last year's 9 percent gain. And Telecheck Services Inc. of Houston, a check-acceptance company, said Friday's same-store retail check sales fell 4.8 percent.
Bond investors watch consumer spending because it drives about two-thirds of the nation's economy. Slower spending would suggest a lesser threat of accelerating inflation, which erodes the value of bonds' fixed payments.
A weakening economy could also spur the Fed to lower interest rates in an effort to keep the country from sliding into a recession.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32 , to 10822/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.22 percent, from 6.24 percent on Friday.
Prices of shorter-term maturities also rose, driving the yield of the two-year note down to 5.45 percent from 5.47 percent, and the yield of the 10-year note down to 5.87 percent from 5.90 percent.
Some market participants had expected prices to fall yesterday because of the amount of new supply coming to market this week. Today, the Treasury will auction $18.25 billion of two-year notes. The Treasury will auction $12 billion of five-year notes tomorrow.
Yesterday, at the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, rates were mixed. The Treasury sold $14.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.36 percent, up from 5.29 percent last week, and $14.7 billion of six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.29 percent, down from 5.31 percent. The three-month bill rate was the highest since 5.43 percent on Aug. 21. The six-month bill rate was the lowest since 5.27 percent on Sept. 25.
In the corporate bond market, trading was slow yesterday, but several companies began marketing debt deals.
Martin Marietta Materials, which is 81 percent owned by the Lockheed Martin Corporation, plans to raise at least $125 million by selling 30-year securities in its first sale of public debt.
The company joins a growing list of borrowers who tapped the corporate bond market for the first time this month, including ITT Destinations Inc., Foster Brewing Group Ltd. of Australia and the Dover Corporation.
Companies selling bonds today can lock in rates that are almost two percentage points lower than if they borrowed a year ago at the same yield premium, or spread.
In another deal, Time Warner Capital I, a financing unit of Time Warner Inc. is planning to sell $250 million of securities that combine features of preferred stock and debt later this week.
In the municipal market, the California School Cash Reserve Authority sold $70 million revenue notes yesterday.
The notes were priced to yield 3.8 percent for securities maturing Dec. 20, 1996. For an investor in the 31 percent tax bracket, the notes have a yield equivalent to 5.51 percent, once Federal taxes are taken into consideration.
Proceeds from the sale will be used by 125 school and community college districts in California to meet their cash flow needs.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: With a European Currency, The Currency Is Conflict

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Though Europe is moving toward creating a single currency sometime around the end of the century, the path will be fraught with dispute, backbiting and squabbling.
That was plainly demonstrated at an important meeting of European finance ministers here today. Representatives of the Continent's two biggest economic powers, Germany and France, bickered for much of the day over procedural issues and tried to win support for their positions from other Governments of the European Union. 
 The issues debated included which economic figures were reliable to show whether a country qualified for participation in the single-currency arrangement, how quickly national debt should be issued in the new currency, how soon to make the new currency legal tender, and how soon European leaders should decide who would be the first nations to join in the common currency.
And almost invariably, France and Germany were at odds.
But despite the disagreements, officials were optimistic that in Madrid next month, the leaders of the 15 European Union countries would be able to sign perhaps the most important economic accord since the Maastricht treaty of 1992, an agreement that clears the way for the creation of the first stage of a new currency on Jan. 1, 1999.
"There are some issues that are not resolved, but we are in a position to take a package to Madrid for approval by heads of state where the final issues will be resolved," Finance Minister Pedro Solbes of Spain said at a news conference.
While there are skeptics, including those who think that Germany will pull out at the last minute, not wanting to give up the mark, officials of European Governments are doing more than just putting down agreements on paper for such a currency. Many are making painful cuts in their budget deficits to meet a tough set of economic-performance criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty.
The two most rigorous standards require a country to have a budget deficit of less than 3 percent of its gross domestic product by the end of 1997 and total debt not exceeding 60 percent of G.D.P. Only Germany and Luxembourg now meet those criteria, but almost a half-dozen other countries are expected to bring down their deficits over the next two years to qualify.
Most economists agree that without German and French involvement, a European currency would be meaningless. The two together would create a big economic market -- one that could draw in Britain, which is skeptical about giving up the pound, as well as other European countries. Eventually, it is envisaged, a monetary bloc roughly equal to the United States would emerge.
But between now and 2002, the projected date when the new bank notes could be in full use and old national currencies no longer accepted as legal, there will be plenty of moments that can weaken and slow the process.
Today was one such time. France, for instance, wanted a decision on which countries qualified for monetary union at the end of 1997, using projections for debt levels that year. Germany wanted to delay the decision until early in 1998 to have confirmed figures on 1997 economic performance.
In addition, France wanted countries that will use the single currency to begin issuing all debt in that new currency as of early 1999. Germany wanted that decision left to the individual governments. Both disputes were put off, to be decided by the heads of government in Madrid over the weekend of Dec. 16.
A big decision in Madrid will be the name of the new currency. Though the French want the name ECU -- the current European Currency Unit, used in many accounts and already the issuance of some debt -- the Germans insist on Euro, a name its Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, floated in September when the finance ministers last met.
Delegates predicted that Germany would prevail in most of the disputes with France, including the dispute over the currency's name.
"I think Euro's won, even though it's a terrible name," a Brussels official said today.

HEADLINE: Remember the Nixon Doctrine

BYLINE: By James Webb; James Webb was an Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's insistence on putting 20,000 American troops into Bosnia should be seized on by national leaders, particularly those running for President, to force a long-overdue debate on the worldwide obligations of our military.
While the Balkan factions may be immersed in their struggle, and Europeans may feel threatened by it, for Americans it represents only one of many conflicts, real and potential, whose seriousness must be weighed, often against one another, before allowing a commitment of lives, resources and national energy. 
 Today, despite a few half-hearted attempts such as Gen. Colin Powell's "superior force doctrine," no clear set of principles exists as a touchstone for debate on these tradeoffs. Nor have any leaders of either party offered terms that provide an understandable global logic as to when our military should be committed to action. In short, we still lack a national security strategy that fits the post-cold-war era.
More than ever before, the United States has become the nation of choice when crises occur, large and small. At the same time, the size and location of our military forces are in flux. It is important to make our interests known to our citizens, our allies and even our potential adversaries, not just in Bosnia but around the world, so that commitments can be measured by something other than the pressures of interest groups and manipulation by the press. Furthermore, with alliances increasingly justified by power relationships similar to those that dominated before World War I, our military must be assured that the stakes of its missions are worth dying for.
Failing to provide these assurances is to continue the unremitting case-by-case debates, hampering our foreign policy on the one hand and on the other treating our military forces in some cases as mere bargaining chips. As the past few years demonstrate, this also causes us to fritter away our national resolve while arguing about military backwaters like Somalia and Haiti.
Given the President's proposal and the failure to this point of defining American stakes in Bosnia as immediate or nation-threatening, the coming weeks will offer a new round of such debates. The President appears tempted to follow the constitutionally questionable (albeit effective) approach used by the Bush Administration in the Persian Gulf war: putting troops in an area where no American forces have been threatened and no treaties demand their presence, then gaining international agreement before placing the issue before Congress.
Mr. Clinton said their mission would be "to supervise the separation of forces and to give them confidence that each side will live up to their agreements." This rationale reminds one of the ill-fated mission of the international force sent to Beirut in 1983. He has characterized the Bosnian mission as diplomatic in purpose, but promised, in his speech last night, to "fight fire with fire and then some" if American troops are threatened. This is a formula for confusion once a combat unit sent on a distinctly noncombat mission comes under repeated attack.
 We are told that other NATO countries will decline to send their own military forces to Bosnia unless the United States assumes a dominant role, which includes sizable combat support and naval forces backing it up. This calls to mind the decades of over-reliance by NATO members on American resources, and President Eisenhower's warning in October 1963 that the size and permanence of our military presence in Europe would "continue to discourage the development of the necessary military strength Western European countries should provide for themselves."
The Administration speaks of a "reasonable time for withdrawal," which if too short might tempt the parties to wait out the so-called peacekeepers and if too long might tempt certain elements to drive them out with attacks causing high casualties.
Sorting out the Administration's answers to such hesitations will take a great deal of time, attention and emotion. And doing so in the absence of a clearly stated global policy will encourage other nations, particularly the new power centers in Asia, to view the United States as becoming less committed to addressing their own security concerns. Many of these concerns are far more serious to long-term international stability and American interests. These include the continued threat of war on the Korean peninsula, the importance of the United States as a power broker where historical Chinese, Japanese and Russian interests collide and the need for military security to accompany trade and diplomacy in a dramatically changing region.
Asian cynicism gained further grist in the wake of the Administration's recent snubs of Japan: the President's cancellation of his summit meeting because of the budget crisis, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher's early return from a visit to Japan to watch over the Bosnian peace talks.
Asian leaders are becoming uneasy over an economically and militarily resurgent China that in recent years has become increasingly more aggressive. A perception that the United States is not paying attention to or is not worried about such long-term threats could in itself cause a major realignment in Asia. One cannot exclude even Japan, whose strong relationship with the United States has been severely tested of late, from this possibility.
Those who aspire to the Presidency in 1996 should use the coming debate to articulate a world view that would demonstrate to the world, as well as to Americans, an understanding of the uses and limitations -- in a sense the human budgeting -- of our military assets.
Richard Nixon was the last President to clearly define how and when the United States would commit forces overseas. In 1969, he declared that our military policy should follow three basic tenets:
Honor all treaty commitments in responding to those who invade the lands of our allies.
Provide a nuclear umbrella to the world against the threats of other nuclear powers.
Finally, provide weapons and technical assistance to other countries where warranted, but do not commit American forces to local conflicts.
These tenets, with some modification, are still the best foundation of our world leadership. They remove the United States from local conflicts and civil wars. The use of the American military to fulfill treaty obligations requires ratification by Congress, providing a hedge against the kind of Presidential discretion that might send forces into conflicts not in the national interest. Yet they provide clear authority for immediate action required to carry out policies that have been agreed upon by the Government as a whole.
Given the changes in the world, an additional tenet would also be desirable: The United States should respond vigorously against nuclear proliferation and state-sponsored terrorism.
These tenets would prevent the use of United States forces in commitments more appropriate to lesser powers while preserving our unique capabilities. Only the United States among the world's democracies can field large-scale maneuver forces, replete with strategic airlift, carrier battle groups and amphibious power projection.
Our military has no equal in countering conventional attacks on extremely short notice wherever the national interest dictates. Our bases in Japan give American forces the ability to react almost anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, just as the continued presence in Europe allows American units to react in Europe and the Middle East.
In proper form, this capability provides reassurance to potentially threatened nations everywhere. But despite the ease with which the American military seemingly operates on a daily basis, its assets are limited, as is the national willingness to put them at risk.
As the world moves toward new power centers and different security needs, it is more vital than ever that we state clearly the conditions under which American forces will be sent into harm's way. And we should be ever more chary of commitments, like the looming one in Bosnia, where combat units invite attack but are by the very nature of their mission not supposed to fight.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
In Europe, Philip Morris beats the drum against government regulations on smoking.

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
TRAVEL in an airplane, eat in a restaurant, go to a bar or a sporting event, and it's unmistakable. Europeans smoke more than Americans do.
Almost 100 million people on the Continent and in Britain spend $90 billion a year lighting up. Unlike the United States, where anti-smoking fever has made it unfashionable to smoke, Europe has far fewer restrictions -- public or private -- on smoking. What is referred to as "European tolerance" has so far prevailed. 
 Still, there are many attempts each year to regulate smoking in Europe, either by central or regional governments. And as in the United States, big tobacco interests fight these efforts aggressively.
They are led by Philip Morris Europe, a unit of the American tobacco giant. For the second time in seven months, the company has begun its own European blitz, buying full-page ads complaining about the threat to smokers from what it sees as excessive regulation.
In May, its ads in publications like The Financial Times, The Economist and The International Herald Tribune depicted street maps of Brussels, London and other big cities with tiny areas outlined. The ads warned, "The passion to regulate down to the finest detail of people's lives can lead to infringements of personal liberty."
Another message was that the Ten Commandments were expressed in 179 words and the United States Declaration of Independence required 300, but European regulations on smoking need 24,942.
More recently, Philip Morris, whose biggest-selling cigarettes in Europe are Marlboro, Chesterfield and L & M, has added more of a human touch. Last week, it began its second big campaign with full-page ads showing office workers standing in the rain on a street outside their building, lighting up. The caption reads, "What sort of policy forces these people outside?"
Philip Morris brings in nice, fuzzy words like "courtesy" and "consideration," suggesting that smokers and nonsmokers can work out their differences without government intervention. A similar campaign has been running in the United States.
While company officials in Europe say their campaign is aimed at the many attempts by governments to regulate smoking, the primary target seems to be the headquarters of the European Union here in Brussels.
European Union officials say it was no accident that the campaign began just as the organization's Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, was trying to organize support for banning almost all print and billboard advertising of cigarettes across the 15-country organization.
He cites figures that 500,000 Europeans lose their lives to "tobacco-related diseases" each year, and argues that passive smoking increases the risk of lung cancer among nonsmokers by 20 percent to 30 percent.
Since 1989, the European Union has banned television advertising of cigarettes and now Mr. Flynn wants to expand the rule to other forms of public advertising.
Mr. Flynn would like to see the ban approved on Thursday at a meeting of the health ministers of the European Union. But his aides say there is almost no chance of that happening, primarily because Germany, Britain and the Netherlands are opposed.
Officials at Mr. Flynn's office say the three countries oppose the ban because they all have big tobacco interests. Germany is the biggest maker of cigarettes in the European Union, while the Netherlands is the largest exporter of tobacco products and Britain is the home of some of the industry's giants.
But British officials say they are motivated by other reasons. They say that their country is among the strictest in the European Union in banning advertising and restricting smoking in public places, and that they do not see a total advertising ban as reducing consumption.
"The statistics simply show that the countries where there is the highest smoking-related illness rate are where cigarettes are cheapest," a British official said. "It's a correlation with the prices of cigarettes, not advertising. So you have to raise the duties."
The European countries where smoking seems most pervasive are often those where the bans on cigarette ads are the tightest. In Italy, France and Portugal, all ads are banned except indirect advertising, for products like Camel lighters and Marlboro brand clothing.
David I. Greenberg, vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris in Brussels, said more than 40 national and local laws "dictate where and when people can smoke," with many more being proposed each month.
The company says these range from bans on smoking on the beach at Damp, Germany, to a rule that workers in Solihull, England, not be able to take a cigarette break until they have been working for at least two and a half years, to a requirement that workers in Derby, England, not smoke in parks where they serve on maintenance crews.
"We think it's a modern-day horror story that a group of people is literally being banished and sent out into the cold," Mr. Greenberg said. "We believe there is more tolerance in Europe than that, and that is why we have begun to speak out."
Philip Morris officials declined to state the cost of the campaign, except to say that it was in the millions of dollars and that it was a small fraction of the company's overall advertising budget in Europe.
Mr. Greenberg advocates that smokers and nonsmokers work out their differences on the local level and points to the restaurant association of Madrid, which recently agreed with the City Council that all restaurants set aside 25 percent of their tables for nonsmokers.
But those minding Europe's purse strings may have economic reasons not to restrict smoking. Taxes on cigarettes account for an enormous amount of European governments' revenues. In 1993, for example, tobacco excise taxes represented 5 percent of all government revenue in Germany, and 6.2 percent in Greece. For the 12 countries that were then part of the European Union, tobacco taxes totaled 3.5 percent of government revenue.
Still, Mr. Flynn promises to fight for the advertising ban and against the message of the Philip Morris campaign.
"The public should not be misled by this publicity," he said in a statement last week. "The interests of smokers and nonsmokers are not equal. When a person chooses to smoke, they are not only harming their health but also the health of other people who are exposed to their smoking. Nonsmokers have every right to object to being exposed to such dangers."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises to a 7-Week High Against Mark on Rate-Cut Talk

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday to a seven-week high against the German mark, bolstered by new speculation that Germany's central bank would soon lower interest rates.
The dollar managed a small gain against the Japanese yen in light dealing, as many traders were still returning from last week's holidays in the United States and Japan. 
 "The main feature of the day is Deutsche mark weakness against everything," said Chris Iggo, an international economist with the Chase Manhattan Bank.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4360 marks, up from 1.4193 on Friday. The last time it was higher was Oct. 4, when the dollar touched a high of 1.444 marks.
It also rose to 101.71 Japanese yen from 101.41 yen, and to 1.1580 Swiss francs from 1.1437 francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5535 from $1.5595.
Speculation about a rate cut was spurred by fresh evidence of low inflation in Germany. The state of Bavaria reported that its consumer price index was unchanged in November, putting it up 1.5 percent for the year.
This was preceded by reports last week from other German states of little or no inflation. Speculation began then, and became the dominant theme yesterday, that the central bank would cut interest rates as early as Thursday's policy-setting meeting.
Central banks typically reduce rates to stimulate their economies, especially when there is little fear of a resurgence in inflation. Lower interest rates, however, make a country's assets less attractive, and traders become less likely to acquire that country's currency, which is needed to buy the assets.
"This whole issue about the German rate cut seems to be prevailing in the market," said Peggy Reed, a currency vice president at Credit Agricole.
The mark fell against all major European currencies and the yen in thin trading. It fell, as well, against a rallying Swedish krona after weekend reports that Sweden would join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. "It doesn't take a whole lot of volume to move it," Ms. Reed said.
Most of the dollar's action against the mark occurred in the period when the European and North American trading sessions overlap.
The dollar's upward move against the yen was blunted by yen-buying above 102 yen, Mr. Iggo of Chase Manhattan said, noting that there were no fundamental reasons for dollar-yen trading to go in either direction.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Sacrifice Of Hands, Heart And Soul

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
The politically and socially committed left-wing Group Theater did not survive long. Founded in 1931, it disbanded in 1940, but not before it had provided a kind of prewar staging area for some of the American theater's most militant talents. Among them: Elia Kazan, John (then Jules) Garfield, Luther Adler, Robert Lewis, Martin Ritt, Howard da Silva and Lee J. Cobb.
All of these and others appeared as actors in "Golden Boy," the 1937 Clifford Odets play, which under the direction of Harold Clurman became one of the Group's most successful productions. It's still an effective piece, at least to read: a visceral and gritty tale of a poor but gifted young violinist, Joe Bonaparte, who sells out a promising career in music to get fame as a boxer, as well as fortune and a fancy Duesenberg. 
 "Golden Boy" was less overtly political than most of the Group's projects. For all of its realistic details, it takes a rather romantic view of social despair. Yet it's a fascinating artifact both of the Group's work and Broadway theater during the Depression. As Clurman noted years later, it's also prescient in the way it predicts the arc of Odets's declining career after he went to Hollywood.
These are probably the most cogent reasons to see the Blue Light Theater Company's earnest revival, which opened last night at the 45th Street Theater, the usual home of Primary Stages. Under the direction of Joanne Woodward, the production itself has a lot of shaking down to do before it acquires a living, breathing identity of its own. The elements are there, but time is limited. The run ends Dec. 16.
"Golden Boy" is a big play in three acts (played in two here) and 12 scenes with 19 characters, though in the mid-30's even the economically pressed Group Theater could manage the financing. It's dated but in the best sense: watching it is like rediscovering the manners, obsessions and locutions of our theater's past. Yet unless the director can find a decisive, coherent style for it, the drama remains distant and unnecessarily archaic. Today's audience is part of the problem. As movies and television have usurped the kind of linear narratives that once were commonplace on Broadway, we expect live theater to be more condensed, less realistic, more intense and less banal. Among the more interesting aspects of this revival is that Odets's so-called realistic speech seems to have aged less well than his big, poetic outbursts, which used to be so enthusiastically parodied.
"Hallelujah!" Joe Bonaparte (Greg Naughton) exults after winning a crucial fight but breaking his hand. "It's the beginning of the world!" Also surprisingly affecting today is a park scene in which Joe and Lorna Moon (Angie Phillips), the sad, self-described "tramp from Newark," declare their love. It's the sort of poetic moment that once was obligatory in such prole theater. Yet as Odets wrote it, the scene is more dramatically effective than those depicting the fight racket and Joe's uneasy relations with his immigrant father (Spiro Malas).
"Golden Boy" fits gracefully onto the small, narrow stage at the 45th Street Theater, though the scenic design might benefit by being even more minimal than it is. Scenery is not the point of this production; the play and its performers are. There's no need for the high, center-stage platform that sometimes passes for the ring in the gym where Joe works out. It just clutters up the movement.
A standout in the large cast is Ms. Phillips in the role originally played on Broadway by Frances Farmer. Though she looks more like a Manhattan post-debutante than a refugee from Newark, she acts Lorna with a melancholy and fragile toughness that perfectly evokes the romantic tone of the play.
Mr. Naughton, a lithe young actor, seems actually to grow in heft within the performance as Joe transforms himself from musician to contender. Also very effective are James Naughton (Greg Naughton's father), as Tom Moody, Joe's married manager, who keeps Lorna on the side; Joe Grifasi as Tokio, Joe's trainer; Lee Wilkof as Tom Moody's partner, and Bruce MacVittie as Eddie Fuseli, the gangster who buys a piece of Joe's contract and behaves as much like a lover as a gun-packing investor.
Though all of the actors are good, and the events unfold with dispatch, "Golden Boy" still seemed unfinished at the preview I attended. It had nothing to do with people not knowing their lines, but with their not yet feeling at home with one another or within the play's scheme. Too often they appeared simply to be hanging around, waiting for cues. Work is needed.

There were plenty of Toyotas, Hondas, Mazdas and Subarus, but G.M. vehicles were scarce. "It was very sobering when you drove the neighborhoods and expressways," she said.
That was two and a half years ago, when the market share of the General Motors Corporation in California was suffering through a 10-year slump and seemed to know only one direction -- reverse. 
 Ms. Pattyn's mission was to implement the company's California comeback strategy, which involved equipping certain models with popular options, discounting the prices and ending further discounts and rebates. As an example of how it works, the suggested sticker price for a 1996 Pontiac Grand Am SE coupe is $14,995 in California, about 7.6 percent lower than the $16,234 list price elsewhere.
Call it "no haggle pricing," "value pricing," or simply price cutting, G.M. said that the approach implemented in August 1993 had helped turn California sales around. Despite some resistance from dealers and even some G.M. divisions, the company said it had managed to raise its anemic market share in California to nearly 23 percent this year.
G.M.'s California market share is still 10 percentage points below the company's nationwide figures. But industry analysts said the company's market share has seen a remarkable resurgence, after dropping 10 points since 1982 and reaching a low of 19 percent in 1991.
And the price cutting has caught on, as other dealers and brands have used it selectively. (All Oldsmobile models are sold this way as are many Chevrolet models nationwide. G.M.'s Saturn division has used the approach since it introduced its cars in 1990.)
But analysts said the strategy would ultimately squeeze profit margins. Dealers complain that sales of some models have not increased enough to recoup the profits that have been given up. And many experts are skeptical that G.M. can sustain its sales surge in California with this tactic alone. They also question whether consumers will continue to trust the program.
"The car industry is being pressured by the expectations of consumers, who expect better for less cost," said Donald L. Keithley, a partner with J. D. Power & Associates, citing as an example the declining prices for increasingly powerful personal computers.
G.M. initiated the California battle plan with $75 million for advertising and sales training. It has since been expanded to nearly all G.M. models, including hot sellers such as the GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle and the Buick Regal. The few exceptions are the high-priced cars and trucks in each G.M. line, most Cadillacs and budget-priced Geos.
Ms. Pattyn, 42, said that to lure back buyers, the the auto maker had to abandon its view of the United States as a single market and respond to car-buying tastes in specific areas, like California, where foreign cars have been hugely popular for years.
Including fleet sales, imports hold more than 40 percent of the California market, compared with about 26 percent nationwide, according to Automotive News. G.M., which saw a 4-point improvement in retail sales during the last model year, said it now has 22.9 percent of the California market, compared with 22.3 percent for Ford and 9.9 percent for Chrysler.
Prices of Japanese cars sold in the United States have risen, pushed by the sharp decline in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen, and more buyers are turning to domestic makes.
"We are being opportunistic in reverse," Ms. Pattyn said. "This is a window of opportunity with the yen relationship."
Melaine A. Johnson chose a Chevrolet truck over a Japanese truck last month because of its lower price. "I think I got a lot more in my Chevy than in a Toyota," she said.
Ms. Johnson, 25, paid $14,000 for a 1996 Chevrolet pickup equipped with air bags, power steering and a stereo, options that she said would have added $5,000 to the cost of a comparable Toyota truck. "I got what I wanted without having to pay extra for it," she said.
G.M.'s strategy forces dealers to accept lower profit margins, but some some dealers said it had not lifted sales of Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, whose buyers are generally older and still expect big discounts.
"If value pricing really worked, all sales should have gone up," said Robert R. Longpre, whose dealership in Westminster, sells Pontiac, Lexus and Suzuki models.
Mr. Longpre said G.M. was misreading its customers by focusing on price instead of quality. "As a stockholder, I'm not sure I got my $75 million worth," he said. "You vote your paycheck and my Pontiac sales have gone down."
Other dealers said customers preferred the approach. James J. Smythe, 41, vice president of the Santa Clara dealership owned by his father, said he welcomed the idea because it allowed salespeople to focus on service. But he estimated that only half of the state's G.M. dealers were smitten with the campaign. "It's very controversial," he said, because volume on some lines has not increased to make up for profit margins that have sunk to 6 percent from as much 18 percent.
Some dealers, he said, have abandoned the pricing strategy when they were overstocked, resorting to old-fashioned discounting. "There are three other G.M. dealers within three minutes of us," Mr. Smythe said. "It's difficult to compete with the guy who cuts prices."

HEADLINE: Making the 'Invisible' Clearly Visible

BYLINE: By Janet Maslin

 BODY:
Billy Golfus was a Minneapolis rock-and-roll radio personality before the motor-scooter accident that left him brain-damaged and partly paralyzed more than a decade ago. His professional irreverence is very much intact in "When Billy Broke His Head . . . and Other Tales of Wonder," a spiky, vigorous and often caustically funny documentary about problems faced by the disabled. 
 Serving as director (along with David E. Simpson), writer and acerbic narrator, Mr. Golfus outlines the frustrations that confront this country's largest minority group. There may be nearly 50 million disabled Americans, he notes, "but we're as invisible as Casper the ghost." 
 This hourlong film, which won a prize at last January's Sundance Film Festival, was shown on PBS several months ago and opens today for a two-week run at the Film Forum, does a lot to rectify that situation. It visits brave, interesting people who have learned to deal ably with handicaps they see as both physical and political. Mr. Golfus strongly attacks the practice of funneling Medicaid money for the disabled into nursing homes, maintaining that most handicapped people could live more happily and economically with home care. 
 Naturally, Mr. Golfus uses his own example whenever possible, beginning with an account of his own physical difficulties. Photographed trying to hit a punching bag, he moves so slowly that he seems to be underwater. "You lose your ability to make money, to survive and to have fun," he says. "You never get asked anywhere. You never get told anything. You lose stuff that you can't even name: the things that gave your life stability and meaning." Mr. Golfus also outlines his professional problems, showing off a wall decorated with rejection letters "from some of the best magazines in America." And he films some painful encounters with his own father. 
 The senior Mr. Golfus implies that his son needs more determination, and manages to suggest that paralysis is a fate worse than death. It's typical of this documentary's sardonic outlook that this idea is lampooned with melodramatic movie clips, patronizing snippets from a Jerry Lewis telethon and an excerpt from "Star Trek." "My life as a Klingon is over!" proclaims the extraterrestrial who learns he has been paralyzed in that scene. 
 Meanwhile, the film visits disabled people who hate the idea of being stigmatized. "Packaging is everything," says Mr. Golfus about the ways in which physical handicaps create image problems. Among his stereotype-busting interview subjects are Joy Mincy-Powell, a beautiful young woman who performs dance routines from her wheelchair, and Ed Roberts, nicknamed Special Ed, who is seen starting the day after a night's sleep in an iron lung. After that, he takes a karate lesson. 
 Mr. Roberts, who died in March, had been deemed a hopeless case and denied employment assistance from the California Department of Rehabilitation; he was appointed director of that same state agency 14 years later. 
 As the camera observes some remarkable coping mechanisms (one woman who cannot speak or move without huge difficulty has been driving a van safely for years), it also shows how hard it can be for the disabled to make their needs understood. Mr. Golfus films a visit to his own caseworker, who has 400 other clients and no great personal interest in explaining why Mr. Golfus's government benefits are being cut. In another scene, a woman shows off the extensive government paperwork she must complete. Since her disability is extremely poor eyesight, she can't read a single word. 
 If this film's subjects feel like outsiders, they're well matched with the main character in "Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life," this year's Academy Award-winning short subject. Originating in a slip of the tongue by its writer and director, Peter Capaldi, this Scottish film is more Kafka than Frank Capra and more Tim Burton than either of them. Alone in his lair, Kafka (Richard E. Grant) struggles with the first line of "Metamorphosis," wondering whether Gregor Samsa shouldn't wake up as a giant banana. From its macabre wit to its Christmasy ending, Mr. Capaldi's film is gratifyingly bizarre. Crispin Letts revels in the banana and cockroach role.

HEADLINE: China's Inevitable Dilemma: Coal Equals Growth

SERIES: THE AIR IN 2000: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: TAIYUAN, China

 BODY:
Within a 300-mile radius of this energy capital, hundreds of thousands of coal miners are shredding subterranean seams thicker than ocean liners and hauling a black treasure to the surface to power the economic rise of China.
From the great forest of chimneys that punctures the haze of China's industrial landscape, a nimbus of carbon- and sulphur-based gases is billowing into the atmosphere. It is mixing with the buildup of the century-long industrialization of Europe and North America and, many scientists say, it is contributing to the overall warming of the earth's atmosphere. 
 And as the evidence hardens that global atmospheric warming is a result of human activity, especially the production of gases from the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas, questions are growing about whether China can change course.
China's heavy reliance on coal, along with its inefficient and wasteful patterns of energy use, will make it the largest single producer of climate-warming carbon dioxide by the second or third decade of the next century.
As it surpasses the United States and other industrial countries as a cause of the problem, China seems certain to come under strong international pressure to curb its reliance on its vast, cheap coal reserves.
And China itself may face serious consequences from global warming, as a rise in sea levels inundates coastal zones. Right now, many of its citizens are choking on the air pollution produced by the widespread burning of coal.
But coal development on a vast scale appears inevitable. China's dilemma is repeated, on a lesser scale, in India, Brazil and the rest of the developing world, where diverting scarce funds to meet global environmental goals is seen as a rich country's luxury.
For China's leadership, it is simply a question of capital, massive amounts of it. Already, Beijing's leaders face a daunting array of demands to build highways, railroads and modern industries to compete for export markets with the developed world and to provide the economic growth China's expanding population will expect.
Some efficiency improvements will pay for themselves, but with its huge reserves of coal, China sees any energy alternative that costs more or requires more up-front capital as a threat to development.
"You try to tell the people of Beijing that they can't buy a car or an air-conditioner because of the global climate-change issue," said Li Junfeng, a senior energy researcher for the State Planning Commission in Beijing. "It is just as hot in Beijing as it is in Washington, D.C.
"If we reduce our emission of gases, it means we must reduce our energy consumption," Mr. Li said. "When people get rich, they want to buy an air-conditioner or a car; that will increase energy consumption."
It already has.
Between 1970 and 1990, energy consumption rose 208 percent in China, compared with an average rise of 28 percent in developed countries during the same period.
More than five million Chinese are now engaged in the largest coal extraction enterprise in human history, feeding China's enormous thirst for energy and pushing toward fulfillment of the national goal of quadrupling the country's economic output between 1980 and 2000.
Last year, China's national honeycomb of mines produced 1.2 billion tons of coal, more than any other nation, and the numbers are only growing, perhaps nearly tripling to 3.1 billion tons annually by the year 2020, when China will be overtaking the United States as the largest source of waste gases being pumped into the atmosphere.
Still, despite the possible economic cost, the Chinese have plenty of impetus to change.
 
The Emissions
Whose Are They, And Who Pays?
 Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences now say they believe that global climate changes during the next 30 to 50 years could cause a 1-meter rise in sea levels that, when magnified by storm tides, would inundate an area the size of Portugal on China's coastal plain, including the important manufacturing centers at Shanghai and Guangzhou, forcing 67 million people to abandon their land and homes.
Equally vulnerable is China's straining agricultural base, which must nearly double its harvest to feed the 1.6 billion Chinese who will live here 30 years from now.
Though uncertainties abound in these projections, profound concerns about the potential impact of global climate change has mobilized China's scientific community and elevated climate research, monitoring and computer modeling to a high-priority national effort.
"We are paying a great deal of attention to this issue," said Sun Honglie, a senior Government scientist in Beijing and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's Parliament.
But for China's Communist Party leaders, the question of who should bear the burden of reducing the enormous volume of warming gases rising from the Americas, Europe and Asia draws a fiercely nationalistic response, and quickly turns to the rancor-filled question of whether the West, led by the United States, is seeking to limit China's emergence as a great power.
"Developed countries discharge more carbon dioxide than developing countries on a per capita basis and the United States discharges 10 times more than China on a per capita basis," Qin Zhongda, the vice chairman of the environmental protection committee of the National People's Congress, said last month during a news conference at the Great Hall of the People.
For many Chinese, the question of whether the rest of the world will accommodate China's coal-burning juggernaut is a question of fundamental equity, and the country's political leaders have been thus far unwilling to enter serious negotiations about their future emissions.
"China has not recognized that they are going to have increasing obligations for the future," said Timothy E. Wirth, the State Department's undersecretary for global affairs who visited China last year seeking to broaden cooperation on strategies to combat climate change.
"We may have fouled the atmosphere in the past," he continued, "and that's our responsibility. But we both are fouling the atmosphere for the future and that is both of our responsibilities."
China disagrees.
"Two hundred years after the Industrial Revolution, the world economy has greatly advanced and the developed countries are the main beneficiary," said Lin Zongtang, a former head of China's Aero-Space Ministry and now vice chairman of the environmental protection committee of the National People's Congress. "About 80 percent of the world's pollution is caused by developed countries and they should be responsible for these problems."
That means, Chinese officials say, that the developed countries should help pay for cleaner coal burning technologies in the third world, as well as helping to finance capital-intensive hydro-electric projects, nuclear power stations and alternative energy sources like wind and solar.
Many Western and Chinese scientists say they believe that despite China's dependence on coal for the foreseeable future, China's emissions of carbon dioxide could be held to a doubling of output, instead of a tripling, during the next 30 years by increasing efficiency and investment in alternative energy sources.
But that, in itself, would require a huge mobilization of capital, technology and political commitment.
 
The Attitude
So Many Burners, One Thing to Burn
 Here in China's coal capital, miners, mine bosses, engineers and power plant operators all seem to believe that China is resigned to a heavy dependence on coal for decades, even though this dependence may have serious consequences for China and the rest of the world.
"We are a developing country and we started out without a very good foundation," says Zhang Fengtong, the senior engineer at the Gu Jiao mine complex 50 miles north of here. "We have so few choices and no funding, so our industries are going to rely heavily on coal for a long time to come."
Farther north, on the road to Datong, another coal capital, Yang Zeguo peered out from under the chassis of his parked Liberation-brand truck looking incredulous at a visitor's question about China's dependence on coal.
He was in the process of transporting his 27-ton load of raw coal to the market of neighboring Hebei province when he stopped for lunch and repairs at a dusty truck stop littered with coal carriers and prostitutes draped across the doorways of one-table diners.
"If we don't burn coal, what else can we burn?" he asked. "We can't find anything else to burn."
In one sense, he was right. Even if China improved the efficiency of all of its electric power plants, much of the coal burned in China is consumed in small industrial and municipal boilers and in millions of cooking stoves and household heaters, for which no alternative fuels are currently available.
"You really have to change the culture to have any impact," said Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba in Canada, one of the leading experts on China's environment.
"They have this coal; they have to use it," Prof. Smil said. "But they could use it in a proper way. Much of the coal is now coming from these very small coal mines, but there is no sorting, no cleaning or washing and this kind of coal generates a tremendous amount of pollution. It meets the needs of today, but it doesn't meet the needs of tomorrow."
The decentralization of economic power in China has made it more likely, not less, that boilers for heat, steam or electrical generation will be smaller and less efficient.
At Yuanping, a scruffy crossroads town sandwiched between mountain ranges in central Shanxi, Gong Gaoshou is the deputy manager of the local power station, whose chimney was spewing a black plume visible in the next county on a recent afternoon.
Yuanping's power plant is rated at six megawatts, less than one-100th the size of a standard power station in the West, and its boiler is among the least efficient for clean burning or for the economies that accrue to large-scale power production.
But even though national policy now forbids the construction of such plants, China's provincial leaders continue to underwrite them because they are the most affordable on provincial budgets.
"We don't have any money," Mr. Gong said. "The price of electricity is too low and the price of raw materials is increasing greatly. What can we do? We are trying our best."
Susan E. McDade, a United Nations energy specialist in Beijing, said China could reap the same benefit Western countries did when sharp increases in energy prices during the 1970's and 1980's led to a host of efficiency improvements and conservation measures that cut energy consumption.
Electricity prices in China are half those in many developed countries.
"Liberalizing energy prices would be the single most effective policy to promote energy efficiency," Ms. McDade said.
From the lowliest coal miner to the most senior scientist, it is this sense of inevitability that China's energy economy will be dominated by coal that impels China to insist that the world must make room.
"The most important thing for China is to modernize the economy, and after that occurs, we will have more money to deal with environmental issues," said Mr. Li in Beijing. "But it must follow economic development" and, he added, "we can't change the energy situation."
 
The Alternatives
Hey, Buddy, Can You Spare a Reactor?
 China is working with the World Bank, Japan and the United States Department of Energy to fund an assortment of projects that could improve the efficiency of Chinese power plants and develop alternative energy sources like hydroelectric power, solar, wind and the burning of biomass, or plants.
Earlier this year, a joint study team of Chinese scientists and experts assembled by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program concluded that China could marshal the technology to ameliorate significantly the global effects of its coal economy.
"By the year 2020," the team concluded, "large-scale adoption of low-carbon energy sources such as hydro, nuclear, gas, biomass, solar and wind technologies could displace a substantial quantity of coal, particularly for electric generation."
Mr. Li of the planning commission's energy institute said that even if there were no fear of climate change, "We are trying to increase our efficiency."
Ever quick to remind an American of the nationalistic tensions that persist, he added: "The United States has so many nuclear power stations that it has given up on. Why not sell them to China and help China reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and develop its economy?
"If you don't sell nuclear equipment to China, the demand is still going to be there," he added, "and people will build with coal."

HEADLINE: Gartner to Acquire Dataquest In $80 Million Bid to Expand

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28

 BODY:
In a move to broaden its market in the analysis of information technology, Gartner Group Inc. has agreed to buy Dataquest Inc., a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, for about $80 million in cash and securities.
Gartner, which announced the deal late Monday, is itself 51 percent owned by Dun & Bradstreet. 
 Both Gartner and Dataquest provide research and analysis of computers, software and other information technology, but they serve different customers. Gartner, which is based in Stamford, Conn., has focused on users, primarily the information systems managers of large corporations, while Dataquest, based in San Jose, Calif., has sold its services to vendors, primarily computer hardware and software producers. Sometimes those customers have overlapped, but the two concerns have not been direct competitors.
Gartner shares surged $6.125 today, to $45.25, on Nasdaq, while shares of Dun & Bradstreet rose $1.375, to $62.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the acquisition was not risk-free because it would send Gartner into a new sales area, but they said it could bolster Gartner's position as the leading provider of independent analysis of information technology.
"On balance this would appear to be a very positive acquisition for Gartner, though it's got to raise the risk-reward profile of the stock a bit," said Steven Eskenazi, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons in San Francisco. "It gets Gartner critical mass in Asia/Pacific, where Dataquest is strong, and it gets them into a new business," he said. Gartner has managed smaller acquisitions well in the past, he said.
The terms of the acquisition call for Gartner to pay Dun & Bradstreet $15 million cash, plus 1.5 million shares of Gartner common stock, valued on Monday at about $60 million. Dun also receives warrants to buy another 300,000 shares, valued at about $5 million.
Gartner plans to lay off about 100 of Dataquest's 500 employees, primarily in administrative and oversight functions, said Dennis G. Sisco, executive vice president of Dun & Bradstreet. Gartner has about 1,000 employees.
Judith H. Hamilton, Dataquest's president and chief executive, will also leave the company, because her position will be eliminated. The sales forces of the two companies would be combined, Mr. Sisco said.
"The sales process is very much the same for this type of information," Mr. Sisco said. "We have ahead an instant opportunity to bring Gartner's 300-plus sales force together with Dataquest's 50-plus sales force for a coordinated package of offerings."
He said that after the initial integration period, both companies would probably add new positions.
Gartner's acquisition of Dataquest follows an acquisition by the company's founder, Gideon Gartner, who left in 1990. He recently bought BIS Strategic Decisions, a Dataquest competitor, and renamed it Giga Information Group. One executive close to the Gartner Group, who insisted on anonymity, said the timing of the two deals was not coincidental.
Another factor that could have driven the Dataquest deal, the executive said, was that Manny A. Fernandez, Gartner's chief executive, ran Dataquest during the 1980's.
Dataquest was not consistently profitable then or in the early 1990's. It has become profitable in the last two years, under Ms. Hamilton.
"About three years ago, on significantly lower revenues, we were losing large amounts of money," Ms. Hamilton said. "We will have revenues this year of $69 to $70 million, with operating income securely in double digits," she said.

HEADLINE: House Acts to Protect Gift Arrangement Used by Charities

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives yesterday unanimously approved two bills that would shield charities from the antitrust and securities regulations that apply to businesses. The Senate is expected to pass similar legislation quickly.
The legislation is a response to an unusual class-action lawsuit against the American Red Cross, United Way of America, the Salvation Army, Mount Holyoke College and about 1,900 other charitable institutions. The suit asserts that these charities violated antitrust laws by colluding on the rates of return they pay donors who make gifts to them and who wish to earn income on those gifts for as long as they live. 
 The suit also contends that charities are breaking securities laws by even offering the arrangements, known as charitable gift annuities, which are usually sold by licensed insurance agents and brokers.
Charities and Congressional sponsors hope that the legislation will make the lawsuit moot. A trial is scheduled for February, unless the case is dismissed.
"Without this common-sense protection, charitable organizations would lose a much-needed and useful tool for raising funds, and that would be a tragedy," said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, who was a co-sponsor of the bill that would give charities antitrust protection in setting payout rates -- that is, the gift's yield, paid to the donor. A companion bill deals with the securities law issues.
The gift annuity is a popular arrangement, particularly among older givers, because it allows them to take an immediate tax deduction by making a donation and still receive income for as long as they live. Donors do not get to take their full gift as a deduction, since in return they receive income and often some principal back as well.
The lawsuit that prompted the legislation was brought last year in the Federal Court for the Northern District of Texas on behalf of Louise T. Peter, an elderly Texas woman. It was initiated by Dorothy Ozee, a great-niece who cared for Ms. Peter for many years. A probate court had found Ms. Peter, who is now 96 and lives in a nursing home, mentally unable to handle her own affairs.
The lawsuit argues that charities should set payout rates on gift annuities individually, without reference to an industry standard.
Ms. Peter, whose grandfather helped found a denomination of the Lutheran Church in Texas nearly 150 years ago, is a retired secretary who never married. She inherited about $2 million from a brother who owned land on top of oil reserves, and she has been a frequent donor to Lutheran charities. In 1988, she gave $200,000 to the Lutheran Foundation of Texas, setting up a gift annuity arrangement with an interest rate of 13.4 percent, which was the rate recommended at the time by the American Council on Gift Annuities.
In October, a Federal judge, Joe Kendall, allowed the suit to be brought as a class action against 1,900 charities. The suit, which alleges antitrust and securities violations, asks that all money donated to charities through charitable gift annuities be returned, along with double that amount in damages.
The American Council on Gift Annuities, which was founded in 1927 to help charities that want to use gift annuities, publishes standard rates for those annuities, and is also a defendant in the lawsuit. The rates, which are based on actuarial calculations by a consulting group, are reviewed only every three years, and sometimes changed less frequently.
The aim, the council says, is to recommend a payout rate that takes into account the life expectancy of the donor and what the charity is likely to earn by investing the money, and to leave at least 50 percent for the charity after the donor's death -- the amount required under some state regulations. Currently, the council suggests that an 85-year-old donor be given a 10 percent payout rate, while a 75-year-old donor be given a 7.7 percent rate. Insurance company executives say their annuities are structured somewhat differently and so are not really comparable.
In fact, the charities argue that their rates are not meant to be competitive, since the main goal of the donor is to help the charity, not to maximize income. And they say that this is an important reason why they should not be subject to antitrust regulation.
"If the donors' primary concern is income, they are not going to be looking at charitable gift annuities," said Judy Norris, a lawyer with Thompson & Knight in Dallas who represents the council.
Robert Elkin, a lawyer with McKool Smith in Dallas, who represents the plaintiff in the case, declined to comment.
There are no figures on how much money all charities have collected through gift annuities, but a survey by the American Council on Gift Annuities found that the 706 charities that responded had received $1.2 billion from them, including $316 million in 1993.
"Charitable annuities are a very big part of giving, especially with major gifts," said Helmer N. Ekstrom, president of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel in New York.
And charities have been fighting hard to keep the annuities, both in defending themselves against the lawsuit and in pressing for the protective legislation. Tal Roberts, executive vice president of the Baptist Foundation of Texas and president of the American Council on Gift Annuities, estimated that charities had been spending more than a million dollars a month on the suit.
"It is just outrageous to be spending this kind of money on a lawsuit," he said, "but it is one we cannot take lightly."

HEADLINE: Spending-Cap Issue In Connecticut Court

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 28

 BODY:
In an unusual case that tests the balance of powers in the Connecticut government, the State Supreme Court was urged today to force the Legislature to put into effect a spending cap that voters overwhelmingly approved three years ago.
The problem facing the justices is that it is far from clear what the voters had in mind and whether the Supreme Court is responsible for figuring that out. 
 At issue is a 1992 amendment to the State Constitution decreeing that "general budget expenditures" should grow by no more than the percentage increase in personal income or inflation, whichever is greater. Left up to the Legislature was how personal income and inflation should be measured and what areas of spending would be exempt.

HEADLINE: Bowing To Profits, Reluctantly

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
IT is 21 years since the release of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three," and, unless the Transit Authority is sitting on a great secret, no one has imitated that popular movie by hijacking a New York subway train and holding its passengers for ransom.
Cinematic depictions of horror do not lead automatically to copycat crimes in real life. There may be evidence that the phenomenon does sometimes occur, but it is difficult to predict. True, a President was killed in Dallas only a year after "The Manchurian Candidate" filled theaters. It seems quite a stretch, though, to say that Lee Harvey Oswald simply mimicked that movie's assassination theme. 
 The depressingly familiar question of what to do when life appears to imitate art is with us once again because of Harry Kaufman, fighting for his life after being set aflame in his token booth by degenerates who may or may not have taken their cue from the movie "Money Train."
Perhaps the copycat issue is not the right one to raise, as has been done since the weekend. Maybe it is time to ask whether the city and related agencies like the Transit Authority should be collaborating at all on movies like this one, in which violence energizes a central plot of stealing the subway system blind. After all, the authority itself said in early 1994 that it would no longer allow producers to film scenes in the subways that suggest the system is "out of control."
Attitudes like that have long driven city officials wild because the New York subway is a big scene-setting attraction for Hollywood. These officials consider the Transit Authority to be obstructionist, and they do not want to hear even a whisper that may be interpreted as hostility to movie makers and their megabucks. Indeed, the authority's resolve in 1994 lasted only a day, until Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani waved off restrictions on movie makers as smacking of censorship.
In the first hours of Mr. Kaufman's ordeal, the Mayor said unequivocally that his position had not changed. (When Mr. Giuliani became such a First Amendment absolutist is not clear. It had to be either before or after he decided that shops selling pornographic videos were not fit to operate in residential areas.)

 IN this atmosphere, and with City Hall keeping up the pressure, transit officials say that they, too, had to give priority to keeping New York a Hollywood-friendly place. So even though they technically could do whatever they want -- it is their subway system -- they felt they could not keep out "Money Train" despite serious misgivings that security officials say they had about the script.
"You can't say that you're not going to fully cooperate," an authority official said. Cooperation in this case might strike some as a moral tap dance -- that is, giving Columbia Pictures a good deal of help on its $60 million project but drawing the line at filming the most violent scenes underground.
It left unanswered the broader question of whether there are times when the proper response is no, full stop, to a movie that is excessively long on slam-bang violence and short on brains even by modern Hollywood standards.
Does the city or an agency like the Transit Authority have to give its stamp of approval to almost anything in the name of free expression? How about a film on a vicious killer who slithers from one New York landmark to another and, with no redeeming social value to his actions, dispatches his victims with maximum gore?
The short answer is yes, says Commissioner Patricia Reed Scott of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.

 THERE may be logistical to-ing and fro-ing, but "we shouldn't be in a position of censorship," Ms. Scott said yesterday. "If you're saying that we should determine what everyone else sees or reads, that's stepping over the line." Her position was echoed by Martin Bregman, producer of New York-based movies like "Serpico" and "Carlito's Way."
"You can't have attempts at censorship and create a film industry," Mr. Bregman said, striking at the economic heart of the matter.
Without question, a big fear at City Hall is that Hollywood, if pushed too hard on content, will simply walk away, as it did a few years ago to protest New York's high costs and complicated union rules. That would be an enormous loss. This is an industry that made 157 feature-length movies here in 1994, not to mention hundreds of television shows, commercials and music videos. Those productions were worth $1.75 billion to the local economy, Ms. Scott says.
That is enough to make a First Amendment true believer out of anyone. Too bad Harry Kaufman can't add his voice to the debate.

HEADLINE: City Seeks Renewal In Absence Of Bomb

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: LOS ALAMOS, N.M.

 BODY:
A casual visitor to this isolated mesa might find local real estate advertisements a bit off-key for a town long associated with designing nuclear Armageddon.
"Excuse me, but is this heaven?" one advertisement asks a visitor, who may be breathless from the 7,424-foot altitude or from a multihued Southwest sunset. "Actually, it's Los Alamos! Once upon a time Los Alamos was a secret town. Now, the cat's out of the bag. A great place to live." 
 In fits and starts, a town that calls itself the nation's premier Atomic City is adjusting to a new stage of life. Since the 1940's, when the Federal Government built and tested the first atomic bomb here, Washington has subsidized many local services. But with the end of the cold war and budget-cutting fever high, the flow of Federal money is drying up, bringing change to this dry, windswept town 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe.
Some locals predict that here, where scientists endured cold showers and barracks life to design the atomic bomb, tourists will enjoy hot tubs and organic food after rock climbing, river rafting or exploring ancient Indian cliff dwellings.
"We could turn Los Alamos into a quasi resort town, like Taos," mused Matthew Albright, administrator of the town Community Development Committee.
But skeptics sporting "Conehead Cafe" T-shirts joke about the challenge of luring tourists to a town that has the nation's only fully operational plutonium plant, part of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. And behind the jokes, there is worry about the effect of Federal cuts on Los Alamos, which has historically been recession-proof.
"We're a one-company town -- 100 percent dependent on Washington," said Fred Brueggeman, the county's community development director. "When the lab sniffles, the rest of the community gets pneumonia."
Half a century of Government money for nuclear weapons research magically transformed Los Alamos, New Mexico's smallest county, into its wealthiest, with an average household income of $68,000 a year.
Originally a secret city, Los Alamos once had guarded gates that, until 1957, cut the city off from the outside world . Only in 1962 did President John F. Kennedy sign legislation allowing private citizens to own property here.
Today, with Federal and state land accounting for 88 percent of Los Alamos County, one-acre housing lots sell for $300,000. And Los Alamos is New Mexico's most expensive city, with the cost of living 23 percent above the national average.
On Nov. 30, this town of 18,000 is to see the final stage in a four-month layoff of 1,000 contractors and employees at the laboratory, or 10 percent of its work force. While research programs have come and gone in the past, this is the first time that deep cuts have been made in lab jobs that many locals have considered lifetime positions.
Moreover, next June will bring the expiration of Federal contracts that have provided annual payments of $8 million to Los Alamos public schools and $2.8 million to Los Alamos County for road maintenance.
Starting with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950's, Washington has traditionally paid for a third of the school system's budget, helping to put the county's spending per pupil 15 percent above the state average. Federal money also helps Los Alamos High School offer such atypical courses as simple robotics and computer-aided manufacturing.
"How else do you attract people to the biggest cul de sac in the world?" asked Jim Anderson, Los Alamos superintendent of schools. "The school district is a top reason for people coming here and staying."
Indeed, Los Alamos County has the greatest concentration of Ph.D.'s in the country, local officials say. And last year Los Alamos students scored higher on Scholastic Assessment Tests than students in the school district of Princeton, N.J., a university town that is the headquarters for the company that develops the tests.
Residents defend the large Federal subsidies as compensation for taxes that would be paid by private industry if the Government's presence was not so overwhelming.
Today, this legacy of Government dominance hinders efforts to attract high-technology companies that would profit from research at the $5 billion Federal laboratory.
"This is a town of 18,000 people without a Wal-Mart, without a Kmart, without a car dealership," Mr. Anderson said. "Retail companies can't afford to pay people $10 an hour."
As part of its golden legacy from the cold war era, Los Alamos has a municipal ski area and the nation's highest-altitude Olympic-size swimming pool.
On Trinity Drive, a showcase avenue named after the first atomic bomb test, Federal budget levels ultimately determine the volume of cash flowing into the McDonald's, a gallery selling Native American pottery and a boutique selling T-shirts bearing mushroom clouds and "The Atomic City."
Indeed, the most powerful figure walking the mesa today is a diminutive, mustachioed man who came to this country after his father died fighting for Germany in World War II. As the director of the Los Alamos laboratory, the man, Siegfried Hecker, oversees a 43-square mile empire of 2,224 buildings.
Dr. Hecker believes that this immense laboratory has an important post-cold war role. The laboratory stopped designing nuclear weapons in 1989, but about 60 percent of its $1 billion budget is for defense-related work. Most of the money goes for dismantling nuclear weapons and for insuring the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear arms stockpile.
"We are cleaning up the legacy of 50 years of nuclear weapons," Mr. Hecker said in an interview. "If you look to the nuclear future, the lab will continue to have an extremely important role to play. Los Alamos is going to be here for a long, long time. We still attract the best scientists in the world."
While the laboratory's future level of financing is a perennial topic of debate here, the city is witnessing its largest private investment since the Manhattan Project took over the mesa in 1943. Two local banks are moving into new headquarters and two shopping malls have been renovated. Spurring business confidence, the Department of Energy has promised to transfer parcels of Federal land to the county for private use.
Even tourists are responding to promotional appeals to "discover the secret that is Los Alamos." The Bradbury Science Museum, which tells the history of the Manhattan Project, is expected to draw 130,000 visitors this year, a higher attendance than any museum can claim in Santa Fe, a city more commonly associated with New Mexico tourism.
One recent evening, Michael Smith, a third-generation Los Alamos entrepreneur, talked amid the hubbub of his new Central Avenue Grill.
"There is always uncertainty in a single-industry town," said the proprietor, who seemed far from uncertain himself. "My grandfather bought the PX here, and then the Korean War ended. We thought, Los Alamos is over for sure."

HEADLINE: Polish Leader Vexed by Final Hurdle: His Past

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Nov. 28

 BODY:
President-elect Aleksander Kwasniewski, the model of a media politician in his Oxford-cloth blue shirt, smart tie and suit, says he is annoyed that as he tries to hitch Poland to the West he faces a huge obstacle: his image as a former Communist.
"I can imagine in the United States people asking, 'Since the post-Communists won the election in Poland does Poland want to be a Communist country again?' " he said in an interview today. "It's a stereotype. Totally wrong, totally wrong." 
 Mr. Kwasniewski, 41, who first rose in the Communist Party as a newspaper editor, sat in an elegant damask-covered chair in his transition headquarters and spoke in English of his plans for convincing skeptics that such labels do not matter.
Since defeating Lech Walesa, Poland's first democratically elected President and a staunch anti-Communist, Mr. Kwasniewski (pronounced kvash-NYEFF-skee) has kept a low profile, trying to allow passions at home to cool. But he has tried to make the case to President Clinton in a telephone call and to West European leaders that he will push forward on political and economic reforms.
To show he is serious, Mr. Kwasniewski resigned his membership on Saturday from the political party that he founded on the rubble of the former Communist organization and that carried him to the presidency.
But he knows, he said, that the "ex-former-post Communist" label will stick a while longer. "I'm irritated, sure," he said. "Not because I wasn't a member of the party. I was, of course. But first, from an ideological point of view, I was never a Communist. In Poland I've seen very few Communists, especially since the 1970's. I met a lot of technocrats, opportunists, reformers, liberals."
Mr. Kwasniewski has been called all those things himself. But he insists he has been a social democrat for the last six years, leading his party to support privatization and heading the commission that is drafting a new constitution.
He will reinforce his separation from his past and party, he suggested, by choosing his Foreign and Defense Ministers from outside his political camp. Those appointments are seen by Washington as the most critical as Poland continues its drive to join the European Union and NATO.
A Clinton Administration official said Washington had told Mr. Kwasniewski that the "door is open, but you've got to walk through it by reaching beyond your base."
But Mr. Kwasniewski backed away from the idea, favored in Washington, that those positions be filled by leading figures in the anti-Communist Freedom Union.
"It's difficult to think of the leadership of this opposition in the Government," Mr. Kwasniewski said. This would lead to "some kind of schizophrenia," he said. Instead, he would choose more politically neutral officials for the two posts. "We need candidates with credibility and well prepared and not connected with our political groups," he said.
Poland has said it will send about 800 soldiers to Bosnia to help NATO enforce a peace accord there, something Mr. Kwasniewski said he views as building Poland's credibility.
"If we want to speak seriously about NATO membership, Poland should participate," he said. "It's extremely important."
On relations with the Roman Catholic Church, which has been hostile to him, he said he was not seeking a fight with the bishops. He said earlier this week that he was brought up in a Catholic household, that his mother was religious and that he would work so hard for Poland that he would "earn God's blessing."
He hoped to win a "compromise" from the Church on wording in the new constitution that would call for the state to be "impartial" in Church matters, a posture for which, officially, the Church has shown little enthusiasm.
On abortion, Mr. Kwasniewski was clear: He would sign a law liberalizing the restrictions enacted after Communist rule ended in 1989. "It is a deep illness and something is wrong," he said of Polish society, if women had to resort to organized trips abroad to get abortions and the police were wire-tapping the organizers in an effort to convict them.
"I'm against abortion as abortion," he said, "but if we want to solve the question more has to be done in the economic, psychological and educational fields."
Mr. Kwasniewski gives the impression of being an adept politician who, during his travels in Western Europe and the United States, has learned how to be convivial but also how to sidestep questions. His staff ran an almost textbook American-style campaign.
It also successfully defined his image after a close study of the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy television debates. Like John F. Kennedy, Mr. Kwasniewski came across as a freshly minted candidate against the tired war horse, Mr. Walesa. Mr. Kwasniewski said today he had deliberately arrived late in the studio to unsettle Mr. Walesa, who was waiting by himself before the first debate.
In 1976, as a 22-year-old student, Mr. Kwasniewski crisscrossed the United States for three months, earning his way by delivering cars for an auto agency. He visited New York during the bicentennial celebrations, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and saw parts of 33 states in all. He had already worked in Sweden and had been to London. He was impressed by the different cultures in New York.
"To see blacks, whites, Indians, Orthodox Jews -- it was unbelievable -- people working together and having tolerance for each other," he said. It was also extraordinary, he said, to visit the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and talk to a white store owner who complained that it was no longer legal to refuse to serve a black customer.
Asked to name his political heros, Mr. Kwasniewski started with the Polish list: Jozef Pilsudski, the general who forged the rebirth of Poland after World War I; Wladyslaw Gromulka, first secretary of the Polish Communist Party from 1956 to 1970, because "he was the first man to say Poland should go on its own way" from the Soviet Union -- a characterization many Poles would take issue with; Edward Gierek, the Communist leader from 1956 to 1970, "because he opened Poland" to the West, another reading non-Communist Poles would dispute; and Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader.
As for his recent opponent, "I have big respect for Walesa as leader of Solidarity rather than as President," Mr. Kwasniewski said.
Among foreign leaders, Mr. Kwasniewski said he admired Felipe Gonzalez, the Prime Minister of Spain, for having "reconciled Spain with its Franco past, modernized Spain and led the country into the European Union."
Mr. Kwasniewski said he faces similar challenges. He is planning a vacation this week in Spain.

Treasury Prices End Lower On Concerns About Budget

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday, after paring most of their earlier losses.
Strong demand for new two-year Treasury notes and comments by a top Federal Reserve official suggesting that the Fed could still lower short-term interest rates in the coming months helped attract buyers yesterday. 
 But concerns over the budget negotiations in Washington hampered prices.
"Basically we had a succession of good news and the market has responded to it," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. "But we still have budget uncertainties. I think there is a limit to how far the market can go."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 of a percentage point, to 108 23/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.23 percent from 6.22 percent.
Prices began bouncing back yesterday after the Treasury said it had sold $18.25 billion of new two-year notes at a yield of 5.479 percent, better than the 5.5 percent that market participants had expected. In one sign of the strong demand for the notes, the bid-to-cover ratio -- a comparison of bids submitted with bids accepted -- was 3.01, up from an average of 2.54 at the last 10 auctions.
"The two-year note auction was pretty good," said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at IDEA Inc., a consulting firm.
Today, the Treasury will auction $12 billion of five-year notes.
Comments by the the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, reinforced the market's perception of a slowing economy. Mr. Blinder said the Fed might need to cut rates in the future because monetary policy was acting as a drag on economic growth
In an interview, Mr. Blinder also said big budget deficit cuts could lead to sizable falls in interest rates. He also said that he saw some signs the economy was softening too much, calling those signs worrisome.
Economic data released yesterday gave the market mixed signals.
Early in the day, the market took in the positive news of a 3.7 percent drop in October housing starts, which was followed by negative news on consumer confidence, which jumped to 101.4 in November from 96.3 in October.
"The data was mixed," Mr. Stiles of IDEA said. "With housing weakness versus a big jump in consumer confidence."
Astrid Adolfson, an conomist at the consulting firm MCM Money Watch Inc., said, "It was another shaky day for the market, with a lot of mixed indicators."
Analysts said Treasury prices were expected to stay in a trading range over the next few days, awaiting fresh news on the deficit reduction plan to come out of Washington
In the corporate bond market, prices followed Treasury securities lower.
The BellSouth Corporation issued $500 million of 100-year debentures.
The noncallable debentures were priced at 99.72 to yield 7.02 percent, or 70 basis points over a comparable Treasury security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Columbia Gas began the exchange of $2 billion of debentures following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection yesterday.
The company set seven issues of debentures ranging in maturities from 5 to 30 years at spreads of between 78 and 135 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.479%
Low Yield . . . 5.430%

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trades Broadly Lower While the Pound Is Hit Hard

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped yesterday against most leading currencies as traders took profits after two days of gains.
The dollar was also buffeted by trading between other currencies as the market focused on a new budget in Britain. The pound sterling weakened when the Conservative Government's budget proposals failed to satisfy the markets. 
 The dollar's fall against the German mark and the Japanese yen seemed almost incidental to other moves. "The dollar sort of took a breather as attention moved elsewhere" during a day of thin trading, said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Smith Barney.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4335 marks, down from 1.4360 on Monday. The dollar surged on Monday, reaching a seven-week high against the mark, on expectations that the German central bank would cut interest rates this week, thus reducing the attractiveness of some mark-denominated investments. Some of those expectations waned yesterday, as currency traders tried to guess the German central bank's strategy.
The dollar slipped to 101.15 yen from 101.71 and to 1.1569 Swiss francs from 1.1580 francs. But the British pound fell to $1.5430 from $1.5535.
The pound and British Treasury bonds, known as gilts, fell sharply after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, raised his forecast for Government borrowing in the next year to 29 billion, or $45 billion, from 23.5 billion. In addition, the forecast for 1996-97 was revised sharply higher, to 22.5 billion from 16.1 billion.
Stocks in London were little changed yesterday, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading issues falling two-tenths of 1 percent, to 3,648.8.
But currency traders were disappointed by the higher than expected borrowing needs, saying that there had not been enough spending cuts.
"The market is continuing to wonder about the possibility of a Bank of England base-rate cut, and that is leaving the pound kind of weak," Ms. Finstrom of Smith Barney said.
The pound fell to 2.2136 marks in New York yesterday from 2.2322 marks on Monday.
The strength of the mark helped pull down the dollar as well, as traders sold currencies for marks.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Price of Gold Increases on Signs Of Strong Demand and Shortage

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold prices jumped on the Commodity Exchange of New York yesterday on signs of a shortage of bullion.
On other markets, cotton prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.20 point, to 241.12. 
 Gold lease rates, which are charged for borrowing gold, have more than doubled during the last week, indicating a lack of gold available to make loans. The average one-month lease rate reached 6.16 percent yesterday, according to estimates by four London banks, compared with 1.98 percent at the end of October.
Jewelers, who use about 70 percent of the new gold supply, are in their busiest manufacturing season of the year. The strong demand pushed supplies of gold in Commodity Exchange warehouses to an 18-year low earlier this month.
"There isn't that much gold around," said Lenny Kaplan, vice president and chief trader with the Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. "Now that there is good demand for gold, people are going to have to pay more for it."
Part of the reason gold supplies are low is that central banks have been unwilling to lend gold for short periods. In addition, those banks often scale down their lending operations at the end of the year as they "close their book," said Helen Junz, a director of the World Gold Council's economic service.
Gold for February delivery, the actively traded month, rose $3.10, to $388.90 an ounce. Other precious metals were mixed. The December silver contract fell 0.4 cent, to $5.198 an ounce, while on the New York Mercantile Exchange, January platinum gained 50 cents, to $416.30 an ounce.
Cotton prices fell after a Government report showed that consumption in the United States dropped 22 percent in October.
The Census Bureau said domestic mills used 795,499 bales of cotton in October, down from 1,020,212 bales during September. High cotton prices, weak retail sales and high debt levels are holding down sales of textiles, traders said.
March cotton fell 1.1 cents, to 84.2 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing Fall 3.7% In Biggest Drop Since March

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments fell surprisingly for the third straight month in October, the Commerce Department said today, raising doubts about the housing sector's ability to support economic growth.
Despite falling mortgage rates, housing starts dropped 3.7 percent in October, to an annual rate of 1.34 million, seasonally adjusted. Analysts said that while starts were weaker than anticipated, the drop was concentrated in apartment construction, which plunged 11.2 percent, to an annual rate of 238,000. Single-family home building fell 2 percent, to 1.10 million units a year. 
 Meanwhile, applications for building permits also weakened, but only by seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of 1.40 million.
"Housing construction activity is certainly slowing a bit, but we all knew that was going to come," said David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association. "We couldn't sustain the level of the past few months, so last month's figures are a yellow warning flag."
Housing was a source of economic vitality in the late spring and summer, with starts rising from April through July. But waning sales and construction fit a pattern of gradual slowing in economic activity in this year's final quarter.
Separately, the Conference Board in New York reported that consumer confidence perked up in November, with its index rising to 101.4 from a revised 96.3 in October. This differed from other reports indicating a slowdown in consumer spending.
"This latest rise in confidence suggests that holiday spending could be reasonably lively," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "Gains in confidence have traditionally signaled stronger-than-anticipated retail sales during the holiday season."
David Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said the slowing pace of home building will sap the economy in the fourth quarter and in early 1996.
"The starts number itself may hold up fairly well, but as an engine of growth the housing sector may well have had its spurt," Mr. Seiders said. Other sectors, he said, are going to have to pick up some of the economic momentum.
Last month's fall in housing starts followed a revised decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in September and a 2.8 percent drop in August. The October fall was the sharpest since March, when starts dropped 6.5 percent, the department said. Previously, the department said starts fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September.
Sales are also losing steam. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors said October sales of existing, or previously owned, homes dropped for the first time in six months.
Mortgage rates that were above 9 percent for a 30-year loan at the beginning of the year averaged 7.48 percent in October, down from 7.64 percent in September, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Total starts during October were 7.9 percent lower than they were in October 1994, when they were running at a rate of 1.451 million a year.
The only region in which housing starts improved was the Northeast, where they were 7 percent higher than in September. By contrast, they dropped 8.9 percent in the Midwest and were down 1.5 percent in the South. Starts fell 6.5 percent in the West.

Yanks First In Average Salary

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: AVENTURA, Fla., Nov. 28

 BODY:
In a season when the average major league salary computed by the Players Association dropped by 5 percent, the Yankees became the first team to hit the $2 million mark.
According to figures the union presented to its executive board today at the first session of its annual winter meetings, the Yankees had an average salary of $2,000,271, eclipsing the record of $1,827,539 the Yankees established last year. 
The player relations committee, the clubs' labor arm, has not computed final average salaries, but on its list the Yankees should fall short of $2 million. The latest committee figures, which did not include bonuses for post-season awards, had the Yankees at $1,960,351.
The players and the clubs differ on their figures because the union enhances the value of signing bonuses. The players' average salary for the 1995 season came to $1,110,766. The incomplete player relations committee average was $1,089,621, but will move closer to the players' average when the post-season bonuses are added.
The players' average fell 4.9 percent from the 1994 average of $1,168,263. It marks only the second time since the Players Association began computing average salaries in 1967 that the average dropped. In 1987, when salaries were affected by the owners' collusion against free agents, the average slipped a minuscule .016 percent, from $412,520 to $412,454.
The decrease this year was a result of the economic losses the owners suffered from the players' eight-month strike. When clubs signed players last winter and spring, they induced players to accept smaller salaries because of their losses.
Based on their record average salary, the Yankees had no such problem. But another factor was involved in their precedent-setting number.
Both clubs and players compile salary data based on Aug. 31 rosters and disabled lists. They also include in players' salaries pro-rated shares of signing bonuses, whether or not the players received their bonuses from their present club.
The Yankees acquired David Cone July 28. They paid only the last two months of his $5 million salary, about $2 million, but they were charged not only with his entire salary, but also with a one-third share of the $9 million signing bonus the Kansas City Royals gave him three years ago.
With their inflated valuation of signing bonuses, the Players Association listed Cone at about $8.5 million instead of the about $2 million the Yankees actually paid him.
Second on the players' list were the Atlanta Braves at $1,917,599.
The averages of 11 clubs went up; 17 clubs' averages dropped. The Mets, 27th of 28 on the list, had the largest decrease, from $1,193,288 to $465,891. The Montreal Expos were 28th at $411,142, down from $750,840. Their average was the lowest since the San Diego Padres averaged $378,471 in 1993.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
AIR bags save lives: more than 911 in the United States since 1987, and 374 last year alone, according to the National Center for Statistics and Analysis. More important, perhaps, just in the terms of numbers, they have prevented many thousands of serious and deforming injuries. A friend said she would never again drive a car without an air bag after witnessing a brutal accident in which the driver would almost certainly have been killed but instead walked away with a few bruises because he had been protected by an air bag.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that there are 23 percent fewer deaths than expected among drivers involved in head-on and front-angle crashes of cars equipped with air bags. The devices are more effective at savings lives among those driving large cars (a 30 percent reduction) than among those driving small cars (a 14 percent reduction). 
 A four-year study of 2,300 accidents in New Jersey conducted by plastic surgeons at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick showed that motorists who used both lap and shoulder belts and drove cars equipped with air bags reduced their risk of serious facial injuries by 75 percent. Such drivers were also 90 percent less likely to require intensive hospital care following an accident.
There are now more than 33 million cars on the road equipped with driver-side air bags, and 15 million also have bags to protect front-seat passengers. All passenger cars manufactured after Sept. 1, 1997, will have to be equipped with air bags for both the driver and front-seat passengers. However, nearly all manufacturers are now installing driver-side air bags, and many are also adding passenger-side air bags in all new cars, sports utility vehicles and light trucks.
 
Improving Air Bags
But air bags are not perfect, and neither are the drivers and passengers who ride in cars with air bag protection. Air bags have inflated and injured and even killed passengers in vehicles involved in nothing more than a fender-bender that in all likelihood would not have injured anyone. For example, one child died of a broken neck caused by an air bag that inflated when his grandmother bumped into a concrete wall while parking the car.
Those at greatest risk of injury caused by an air bag are small children, short or obese adults, disabled people and anyone who drives or rides unbelted. Those who sit close to the steering wheel are likely to be struck with great force by an inflating air bag.
Although 43 percent of air bag deployments have resulted in at least one air-bag-related injury, the overwhelming majority of these injuries have been minor.
For example, a review of 614 injuries published earlier this year in the Annals of Emergency Medicine showed that 96 percent were minor, 3 percent were classified as moderate and fewer than 1 percent were considered serious. Scrapes and bruises were the most common injuries. A few cases involved minor cuts, fractures of the forearms or wrists, burns and, rarely, retinal detachments, caused by the force of impact, and hearing loss, caused by the noise of inflation.
The industry is currently working furiously to improve these long-awaited devices so that inappropriate inflations and other preventable air bag accidents will not occur. The next generation of air bags, called "smart bags," will employ sensors that can adjust inflations depending on whether occupants are belted, on their position in their seats, including the distance from the steering wheel or dashboard, and even on their size and weight. Several companies are also considering installing additional air bags to protect occupants in side collisions.
 
Occupants Need Work, Too
The occupants of vehicles also need improvement. In a country in which only 40 to 50 percent of drivers and front-seat passengers use lap-shoulder belts and 35 percent of young children ride unrestrained, air bags threaten to induce even further complacency about buckling up. Yet the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration advises that seat belts remain the main source of protection in any kind of accident, while air bags offer "supplemental protection" only in front-end collisions. Air bags do not protect drivers or passengers in side and rear-end collisions and rollovers; seat belts do. Last year, the administration estimates, seat belts alone saved almost 9,200 lives and prevented more than 211,000 moderate to critical injuries.
The four drivers who have suffered fatal air bag injuries to their heads, chests or both were unbelted when the accidents occurred.
Furthermore, Americans tend not to read directions or heed warnings, especially when they think "there's nothing to it," as might seem to be the case with self-activated air bags. Despite two years of repeated warnings and instructions posted since August 1994 on vehicle visors and infant car seats and in owner's manuals stating that babies in rear-facing car seats should not ride in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger-side air bag, several infants have been killed by air bags because these warnings were ignored.
The child who died in his grandmother's car was sitting in the front seat and was not buckled in, which allowed the air bag to hit his head with undue force. This child was one of about half a dozen-air bag-related fatalities among small children who were riding unbelted in the front seats of vehicles involved in low-speed crashes that the youngsters might otherwise have survived.
 
The Safest Journey
Even if your vehicle has dual air bags, never neglect to fasten the lap-shoulder belt when driving or riding in the front passenger seat. Infants under 20 pounds should always be placed in a rear-facing infant seat in the back seat of the vehicle. For vehicles that have no back seat but have a passenger-side air bag, a manual device should be installed to allow the driver to disengage the passenger-side air bag when an infant is sitting in the front. All children under 12 should ride in the rear and always be buckled in. Make it a rule of the road: the car does not start until everyone's seat belt is properly fastened, and that includes the shoulder belt, when there is one.
The presence of an air bag should not be taken as a license to drive faster or take extra chances on the road. Even with the fullest protection currently available -- a lap-shoulder belt properly fastened and an air bag installed -- fully half the accidents that could result in fatalities still do.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the nation's traffic safety administrator, cautions that "no safety device is a panacea," and that it remains a driver's responsibility to drive safely and never to drive even a short distance when impaired by alcohol or drugs.

HEADLINE: A Society Decides It Can't Go It Alone

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
After a three-year scramble back from the brink of insolvency, the New-York Historical Society has virtually given up hope of remaining independent and is actively seeking a merger or partnership with another institution.
Although the society is in better financial shape than it has been in years, thanks in part to auctioning off pieces of its collection, life there is still hand-to-mouth. And now, officials say they have hit a financial dead end that seems to rule out further substantial progress toward a hoped-for $40 million endowment or much chance of winning $1 million a year in government support. 
 Today, the society will try to woo one potential partner, the Museum of the City of New York, in talks at the office of New York City's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, Schuyler Chapin. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani supports the talks. And while the society has failed at merger talks before, it says that now it is truly interested -- and a much more attractive partner financially than it was a few years ago.
"If the merger doesn't happen, we're not going to go under, but we're going to have to find other partnerships," said Betsy Gotbaum, the society's executive director. "The alternative to a merger is to keep going at this level or lower," she said, calling that path "unacceptable."
All of this is happening while the society is preparing to auction off more of its collections -- some 24,000 items from its library, which is regarded as one of the top historical research libraries in America. To the chagrin of some scholars and archivists, arrangements for the sale are proceeding even while the merger talks progress.
The materials, ranging from comic books to Remington engravings, are expected to sell for less than $1 million, a fraction of the $17.6 million realized from the society's much-debated sales of paintings and other artworks this year. But officials at the society say they feel obligated to raise everything they can, under the strategy developed by their advisory committee and approved by the New York State Attorney General.
That strategy has taken the society a good distance since 1993, when the endowment had shrunk to $6 million and its doors were closed to the public. The society has renovated and reopened its grand old limestone building on Central Park West at 77th Street. It has built its endowment to more than $22 million. And after a period in which its future seemed so uncertain that foundations and other contributors stayed away, it has once again begun to attract private support, like a $7.5 million grant from the Henry Luce Foundation five months ago.
But as Ms. Gotbaum and her trustees now acknowledge, the society is functioning in a bare-bones fashion, and it takes constant begging to keep it even at that level. Although it is not running a deficit, its $5 million budget is the same size as when it was closed. The highly regarded library collection is open only 15 hours a week (Wednesdays through Fridays, noon to 5 P.M.). And there is no way it can list its holdings on line electronically so scholars elsewhere can know what it holds, since there is no money for cataloguers.
Two crucial aspects of the society's financial strategy have not worked out. Although the society received $12 million in emergency money from New York State and New York City and some additional program support, it has failed to secure any permanent government funds. The advisory committee had determined that annual government support of about $1 million was critical to the society's future.
The committee's recommendation that the society develop the empty property in its backyard to bring in another $15 million and raise the endowment to about $40 million also appears unfeasible because of community opposition to any sizable building. Without those extra funds, the society will remain constantly strapped for money, Ms. Gotbaum and others say.
Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the investment banker who headed the society's advisory committee in 1993, does not express surprise that all of the pieces did not fit neatly into place. But he says "it was the only strategy that had a chance to work."
"There were always concerns voiced about individual parts of the package," he said. "The idea was to try to present it as a seamless whole, because in that way you could try to make sure it would all work."
But the idea of a merger with the Museum of the City of New York holds some appeal for him, too. "A combination was not feasible at that time," he said. "But if it is now possible for the two to get together, I think it would be an excellent solution. It is a perfect match. And in this world of much-rationed resources for culture, I think you are going to see more and more mergers."
Raising money to support historical collections and scholarly libraries has always been difficult. Art museums can draw huge audiences with blockbuster shows featuring Picasso or Matisse, and ballet companies can pack their seats with "The Nutcracker" or "Swan Lake." Historical societies and research libraries appeal largely to scholars, a tiny group without deep pockets.
"We're all in trouble to varying degrees," said Charles T. Cullen, president of the 108-year-old Newberry Library in Chicago, the second-largest research library in the United States, after the New York Public Library.
In "The Charitable Nonprofits," William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and three associates concluded that historical societies as a group were less able to earn money from admissions or sales than any other group of nonprofit institutions they examined. This makes them more dependent on endowment income and grants and other private donations than other museums, performing-arts groups, or colleges and universities, they said.
For most historical societies, including the New-York Historical Society, it has also led to a public emphasis on their museum holdings. But while old textbooks and almanacs may be less glamorous than glass paperweights or portraits of Inca kings, the society's strength and reputation among historians have long been in its library. The museum contains some items, like its Audubon watercolors, that are special, but the research library is ranked among the top handful in the nation.
"For me as a graduate student, going to the New-York Historical Society library was like a Little League baseball player getting to play with Mickey Mantle," said Douglas Greenberg, president of the Chicago Historical Society.
The problem of a limited public appetite for historical books and manuscripts also explains why the society is unlikely to raise sizable sums as it auctions off materials from its library of some three million books, manuscripts, newspapers, maps and other holdings.
"Their holdings are irreplaceable, but you can't value them in dollars," said Kevin Guthrie, a former research associate at the Mellon Foundation, whose book on the society is due out in January.
That is not to say there is no market for the books and manuscripts, but it is a limited one. George S. Lowry, president of Swann Galleries, which is handling the library sales, estimates that they will bring in about $500,000 to $700,000, far less than the $17.6 million earned by the sale of its art.
Swann has already begun to move the items from the society and to catalogue them. New York museums and libraries, which are eligible for preferential treatment, have until Dec. 1 to indicate interest. The first public auctions are set for March.
The list of the library items to be sold was actually drawn up two years ago and approved by the Attorney General last year. Hendrik Edelman of Rutgers University, an outside consultant and bibliographer who had assessed the library's holdings in 1989, worked with library employees on what might be sold.
The society's internal acquisition committee and its trustees' collections committee both gave their approval, and the Attorney General's office signed off in September 1994, at the same time that it approved the art sales, although no public disclosure of what was to be sold was made before now.
The society describes the materials being sold as multiple holdings or works that do not relate to its redefined mission of focusing more narrowly on New York and the surrounding region. The choices were made conservatively, and the society's staff was protective of the collections, said Margaret Heilbrun, director of the society's library.
Pointing to a 16th-century "View of the World," a watercolor on parchment adorned with gold leaf that is displayed in the reading room, she said, "That shows how hard we tried to keep things in scope."
But scholars say they cannot judge for themselves because no public list has been issued yet.
"I hope above all that they had good advice," said Patricia U. Bonomi, of New York University, a regular user of the society's library.
The announcement of the sale that was sent to museums and libraries last month contained only a general list of 13 categories to be sold. These included 15,000 British and Continental books from the 16th to 20th centuries, 250 maps of Europe and South America, 130 comic and science fiction books, sheet music from World War I and modern times, children's books from the late 19th and 20th centuries, and wood engravings by Frederic Remington. But even by moving these items from their shelves, the huge library will remain costly to operate.
That is why a merger looks so attractive to the society. A combination would offer some economies of scale and the prospect of enhanced stability that donors care so much about. For the society, a merger with the Museum of the City of New York, which is one of the 31 members of New York City's Cultural Institutions Group, would also make it eligible for the support those institutions receive.
Some historians have suggested that the New York Public Library might offer a more congenial home for the society's library holdings, but the library is not part of the cultural institutions group and would not offer automatic coverage of maintenance and energy costs, although it does receive city money. Ms. Gotbaum said that a deal with the public library, which assessed the society's library last summer, would be "much more complicated."
But a merger with the Museum of the City of New York would not necessarily be trouble-free either. The museum faces its own challenges. While New York City pays for its building costs, it has had trouble maintaining some of its collections, and its building is badly deteriorated. It is now trying to cobble together $18 million in private money to match government money that would support an overhaul and expansion of its space. And it, too, has a scanty endowment (about $8 million), most of it restricted.
Robert R. MacDonald, director of the museum, said he would attend the meeting today. But he made it clear that any merger must be accompanied by enough money to pay for the upkeep of both collections.
"Where are the resources?" he asks. "That's a very real question."

HEADLINE: Chemical to Keep Center, and Its 2,500 Jobs, on Long Island

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Chemical Banking Corporation, the largest private employer on Long Island, intends to keep its credit card processing center in Hicksville, along with the center's 2,500 jobs, after Chemical's pending acquisition of Chase Manhattan, people familiar with the banks' plans said yesterday.
Chase moved all of its credit card facilities to regions with lower costs years ago, and Long Island politicians were worried that the combined bank would take the Chemical jobs out of the state as well. 
 "As soon as I learned of the merger back in August and realized the potential for the loss of jobs, I wrote a letter to Chemical asking them to make every effort to retain their staff here," the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said last night.
"Clearly the fact that they have decided to stay here, after being lured by other areas of the country, is proof that Long Island is a good place to live and work," said Mr. Gulotta, a Republican.
The Long Island economy has been beset by job losses, including drastic reductions in employment by Grumman Corporation after the aerospace concern was acquired by Los Angeles-based Northrop Corporation last year. Another major bank, Natwest Bancorp, moved operations from Long Island to Scranton, Pa., earlier this year.
Thus Chemical's announcement is seen as a boon to Long Island, even though the bank is not promising to add any new jobs in Hicksville. The bank is expected to announce its decision at a news conference today that will be attended by Gov. George E. Pataki, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and a raft of bank officials.
"At a time when they could have followed the lead of the businesses that moved thousands of jobs out of New York during the last 12 years, the banks have illustrated their commitment to New York and Long Island," Governor Pataki said.
A Chemical spokesman reached last night declined to comment.
Chemical was under intense political pressure to keep the Hicksville facility open. For one thing, Long Island is the home of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the chairman of the powerful Senate Banking Committee.
A number of New York politicians have asked the Federal Reserve to block the acquisition, complaining that the two banks have not promised to lend enough to poor neighborhoods.
The Hicksville facility was originally built by Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and became a Chemical operation when those two banks merged in 1992. In the 1980's, Manufacturers Hanover had successfully lobbied New York State to raise its interest rate ceilings in return for a promise to keep its credit card operation in Hicksville. Charles Walsh, the executive who ran Manufacturers Hanover's credit-card unit and later Chemical's, is seen as a proponent of the Hicksville facility and has been named to run the same business for the combined bank.
The bank, which will largely be run by Chemical management but will use the more prestigious Chase name, will be the country's third largest credit card issuer with 20 million card holders, representing about $21 billion in credit card debt.
Chemical and Chase expect to close 100 branches and eliminate 12,000 of 75,000 jobs a result of the merger, as many as half of them in the New York area. These moves will save $1.5 billion a year.
Chase maintains credit card operations in Tampa, Fla., Tempe, Ariz., and Wilmington, Del., and Chemical has another facility in Matteson, Ill. None of these operations is likely to close after the merger, and new jobs are likely to be added in Chase's Arizona facility, the one built most recently, people familiar with the bank's plans said.

HEADLINE: Pension Funds Reverse Decade Of Deterioration

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Corporate pension funds moved into a much better position last year to pay promised retirement benefits, reversing more than a decade of deteriorating finances, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said yesterday.
Last year, about 8,000 companies with Government-insured pension plans -- about one-fifth of the total -- fell approximately $31 billion short of covering what they owe to roughly eight million workers and retirees, the Government agency said. That is a sharp improvement from 1993, when about 10,000 companies faced a gap of some $71 billion. In 1983, the shortfall was $10 billion, or about $15.4 billion in today's dollars. 
 Another 37,000 companies covering 24 million workers have pension plans with enough money set aside to cover their obligations or even to generate a surplus. As a group last year, they had 16 percent more money than they needed to pay retirement benefits already earned, compared with a scant 1 percent surplus in 1993. Still, these plans were in far better shape in 1988 -- before the recession of the early 1990's -- when the overall surplus among healthy pension plans was 48 percent.
"Traditional pensions are getting stronger and that is good news for workers and retirees," said Martin Slate, executive director of the pension agency.
Mr. Slate attributed the narrowing of the pension funding gap to three factors: higher interest rates, extra infusions of cash by companies and an early warning program in which the pension agency starts negotiating with companies at the first sign that a plan is in financial straits.
But for all the improvement, the Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, warned yesterday that the mammoth catch-all budget bill passed by Congress could reverse this trend and cause a sharp deterioration in the overall health of the traditional defined benefit pension system under which retirees are paid a guaranteed monthly stipend. Under a provision in the bill, companies with surplus assets in their pension plans would be allowed under certain circumstances to use some of that money for other purposes. President Clinton plans to veto the bill but many of its provisions are likely to survive any compromise legislation.
"We have finally put pension funding on the right track," Mr. Reich said. "But if Congress persists in allowing tens of billions of dollars to be taken from pensions it could derail pension security for America's working men and women."
Supporters of the legislation, however, say that some plans have such huge surpluses that companies should be allowed to tap them to pay for other employee benefits. Companies also argue that allowing pension plans to serve as potential nest eggs for hard times will encourage the survival of defined benefit plans.
James B. Lockhart, an investment banker who ran the pension agency during the Bush Administration, called Mr. Reich's remarks "fear mongering," arguing that only the healthiest plans -- not the shaky ones that are underfunded -- would be eligible to make withdrawals.
The improvement in the ability of companies to finance their pensions can be traced to both temporary and permanent sources.
Interest rates were higher in 1994, but they declined again this year. When rates go up, the future value of current obligations goes down and money invested in bonds generates a higher return. Raymond Sharp, an actuary at Buck Consultants, a leading pension consulting company, said a 1 percent rise in interest rates could reduce pension liabilities by 10 to 15 percent. Improvements in the stock market also make it easier for companies to meet their pension obligations.
Companies have also taken steps in recent years to fill the gap for good. In 1994 employers put an extra $12 billion into pension plans with shortfalls. The biggest infusion came from the General Motors Corporation, which put up $9.6 billion above its normal annual contribution. Other companies making extra payments into their pension plans included Goodyear, $165 million, and Loews, $157 million.
G.M.'s contribution shifted the biggest concentration of pension shortfall from the auto industry to the steel industry. Last year, less than one-twentieth of the shortfall was in the auto industry compared with one-third in 1993. The steel industry accounted for slightly more than 20 percent of the $31 billion gap.
The troubled plans had 87 percent of the funding needed in 1994, up from 82 percent in 1993.
While the overall funding gap was narrowed substantially, some big plans remain in serious jeopardy. Mr. Reich and Mr. Slate said that 1.2 million workers were employed at 150 companies with bonds rated below investment grade, suggesting that the companies could be in serious trouble if the economy falters. These 150 companies, which cover about 15 percent of the workers whose pension plans face a shortfall, account for one-third of the gap.

Mexican Stocks Rise 4%, Accelerating a 2-Week Recovery

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Mexican stocks surged to their highest level in 13 months today, in a rally that has propelled the market upward on 9 of the last 10 trading days and all but dissipated the gloom that prevailed here last month.
"It's been really incredible, the strength of this thing, and how fast it has whipped around," said Robert J. Pelosky, director of Latin American research at Morgan Stanley. 
 The main Mexico City stock index increased by 109.04 points, or 4.17 percent, in heavy volume today, closing at 2,724.50. With that increase, the index has risen 21.55 percent in two weeks.
In New York, American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, the giant state telephone company that makes up about one-fourth of the market capitalization, rose 27/16 , to 347/16 in trading of 12.9 million units. In the last seven New York sessions, the price of Telmex has increased more than 29 percent. Other Mexican issues, including the industrial holding company Desc, Grupo Televisa and Grupo Tribasa, also made steep gains.
"This is a highly volatile market," said Jorge Mariscal, chief strategist for Latin American equities at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It had been three or four very bad weeks, and now we have a good couple of weeks. I just wish it would even out."
Traders said the market began climbing today immediately after its opening and got a strong boost at midmorning when 38 of Mexico's top corporate executives announced in a meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo that their companies would collectively invest $6.2 billion in Mexico during 1996, an increase of 40 percent over this year.
"That had a strong impact immediately," said Araceli Espinosa Elguea of the brokerage Probursa.
Also fueling the market surge were a stronger peso, lower interest rates and an announcement that the Government had increased a planned $500 million bond offering in Europe to $1.5 billion because of strong demand, analysts said.
The peso strengthened by nearly 2 percent, closing here at 7.475 to the dollar, compared with 7.615 on Tuesday. A stronger peso increases the value of peso-denominated stocks.
Lower interest rates also fed the market rally. On Tuesday, the demand was high for 28-day Mexican treasury bills, which determine how much companies and Mexican consumers will pay to borrow short-term money, and yields fell, declining 128 basis points, to 53.46 percent from 54.74 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The high demand in the European bond offering, involving a one-year, variable-rate issue, suggested that investors might be putting aside lingering worries over the heavy losses they had suffered in the peso devaluation last December.
"The Government is being able to tap the debt market in a very sizable amount, and at a lower cost," said Luis R. Luis, managing director at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. "That's always stimulative for the stock market, and it's very good news for Mexico."

Treasury Securities Surge; Yields at Nearly 2-Year Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday, driving yields down to their lowest levels in nearly two years, as a sale of five-year notes came close to expectations.
Some of the early buying was attributed to anticipation of strong demand at the sale of $12 billion in new five-year notes. And indeed the yield at the auction was slightly lower than expected, at 5.625 percent, and the lowest since Feb. 24, 1994. 
 While the results were not as impressive as those at Tuesday's auction of new two-year notes, they were still considered strong, helping to keep prices firm through the afternoon.
Also bolstering prices yesterday was optimism among some market participants that interest rates would soon be lowered in the United States and in Europe. Lower interest rates overseas would make United States securities more attractive.
Still, traders noted that some gains yesterday could be attributed to end-of-the-month buying.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32 , to 109 6/32 , pushing its yield down to 6.19 percent, from 6.23 percent on Tuesday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Yesterday's long bond yield was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1994, nearly a month before the Federal Reserve started a series of increases in short-term interest rates.
Today, the market turns its attention to a report on durable goods orders in October and a survey by the Chicago Purchasing Management Association.
Donald Fine, chief market strategist for Chase Securities, said he expected a decline in durable goods in October following strong gains in both August and September. But while the rate of growth for durable goods orders is still noticeably positive, he says, it nevertheless is running at about half the pace of last year.
The Chicago purchasing managers' index is also expected to show a decline in November after a sharp rise in October.
"Looking at the broader picture, economic growth appears to be slowing both in the fourth quarter and in terms of the longer-run trend rate of growth," Mr. Fine said, "all of which is taking place in an inflationary environment that can only characterized as subdued, benign and nonthreatening."
"In my view the chances of the economy accelerating and producing an inflation threat have lessened, while at the same time the chances of a further deterioration in economic growth have increased, although not to a point where a recession would become an significant risk," he said.
As a result, Mr. Fine said, he expects the Fed will lower short-term interest rates when policy makers meet on Dec. 19.
In the futures market, traders shifted their attention yesterday to the March bond contract, which is now the most active contract. The Chicago Board of Trade uses only four months for its bond contracts: December, March, June and September.
The March bond contract managed to close above the top of its previous multiweek range, at 1188/32 . The high was 1189/32 and the low was 11726/32 .
Robin Mesch, an officer at Thomson Research of Boston, said:
"There are signs all over the technicals that a bullish picture is perservering.
" And I see a 120 price on the bond futures contract by the end of December or early into the new year. There's just nothing there to say that it isn't going higher."
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Hondo Oil's fortunes brighten, but some investors are wary.

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

 BODY:
AT the beginning of the year, it looked as if Robert O. Anderson, the former chief executive of ARCO, had run out of luck in founding the Hondo Oil and Gas Company instead of kicking back on his New Mexico ranch to enjoy his retirement. Having sold off most of what he owned to pursue a single natural gas project in the foothills of the Colombian Andes, he had only a vague idea of how much he would find. He had no customers. Creditors and short-sellers were closing in.
But in the last few months, almost everything has gone right for Hondo. A second well has indicated that the project is probably sitting on 9 to 12 trillion cubic feet of gas, about twice the earlier estimates, analysts said. That amount of gas would be valued at billions of dollars, even before counting petroleum liquids that might be worth almost as much. 
 Hondo, based in Roswell, N.M., has also found a buyer for the gas. The company reached an agreement to sell 80 million cubic feet of natural gas a day, most of what the two wells can produce, to a refinery owned by Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil and natural gas company. The refinery will then be able to substitute natural gas for fuel oil in its own operations, freeing the oil for other domestic uses or export.
Amoco, which holds a 60 percent interest in the Colombia project to Hondo's 30 percent, brings the skills and financial strength to build the $100 million, 55-mile pipeline needed to transport gas to the refinery. The pipe has already arrived in Colombia and Amoco expects to begin laying it next year, although the completion date is uncertain.
Hondo's major creditor was Lonrho, the British conglomerate, to which Mr. Anderson had personally guaranteed $35 million. He has settled Hondo's debts and his own by giving Lonrho about 27 percent of the company, raising Lonrho's stake to about 66 percent and cutting his own to 12 percent.
Hondo also has some assurance now that its good news will be publicized on Wall Street. It was nearly bereft of analyst attention at influential investment firms until August, when Paul Hayes, with Oppenheimer & Company, began coverage by recommending it. After the stock had sunk as low as $8.50 earlier this year, it rose to a peak of $24.375 in August.
Since then, Hondo has dropped back, and closed yesterday on the American Stock Exchange at $14.625, off 12.5 cents. There are still many reasons investors remain squeamish. Given Amoco's interest and the Colombian Government's rights to half the profits under the project agreement, Hondo would receive only a fraction of any payoff. And because emptying such a huge natural gas reservoir just to power the oil refinery would take a few centuries, Amoco and Hondo hope to find broader markets. The plan: develop power plants for a nation that needs more electricity, and then fuel the power plants with natural gas. It is a strategy practiced around the world, but one always fraught with political and economic risks.
Hondo's progress has scared away only some of the short-sellers. These investors, who sell borrowed shares in the hopes of a price drop, at which point they buy back the shares to repay the loan and pocket the difference, have reduced their positions but are still short about 750,000 of the 13 million shares outstanding. "They don't know as much as I do," Mr. Anderson said with a chuckle. "I don't envy them."
Mr. Anderson, Hondo's chairman and, he said, its "resident dreamer," wants to build the first natural gas pipeline through Central America, but others in the industry call this at best a very long-range plan.
Hondo will try to strike oil, far easier to market than natural gas, with the project's third well, likely to be completed by late next summer. Otherwise, Mr. Hayes sees no earnings until the third quarter of 1997. But if Mr. Anderson, at age 78, is willing to make a long-term bet, investors who are patient and better diversified than he is might want to as well.

Dollar Up vs. Pound and Mark As Traders Expect a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a 16-month high against the British pound and gained against the German mark as expectations grew that interest rates in those two countries would soon be lowered.
The pound slumped on speculation that British policy makers would have to cut interest rates soon if they intended to meet the economic growth forecasts set forth in the Government's 1996-97 budget, which was announced on Tuesday. 
 "Sterling was the main event today," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "We had a selloff after that unspectacular budget."
The pound tumbled as much as 1.2 percent, to a 16-month low of $1.5253, before recouping some of its losses. In New York trading late yesterday, it was at $1.5336, down from $1.5430 on Tuesday.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, who must approve British rate changes, said yesterday that the Government's growth forecast did not require a cut in the base lending rate, which is now 6.75 percent.
But analyst and currency traders were skeptical. In its budget, the Conservative Government forecast annual economic growth of 3 percent in the coming year.
"The only way the Government can come even remotely close to making this budget work out as planned is to cut base rates, fast," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.
The dollar was bolstered against the German mark ahead of a policy meeting by the Bundesbank today. Recent evidence that German inflation remains subdued has fueled expectations that the central bank will cut interest rates, perhaps as early as today.
Those expectations were not dampened by a surprise increase in Germany's 14-day securities repurchase rate, an important money-market rate. The rate rose 1 basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.98 percent at the central bank's weekly money market transactions.
The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said the rise in the rate did not signal a change in monetary policy.
The dollar rose to an eight-week high of 1.4411 marks before settling to 1.4366 marks, up from 1.4335 late Tuesday.
In other trading, the dollar rose to 101.58 Japanese yen from 101.15.

HEADLINE: Toyota Truck Plant Expected in Indiana

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to announce on Thursday that it has selected southwestern Indiana, an area hurt by a declining coal industry, as the site for a $1 billion pickup-truck plant with 1,300 jobs.
Toyota scheduled "a major business announcement" for Thursday afternoon in Princeton, Ind. State and local officials, cautioning today that a deal had not yet been signed, were nonetheless cheered by the prospect of new jobs. 
 Press reports in Indiana said Toyota had chosen a site just outside Princeton, about 20 miles north of Evansville, Ind., and about midway between Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis.
The community is served by two railroads, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, and by two utilities, PSI Energy, a unit of the Cinergy Corporation, and the Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company. With such competition, Toyota is expected to be able to reach favorable terms for power and rail service.
Among states also seeking the plant were New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky. Doug Smith, Toyota's vice president for government affairs, said geography had worked against New Jersey because auto-parts suppliers were concentrated in the Midwest.
Toyota has said that its fourth plant in North America will produce T100 midsize pickup trucks, which are now made only in Japan. Toyota produces passenger cars in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge, Ontario, and at a plant in Fremont, Calif., jointly owned with General Motors.
The company has said that its new pickup plant, to be completed in 1998, will be able to make 100,000 trucks a year for sale in North America.
Fred Nation, a spokesman for Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, estimated that combined state and local incentives for the plant would amount to less than $75 million, adding that Toyota was still negotiating over local incentives like property taxes. The state's portion, he said, totaled $29.8 million, including $2.8 million in worker-training grants.
The Indiana Department of Work Force Development will help provide job candidates for the nonunion plant, including skilled but unemployed miners. Demand for Indiana's high-sulfur coal has declined with Federal clean-air requirements, eliminating jobs in the region's once-dominant coal industry.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
With Japan hurting, the U.S. mutes chauvinist trade fears.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES the news from Washington is not what they say but what they don't say: Have you noticed that the Clinton Administration has stopped bashing Japan? It's possible, of course, that the White House has simply been distracted by more urgent matters like the budget and next year's election.
But the true explanation, it seems, was signaled earlier this month in a speech by Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. Without quite saying so, he suggested that the sophomoric notion of trade as war had lost its appeal now that the Japanese economy has been badly wounded by recession. "Prosperity, unlike power, is not a zero sum game," he said. 
 Michael Aho, an economist at Prudential Securities, interprets the Administration's less antagonistic disposition toward Japan more bluntly. "This is just not the same Godzilla that was eating our lunch," he said. Indeed, the myriad problems facing the Japanese economy -- by contrast the American economy, for all its problems, has enjoyed relative success in recent years -- raise the issue of whether Tokyo is up to the challenges of economic maturity.
Japan, so long the Energizer bunny of national economies, has barely twitched in the last four years. And no wonder: the real estate and stock markets, both prone to speculative excesses, have crashed and burned.
Consequently, many of Japan's largest banks are effectively moribund, with total unfunded liabilities that far exceed the bill for bailing out depositors in America's savings and loan debacle. The overvalued yen has made Japanese exporters far less competitive in world markets, pushing thousands of smaller companies into bankruptcy, forcing dozen of larger ones to drop lifetime employment guarantees and leaving the unemployment rate, while still low by international standards, at nearly double its traditional level.
Worst of all, weak elected governments unable to sway the conservative bureaucracies that control the levers of power have failed to rise to the occasion.
No mechanism has been created to bail out edgy bank depositors. Cuts in interest rates, which have fallen so low there is little room for further reductions, failed to cheer securities markets. Tokyo's half-hearted fiscal stimulus packages, which did not rescue the economy, have actually made things worse by convincing many people that nothing can be done at all.
Indeed, while hundreds of billions of dollars worth of productive capacity sit idle and Japanese manufacturers are shifting plants to Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo remains preoccupied with the budget deficit. The last thing the Japanese economy needs is a tax increase, yet consumption taxes are still set to rise in 1997. "The Ministry of Finance is brain dead," John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute concluded.
Mr. Makin argues that the Japanese economy will not climb back until Tokyo accepts the need for fundamental change. He advocates tax changes that favor long-suffering consumers, deregulation that breathes enterprise into inefficient service industries and a looser monetary policy that drives down the value of the yen by another 20 to 30 percent.
Others are not as pessimistic. Mr. Aho predicts a weak recovery in 1996 with 2.5 percent growth. Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, reminds us that Japan is still blessed by a strong work ethic, a superbly trained labor force and a high savings rate. "I don't think there is anything so structurally wrong with the economy that would lead to three more years as bad as the last three," Mr. Saxonhouse said.
Still, it is hard to find anyone who expects Japan to get back on the fast track any time soon. Mr. Saxonhouse alludes to the "bicycle theory" of economic development -- the idea that rapid growth is relatively easy to keep going, but hard to restart once it stalls.
The parochial question is what Japan's expulsion from the Eden of fast-growing economies means for America. Sophisticated analysts, including some members of the Clinton Administration, never equated Japan's success with America's failure. Quite the opposite: "We'd all feel better if Japan were coming out of recession," Mr. Saxonhouse said, giving it the wherewithal to buy more American products.
A subtler question -- and the focus of Mr. Summers's analysis -- is whether the stagnation of the heavily regulated Japanese economy makes free-wheeling, American-style capitalism the more attractive model for rich nations. It is certainly true, as Mr. Summers puts it, that "American firms have emerged as leaders in almost everything that one associates with the post-industrial economy." Left to be answered is whether America's poor schools and weak savings -- the mirror image of Japan's devotion to education and thrift -- will drag the economy down over the long haul.
The hope, buoyed by Mr. Summers's olive branch, is that the Administration will stop playing to chauvinist trade fears that highlight peripheral issues. Then, the countries can focus on the real problems bedeviling their economies.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Seagram Reports a Deficit Of $55 Million in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Seagram Company said yesterday that it took a pretax charge of $290 million in the third quarter to trim its wine and spirits business, resulting in a loss of $55 million.
The charge, which was higher than what analysts had expected, will cover job cuts and closing some warehouses, bottling plants and distilleries, mostly in Europe, where business has been weak. 
 The company reported a loss of $55 million, or 15 cents a share, for the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, compared with a profit of $199 million in the quarter a year earlier. Although based in Montreal, Seagram, a beverage and entertainment company, reports in United States dollars.
Revenues increased 92.8 percent, to $2.92 billion from $1.51 billion, reflecting Seagram's acquisition of 80 percent of MCA Inc. in June and the juice beverage business of the Dole Food Company in May.
The charge amounted to about $211 million after taxes, or 57 cents a share. Without it, Seagram would have earned $156 million, or 42 cents a share.
The gain was more than the average estimate of 40 cents a share from five analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
Shares of Seagram rose 12.5 cents yesterday, to $37.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"The engine for this quarter was filmed entertainment," Edgar Bronfman Jr., Seagram's chief executive, said from his office in New York. He said the success of MCA's "Casper" and "Apollo 13" was primarily responsible for the third-quarter growth.
Under MCA, Seagram runs Universal Pictures, theme parks, MCA Records, Geffen Records and a television production unit.
Seagram financed the purchase of MCA from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company by selling most of its stake in E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company back to Du Pont for $8.8 billion. Dividends from the Du Pont holding helped bolster earnings in the quarter a year earlier.
In the most recent quarter, Seagram's operating cash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- rose to $481 million from $257 million. Analysts consider operating cash flow to be an important gauge of a media company, although Seagram is still chiefly a beverage company.
The cutbacks in Seagram's wine and spirits business come as the company's profit in Europe has been hampered for some time by weak economic growth, declining consumption and price competition, particularly from Guinness P.L.C., analysts said. Results have also been weak in Venezuela, Brazil and Japan, they said.
Most of the steps will be completed in six to 12 months, Mr. Bronfman said. He said the resulting savings "will far exceed the charge we are taking today."
He said he hopes Seagram's spirits and wine business will post double-digit gains in operating profit after the changes.
Seagram began making changes at its beverage division last year and took a fiscal year 1995 pretax charge of $35 million to cover the costs, Mr. Bronfman said.
Brian Lomas, an analyst at Scotia McLeod in Montreal, agreed. "Ultimately, this will improve beverage margins," he said.

The latest third-quarter results reflected the first full quarter of MCA Inc. and the juice beverage operations acquired from the Dole Food Company.
The charge in the latest quarter reflected provision for cost reduction programs and business improvements in the company's beverage businesses.
Principally, the charge was related to Seagram's global spirits and wine manufacturing, marketing and distribution systems; provision for rationalization of facilities, including lease terminations in the United States and Europe, and provision for severance and other costs related to the company's continuing re-engineering program.
The results are for the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Apple Computer Co-Founder Strikes Gold With New Stock

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 29

 BODY:
In the world of high technology, which keeps score in part by tracking the ups and downs of the stock market, Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer, re-emerged today as a captain of industry.
Mr. Jobs's company, Pixar Animation Studios, the maker of the blockbuster movie "Toy Story," offered its stock to the public today, and by the end of trading the shares had almost doubled in price. As such, his Pixar stake of 80.2 percent was worth more than $1 billion on paper -- more than the value of his Apple stock at any time during the eight years he ran that company. 
 The windfall for Mr. Jobs is yet another example of the stock market's extraordinary upward momentum this year, particularly in shares of technology companies. Indeed, the market reached another record today as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.46 points, to 5,105.56, its 65th high of the year. [Page D10.]
Mr. Jobs invested $60 million in Pixar and spent nine years waiting for his payoff and his story does have mythic overtones for the computer industry. Mr. Jobs, 40, has long been a mercurial figure in Silicon Valley's hot-house culture, which values entrepreneurs with vision and personal drive -- but which also sees most of its start-up ventures end in failure.
With his gains, Mr. Jobs joins the ranks of technology billionaires in just one day. Most recently, James H. Clark, the founder of the Netscape Communications Corporation, saw his paper wealth pass the $1 billion mark, as his Netscape shares climbed from their initial offering price of $28 on Aug. 8 to $140 today.Mr. Clark invested only $4.1 million to start his company 19 months ago.
With Stephen Wozniak, Mr. Jobs founded Apple in a Cupertino, Calif., garage in 1976. By the early 1980's, Mr. Jobs had risen to international prominence as the personal computer began to transform society.
But that was not to last. In 1985, he was driven from Apple by John Sculley, who Mr. Jobs had hired several years earlier as Apple's president. The following year, Mr. Jobs started Next Inc., which has tried with little success to compete with Apple. As such, Mr. Jobs largely fell out of the industry limelight in recent years.
It was almost as a footnote that Mr. Jobs bought Pixar, a tiny computer company specializing in ultrahigh-resolution computer animation technology, from Lucasfilm for $60 million in 1986.
But today, that footnote symbolized the long-heralded convergence of Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
Pixar's stock was initially priced at $22 a share on Tuesday by the underwriters taking it to the public market. That meant Mr. Jobs's stake was already worth on paper roughly $660 million -- assuming the offering of six million Pixar shares was successful.
And it certainly was. Pixar's shares shot up to $45.50 during their first hour of trading today on the Nasdaq market. Trading had to be delayed because there were too many orders to buy and not enough sellers. The stock eventually traded as high as $49.50 before falling back to close at $39 in heavy trading of 4.8 million shares.
Today, at the close of trading, Mr. Jobs's roughly 30 million Pixar shares were worth about $1.17 billion on paper, a one-day profit of more than $500 million. Of course, there is no guarantee that Pixar's shares will continue to trade as high as $39.
Pixar, which is based in Richmond, Calif., across the bay from San Francisco, is a digital animation studio that relies on computers rather than cameras to make movies. "Toy Story," which was Pixar's first full-length computer-animated effort, was the top box-office draw last weekend, grossing $38 million. The Walt Disney Company, which is distributing "Toy Story," has also hired Pixar to create two other movies.
The success of "Toy Story" is spreading. Toys related to the movie are already on sale for the Christmas season. And a CD-ROM version of the movie is in the works for next Christmas.
Silicon Valley industry watchers said Mr. Jobs's financial reward -- even if it turns out to be fleeting -- was well deserved, since he held onto his Pixar investment through a difficult decade.
"The entrepreneur side of me says, 'Hey, this guy put $60 million into the deal and took a major risk, now he's getting his payback,' " said Anthony Perkins, editor in chief of The Red Herring, a technology and entertainment business magazine based in San Francisco.
When Mr. Jobs first bought Pixar, the company was a manufacturer of specialized high-end graphics computers and software. Only in recent years has he transformed it into a digital movie production company, following the original vision of Pixar's founders, a small group of computer researchers who were pioneers in computer animation.
Mr. Jobs contended today that the money did not mean much to him. Instead, he said he was much more ecstatic that the movie was getting widespread positive reviews.
"There's no yacht in my future," he said. "I've never done this for the money, but I'm grateful that people are believing in our dream and the reality of our achievements."
At Apple Computer, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Wozniak each initially had 8.3 million shares that were worth $28.75 apiece on Dec. 13, 1980, the first day Apple's shares were traded. That gave Mr. Jobs, who was then 25 years old, a worth on paper of $239 million.
Apple's stock peaked in 1987 at $82.25. At that point, Mr. Jobs's original shares would have been worth $683 million. But after losing a bitter battle for the control of Apple in 1985, Mr. Jobs quit and then quickly sold out while Apple's shares were trading below their initial offering price. Industry executives have estimated that he left the company with about $100 million.
In a way, Mr. Jobs's experience at becoming a billionaire parallels that of Mr. Clark of Netscape. Both are remarkable Silicon Valley comeback stories, in a competitive environment in which two-time winners are unusual. Indeed, Mr. Clark founded Netscape last year only after he left the work station maker Silicon Graphics, another company he founded, after a falling-out with its president.
"The two guys were both Silicon Valley outsiders and they've both come booming back," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. "You can never count anyone out."
But both men still face imposing challenges in proving they can sustain Wall Street's early interest in their ventures. Pixar needs to show that it is not a one-hit wonder.
"The future value of Pixar is a very simple function of their ability to produce another great movie," said Roger McNamee, general partner of Integral Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., investment firm.
And although the market is treating Pixar as a technology play today, the economics of its business are now far different from most technology companies.
"Pixar needs to be considered in a very different light than any of the big Silicon Valley success stories," said Jim Breyer, managing general partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. "This is fundamentally an entertainment model."
Pixar has lost money in each of the last five years, based on revenues that have ranged from $3.35 million in 1990 to $5.59 million in 1994. The company can still look forward to making at least two more movies for Disney. But Pixar said its second animated movie would not be out before the end of 1998 at the earliest.

HEADLINE: Tensions Build Again in Haiti, Imperiling Peace

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Even as the United States prepares to send troops to Bosnia, the Clinton Administration suddenly finds itself struggling to prevent the unraveling of a fragile peace that began here barely a year ago with the arrival of 20,000 American soldiers at the head of an international peacekeeping force.
In little more than a month, the American commitment to Haiti and to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom American military might restored to power in an effort to rebuild democracy in Haiti, has gone from showcase to headache. 
 Relations with the Aristide Government are deteriorating, political violence has re-emerged, the economy is on the skids and Haitians have begun expressing dissatisfaction with the foreign presence here.
"If you blancs are not going to help President Aristide, then you should just leave us alone," said Gerard Joseph, a university student who was taking part in a pro-Aristide demonstration outside the National Palace this morning, using a Creole word that means both "foreigners" and "whites."
Now Washington may also have to contend with a resurgence of the "boat people" problem that provoked the American intervention. More Haitians have been picked up in the Caribbean over the last week than during the entire year following Mr. Aristide's return to office on Oct. 15, 1994. Today 577 were brought back here on a pair of United States Coast Guard cutters,
Even the reasons for the discord are a matter of dispute, with each side citing different instances of the other's supposed perfidy.
"All the buried resentments are suddenly coming to the surface," said a Latin American diplomat here. "The potential for this whole operation coming apart is growing by the day."
As the United States sees it, Mr. Aristide is engaged in a dangerous flirtation with a movement that wants him to cancel a presidential election scheduled to take place in less than three weeks and remain in office three more years, in contravention of an agreement he made last year with the United States.
Those concerns were heightened by an incendiary speech he delivered this month, urging his followers to "go to the neighborhoods where there are big houses and heavy weapons" to help the police disarm paramilitary thugs.
Haitians, on the other hand, point to a lack of support by Washington for their disarmament efforts and its delay in returning more than 150,000 pages of documents seized last year by American troops from the Haitian military and paramilitary groups and now in the hands of American intelligence agencies. They also resent the recent suspension of economic aid by the United States to show its displeasure with Mr. Aristide's economic policies.
The dispute has jeopardized the objective that has motivated American policy since troops first landed here on Sept. 19, 1994: carrying out a credible presidential vote this Dec. 17 and a peaceful transfer of power next Feb. 7 to Mr. Aristide's democratically elected successor.
On Thanksgiving Day, Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, spent more than three hours with Mr. Aristide here, discussing the transition timetable and seeking an ironclad commitment that the Haitian leader will indeed step down.
"Aristide told Lake that he will leave, but said that he has to do it his way," an American official here said when asked to summarize the meeting.
One day later, however, the Haitian leader cast doubts on those assurances when he told a conference of his supporters that "if you want three more years, I will not turn my back on you" and "I want what you want."
The uncertainty about Mr. Aristide's intentions remains, and his Government continues to send mixed signals. The newspaper Libete published an interview today quoting the President as saying he will leave office when his term ends on Feb. 7, but Government officials said a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting discussed a proposal that he stay on, and well-organized demonstrators this morning paraded in front of the National Palace with banners demanding "three more years" for the President.
"I am leaving on Feb. 7," Mr. Aristide said in the interview with Libete, a Creole-language weekly affiliated with the same "theology of liberation" wing of the Roman Catholic Church to which Mr. Aristide belonged during his priesthood.
When asked if he supported Rene Preval, the candidate of the governing Lavalas movement, Mr. Aristide replied, "Wait, watch and observe."
In an interview here, a senior adviser to Mr. Aristide dismissed the Clinton Administration's concerns as groundless. Much of what the Haitian leader has been saying and doing recently is "for internal consumption," he said, and is not intended to disturb relations with the United States and the United Nations.
"He is in a phase where everyone is saying he is a puppet of the foreigners, and if he is seen as a puppet, Preval will also be seen as a puppet, and the opposition can denounce that," the adviser said. "He has to take the electorate with him and say, 'I am my own man, and I know what I am doing.' "
But most opposition political parties, including the one under whose banner Mr. Aristide ran in 1990, are boycotting the election, leaving an undistinguished field that one European diplomat here caustically described as "a dauphin and 13 pretenders." One candidate, Dieuveuil Joseph, claims to be a reincarnation of the Virgin Mary.
Those political uncertainties have further weakened the Haitian economy, which has failed to attract foreign investment since Mr. Aristide's return and now faces the threat of a cut off of foreign aid because of his failure to privatize inefficient state-owned companies. The gourde lost 20 percent of its value before the Government began last week to prop it up, dipping into its small stock of foreign reserves to the tune of $1 million a day.
With the growing weakness of the economy has come an upsurge in the number of people trying to reach Florida in unseaworthy vessels.
Fewer than 300 "boat people" were intercepted in the 13 months ending Nov. 15, but the Coast Guard has since picked up more than 1,100 aboard two large freighters, and 47 more are believed to have drowned when a smaller ship sank last weekend.
"We don't think that it represents a trend," Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the American Embassy, said in an interview at the port here as the Coast Guard cutter Northland unloaded the first group of Haitians. "We're obviously concerned, having had 1,000 people intercepted in the last week," he continued, "but we can't say we have a problem."
Mr. Schrager linked the increase in interceptions on the high seas to the end of the hurricane season and described the returnees as "economic refugees" rather than people fleeing political strife.
"There is no reason to believe the election, the security situation or the recent surge of violence have spurred these boat people," he added.
As they waited in line for bus fare back to their homes, several of the returnees -- who were mostly young men -- attributed their decision to leave Haiti to what they called "la misere."
Echoing remarks by several others, one young man, who like the others would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said, "There is no work, and we have no food."

HEADLINE: Officials Assure Democrats of a Veto of the Welfare Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, today catalogued the Administration's objections to a Republican welfare bill in an effort to reassure Democrats who fear the President may ultimately sign the measure.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, has said Mr. Clinton will veto the bill. But Democrats in Congress and even some Administration officials say they are unsure of the President's intentions because he has shifted position on the issue in the last two years. 
 Dr. Shalala set forth the reasons for a veto in a speech today to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, saying the legislation would not guarantee child care for welfare recipients who would be required to work.
"Child care must be the foundation of any real approach to welfare reform," she said. "A car won't run without an engine. A jet won't fly without wings. And welfare reform will not work without good child care."
Many provisions of the welfare bill have been incorporated in a separate bill to balance the Federal budget in seven years. In addition, Republicans expect to send Mr. Clinton a freestanding welfare bill.
After Mr. Clinton met with Democratic senators in the Capitol on Tuesday, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, said of the President: "He doesn't like the welfare bill. He will veto that by itself."
Mr. Kerrey's report cheered officials at the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Labor. They have been urging Mr. Clinton to veto the welfare bill, but say they fear he may approve a revised version.
An Administration official said Mr. Clinton wanted to send a clear signal to Democrats that he would veto the welfare bill and would not undercut them by signing the measure if they fought against it.
Referring to the Republicans, Dr. Shalala said: "They want to reduce or eliminate assistance for more than one million disabled children each year. They propose slashing billions of dollars from foster care, adoption assistance and child abuse prevention programs, placing hundreds of thousands of vulnerable children at additional risk. And who would be hardest hit by their $33 billion in cuts to the food stamp program? Fourteen million needy children."
The Secretary also asserted that the Republican proposals would weaken Federal standards for child care. They "take us back to the days when we spent more energy guaranteeing the safety of hairstyling salons than the safety of child care," she said.
On Tuesday, Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who had expressed reservations about the welfare bill, signed a conference report recommending passage of the legislation. But an aide to Mr. Chafee said he was not enthusiastic about the bill and had not decided whether to vote for it on the Senate floor.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, refuses to sign the conference report because of a dispute with the House over the school lunch program.
House Republicans, led by Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, want to allow each state to take a lump sum of Federal money and operate its own school lunch program, free of Federal supervision. But Mr. Lugar opposes such block grants, saying the Federal Government must preserve "a safety net for child nutrition programs."
A block grant undermines the Federal commitment to provide nutritious meals to schoolchildren, Mr. Lugar asserted. "It does not provide more money when recession and unemployment push more families toward the poverty line," he said. "In times when assistance is most needed, it will be less available."

HEADLINE: Panel of Experts Urges Government to Revamp Science Budget

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
A panel of scientists called on the Federal Government yesterday to reinvent the way it finances science and technology research, describing the current system as a haphazard one that worked well for decades when budgets were growing but that could damage the nation now that science dollars are being cut.
In the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the Government spent $69 billion on scientific research, broadly defined, doing everything from fighting AIDS to probing distant planets. The science budget is down from a peak of $73 billion in 1990, in dollars adjusted for inflation. 
 The downturn is a reversal of decades of fairly steady growth in Federal science money, which by some estimates may decline by as much as a third in the next five years.
The blueprint for a new budget method was made public in Washington by a panel of the National Research Council, a private group chartered by Congress to advise the Government.
The panel in essence called for the current untidy process to be made more rational with the aim of preserving excellence during a time of contraction, although a risk in that approach, some science analysts say, is that new rationality and visibility might give budget cutters tempting new targets.
The panel's report, "Allocating Federal Funds for Science and Technology," was requested by Congress last year.
"By any measure, the Federal Government's investments in science and technology since World War II have been a spectacular success, producing enormous benefits for the nation," said the panel's chairman, Dr. Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of Sciences. "However, the question now facing the country is how best to continue this success when factors such as the severe budget deficit, the end of the cold war and the growth of global competition are bringing unprecedented changes to society and to science and technology."
In its report, the 18-member panel made more than a dozen recommendations for changing the budget process, mainly by merging the budget's disjointed parts into a single picture. It rejected the idea of a Federal department of science, saying deft adjustments within the existing Government structure would accomplish more than would a new agency.
As a first step, the report said, the Government should calculate its spending on science and technology more accurately. Last year's figure of $69 billion is misleading, the report said, since almost half of that was spent on things that have nothing to do with the creation of knowledge or technologies but instead help establish production lines and develop new kinds of aircraft and weapons. The true Federal science budget is more like $35 billion to $40 billion, the report said.
In addition, it said, the White House should develop an advisory apparatus to help it and Congress understand the nation's standing in various international fields and to insure that the United States leads in those that are especially promising or important to national goals.
The report also recommended that preference be given to financing projects and people rather than institutions, thereby promoting the quality and flexibility of research.
It said academic research, characterized by intense competition for Federal grants, should take priority over that done by industry or Government laboratories, increasing flexibility and quality control and helping train the next generation of scientists.
Further, it said, Federal laboratories should undergo renewed scrutiny, with the possibility of redirecting or eliminating their resources.

HEADLINE: Japan's Invisible Minority: Better Off Than in Past, but Still Outcasts

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan

 BODY:
A 23-year-old woman had just given birth to her first baby when she learned something devastating about her husband. He was secretly a burakumin, a descendant of outcasts.
So the woman refused to touch her own baby. She returned to her parents' house and abandoned her husband and child forever. 
 That was a generation ago, in Nagano Prefecture in central Japan, and the incident underscores a legacy of discrimination in Japan that has parallels in the United States.
Even today, there is no better way for young Japanese to give their parents heart palpitations than by suggesting a marriage to a burakumin, and most burakumin still live in segregated neighborhoods riven by crime, alcoholism and unemployment.
Yet Japan is also remarkable for the progress it has made.
Today almost two-thirds of burakumin (pronounced boo-RAH-koo-min) say in opinion polls that they have never encountered discrimination. About 73 percent now marry non-burakumin, and most dismiss the possibility that the Japanese police might treat burakumin unfairly.
The E-word -- Eta, or "much filth," the traditional word for burakumin -- has been banished from discourse, so that virtually no Japanese ever uses it.
"I haven't ever encountered discrimination myself," said Masuharu Okuda, a prosperous 53-year-old who was standing outside his dry-cleaning shop in a burakumin neighborhood in Kyoto.
Mr. Okuda proudly pointed to his daughter-in-law, a woman in her 20's who was busy ironing shirts in the shop. "My son married a girl from outside the neighborhood, and she moved in here with us," he said. "There've been no problems."
Yet Japan has not overcome its divide. For if the three million burakumin, amounting to a bit more than 2 percent of the population, are now rarely burdened by overt discrimination, they face the same problems as some minority groups in America: disproportionate poverty, high crime rates, low education levels, many single mothers, dependency on welfare benefits and resentment from a public that believes they are getting special help.
The issues are those that Americans associate with race; in Japan the burakumin are not a different race at all.
They are an occupational minority group rather than a racial one. Indistinguishable in appearance from other Japanese, they were discriminated against simply because they were the descendants of people whose jobs were considered ritually unclean, like butchering animals, tanning skins, making leather goods, digging graves and handling corpses.
A related group of outcasts, also ancestors of some of today's burakumin, were hinin, or nonpersons. They were given tasks like torturing suspects, crucifying Christians and sawing off the heads of criminals for public display.
Outcasts were legally barred from marrying outside their group or from living outside their slums. These slums were called buraku, or hamlets, and that remains the term for a burakumin neighborhood.
In Japan, the outcasts were formally emancipated in 1871, but for decades after that they were effectively barred from ordinary jobs or any life outside the slums. Some Japanese shopkeepers so loathed the burakumin that they would wash their coins upon being paid.
Such behavior has vanished, but contempt still survives in some households. A university-educated housewife in Tokyo was scandalized when asked if she would allow her daughter to marry a burakumin.
"Never, never, never!" she said. "Even if she wanted, I could not allow it. They're dirty. And they're not really Japanese."
Yet attitudes are changing in most families. A housewife in Mie Prefecture noted that the best friend of her teen-age son is a burakumin, and she said this had been a problem until the death of her mother-in-law a couple of years ago.
"My mother-in-law was a very good woman, but she had a terrible prejudice," she said. "So I could never tell her where my son's friend lived, even though he visited us all the time. She would have been furious. She would have said things like, 'He can't be allowed in the house! He can't touch the plates we use!' "
Now the boy eats with the family often, and the mother says she does not know if her son even realizes that his friend is a burakumin.

Invisibility
A Minority Hard to Identify
Some Japanese say the reason that their country has made progress with the burakumin is not broad-mindedness, but rather the inability to figure out who is a burakumin.
Members of another minority group, ethnic Koreans, are more easy to distinguish. Perhaps as a result, Koreans still face enormous discrimination in Japan.
Burakumin are not easily identifiable by their jobs, for only a few of them now work in traditional fields like leather-making. The other big clue to who is a burakumin -- an address in a buraku -- is also less useful now, because burakumin have been pouring out of their neighborhoods while other Japanese have been moving in.
Kenichiro Tatsumi, the head of the Buraku Liberation League in Kobe, said the buraku in which he lives did not have any non-burakumin residents until 1980. "Now half the people who live there are outsiders," he said.
The burakumin are also invisible because there is a virtual taboo on discussing the issue. Newspapers and television stations virtually never mention the word buraku, partly because buraku organizations have sometimes denounced publishers for insensitivity when they have written about buraku issues.
"There've been arguments in which burakumin said some very tough things, and so people became afraid of us," Mr. Tatsumi said.
Most Japanese clam up in horror when the topic is broached, and so most young Japanese know far more about discrimination against blacks in America than about discrimination against burakumin in Japan.
Some junior high school students in the town of Omiya, where there are many buraku, looked puzzled when the topic of burakumin came up.
"Who are they?" a teen-age girl asked. "I've never heard of them."
Even many burakumin students themselves find out only in their mid-teens that they are burakumin.
"Most parents don't tell their kids," said Masahiro Takino, a city administrator in Kobe. "They say, 'Don't wake a sleeping baby.' "
Mr. Takino, who is in his 40's, first learned that he was a burakumin in the third grade, when he went to visit a friend's house. The friend's mother told her son, loud enough for Mr. Takino to hear, never to play with a boy from a buraku.
Japanese corporations used to search the backgrounds of potential employees to make sure there was no trace of burakumin heritage. Parents hired private detectives to investigate the pedigrees of their children's boyfriends or girlfriends.
Such searches are becoming rare now. Strangers are now banned from looking at other people's family registration certificates, where past home addresses are recorded. Private detective agencies are barred in some areas from checking on family backgrounds.

Poverty
Social Problems Are Persistent
In the 1960's, the buraku were immediately recognizable as slums: dilapidated hovels leaned over tiny alleys, open sewers carried waste water into the rivers, and old people blinded by contagious disease sat hopelessly in the open doorways.
Now that has all changed. A torrent of Government investment has improved the buraku so they are no longer slums.
Yet average income for buraku families is still only about 60 percent of the national average, and social problems are proving to be far more persistent than discrimination.
Buraku leaders acknowledge that alcoholism is a disproportionate problem in their communities. Poverty and alcohol, in turn, weaken the family in the buraku.
Single parents are almost twice as common in the buraku as in the nation as a whole. Five percent of burakumin are on welfare, seven times the rate in the overall population.
A 35-year-old study in Japan found that buraku children had lower I.Q.'s than non-buraku children in the same public schools. Scholars who examined the data say the differences reflect general apathy and lack of self-esteem, a result of discrimination and contempt from society as a whole.
In the field of education, burakumin have made stunning progress. But they also remain stunningly far behind.
Truancy rates in elementary school in 1960 were 12 times as high for buraku children as for others. Now they are twice as high.
Burakumin have almost caught up with their peers in the proportion who graduate from high school, a tremendous achievement. But only about 24 percent of burakumin go to college, compared with 40 percent of other Japanese.

Crime
High Membership Among Gangsters
Social workers say crime is a disproportionate problem among young burakumin, but the issue is so sensitive that no Japanese scholars have conducted research on it. One rare statistical study, conducted by Americans in the 1960's, found that burakumin youths were three times as likely as non-buraku youths to be arrested for crimes.
One explanation is that young burakumin sometimes feel that they are outside the umbrella of middle-class society. Denied the benefits by society, they also spurn the responsibilities.
Another explanation, aside from high rates of poverty and unemployment, has to do with one of Japan's open secrets: burakumin and ethnic Koreans dominate the organized crime gangs known as the yakuza. More than three-quarters of the members of the Yamaguchi Gumi, Japan's biggest underworld organization, are said to be burakumin or ethnic Koreans.
In the buraku of Kobe, the nicest houses -- gaudy American-style homes with wide porches and Mercedes-Benzes in the driveway -- belong to yakuza bosses. As a result, the "success stories" whom children in the buraku see as they grow up are often mobsters.
To be sure, there have been many brilliant buraku youngsters who have grown up to be doctors, lawyers, athletes and politicians. But they melt away into the overall society, keeping their background quiet, and so they do not serve as role models.
One of Japan's best-known politicians is secretly a burakumin, according to several buraku social workers. This politician, who has held major Cabinet posts, was horrified when a reporter called his office to ask for an interview on the subject. By all accounts, the buraku connection could still hurt him at the polls, and so he refused to go public.
Partly because burakumin are so invisible, and because mobility is breaking down the barriers that used to keep them apart, many Japanese believe that burakumin will become assimilated over the coming decades.
Yet for now, the progress is only partial.
The daughter-in-law of Mr. Okuda, the dry cleaner, was initially happy to talk about how she had married a burakumin and moved into the buraku. She even posed for a photo in the dry cleaning shop, a symbol of integration in the new Japan.
Then she decided she did not want people to know after all that she had moved into a buraku.
"So," she said, "don't use my name or my picture in the paper."

HEADLINE: City Doubles Its Officers To Cut Down

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Some New Yorkers think double-parking for a quick trip to the store is an inalienable right, and delivery truck drivers, particularly in Manhattan, accept traffic tickets as a cost of doing business in the city. But the Giuliani administration said yesterday that enough is enough, and to free up the city's streets, it would have "zero tolerance" of anything that blocks traffic flow during peak drive times.
Pledging to ease street congestion by Christmas, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would double the number of police officers responsible for restricting double-parking, gridlock at intersections and unauthorized construction that blocks traffic. The effort, which would include arresting some traffic offenders, is part of the Mayor's attack on so-called quality-of-life offenses. 
 City officials said they would leave it up to local precinct commanders whether to crack down on people who double-park to comply with alternate-side-of-the-street rules. But some motorists said the crackdown would make driving in the city -- already a trying experience -- much worse.
"Sometimes physical fistfights occur over these spots," said John Shin, a delivery truck driver struggling with traffic in midtown yesterday. He said getting a space is so difficult that drivers often go back to their warehouses rather than make deliveries.
As part of the crackdown, police officers in helicopters, on motorcycles, scooters and horses will concentrate on traffic problems in Manhattan and the business districts of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens and will be aided by computerized maps. Their task of speeding up traffic at the peak rush hour will return the police force to a traditional function that had been turned over to special traffic agents, or "brownies," over the last three decades.
Mr. Giuliani was careful not to promise the end of gridlock any time soon, but he said the plan "will have a direct impact on the economic redevelopment of this city."
While announcing the traffic strategy, Mr. Giuliani also unveiled a new traffic safety program to be administered by the Department of Transportation. Included are new pedestrian fences and traffic signals along Queens Boulevard, shortening of crosswalks at dangerous intersections in downtown Brooklyn and Chinatown and the construction of traffic circles in all five boroughs.
Central to the police plan is the creation of a new Traffic Control Division of 1,151 police officers, made visible by white gloves, white uniform hats and colorful vests. Linked by radio and computer to a new traffic situation room monitoring traffic 24 hours a day, the specialized force will be sent to the scenes of congestion and be responsible for issuing summonses or even arresting people causing traffic jams.
The command center at West 31st Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues will collect and analyze "traffic intelligence reports" that will be used to deploy officers to accidents or other causes of congestion.
The strategy calls for "zero tolerance" during peak congestion of double-parking, obstruction of bus stops, clogged intersections, and unauthorized construction sites that interfere with traffic. The unit will also focus on arresting intoxicated motorists and drivers without licenses or who have suspended licenses.
While many drivers will probably welcome fewer bottlenecks, businesses that use delivery trucks and taxicab drivers waiting for passengers may be inconvenienced.
"People will have to make plans about how they make and take deliveries," Mr. Giuliani said. But he said that precinct commanders who informally allow double-parking on alternate-side-of-the-street parking days would be able to cater to the needs of their neighborhoods.
About half the 500 officers newly assigned to traffic functions will transfer from other units. But police officials said they do not anticipate any reduction in crime-fighting since the duties of the traffic officers will go well beyond ticketing. Equipped with cellular telephones and computers in their cars, the officers will be expected to check license plates for stolen vehicles, and hand out summonses to aggressive panhandlers, squeegee cleaners and operators of loud motorcycles.
Residential neighborhoods will have to wait at least three months for traffic improvements, but Mr. Bratton has ordered the city's 76 precinct commanders to come up with plans for clearing troublesome thoroughfares and intersections.

HEADLINE: Aetna Selling 2 Businesses To Travelers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The Aetna Life and Casualty Company has agreed to sell its property and liability insurance businesses to Travelers Group Inc. for $4 billion in cash, the companies said yesterday.
Aetna now plans to concentrate on health care and life insurance, where it has a better record of success. Travelers plans to merge the Aetna businesses with its own property and liability insurance units and create a new company which will sell stock to the public next year. 
 Travelers executives expect to eliminate about $300 million of costs and about 3,300 jobs from the combined divisions in the next two years.
The deal is a milestone for the Hartford-based companies, which started the 1980's as two of the country's best known and strongest insurers. But bad real estate investments, a surge in environmental cleanup claims from corporate customers and chronic problems in controlling expenses led the companies to look outside themselves for help.
Travelers, which had more severe financial problems than Aetna did, turned to Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street entrepreneur. Mr. Weill bought the company in 1993 for about $3.5 billion in stock of the Primerica Corporation and subsequently changed the combined company's name to Travelers.
Aetna, after years of mixed success from shrinking its property and liability businesses and trying to cut costs, turned earlier this year to Richard Huber, a former banker, to develop and execute a strategic plan.
The new company will operate initially under both the Aetna and Travelers names, Mr. Weill, the Travelers chief executive, said, and could earn $1 billion after taxes in three years. This year, the Travelers property and liability businesses are expected to earn about $400 million, while those of Aetna are expected to lose $120 million. The loss is mostly attributable to a $750 million increase in Aetna's reserves to cover claims from corporate policy-holders now calling on those policies to pay for environmental clean-ups.
Because the purchase does not require issuing any new Travelers shares, and because Travelers executives have a strong record in merging operations, the company won the approval of traders yesterday. Travelers shares rose $3.75, to $58.875, an all-time high close.
Aetna's stock, though, fell $3.875 a share, to $72, amid concerns that Aetna's per-share earnings would decline because of the sale. Investors were also uncertain about when and how effectively Aetna would spend its cash hoard to buy companies in its remaining businesses of health care and life insurance.
"There is already a lot of speculation about what other managed health care companies Aetna might want," Margo Vignola, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. She noted that Pacificare Health Systems of Cypress, Calif., United States Healthcare Inc. of Blue Bell, Pa., and Humana Inc. of Louisville, Ky., had been mentioned as possible targets, because they are "good-sized, growing and have a major presence in their regional markets."
Ronald Compton, Aetna's chairman, said the $4 billion would be used to acquire companies with proven management, with a capacity to grow faster than they have been and with strength in markets where Aetna is relatively weak. "We are a growth stock now," he said.
Travelers will pay Aetna from a variety of sources, including sales of preferred stock, bonds and, eventually, a public stock offering in the new company. Travelers will also contribute $1.1 billion of capital to the new company, roughly covering an increase of more than $1 billion in reserves needed to pay asbestos and other claims.
Earlier this year, Travelers collected $830 million from the sale of its health care business. Travelers is also close to selling its RCM Capital subsidiary, a San Francisco money management firm with $25 billion of assets, to Dresdner Bank.
Travelers plans to sell about 18 percent of the new company to outside investors -- including Aetna, which promised to buy $200 million of stock. But Mr. Weill took exception to speculation that Travelers would leave the business once the deal was completed and it could sell at a high price.
"We are buying Aetna to enter the business, not to leave it," Mr. Weill said. He added that the merging of the two businesses might not be as daunting as it sounded, since both companies had plans to reduce expenses in 1996, and the $300 million of expense cuts amount to only 15 percent of their combined $2 billion of fixed expenses. About half the job cuts are expected in Hartford, where the new company will be based.
Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a group financed by insurers, said that mergers of competing companies might be the most attractive way to expand, "since this is an industry that grows only at about the same rate as the economy."
With too many companies chasing too few customers, Mr. Mooney said, property and liability insurers have had difficulty raising prices and their profits have tended to be lower than other companies their size.
Even so, he noted that the industry attracted financiers who envisioned big, Warren Buffett-style profits from managing the companies' stock and bond investments.
Maintaining income from premiums is a chronic problem for insurers, since whenever their premiums get high enough to produce large profits, they often lose large corporate customers that opt to insure themselves. Often, high insurance premiums also attract new specialized companies created to service niche markets -- as with catastrophe insurance after Hurricane Andrew in 1994.
"This should be a fabulous investment for Travelers," said Robert A. Spass, managing partner of Insurance Partners, an investment group in New York. "There will basically be one less competitor," he said. Weaker companies like Aetna; Continental Insurance, which merged earlier this year with the CNA Financial Corporation, and Home Insurance, which was bought by the Zurich Insurance Company, he noted, had been criticized for keeping prices low just to hold customers.
Mr. Spass said the industry was likely to see more mergers or acquisitions. The Talegen insurance unit of the Xerox Corporation has been for sale for two years, he noted, and the Cigna Corporation's plan to divide its property and liability businesses into two parts -- one selling new policies and the other devoted only to paying claims of old policies -- was a prelude to a sale or merger.

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Nov. 30, with an article about the sale of some Aetna Life and Casualty Company operations to the Travelers Group Inc., misstated some rankings of the largest property and liability insurers. The CNA Financial Corporation, which acquired the Continental Corporation in May, now ranks third in the industry; that makes the Travelers-Aetna combination fourth.
