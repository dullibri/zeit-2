HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens Against Yen But Gains a Bit on the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended weaker against the yen but modestly higher against the mark yesterday amid growing doubts about Europe's plan to establish a single currency by 1999.
 Talk of a delay in the timetable for a single currency spread through the market after Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy said in a television interview that Germany might ask that the start of the monetary union be rescheduled. 
 Although the German Finance Ministry later denied any plans to change the starting date, Mr. Prodi's comments weighed heavily on the market, sweeping the mark higher against the currencies of many of its European neighbors, particularly the Italian lira.
 The lira fell to its lowest level against the mark in more than three months, rising above 1,000 a mark despite talk that the Bank of Italy was actively selling marks for lire in an effort to defend the currency.
 "The market is clearly concerned about the timing to monetary union," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
The mark tends to benefit at the expense of other European currencies when doubts about the planned single currency arise because it has less to gain from the project.
 While traders bought the mark against other European currencies yesterday, they sold the German currency against the yen, which benefited from renewed hopes for a recovery in the Japanese economy.
 The governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said in a speech yesterday that Japan's economy was gradually recovering.
 Buying of yen pushed the mark to its lowest level against the Japanese currency in eight months and led the dollar lower against the yen.
 In late trading in New York, the dollar fell to 120.22 yen from 120.69 yen on Thursday and rose to 1.6903 marks from 1.6875 marks. The British pound rosed to $1.6295 from $1.6258.
Currency traders said they remained optimistic about the dollar despite yesterday's mixed showing.
 In other trading, the Mexican peso ended higher against the dollar after the United States recertified Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs.
 The peso edged up to 12.5945 cents, from 12.5786 cents on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Compromise May Be in Works on Acquisition by Staples

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Federal antitrust regulators have canceled a meeting planned for Saturday to review -- and possibly block -- Staples Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Office Depot Inc., officials said today.
The delay indicates that senior Federal Trade Commission officials are searching for a compromise to allow the $3.4 billion deal to go forward in spite of strong misgivings at the staff level about the economic wisdom of the combination of the two top office supply retailers. 
 The combination would create an office supply colossus with 1,100 stores and $10.7 billion in annual sales.
Company officials and lawyers for the regulatory agency have conducted a week of intensive discussions over whether, and in what form, the merger should be permitted.
People close to the negotiations said that the F.T.C. staff was concerned that domination of the office supply superstore business by two huge chains would make it virtually impossible for a new competitor to enter the market. Regulators are looking at the office supply market city by city to see how the proposed merger would affect competition and pricing.
Several analysts suggested that regulators might permit the deal if Staples agrees to spin off several dozen stores in cities where the two chains' outlets overlap and if it pledges to keep consumer prices down.
No date has been set for the five-member commission to weigh whether to permit the merger or to challenge it in court.
Agency officials said that the proposed merger presented some of the thorniest antitrust questions they had wrestled with in the last four years. Office supply superstores are a new and evolving business and there is little precedent for the combination of the No. 1 and No. 2 companies in a fast-changing three-player industry.
If the deal goes through, the new company's only remaining competitor in the specialized office supply supermarket business would be Officemax Inc., with about 500 stores and $3.3 billion in annual sales.
The two companies today agreed to extend their merger agreement until May 31 in hopes that a settlement can be reached with the Federal agency. The Staples stock offer for Office Depot was to have expired today.
Staples executives have argued before the agency -- as well as in an expensive nationwide advertising campaign -- that the merger would yield cost efficiencies and lower consumer prices.
The chairman of Staples, Thomas Stemberg, has said that the new entity would control only 5 percent of the office supply market, competing in a highly fragmented environment with catalogue operations, warehouse clubs, local stationers and large general retailers like Wal-Mart Stores.
But some F.T.C. staff lawyers and consumer advocates contend the merger would be anticompetitive and allow the new entity to raise prices with impunity.
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, and Bart Naylor, an official of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, met with F.T.C. staff members earlier this week to lobby against the deal.
"Three competitors are better than two, and they are three giants," Mr. Nader said in an interview after his meeting. "Competition creates price efficiency for consumers."
Mr. Nader said that a study conducted by his Consumer Project on Technology had demonstrated that prices were lower in markets where Staples and Office Depot compete head to head.
The survey showed that thermal fax paper costs as much as $26.99 a roll in locations with no superstore competition and as little as $13.99 where Staples and Office Depot stores were close neighbors.
But a top Staples executive dismissed the Nader study as "statistical hogwash" based on a one-item sample and "sixth-grade analysis."

HEADLINE: Growth Rate In 4th Quarter Cut to 3.9%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter, slower than the 4.7 percent estimated originally, the Commerce Department said today. A measure of inflation remained at a 30-year low.
The department attributed the downward revision in the growth of gross domestic product to an unexpected liquidation of inventories at retailers and other businesses. Farm inventories were also smaller than previously estimated, export growth was slower and military spending was lower. 
 Analysts had expected, on average, growth to be revised downward only to a 4.2 percent pace. In the third quarter, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent.
The 3.9 percent rate "is still a pretty strong number," said Tony Riley, an economist at A. Gary Shilling & Company in Springfield, N.J.
Dan Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities Company International, said the inventory revision "gives us weaker growth but suggests there is more room for it" in the first part of the year as those inventories are replaced.
In all of 1996, gross domestic product, which measures the nation's output of goods and services but does not include income from abroad, grew 2.4 percent, down from the 2.5 percent reported previously but up from 1995's 2 percent expansion.
In a separate report today, the National Association of Realtors said home resales rose 2.1 percent in January. Analysts had expected the report to show no change in the month. A third economic report, from the Chicago Purchasing Management Association, showed the February index of manufacturing rising to 56.2 from 55.9 last month, a sign of improving manufacturing strength in the region.
"It really says that we are looking at decent strength on all fronts," Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said of the data.
In the current quarter, which ends March 31, growth will probably run at a healthy annual pace of 2 to 3 percent. The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said this week in his twice-yearly report about the economy that prospects "in general are quite favorable," although he suggested the Fed might soon raise interest rates to guard against inflation.
The Government issues three calculations of each quarter's gross domestic product as information becomes available to its economists. The final revision will be issued March 28.
On the inflation front, the price deflator, a measure of price increases that is watched by Wall Street, grew at an unrevised 1.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter. That was the lowest reading since the first quarter of 1967, a Government spokesman said.
The price deflator measures the magnitude of price increases and detects whether higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
The price index for gross domestic purchases, which tracks the price of all goods purchased in the country, including imports, grew at a 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the same as previously reported.
The G.D.P. chain-weighted index, which tracks changes in the price of all goods and services made in the United States, increased at an unrevised 1.8 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Japan's Road to Deep Deficit Is Paved With Public Works

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SHINTOKU, Japan

 BODY:
When the national and local governments built a $4 million "agricultural airport" in this small town in northern Japan, they said it would allow local farmers to get higher prices for their vegetables by flying them to market while still fresh instead of sending them by truck, a three-day trip.
What the officials overlooked was that each flight would cost more than $4,000 but could carry no more than $3,000 in vegetables. Moreover, since the planes are too small to make it all the way to Tokyo or Osaka, trucks are sometimes still needed for part of the journey, and shipping time is cut by only one day. Last year, only 10 flights took off from the airport, and taxpayers are wondering if their money was well spent. 
 "It may be good for a children's playground," said Kayoko Omiyo, the wife of a farmer. The town government is indeed thinking of turning the runway over for in-line skating, and cross-country skiing in the winter, to make greater use of the site.
With their nation facing a severe budget deficit, people in Japan are starting to object to the spending for public works projects that have played an outsized role in Japan's economy and political system. The questioning is part of a broader reassessment of public spending policy and of Japan's once-admired bureaucracy, both of which are now being seen as riddled with waste and corruption.
Japan spends more on public construction, about $300 billion, than the Pentagon spends on defense. Critics call Japan "doken kokka," the "construction state," a reference not only to the magnitude of the activity but also to the cozy relationships between contractors and Government officials that keeps pork-barrel projects coming. Public works have also long been a sore point in trade with the United States, as American companies seeking a share of the huge projects have complained of a bidding system that locks them out of contracts.
"The construction state is in some respects akin to the military-industrial complex in cold-war America (or the Soviet Union), sucking in the country's wealth, consuming it inefficiently, growing like a cancer and bequeathing both fiscal crisis and environmental devastation," Gavan McCormack, a professor of Japanese history at Australia National University, wrote in "The Emptiness of Japanese Affluence," a recent book.
In the last few years, public works spending has been stepped up even more to stimulate a languid economy. Everywhere you look, roads are being paved or dug up, rivers dammed, bays filled to make new land, and domed arenas erected. Projects range from the $7.6 billion Akashi Straits Bridge, which is being built near Kobe and which will be the longest bridge in the world, to the art museum for the small town of Ono, completed in 1993, which displays only reproductions because there was no money to buy art.
The statistics alone are staggering. Japan uses as much cement each year as the United States, despite having only half the population and only 4 percent of the land area. Japan's construction industry, with 500,000 companies and 6.6 million workers, accounts for 10 percent of the country's employment compared with 5 to 7 percent in other advanced nations. Public works spending in Japan amounts to about 6.6 percent of gross domestic product compared with 1.6 percent in the United States and 2 to 3 percent for Western European nations, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
But now the Cabinet has formed a task force to cut public construction expenses. Citizens have begun to question Government extravagance in public buildings. And environmentalists have started fighting the construction binge that has left only 3 of Japan's 113 major rivers flowing freely and only 45 percent of the coastline of the four main islands in a natural state.
The press is having a field day digging up white elephants, like the pier at Fukui, a port to which ships rarely come, that is called a "10 billion yen fishing hole" by local residents. The pier, sitting empty except for fishermen, actually cost 30 billion yen, or $250 million.
A fiscal crisis is driving Japan's reassessment. After years of lecturing the United States to reduce its Federal budget deficit, Japan has developed a deficit of its own that is far worse proportionately than Washington's.
In 1996, Japan's central and local budget deficits amounted to 7 percent of gross domestic product, the highest among the Group of Seven major industrial countries. The figure for the United States is less than 2 percent. Some 22 percent of next year's budget will be spent on interest payments on the accumulated debt -- more than on education, science and the military combined.
"Japan holds a time bomb that is expected to explode in a few years, and the bomb gets bigger every year," an advisory committee to the Ministry of Finance said in a recent report.
The deficit results from several years of a weak economy, which forced the Government to cut taxes and to increase spending to prime the pump. Since 1992, the Government has announced stimulus packages worth $560 billion, with much of it spent on public works. The budgets included $50 billion in 1995 alone for relief and reconstruction after the Kobe earthquake.
Despite such infusions, the economy still has not fully recovered. Some economists say the public works stimulus is losing its effectiveness, though others say it kept the economy from a deeper recession.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has suggested that the Government might review a pledge to spend more than $5 trillion on public works from 1995 to 2004. The promise was made in response to demands by the United States that Japan stimulate domestic spending to increase imports.
Critics also label spending for agriculture as wasteful, including $50 billion the Government committed to spend over six years to compensate farmers for the partial opening of the rice market to imports. Takigawa, a town in northern Japan, is building a hot springs resort using agricultural promotion funds, justifying it on the grounds that a shop on the premises will sell local produce.
But cutting back on public works is proving to be difficult. Those expecting sharp cutbacks next year were outraged that the proposed budget included $10 billion for extensions of bullet train lines that analysts expect to prove uneconomical.
Too much fiscal tightness could plunge the still-fragile economy into recession. Japan is already planning to raise taxes this year to fight the deficit and the United States is cautioning Japan not to restrict spending too much.
But a bigger reason is that pork-barrel politics is deeply ingrained. Politicians push for big projects for their districts, not only to satisfy voters but because construction companies have long been among the biggest contributors to the Liberal Democratic Party. The party has governed Japan for most of the post-World War II period and is now back in power after a three-year hiatus. Ministries also fight any diminution of their budgets.
Bribery of public officials to win contracts is common. So is bid-rigging, in part because bidding on many projects is open only to designated companies, shutting out foreign firms, among others. Those factors have helped make construction costs in Japan at least 30 to 40 percent higher than in the United States.
Government officials contend, and many citizens agree, that Japan needs to improve its infrastructure . The war leveled large parts of the country, and Japan has emphasized developing industry over improvements that would have been considered consumer amenities.
Half of Japan's population lives in homes that are not connected to sewage systems. And Japan has only 4,000 miles of expressways compared with 5,500 in France and 7,000 in Germany. Most of its highways are only two lanes in each direction and are clogged.
"Japan is still a developing country compared with Western Europe and the United States," said Yasuo Mitsuie, a Ministry of Construction official.
But critics say that politics drives projects to take on a life of their own, even if the need for them disappears.
"The construction itself is the purpose," said Hirofumi Uzawa, a retired University of Tokyo economics professor.
There are some signs of change. In a rare move, the Ministry of Construction has canceled plans for four dams -- of 300 being built or planned. The Ministry of Agriculture is reviewing its agricultural airport program because the four that have been completed have been failures.
But the construction state will not die easily. Indeed, a project to top all others is now being planned -- to move the nation's capital out of Tokyo by the year 2010.
To reduce the congestion and concentration of power in Tokyo, a new capital city of 600,000 people is to be built. The initial cost estimate is more than $100 billion, but it is likely to cost much more.

HEADLINE: A Rational Way to Reduce the Deficit

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has bravely called for a commission to fix -- more accurately, lower -- the Government's measure of inflation, the first step toward reducing Social Security payments to the elderly and raising personal income taxes. Revising that yardstick, the Consumer Price Index, would knock perhaps $1 trillion off the deficit over 12 years and spread the burden of the budget cuts across the population.
But President Clinton and most Congressional leaders -- with the notable exception of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York -- have refused to take on the elderly and other beneficiaries of an overly generous inflation gauge until Mr. Lott made the first move. The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, embraced the proposal. The White House expressed lukewarm acceptance. 
 A panel of economists reported last year to Congress that the gauge was probably off by about one percentage point a year. The panel estimated that if Congress adjusted its benefit and tax schedules accordingly, it could reduce the deficit by about a third, or $60 billion, by 2002. The correction would reduce Social Security benefits by an average of $100 next year, and raise taxes by about the same amount for a family earning $50,000.
To fix the problem, Congress need not tamper with the actual computation of the index, which is produced by a professional, nonpartisan staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Instead it could forthrightly acknowledge that the official measure is exaggerated, that a reliable measure is not yet available and that it will make a reasonable correction for the purposes of adjusting Federal spending and tax programs. But because the exact size of the correction is uncertain, Congress should exempt disability benefits and other payments to the poor.
Adjusting the Consumer Price Index is a better way to balance the budget than big cuts to public investments and other valuable Federal programs.

HEADLINE: Ford Files for Initial Hertz Offering

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.. Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, aiming to unlock more of the value tied up in its nonautomotive assets, said today that it planned to sell less than 20 percent of its Hertz Corporation car rental unit in an initial public offering.
Ford said the offering, which had been long expected, will involve newly issued shares of Hertz common stock. A registration statement for the offering was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. 
 The transaction will mark the end of Ford's three-year ownership of 100 percent of Hertz, which claims to be the world's largest car rental concern.
Ford first invested in the car rental giant, which is based in Park Ridge, N.J., in 1987 to gain a captive customer for its vehicles. The strategy, also pursued by General Motors and Chrysler, allowed the auto maker to keep its factories running during the early 1990's recession, but barely used rental cars soon lured buyers away from new cars.
Analysts said today that Hertz as a whole was worth up to $3 billion, meaning that Ford could gain up to $600 million in cash in the 20 percent offering.

HEADLINE: Long Bond Unchanged in Mixed Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as end-of-month buying partly offset investors' concern that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy from overheating.
Traders said the morning release of economic reports showing a rise in home resales and manufacturing heightened the anxiety investors evidenced since Wednesday. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in Senate testimony then that the central bank could move pre-emptively to counter inflation without waiting for signs to appear. 
 The price of a 30-year Government bond was unchanged from Thursday at 9725/32 , to yield 6.80 percent, while the price of a two-year note fell 1/32 , to 9920/32 , to yield 6.08 percent.
"It's simple," said David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data, Boston. "The market believes that Greenspan has told us he wants to tighten, and he doesn't need inflation to do it. He is willing to make a pre-emptive move, and we are still reeling from that pronouncement. I don't see a chance for this market to have much more than a short-lived bounce until, and unless, we get some very friendly data."
The National Association of Realtors reported that resales of homes rose 2.1 percent in January, a stark contrast to analysts' forecast of no change. And the Chicago Purchasing Management Association said its February index of manufacturing rose to 56.2 from 55.9 in January, a sign of improving manufacturing in the region, as the prices-paid component, which is viewed by some market participants as a measure of inflation, fell to 56 from 57.4.
"However," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, "the vendor performance index of delivery lead times," which, he said, is one of Mr. Greenspan's favorite indicators, "jumped from 47.6 to 56 in the Chicago purchasing agents' survey."
He added, "The odds for Fed tightening will rise further if a similar vendor performance rise is reported in the overall N.A.P.M. survey to be released on Monday."
The Commerce Department said fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent last year, down from its original estimate of 4.7 percent. But the drop did little to comfort investors, since the revised number was still fairly strong. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast that G.D.P. would be revised down to 4.2 percent.
Despite the downward revision, analysts noted that some market participants saw within the report a drop in inventories, which could be a sign of strong first-quarter growth.
Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said economic growth during the first two quarters of 1997 would be contingent upon trade. He said the trade deficit was unsustainably low in the fourth quarter of 1996.
The February employment report on Friday will help investors develop a view as to the outlook for a rate increase at the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
The Fed has held the line on a rate adjustment since January 1996, even as the economy expanded because inflation has been benign. February nonfarm employment is expected to rise by 204,000, slowing from a 271,000 rise in January.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Again as Dow Drops 47.33

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell for the third straight day yesterday, as many technology stocks continued to slump and investors became cautious in the wake of Alan Greenspan's warning about "excessive optimism" in the financial markets.
Since the Fed chairman testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 160.47 points, or 2.3 percent. Yesterday, the Dow was off 47.33 points, to 6,877.74. 
 "I think Greenspan just spooked the buyers," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "We have seen the buyers become much more cautious, but there's not so much selling."
Mr. Birinyi said that despite the attention given Mr. Greenspan's warnings, the market has not lost much of its strength. Further, what it has lost recently has come as much from a faltering technology sector as from the Fed chairman's cautioning, he said.
For the week, the Dow was down 53.88 points. After zooming up 106.59 points on Monday and Tuesday, the Dow retreated to finish the week with its lowest close since Feb. 11 -- just two days before the Dow topped 7,000 for the first time.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.66 points yesterday to close at 1,309. For the month, the technology-heavy Nasdaq lost 5.1 percent. Yesterday, Microsoft and Intel made a comeback, but other technology shares -- particularly computer networking companies -- continued to falter. Microsoft was up 1 3/8, to 97 1/2, and Intel was up 29/64 , to 141 7/8. But Ascend Communications lost 4 3/4, to 52 1/4, and 3Com was down 157/64 , to 337/64 .
While the Dow has risen 6.6 percent this year, the Nasdaq has gained just 1.4 percent. Without some of its leading technology stocks, the Nasdaq has actually lost ground this year. The Russell 2000 index of small- capitalization stocks is down seven-tenths of 1 percent.
"There is this dichotomy in the marketplace," Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston, said. "It's been more of a defensive market than an offensive market for the last seven months."
Mr. Riley said that investors believed that large-cap stocks were safer, particularly in the event of an economic downturn, while smaller stocks are considered more vulnerable. "One reason for the dichotomy is that the market is discounting a slower economy in 1997 than the Fed has forecast," he said.
In contrast to the troubles of stocks, gold has recently made a comeback. Some believe a rise in the price of gold is a sign of increasing expectations of inflation. Gold rose $4.10 an ounce yesterday, to $365.10 in New York. Since Feb. 13, the price has risen $22.
"With the bond market flat this year, I think gold has taken over as the lead daily indicator," Mr. Birinyi said. He noted that stocks had made some of their biggest losses this year on days when the price of gold had gained. And although the stock and bond markets have often moved in tandem this year, they have also frequently decoupled, he said. Yesterday, as stocks slid, the bond market was flat, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury holding steady at 6.80.
The biggest losers in the Dow 30 were General Electric, down 2 1/4, to 102 7/8; J. P. Morgan, off 2 1/8, to 105; and Merck, down 1 3/4, to 92 1/8. Merck has lost about $5, or 5.8 percent, since announcing on Tuesday that it would buy back about $5 billion worth of shares and increase its dividend.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks also fell, closing down 4.25, to 790.82, dragged down by declining energy and financial issues.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Ruler of Japan Ports Not Cowed by U.S.

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 28

 BODY:
When the United States imposed new trade sanctions against Japan this week, it was taking on not just the Japanese Government but also a far more formidable figure -- a little-known 83-year-old Japanese businessman who governs the nation's ports as if they were his own backyard.
Shiro Takashima, who has run Japan's ports for two decades, has created a system that is among the most tightly ruled, opaque operations in the world, and probably the most expensive. And Mr. Takashima, shows no signs of changing a thing. 
 Indeed, he has reportedly threatened to retaliate against Washington by banning all American ships from Japan.
Mr. Takashima is an oddity in the world at the end of the 20th century, an authoritarian traditionalist running modern container ports in one of the world's great trading nations. Japan had $689 billion in two-way trade last year, and Mr. Takashima controlled virtually every ship.
"You have to play by the rules in all aspects if you want to get anything done," said a United States official, who insisted on not being identified. "It goes to the balance of power on the wharf, and right now, it's a dictatorship. And there are lots of costs associated with that, and it's discriminatory to boot."
Japan's ports have always been run with a touch of xenophobia, ever since the nation virtually closed them to the outside for more than two centuries beginning in the early 1600's. Moreover, around the end of World War II, the ports became dominated by mobsters, and it has been hard for the ports to shed that shady image.
The latest dispute escalated sharply Wednesday when the United States said it would impose sanctions against Japanese shipping companies, in retaliation for Japan's failure to liberalize its port practices. Japan has angrily denounced the United States action and threatened to appeal to the World Trade Organization.
At the center of the dispute is Mr. Takashima, who runs his own stevedore company and is chairman of an influential association, the Japan Harbor Transportation Association. Mr. Takashima declined to make any comment. A fierce, imposing man who has spent most of his life in the business, Mr. Takashima oversees domestic as well as foreign shipping companies, shipping executives and analysts say.
"Whether you are a domestic shipper or a foreign one, your wish is the same: you want changes," said Jun Harada, a shipping analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute.
"Even executives from the listed companies can't feel that they can talk directly to him," he said. "He's such a mighty figure. People can't freely utter their views."
When shipping companies want to change their routes, adjust their port call schedules or switch ships, they must apply to the harbor association at least six weeks in advance. Such changes are usually allowed, but there is a great deal of uncertainty.
"If they are in a good mood, they will accept" your application, said Rudy Mack, head of the Japan Foreign Steamship Association. "There are no guidelines."
But when it comes to creating a new shipping alliance, or forming a new line, the process becomes more complicated. Moreover, to handle cargo at the docks, foreign shipping lines are assigned a stevedore, and shipping companies say that it is virtually impossible to get approval from the harbor association to change a stevedore.
The Sea-Land Service Inc. unit of the CSX Corporation, for instance, has been using the same stevedore company that the association assigned to it in 1968. Over the last year, shipping lines have cut the prices they charge by about one-third, but the cartel-like port practices in Japan have kept costs high.
"We as a carrier are interested in the modernization of port practices in Japan," said William J. Flynn, who runs Sea-Land in Japan. "It's regrettable that sanctions have to be issued to cause meaningful discussions on the modernization of port practices."
A couple of years ago Sankyu Inc., a large Japanese transport company, filed a complaint with Japan's Fair Trade Commission, contending that the harbor association's allocation practices violated antitrust laws. The association responded by putting pressure on Sankyu's clients and reportedly refused to approve Sankyu's terminal revamping plans.
In the end, Sankyu withdrew its complaint and is said to have apologized to the association.
The harbor association told American officials there would be "massive retaliation against U.S carriers," if sanctions are put in place in April, according to the United States Federal Maritime Commission's ruling on sanctions Wednesday. If the sanction effort is pursued, Mr. Takashima said he "will not let any U.S. ships come into Japanese ports," the ruling added.
As long as he runs the harbor association, Mr. Takashima is likely to exert a great deal of control, experts say, and the Ministry of Transportation has done little to make changes. Kazuhiko Umoto, an official at the port transport division of the Ministry of Transportation, acknowledges Mr. Takashima's influence.
Japanese shipping companies have mixed feelings about the sanctions. On the one hand, they do not want to pay the $100,000-a-ship penalties that Washington will impose.
Still, the Japanese companies say that they, too, want to liberalize port practices and that the most effective means might be "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure, like the threat of American sanctions.
About three-quarters of the value of Japan's worldwide trade moves in and out of its ports, producing $13 billion in annual revenues for Japanese shipping companies alone. But a port call in Japan for cargo ships, whether Japanese or American, costs two to three times what it does in the United States.
It is no surprise, then, that Japan is losing business to other Asian ports like Hong Kong; Pusan, South Korea, and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Japan's share of cargo tonnage shipped in Asia dropped from 66.5 percent in 1975 to 19.2 percent in 1994.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: METS NOTEBOOK;
Wilson Makes Most of a Chance

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 28

 BODY:
When Jay Payton, a candidate to play right field for the Mets, injured his right elbow Tuesday, Manager Bobby Valentine said that Payton's setback would not necessarily change the workload for Carl Everett and Alex Ochoa, the other top competitors for the position.
Valentine did say, however, that Payton's misfortune would create at-bats for outfielders considered long shots to make the club and that the opportunity was theirs to do with what they could. Today, Preston Wilson, the son of Mookie Wilson, the Mets' first base coach and former center fielder, took advantage. The long shot muscled an even longer shot for his first home run of the spring. 
 Yes, it came in an intrasquad game, off Mike Welch, a minor leaguer who otherwise threw well. Welch retired the final six batters he faced and struck out two of the final three.
But, for Wilson, the homer was something to cling to, a powerful statement made in the only at-bat by a player who has yet to advance past Class A ball.
Valentine was watching, and he said later that the home run showed him Wilson was capable of using his power, which he has shown rather impressively in batting practice, in games.
Yes, it was an intrasquad game, "but it was competition," Valentine said. "And it was not wind-aided; it was a legitimate blast." The ball cleared the fence in left-center field at St. Lucie County Stadium, where dead center is 410 feet from home plate.
Wilson said he got only about 95 percent of the ball. "It went more up than on the line," Wilson said. "But I guess it was enough."
Though he feels for Payton, his sidelined friend, Wilson said of this sliver of an opening: "You have to do it. It's a profession."
 
 
Exhibition Opener Today
 The Mets will begin the exhibition season Saturday against the Dodgers (Channel 9, 2 P.M.) with the following lineup: Lance Johnson, center field; Edgardo Alfonzo (2b), Bernard Gilkey (lf), John Olerud (1b), Butch Huskey (3b), Ochoa (rf), Tim Bogar (ss), Alberto Castillo (c). Bobby Jones will be the starting pitcher.
Players who were still missing because of nagging injuries and were not expected to play this weekend were catcher Todd Hundley (tight left hamstring), shortstop Rey Ordonez (sore right shoulder), second baseman Carlos Baerga (hyperextended right elbow) and Jay Payton (scar tissue irritation in his reconstructed right elbow).
Baerga said his elbow was back to about 85 percent and that adjustments in his swing have allowed him to sense more drive from his legs. "I've got more pop in the bat and I feel quicker," he said.
Hundley, who ended practice early Thursday when his hamstring tightened, today said "it's nothing." He added that he did not know when he would play. "Whenever I feel like it," he said, grinning.
"Todd's hamstring is still a little tight, but it has progressed," Bobby Valentine said.
Payton said that though his elbow was still sore, it had not bothered him to hit. Therefore, he hopes to get clearance Saturday to start facing live pitching again. As for throwing, he said, "That's a day-to-day thing right now."
 
 
Clark Is Steady as Ever
 Mark Clark, the Mets' steadiest starter of 1996, pitched in his typically steady, economical fashion today, throwing two and a third scoreless innings and allowing just one hit. He walked two. Valentine praised Clark's location and sinker, and said his slider was O.K. "Mark's pick-off move is greatly improved," he added.
Joe Crawford, a left-hander hoping to crack the rotation, matched Clark's outing, throwing two scoreless innings with one hit, one walk and a strikeout. "He was trying to work the inside part of the plate and did," said Valentine, who also praised Crawford's top pitch, his changeup.
"I threw strikes and, when I put a guy on, I showed that I could throw a changeup wherever and had some good, inside fastballs," said Crawford, who was very pleased with his outing.
 
 
Six Players Sign Deals
 The Mets signed six players to one-year contracts today but ended negotiations with the five other players left on the 40-man roster who are without deals.
The five unsigned players -- pitchers Paul Wilson, Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen and Juan Acevedo and outfielder Alex Ochoa -- have until Sunday to accept the club's offer or have their contracts renewed.
The players agreeing to one-year deals were infielders Rey Ordonez, Edgardo Alfonzo, Butch Huskey and Roberto Petagine, outfielder Carl Everett and catcher Alberto Castillo.

HEADLINE: Casino Hope Dashed, Catskills Resort Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Feb. 28

 BODY:
For years, it has been the gold standard of Catskills hotels, the sleek resort where Buddy Hackett and Alan King kibitzed, Muhammad Ali trained, and scores of Jewish singles met the loves of their lives.
But today, reeling from lagging patronage and the defeat of a state measure to permit gambling that it saw as its salvation, the Concord Resort Hotel announced that it had asked for protection against its creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed in Federal Court here Thursday. The 1,200-room hotel, with its three golf courses, 41 tennis courts and two swimming pools, will stay open for business while the owners and creditors figure out a plan for repaying its mountain-sized debts. 
 The Chapter 11 filing by the Concord is a milestone in the declining fortunes of the Catskills, which in its heyday had 40 large hotels but now has no more than 6. A generational shift in vacation tastes toward destinations like Europe and the Hamptons and the weak economy of the late 1980's and early 1990's have buffeted even a hotel that seemed as invulnerable as the Concord.
S. Robert Parker, one of five siblings who own the hotel in Kiamesha Lake, said that the hotel had sustained a small decline in patronage in recent years but that the coup de grace was the defeat on Jan. 28 of a measure in Albany that would have permitted gambling in the Catskills and other sites in the state. Without a tourist lure like gambling, other hotel operators theorized, the Concord could not put together any financing for an effort to pay off its creditors or attract a buyer.
One creditor is Sullivan County, to which the Concord owes $8.7 million in property taxes and $258,000 in room taxes. Last week, the County Attorney wrote a two-page letter to the resort threatening to seize the hotel's property unless its room taxes were paid.
The Concord's court filing, which said the hotel had $56.9 million in assets and $26.6 million in liabilities, identified other creditors as Robert Towers Advertising in Manhattan and Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, a public relations firm, as well as a number of food vendors.
As the hotel's financial problems mounted, it seemed to have trouble maintaining the standard of luxury that lured vacationers and conventioneers. Carpets were frayed and tiled bathrooms needed new grouting. A major setback in recent months was the decision of the fire chiefs of New York State not to hold their annual convention at the Concord.
A lawyer handling the Chapter 11 petition for the hotel, Richard Braverman, said that the hotel still plans to refurbish to attract more customers and to this end had secured a $5 million loan from Lincoln Capital Mortgage of Cleveland.
One small wrinkle in the Concord's travails is that Donald J. Trump, who has a hankering for owning premier properties in any locale, briefly considered buying it. But Mr. Trump, who owns casinos in Atlantic City, ultimately helped defeat the gambling referendum in Albany.
Jonathan Drapkin, county manager of Sullivan County, said the hotel still had prospects for a healthy recovery like other companies that have entered Chapter 11, such as Macy's. He cited the hotel's proximity to New York City, its ability to host large conventions, its world-class golf courses, and its national reputation.
"Seeing the Concord file for Chapter 11 is not a good thing," he said. "Obviously the county is concerned because of the impact on jobs and the local economy."
The county, with 68,000 residents, had an unemployment rate of almost 6 percent, about average for the state. But such figures do not give a hint of how the county's fortunes have plunged since the 1960's, when the summer hotels made the streets of Monticello, Liberty and the other towns bustling centers of commerce and tourism.
The Concord, which employs 1,200 people during the summer, was started in 1937 by Mr. Parker's grandfather, Arthur Winarick, who took over a 60-room hotel from a woman who defaulted on a mortgage he gave her. In the postwar boom, the family began adding tall modern wings that contrasted sharply with quainter neighboring hotels. But the Concord essentially shared the same tried-and-tested Catskills formula of three voluminous meals a day, endless entertainment that invaded even the pools and plenty of rooms for pinochle and mah-jongg.
Soon the Concord drew performers like Judy Garland, Sammy Davis Jr., Maurice Chevalier, Barbra Streisand, Bill Cosby and Buddy Hackett. In recent decades, as many in its traditional clientele retired to Florida, the hotel tried to lure new patrons with singles weekends and a cuisine aimed at young Orthodox Jews. A hint of the tradition clinging to the Concord was evident two weeks ago when the comedian Alan King performed on Presidents Day weekend. Mr. King and his wife were joined by three couples with whom they had honeymooned 50 years before at the Concord.
Mr. Braverman, the Concord's lawyer, said, "What are the odds of four couples still alive, still being married to the same person 50 years later?"

HEADLINE: COURTING DONORS: POLITICAL MEMO;
Clinton Burnishes Image as Protector of Children, Not Hotelier

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
For the second time this week, it was Vice President Al Gore's job today to introduce a youngster, who had the loftier task of introducing the President of the United States.
And once again President Clinton stepped to the microphone to present himself as the defender of children everywhere, projecting an image that his aides believe slices through the babble about campaign finance scandals and means much more to voters than who slept in the Lincoln Bedroom and at what cost. 
 At almost every public appearance, reporters fling questions at Mr. Clinton about campaign finance improprieties, and although he answers some, he also plugs away at his chosen topics: higher education, fighting drugs or, today, ending tobacco use among children and teen-agers.
A senior White House official said, "We know it plays out there," in referring to reports on those issues on local television and radio as well as by national news organizations.
The Administration is not overlooking many opportunities to push the President's themes -- or to burnish his image. On Monday, the White House plans to announce that Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, will begin appearing on television in public service announcements promoting better parenting.
His preferred message appears to be getting through so far. It has also not hurt, some aides acknowledge, that the economy is strong. As new details of questionable campaign finance practices have trickled and then poured out in recent weeks, as the White House has reluctantly filled in some of its stories and rejiggered others, one thing that has stayed constant is Mr. Clinton's public approval ratings, which are among the highest of his Presidency.
But this week, some Republican pollsters reported signs of hope for their cause: The words "Lincoln Bedroom," and the notion that it was up for sale, was at last generating a response, they said.
Yet White House aides grit their teeth over the daily drumbeat in the press, urging reporters to examine Republican campaign finance practices and rattling off lists of Republican donors appointed to ambassadorships by President George Bush.
Mr. Clinton demonstrated his own concern about the issue this week by placing late-night telephone calls to Senate Democrats, asking that they not call for an independent counsel to look into his campaign finances.
"Clearly, he was upset with some of the statements that had been made," said Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who talked to the President on Sunday. Senator Kerrey said Mr. Clinton had urged him to remind other Democratic leaders that there was a legal mechanism for appointing an independent counsel. The calls were reported today in The Wall Street Journal.
But the public so far is not up in arms about slippery campaign finance practices.
"There's a disconnect between the way Washington sees this, and the way the American public sees it," said Andrew Kohut, a pollster who is the director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
That situation depresses some proponents of changes in the campaign finance system, who see it as a sign that they cannot count on rising public revulsion to propel restrictive finance legislation through Congress. But others argue that Congressional hearings will help generate enough political pressure to force change.
Paradoxically, in the view of some Clinton confidants, the sheer volume of reporting on the scandal is working against its potential power to bring about reform.
"There's a sort of numbness out there," an Administration official said, noting that even news organizations were sometimes not chasing one another's scoops. "They think you guys cover it like a sport, and they think that what we do is sport."
Even after new details of Mr. Clinton's close involvement in raising money were released on Tuesday, a poll by CNN, USA Today and Gallup on Wednesday found that most respondents said they believed that his behavior was typical of how the White House had been used by both parties.
Public anger has certainly not been great enough to stop Mr. Clinton from raising money. He has held two fund raisers in the last two weeks. At one, he called for legislation to outlaw a type of donation that he was soliciting.
On Thursday, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, left changing the campaign finance system out of a list of things he said "the President believes that the American people are interested in seeing progress on." Asked about the omission, Mr. McCurry said such changes were "a very high priority."
Referring to polls, he said that although changing the campaign finance system was "not indicated as a subject of high concern or interest on the part of the American people, it is a subject of high interest to the President himself."
Today, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Clinton stood before a group of children wearing bright-red T-shirts promoting the "campaign for tobacco-free kids." It was an image shown over and over today on CNN.
Mr. Clinton, speaking in mild, fatherly tones, said: "Most of us have an instinctive urge to protect our young people from danger. We make sure they bundle up before going out in the cold. We should wrap that same protective arm around them when it comes to resisting smoking and the advertising and marketing of cigarettes."
Concerns about children and smoking weigh more heavily on people's minds than campaign finance details, aides to Mr. Clinton say.
"We believe that the American people care more about college costs than coffees," said Rahm Emanuel, the senior adviser to Mr. Clinton. "They care more about the drug war than donor history, and they care more about standards than the stay-overs. And that's what we're going to continue to do, is to focus on the American people's agenda."
Aides to the President say that despite the preoccupation here with news about campaign finances, his comments and appearances filter through the Beltway. Even major news organizations give many of them prominent play. On Tuesday, "ABC Evening News" featured Mr. Clinton's presentation of his anti-drug plan ahead of a report on new documents revealing his intimate role in raising campaign money.
But Mr. Kohut's poll, taken last weekend, suggests a more complex picture. Over two-thirds of those who said they had recently heard something about Mr. Clinton said it related to a scandal. Yet, over all, 60 percent approved of the job he was doing. The poll's margin of sampling error was three percentage points.
Mr. Kohut summed up the public's attitude this way: "Their nerve endings are dulled if not dead to news of scandal about Bill Clinton. They feel the finance scandals are to be found on both sides of the aisle."

HEADLINE: Japanese Fears Give Boost to Nationalists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Edward J. Lincoln's "Japan Hasn't Really Failed" (Op-Ed, Feb. 22) fails to recognize Japan's serious political and economic paralysis. In the parliamentary election last fall, Japanese voters did not, as Mr. Lincoln claims, largely spurn the parties most eager to reform.
Amid the deepening distrust of bureaucrats and the lowest voter turnout ever recorded, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of the Liberal Democrats won voters' grudging faith in his promise of fundamental reforms. 
 As Prime Minister Hashimoto's pledge has turned out to be another empty campaign promise, both Japanese and foreign investors have started selling Japanese yen, shares and bonds.
They do not share Mr. Lincoln's belief that Mr. Hashimoto and those corrupt bureaucrats will suddenly grow wise and selfless enough to guide Japan properly into the 21st century.
Nowhere is the Japanese public's rising fear for their future more vividly shown than in the rising influence of the ultra-right-wing nationalists.
In order to review the image of the former glory of Imperial Japan, they are successfully denying Japanese atrocities committed during World War II.
Unlike French ultranationalists who have to fight to influence local municipalities, Japanese ultra-nationalist deniers are already entrenched in politics, business, mass media and education circles.
Even belated United States disapproval of Japanese war crimes and their deniers would help Japan to reform to meet the best interests of the world.

To the Editor:
I take exception to just one point in Edward J. Lincoln's perceptive commentary on the Japanese economy and official efforts to revive it (Op-Ed, Feb. 22). Rather than Americans, it is the Japanese themselves who have become the most pessimistic about the prospects for their nation's economic recovery. 
 China is now at the epicenter of Asian economic growth. Yet many signs already point to a modest Japanese economic recovery -- followed, no doubt, by a renewed Japanese sense of economic strength and direction.

Businesses in New Jersey often benefit from state contracts, economic development aid and investment from the state's huge pension fund. Yesterday, elected officials and the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. held a rally at the National Labor Museum here in support of legislation to withhold those benefits from businesses that inflict hardship through layoffs or relocations. The Assembly bill was introduced in January by a Democratic lawmaker, Loretta Weinberg of Teaneck. State Senator Richard LaRossa, Republican of West Trenton, pledged at the rally to sponsor a Senate version. TERRY PRISTIN

BAYARD RUSTIN: TROUBLES I'VE SEEN
 A Biography.
 By Jervis Anderson.
 Illustrated. 418 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $30. 
 BAYARD RUSTIN is probably best remembered today for his close association with Martin Luther King Jr. and for his part in organizing the 1963 March on Washington. But his role in the civil rights movement was only one of the many he played in his long and varied career. He was a major figure in the American pacifist movement and both a theorist and practitioner of nonviolence. He remained active in peace causes until his death. He was, at various times, a Communist, an anti-Communist Socialist and a well-connected activist within the Democratic Party. He was a champion of the American labor movement and a well-traveled advocate of human rights throughout the world. He was a talented musician who once considered a career as a professional singer and entertained audiences with his powerful tenor voice throughout his life. He was an avid collector of art and antiques. He was a self-educated scholar of philosophy and political theory. He was a black American. And he was a gay man.
Rustin juggled these multiple roles and multiple identities with remarkable agility and, on the surface at least, seldom exhibited any serious anxiety about the strains they must often have created for him. Indeed, the picture that emerges from Jervis Anderson's admiring portrait is of a man with an almost insouciant imperviousness to the many trials, assaults and frustrations he experienced as he moved through the public world. Rustin became an important force in many organizations and movements, but in most of them he also alienated or embarrassed the leadership and found himself obliged to move on. His life was dominated by his consistent commitment to work actively on behalf of peace and social justice, but it was also characterized by a restless instability. Few things could contain him for very long.
Mr. Anderson worked at the A. Philip Randolph Institute when Rustin was its executive director in the late 1960's, and he has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1968. "Bayard Rustin: Troubles I've Seen" reflects both experiences: a reverence for Rustin that Mr. Anderson evidently derived from his association with him, and a clean, straightforward prose style characteristic of the magazine for which he works. He provides the first thorough account of Rustin's life and career, and he suggests how Rustin became so eminent a figure without ever becoming a genuine leader. "He didn't lead so much as he influenced," The New York Times observed in an editorial when Rustin died in 1987. And he derived that influence from a combination of intelligence, magnetism and charm that Mr. Anderson effectively portrays.
Rustin was born in 1912 into a middle-class black family in West Chester, Pa. Not until he was an adolescent did he discover that the man and woman who had raised him were not his parents but his grandparents, and that his real mother was a woman he had always assumed was his older sister, who had given birth to him when she was 17 years old. His father was a young man from the neighborhood whom Bayard never knew. As with many other important personal issues in Rustin's life, Mr. Anderson offers few clues as to what effect this shocking discovery might have had on him. But he does note that Rustin went to some lengths to hide the facts of his birth from all but a few close friends.
The Rustins were Quakers, and Bayard grew up in and absorbed the political -- although never much of the religious -- ethos of his family's faith. He attended two colleges for a year each and, despite real academic gifts, left both under mysterious circumstances, perhaps related to his homosexuality. Not long after that, he gave up his ambitions to become a professional musician, began his long career as a political activist and moved to New York, where he lived through most of the rest of his life.
While taking courses at City College in the late 1930's, he became active in its Young Communist League, where he stood out as the only black person, as a talented organizer and as an epicure who introduced his comrades to good wines, cheeses and pates. Rustin was interested in the league largely because of its commitment to the racial struggles in the South. In 1941, when Moscow ordered the American Communist Party to abandon its civil rights commitments and focus on World War II, he left the organization.
He moved instead into the orbit of two great anti-Communist Socialists of the 1940's and 50's: A. Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and one of the pre-eminent black leaders of the era; and A. J. Muste, a leading pacifist and the head of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Rustin helped Randolph organize a great march on Washington in the spring of 1941 -- and then angrily (if temporarily) broke with him when Randolph canceled the march in response to Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order banning racial discrimination in war industries. Rustin then joined forces with Muste and became a major figure in the Fellowship of Reconciliation's peace campaigns during and after the war.
As a Quaker, Rustin easily won conscientious objector status. But true to the radical pacifism of Muste and his organization, he refused to report to the Civilian Public Service camp to which he was then assigned, because, he said, "I cannot voluntarily submit to an order stemming from the Selective Service Act." He spent nearly two and a half years in Federal prison as a result, the first of many imprisonments he experienced -- all but one of them for acts of conscience.
For the first eight years after the war, Rustin remained almost wholly within the Fellowship of Reconciliation and, as one of the organization's most popular and magnetic speakers, traveled widely on its behalf. But in 1953, while on a trip to California sponsored by the organization, he was arrested on a morals charge when he was found having sex with two young men in a parked car near his hotel. Rustin's associates had long known of his homosexuality and had quietly tolerated it. But the stern and at times self-righteous Muste could not forgive Rustin for a public scandal that might damage the fellowship, and he unceremoniously dismissed him from the organization.
It was a low point in Rustin's life -- and a moment that Mr. Anderson (who rarely offers much explanation of the critical ways in which Rustin's homosexuality surely affected him) handles gingerly. But Rustin's departure from the Fellowship of Reconciliation in fact helped him move in new and more visible directions. Three years later, after working for a while for another pacifist organization (one more tolerant of his personal life), he responded to the urgings of the novelist Lillian Smith and A. Philip Randolph and traveled to Montgomery, Ala., where he joined Martin Luther King Jr. in organizing the bus boycott that established King as a national figure. And for the next 10 years, he moved back and forth between the world of the civil rights movement and the world of peace activism, both movements then committed to the Gandhian ideas of nonviolence to which Rustin subscribed. His past followed him everywhere -- his youthful ties to the Communist Party, his wartime imprisonment, his arrest in California; Rustin often had to limit his public exposure to avoid discrediting King and others whom Southern white leaders (and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) were attempting to destroy. But his training in the peace movement, and his sophisticated understanding of philosophies of nonviolence and social witness, made him an influential and valued adviser to more visible figures still searching for the intellectual underpinnings of their efforts.
Rustin worked closely with King and the movement for nearly a decade and was particularly important in helping Randolph plan the 1963 March on Washington, the high-water mark of the nonviolent age of civil rights. But his relationship with King was never an easy one. In part, it was because his radical past and very likely, although no one ever said so, his homosexuality made the beleaguered leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference uncomfortable as they struggled against the false accusations of Communism that the F.B.I. and others flung at them.
But Rustin's problems with King were also a result of Rustin's own relative conservatism in areas in which King was becoming more radical. He criticized King for denouncing the Vietnam War; Rustin opposed it too, but like many others he thought King was compromising his leadership of the civil rights struggle by linking the issues. He opposed King's plan to take the movement to Chicago in 1966, warning (correctly) that the prospects for success were dim. And he began to argue as early as 1967 that the "movement" phase of the civil rights struggle had lost its usefulness, that it was time for blacks to turn to politics (and to form coalitions with other progressive forces, most notably labor) to work for the economic reforms that should now be their most important goal.
In the late 60's, Rustin at last found in his leadership of the A. Philip Randolph Institute the secure institutional base he had always lacked. But at the same time, he was becoming increasingly at odds with his former colleagues in the movement. He was a strong critic of black nationalism and black power, a fervent believer in making political alliances with powerful groups dominated by whites, a defender of the Democratic Party and the labor movement, even an energetic supporter of Albert Shanker and the United Federation of Teachers in their bitter battle against the effort by black activists to win community control of public schools in New York. He remained in demand as a speaker and adviser throughout the 70's and 80's, and he served on many committees and boards. But while his life was no less active in those years than it had been in his youth, his influence was less profound. And when he died, even his admirers had some difficulty articulating exactly what had made him a significant figure in the nation's recent history.
But Rustin was a significant figure, perhaps more significant than Mr. Anderson's cautious biography makes clear. Not so much for the speeches he made, the organizations he assisted and the events he orchestrated, but for the way in which he, almost alone among the major figures of the civil rights movement, tried to articulate a set of ideas and theories to justify their efforts and shape their tactics. He was a man of ideas and a man of action, of "pragmatic idealism," as Vernon Jordan said in eulogy. And in an age of acrimony and division, he helped keep alive the fading vision of a broad, consensual coalition of the forces of change.

HEADLINE: Even Without Snow, Winter Means Travel

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
JUST plain winter, with or without snow, is enough to send people packing. So say those who sell winter travel packages.
"People may not be as desperate to get away this year, but winter is still winter and they want to go," reported Ina Rich, founder and chief executive officer of Rich World Wide Travel, with headquarters in Harrison, one of several travel agents interviewed. Even a week off in a short month like February, traditionally observed by most schools, had little negative impact on travel plans. 
 "Trips were shorter, four days instead of a week, and some parents even kept their kids out of school," said Allen Rich, a director of Rich World Wide Travel and Mrs. Rich's husband. "But there were very few cancellations in any of our offices."
Mr. Rich added, however, that "everything has a direct impact on the travel industry. Whatever affects the world, weather, political unrest, the stock market, we feel it. Right now the public's perception of the economy is that it is stable and times are good. And that upbeat outlook shows up in increased business for us."
Rich World Wide Travel employs 148 people in 6 retail offices in Harrison, Somers, Chappaqua and Pearl River and 2 offices in Manhattan. The company also operates 12 corporate in-house ticketing offices. Rich, which ranks among the 100 largest independent travel agencies in the country, evolved from the Riches' early careers as tour operators.
"Back in the 50's, we were a young married couple, teachers who ran summer teen tours all over the world," Mr. Rich recalled. "My wife, who wanted to stay home after our first child was born, opened a travel agency in Scarsdale in 1968. She gets the credit for building the business. I joined her in 1980, and now with our two sons-in-law in with us, we have a real family enterprise."
Given their own family structure, it is not surprising that when speaking about trends in travel, the Riches say the multigeneration vacation is hot.
"We've taken a number of three-generation vacations ourselves," Mrs. Rich said. "And the family market is very strong." "Instead of throwing the big party, our clients are celebrating important anniversaries and birthdays with their children and grandchildren on location. Bermuda, an easy flight from New York, is one popular destination. Resorts and cruise ships are others. Cruises are an excellent buy. There are a lot of bargains around. And a cruise lends itself to a three-generation vacation because it offers something for everyone. It's also the easiest way travel, with a minimum of packing and unpacking."
The renewed interest in golf has led to another trend, the golf tour, Mr. Rich said. "Lately, we've been sending more clients out on golf tours than ever," he said. "They favor resorts in the South and the West and in Bermuda. And spring bookings, beginning in May, for golf tours in Scotland and Ireland are heavy."
At Pied Piper Tours in Chappaqua, Kay Mullane, the owner, said that last winter's snows changed business sharply. "We run bus trips for older adults, and we always were busy year round," Ms. Mullane said. "But we were faced with so many weather-related cancellations last year that we reorganized our business, and this year cut out winter trips entirely. We hope to make up for it by scheduling more spring and summer overnight tours to our most popular destinations like Williamsburg, Cape Cod and the Allegheny Mountains."
Joel Dash of Dash Travel in Mount Vernon has been in the travel business for 39 years. And rarely, he said, in all those years have there been the travel bargains that there are now.
"Bargains that have a negative impact on the profits of travel agencies," he said. "When we book a cruise that cost $2,000 last year and is going for $1,000 this year, a cut in profits results."
By the same token, he said, consumers are profiting.
"How can you beat $349 for a seven-day, all-inclusive Carnival cruise from Miami to San Juan?" he said. "And more than a half a dozen mega cruise ships, those carrying approximately 3,200 passengers, are coming on line in the next couple of years. The Carnival line has three; Royal Caribbean has two. If these ships are to go out anywhere near capacity, I think the policy of offering deep discounts will continue."
Today's consumers are hunting for bargains in all other types of travel, he added.
"They are very price sensitive and savvy," he said. "They read the ads and quote the prices of airline promotions. Right now, there are many travel deals around at unbelievable prices."
One example, he said, is Alitalia's promotional fare of $279, which has stimulated winter tourism to Italy.
"People who have never been to Europe are passing up Florida for sightseeing," Mr. Dash said. But the best buy around, he said, "is Air Moroc's $899 package to Morocco, which includes everything: air, meals and hotel. They use Club Valtur, which is the Italian version of Club Med and very luxurious."
Asked to describe the pace of business at Briarcliff Travel Service in Briarcliff, Lenisse Goldberg said: "It's running off the walls, we're so busy. We're also an American Express Agency, so we draw our clients from all parts of the county. Our advance bookings are well ahead of last year with the volume of leisure travel up."
Ms. Goldberg said the increase in travel reflects the general feeling that the economy is strong. "I think the early bookings are an indication," she said. "People are confident enough to plan ahead."
And the excellent travel buys on the market are a strong contributing factor, Ms. Goldberg added: "We're selling well-priced packages to Asia and Europe. Greece is a popular summer destination. Disney is No. 1 for families and honeymooners, although Hawaii, after losing ground, is back in favor for honeymoons."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Air Fare Specials Served Up on the Web

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
THE growing use of the Internet for selling air fares has been compared to a revolution, supposedly as important as the dawn of the jet age in the late 1950's and airline deregulation in 1978.
Calling the trend a revolution may be an overstatement, but it has evolved rapidly, with many domestic airlines using the Internet's potential by offering discounts to computer users. For the airlines, the Internet offers an inexpensive way to advertise fares to fill seats that generally go unsold for weekend travel. And there appears to be a big appetite for such discounts -- several airlines have signed up tens of thousands of subscribers within the last year. 
 Each week, the airlines that offer such fares -- including American, Northwest, Continental and USAir -- send out discounts for travel between certain cities to subscribers via electronic mail or post them on their World Wide Web computer sites.
The fares, which are typically about 75 percent less than 21-day advance purchase fares, are intended for spur-of-the-moment travel, as they are good only for the coming weekend. The airlines say they generally change the list of cities each week. Although every airline's rules vary slightly, the fares are typically posted every Wednesday, and require leaving on a Friday or Saturday, returning on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday.
American Airlines, for example, offered round-trip fares during the first weekend of February that ranged from about $69 to $189. A round-trip between Dallas and La Guardia Airport in New York was $179; a New York to Boston round-trip ticket was $89. American also offers international fares, such as a $249 round-trip between New York and London. The international fares are sent out on Mondays for departures on Thursday or Friday, and return flights the following Monday or Tuesday.
Not everyone is applauding the trend. Donald L. Pevsner, an attorney who describes himself as a consumer advocate on many aviation issues, filed a petition in January with the United States Department of Transportation. He said that the Internet-only fares represent "invidious discrimination" by airlines against consumers, like him, who do not own a computer. Mr. Pevsner said that when he calls an airline and requests its lowest available fare for a particular route and is not told about the Internet deals, that is discriminatory.
"The computer is a tool," Mr. Pevsner said in an interview. "It is not supposed to be some unfair edge."
The airline industry counters that use of the Internet is simply another way of distributing its product. The Transportation Department has not yet ruled on Mr. Pevsner's request. USAir, however, said that if travelers call a toll-free number, (888) 359-3728,, and tell the airline which cities they are interested in flying between, the agent will check whether any of its discounts on the Internet are available. Travelers who have specific cities in mind can also ask agents at Continental's toll-free number, (800) 525-0280, whether any Internet fares are available that week. At American and Northwest, the fares are only for those who learn about them through the Internet.
Some of the largest airlines, including Delta and United, do not yet offer Internet-only fares. United said it is developing a system that subscribers can customize so that they receive special fares only for certain destinations.
For now, the growth of Internet fares has eclipsed another fledgling idea -- electronic auctions on the Internet, in which airlines receive bids for tickets. American Airlines held three such auctions last year. But a spokesman for American, Tim Smith, said the company found aspects of the auctions cumbersome. "It was definitely a learning process," he said.
Cathay Pacific Airways held several successful auctions last year. It is planning just one this year, though, because most of its flights to Hong Kong this year are already largely booked. Its auction for 1,000 seats in economy class for travel from September through November will be held this summer. Cathay Pacific also has 130,000 subscribers for its Internet-only fares, which have fewer restrictions than those offered by the United States airlines.
Although Internet fares appear to be a greater success for the moment than auctions, other companies say they are committed to the idea. A fledgling business called Electronic Travel Auction with the Web address http://www.etauction.com began offering a variety of travel packages in January. Its auctions generally run for 30 days, and people who place a bid (the seller sets a minimum bid) are sent electronic mail to inform them whether they are the new high bidder.
Mark Hawkins, president of the company, said the business has started relatively slowly, but that with the recent addition of partners like Hilton, interest should grow quickly. He, too, is eager to learn what form on-line auctions will eventually take. "Every day brings yet another twist that forces you to change your business plan," he said.

Irish Famine Remembered
Q. We plan to travel to Ireland this year and would like information on events commemorating the Great Famine. -- Doris Moran Weisberg, Lawrenceville, N.J.
A. Hundreds of thousands of people died and more than a million emigrated from Ireland during the famine from 1845 to 1850; 1997 marks 150 years since "Black '47," considered the worst year. 
 One major project designed to commemorate the tragedy and recognize the emigrants' contributions is the Great Irish Famine Event, centered on Millstreet in County Cork on May 31 and June 1. It is being organized, with the support of the Irish Government, by the Big Issues Social Initiative, a charity that publishes a magazine sold by vendors who are homeless or unemployed.
The event will include "The Gathering" on May 31 at Drishane Castle, with readings and songs and the lighting of a Famine Candle by Ireland's President, Mary Robinson. Also in Millstreet, there will be a concert June 1 celebrating Irish culture, with the Chieftains and the Dubliners expected to appear.
In Cobh (the port for Cork, about an hour's drive from Millstreet), a copy of a 19th-century ship will be moored, with flowers placed on board by visitors in memory of the emigrants; on June 1, the ship will set sail to lay the flowers at sea.
A single ticket for both days' events is about $171, calculated at $1.71 in United States currency to the Irish punt, including a contribution of $103. Information or reservations: (800) 586-3197. The event has a Web site at http://www.famine.ie/
A Boston-based company is arranging packages around the event; contact Conferences International, 25 Huntington Avenue, Suite 607, Boston, Mass. 02116; (617) 266-5800 or (800) 221-8747, fax (617) 266-5886.
 
Barrier Reef on the Cheap
Q. A friend and I are planning to visit the Great Barrier Reef in Australia for two weeks in late December. We are students on a tight budget. Can you tell us the cheapest time to purchase tickets? Do you have any ideas on where to stay? -- Stacy Khong, Lakewood, Calif.
 
A. Late December, with school vacations and Christmas holiday travel, is a busy travel time in Australia, and air fares, too, are on the high side then. The lowest student fare currently available from S.T.A. Travel, an agency that has contracts with several airlines flying to Australia, is $1,206 round trip midweek between Los Angeles and Cairns, gateway to the Reef. Reservations by October are recommended.
S.T.A. has 17 locations throughout the country, including three in Southern California; the company's toll-free number is (800) 777-0112. You will need an international student ID card, which the company can issue.
Of the islands that belong to the Great Barrier Reef National Park, camping is permitted on about two dozen. A permit is required, and in most cases you must take all provisions and gear. The cost is generally $2.50 a person a night. (Prices calculated at $1.19 Australian to the United States dollar.) The reservations procedure is outlined in a flier from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Department of Environment, Box 155, Brisbane Albert Street, Queensland 4002, Australia; (61-7) 3227-8187, fax (61-7) 3227-8749.
If you don't camp, staying right on the Reef may be beyond your budget. On Lady Elliot Island, prices in late December will be $97 a person, double occupancy, in a tent cabin, including buffet breakfast and dinner. Reservations: (800) 531-9222 in the United States. Heron Island, another atoll, has cabins starting at $125 a person, double occupancy, including three meals. Reservations: (61-79) 78 1488, fax (61-79) 78 1457.
You have many more options if you stay on the coast and make day trips to the Reef. The Australian Tourist Commission's Aussie Help line, (847) 296-4900, can provide information on hostels. Among the possibilities in Cairns are the Bellview, 85 The Esplanade, (61-70) 31 4377, where rates start at $14 a person in a four-bedded dormitory room, and Jimmy's on The Esplanade, 83 The Esplanade, (61-70) 31 6884, with rates starting at $13 a person.
About three hours' drive north of Cairns, in Cape Tribulation, another recommendation is PK's Jungle Village, at Avalon Street and Cape Tribulation Road, (61-70) 98 0040, fax (61-70) 98 0006, which is set on a beach and has a pool, restaurant, water sports and a party atmosphere; the cost is $40 for two people in a double room (shared bath), $13 a person in a room with eight beds. Boats go to the outer reef, about 30 minutes away, from $42.
Eight or nine hours by road south of Cairns, the town of Airlie Beach is a good jumping-off point for the 70-odd Whitsunday Islands, as well as reef trips. Two hostels recommended by the local tourist information center: Whitsunday Backpackers, 13 Begley Street; (61-79) 46 7376, which charges $12 a person in four- or six-bedded dormitory rooms or $30 for two in a double, including breakfast. Beaches Backpackers, Shute Harbor Road, (61-79) 46 6244, charges $12 a person in a five-bedded dorm room with its own bath.
For an island experience, Hook Island in the Whitsunday Group, has cabins for $46 a night for two people (shared bath), or dormitory accommodations for $12 a person. Reservations: (61-79) 46 6900.
 
On the Ice in Paris
Q. While in Paris in late May, I would like to go ice-skating. Is there an indoor rink in the city or nearby? -- Charlotte L. Thorp, Brooklyn, N.Y.
A. The Patinoire de St.-Ouen, about 10 minutes by Metro from the center of Paris, was built in 1980 and has large glass walls that provide plenty of light. Like most rinks in the city, it closes June 1 to Sept. 10.
Hours vary by the day: Tuesday, 11:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 8:30 to 11 P.M.; Wednesday, 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 2:30 to 6 P.M.; Thursday, 11:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 5 to 8 P.M.; Friday, 11:30 A.M. to 1 P.M., 4:30 to 6 P.M. and 8:30 to 11 P.M.; Saturday, 2:30 to 6 P.M. and 8:30 to 11 P.M., and Sunday 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 2:30 to 6 P.M.
Admission, $2.30 to $5.10; skate rental, $2.30 to $3.10 (at 5.42 francs to the United States dollar).
The rink is a one-minute walk from the Metro station Mairie de St.-Ouen on Ligne 13, Chatillon-Montrouge/St. Denis-Basilique. From Paris, be sure to take the train that is going to St. Denis-Basilique; look for that name on the electronic boards on the Metro platform, since the line separates into two directions at some points.

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
Works of Art That Once Humbly Bore the Soup

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
HEARTY STEW OR EFFETE consomme, soup has been a culinary constant in most world cultures, its presence on the menu symbolic of prosperity and hospitality. But it was not until the middle of the 18th century that the tureen -- an oval lidded container designed expressly for the serving of soup -- made the esthetic advance from rustic receptacle to masterly, occasionally lurid art form.
"Think how marvelous it must have looked, carried in by candlelight, the soup steam issuing from its nostrils," said Patricia Halfpenny, the curator of ceramics and glass of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del. She was waxing lyrical over a new acquisition, an antique tureen whose iconography is not for diners of weak constitution. 
 Made in England in 1754, at the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory, the tureen depicts a queasy-making sight: a life-size boar's head, severed by hunters and set on a platter. Painted blood drips from its eyes and mouth, and its flared nostrils are cunningly pierced to allow steam to escape, a practical consideration that also added considerable drama to the plate passing of dinner time.
Until recently, the tureen, appropriately enough, was in the collection of the Campbell Museum in Camden, N.J. A creation of John T. Dorrance Jr., a former chairman of Campbell Soup Company, the museum was built in 1970 to house 300 tureens and other soup-related tableware: spoons, ladles, plates, broth bowls.
Poor attendance forced the museum to close last March, but its contents, which were assembled between 1966 and 1993, were donated to Winterthur. Of the 125 tureens that will go on permanent display there on May 24, eight are temporarily housed in a small alcove on the second floor of the Galleries, Winterthur's primary exhibition building. This recently opened installation acts as a sort of appetizer to May's main course.
As a form, the tureen came into its own as a result of the 18th-century fashion for meals served a la francaise, where the dishes and serving pieces were set on the table at once in a sumptuous groaning-board sort of mosaic-cum-buffet.
In royal and aristocratic houses -- or those whose owners aspired to a similar distinction -- French-style dining was a fad that demanded, and inspired, the creation of extravagant tableware. When assembled en masse, these pieces would provide a crass but highly gratifying metaphor for a host's financial success.
The queen of serving pieces was the tureen. And its piping hot contents were not only fashionable; it also provided the first step in multicourse meals whose evolution -- from primal broth to artistic desserts -- would have appealed to the deep thinkers of the Age of Reason. Simply put, a tureen was one of the tickets to chic in the 18th century.
"Did I write you word we had got a new terene?" Mary Delany, an Irish artist, proudly reported to a friend in the middle of the 1740's. "The chasing is mighty well done; it holds six quarts, and has a very light look."
Inspired by contemporary fashions -- Roman antiquities, rococo naturalism, the bucolic artifice fostered by faux shepherdesses like Marie Antoinette -- potters and silversmiths of the day elevated tureens to a stylistic apotheosis.
Tureens took the form of livestock and farm produce: swans, rabbits, a head of cabbage, a speckled hen with her golden chicks. Some designs refer to regional food specialties. An especially splendid example at Winterthur, a faience tureen made in Portugal in the 1700's, takes the shape of a wooden bucket full of freshly caught fish, making it the perfect container for a seafood stew.
Scottish, American and Polish silversmiths created tureens that resembled neo-classical chalices, while other artisans took the opportunity to incorporate little history lessons. For all its glazed gore, the Chelsea-ware boar's head has noble precedent. It refers to the medieval habit of opening a banquet with a fresh boar's head encased in decorative pastry and icing.
Then there were tureens that acted as giant postcards, like those from a dinner service made around 1825 as a wedding gift for Princess Louise of Prussia. Mounted on leather-topped ormolu presentation stands, the tureens are emblazoned with meticulous hand-painted scenes of Berlin buildings and gardens.
The illustrations perhaps acted as much as aides-memoire as symbols of national pride. The bride, after all, was leaving her country behind to marry a Dutch prince. Still, it is doubtful that her tureens ever saw much use, for the same reason many modern wedding gifts gather dust.
"Dinner services like that often had a formal, ceremonial function," Ms. Halfpenny said. "So it was very likely that the tureens were used once, at the wedding dinner, and then never again."
By the end of the 19th century, however, the fashion for soup as a first course among trend-setting hosts had declined, thanks in part to the efficiency of the Industrial Revolution. Dinner services, and hence tureens, had become widely available, and at prices low enough to enable diners of every economic station to declare "Soup's on."
Which, perhaps, explains the anti-soup rhetoric of Elsie de Wolfe, a decorator of the 1920's. Her standards as a hostess were as formidable as her interiors. "Never begin a meal on a lake," she counseled. Perhaps all she lacked was the right tureen.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Terry Cassidy;
High-Tech World, Low Scores in Literacy

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
BETWEEN 300,000 and 400,000 Connecticut residents are functionally illiterate. The information comes from Terry Cassidy, who for 16 years was executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education and since September has been the executive director of the Literacy Volunteers of America-Connecticut Inc.
"We are becoming more aware that we have a real problem as businesses become more sophisticated, more dependent upon computers, the manuals become more difficult to follow. If you have a problem with reading it is more and more difficult to hide," explained Mr. Cassidy. 
 Not that problems only arise in high-tech environments. "Someone came to Literacy Volunteers after learning that he'd been sneaking cigarettes behind a boiler under the sign that said, 'Caution flammable liquids, no smoking,' " Mr. Cassidy said.
At the national level, President Bill Clinton has announced the creation of America Reads, with 100,000 new college work-study jobs devoted to tutoring in reading.
In Connecticut, Mr. Cassidy recently discussed his concerns about illiteracy. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Does the term "functionally illiterate" mean that someone cannot read at all?
A. People who cannot process words at all are illiterate. Someone who is functionally illiterate cannot fill out a job application, follow certain directions, handle mail, read traffic signs or do very basic things an office needs to do.
The illiterate population is high. In some respects it will get higher, because business and industry are more complicated. So that someone who was able to just get by won't be able to get by a few years from now because of the demand to read more complicated materials.
Q. With changes in public assistance many more people will be seeking entry-level jobs. Does literacy have a role in this social issue?
A. Clearly a large percentage of people on welfare are challenged when it comes to literacy. How are these people going to work? It's almost an impossible situation for them. Employers aren't in business to help people learn how to read.
A lot of people who are going off welfare will get positions and not stay with them very long. We'll see people going from employment to unemployment, back and forth. It is very discouraging.
Even to flip a hamburger you might have to read a sign that says, "caution," or directions on how to get the french fry machine going. There are simple cleaning fluids that can become lethal when combined.
If policy makers do not develop strategies to help people who are going off welfare to develop the capacities they need to succeed at work -- literacy being one of them -- the crisis among poor people is only going to worsen.
Q. Can Literacy Volunteers take care of the problem in Connecticut?
A. It is amazing that in the wealthiest state in the nation, the wealthiest country in the world, we don't seem to get the importance of providing people with the context in which they can flourish. We have 17 affiliates with close to 4,000 volunteer tutors. They help approximately 6,500 adults learn how to read or speak English. We cannot help everyone. It is getting more difficult to recruit volunteers. Tutors, particularly in basic reading, tend to develop close relationships with their clients.
Literacy Volunteers is doing a wonderful job with a relatively small group of people but there is an enormous unmet need out there that we can't respond to because of resources and getting enough tutors.
Q. Is this a problem concentrated in Connecticut's urban areas?
 A. No. Fairfield County has one of the largest Literacy Volunteers, with English as a second language and basic literacy instruction their mission. The problem with illiteracy is not a problem of minorities. Fully 50 percent of the nonreading population is white. It is a problem of our entire society. It tends to be a problem of lower-income people, but not always.
It can be people like spouses who stay at home; they find it most difficult to admit they have a reading problem. It can be people who own their own business; recently we had a fellow who has run a candy store in Hartford's North End for many years. Clever, resourceful people can explain away the fact that they aren't writing something down.
Q. Does Literacy Volunteers work with immigrants in Connecticut?
 A. Absolutely. One of the fastest growing populations that we're working with are people who do not speak English as their primary language. The largest percentage are Spanish speakers but we have people from Bosnia, a relatively large number from Asian countries. I suspect we have about every language you might imagine.
There is a difference between people who come to us for language instruction and people who come to us for literacy. No shame is involved in learning to speak English. People are ashamed that they can't read.
Q. Do public schools have a role in alleviating illiteracy among adults?
 A. There is a the lack of connection between public schools and the issue of adult literacy. Family literacy is one of the major concepts that literacy groups are looking at now. Involving parents who are illiterate with their young children who are learning how to read is sometimes a very positive motivator. Family literacy centers located in public schools might be very helpful.
One of the keys to getting an adult to learn how to read is to remove all the barriers to learn. One could be lack of eyeglasses, another could be child care. It's tough to concentrate on learning how to read when you don't know where your child is. Schools with parent centers have a facility where parents come where their children are at the same time. Tutoring under those conditions can be pretty successful.
Q. Is there a link between imprisonment and illiteracy? A. A very high percentage of prisoners don't have high school diplomas. There are few programs in prisons to help people who are illiterate. Literacy volunteers are involved to some extent, but our presence is nowhere near as great as it should be. The state does not provide the kind of intervention that any prisoner needs to learn and grow.
Q. Is it possible to graduate from a Connecticut high school and not know how to read? A. I hear enough anecdotes that suggest that some young people getting out of high school read at very low levels. There is a reading system called the National Adult Literacy Survey that divides the reading population into five categories. The lowest is complete illiteracy. Next is fifth-grade literacy level. People are graduating at that reading level. When they get into the workplace they are at a serious disadvantage. There are myriad reasons why people don't learn how to read in school. The fact that no one diagnosed the need for eyeglasses is one. Learning disability is another. Attention disorder is another. I suspect I wouldn't have learned to read very well if I came from a violent family where my mother were being abused and I was being abused. There are emotional factors that get in the way of learning how to read. There is also institutional racism, which will expect little from some children and reinforce the fact that they are not achieving.
I don't think it is reasonable to call a second-grader lazy or unwilling to read. A child that age isn't capable of making that decision.
I would like to see public education put us out of business by making sure that every child learns how to read, but we're always going to have problems with poverty and problems with learning disabilities.
Q. What method do you use to teach someone to read?
 A. Literacy Volunteers is based on a model that is student centered. That means we do an individual assessment of each person who comes to us to determine his or her level of ability. Then we develop programs based upon their needs.
What I hear causes people to come into L.V.A. is that something happens in their lives that challenges them in a new way. An example would be a divorce or death where the person who was a good reader is no longer present.
Q. What is your vision for the Literacy Volunteers in the future?
A. I would like greater coordination with the Department of Social Services. I would love for us to become more closely associated with hospitals: first, to make sure that every health worker can read -- and to identify patients who can't read. After all, these patients will be going home with prescription bottles.
I would like us to develop a much closer relationship with business and industry. We ought to be providing workplace literacy.
Programs that occur on the job and with tutors from the industry are the most successful.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
At the Center Of Modern Architecture

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
TUNE IN TO A NATIONAL TREASURE ON Wednesday night at 9, when PBS presents a 90-minute documentary on I. M. Pei., the elder statesman of American architecture. Best known for large institutional projects like the East Building of the National Gallery in Washington and the overhaul of the Louvre, he is also the embodiment of charm. "First Person Singular: I. M. Pei," produced and directed by Peter Rosen, an Emmy Award winner, and narrated mainly by Pei himself, documents the combination of esthetic conviction and personal charisma that enabled the architect to get these projects built.
His work is well worth looking at in this season of yearning for the "vital center." No architect more fully embodies that concept. Pei is the great architect of liberal consensus culture. His work epitomizes the American ethos that by midcentury had embraced the tenets of modernism as the authentic expression of our age. Pei recast those tenets in projects that ranged across the social and economic spectrum, from low-cost housing in Washington to the grandly dynamic East Building. It is moving to recall a time when the ends of that spectrum seemed less far apart. 
 Aptly, it was the commission to design the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, bestowed by Jacqueline Kennedy, that catapulted Pei into the front ranks of American architects in the late 1960's. And his work in the decades since then has been suffused with a Camelot-like aura.
"First Person Singular" shows Pei in Paris, revisiting the underground building topped by a glass pyramid that he designed for the Louvre, and a handful of his other projects on three continents. He appears not simply as an architect but in fact as a kind of ambassador of culture, an emissary from a time before the liberal consensus crumbled beneath pressures from left and right. The archetypal Pei space -- a sculpturally geometrical atrium radiant with light pouring through a glazed metal frame -- is a glowing shrine to the belief in progressive art and architecture.
Viewers of this first of three films (the historian John Hope Franklin, author of "From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans," considered the definitive text on the black experience in America, and the economist John Kenneth Galbraith are the other subjects), will have to flesh out much of this context for themselves.
From segments on Pei's childhood in China to one covering opening ceremonies at the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1995, this program is all foreground. We see little about the enormous changes that have overtaken cities during the years Pei has been practicing. We hear nothing about the post-modern critique of work like Pei's. Indeed the program offers no commentary to contradict its premise that Pei is "the architect of our time."
More damaging, the documentary barely sketches in the contentious chapters of architectural history that made Pei's success possible. Pei speaks in passing of the pioneer modernists who influenced him, like Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, and Marcel Breuer. But the account scarcely hints at the battles these architects waged for their beliefs. Conviction, not compromise, was what made the vital center possible. As a second-generation modernist, Pei faced fewer obstacles to the realization of his architectural vision. Even before he obtained large institutional commissions, the so-called International Style had become the house style of the establishment.
BUT THE TRIUMPH OF MODERN architecture created new problems in turn. For some observers, the corporate acceptance of modernism tarnished the movement's image as a moral force. These feelings resurfaced two years ago, in the negative response to Pei's design for the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. Younger architects, especially, resented that the man who designed the Louvre had been hired to create a building honoring Elvis and his progeny. My response was: this is America, rock-and-roll is our history, Elvis our "Winged Victory." Elvis wearing black leather in the Louvre is exactly what we all want to see.
Pei has, on the whole, managed to outlive the stigma of his success, largely because he did stick to his guns. With his work, there is no slippage in standards of the kind that has afflicted other successful firms like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill or Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo & Associates. One could object that the "first person singular" format of this documentary is wrong for representing architecture, the most collaborative of the arts. And the program does slight the contributions of Pei's partners, including Henry N. Cobb and James Ingo Freed.
Even so, Pei's personality is not a bad lens through which to see his work. "Architects talk to people," Frank Lloyd Wright once commented, and this very human aspect of the architect's work is often underestimated. It is useful to gain a glimpse of the social skills that have enabled this architect to soar. In describing his design process, Pei tempers his convictions with a grin at once mischievous and wise: "Or so I believe."

HEADLINE: Perish? No, Publish!

BYLINE: By BARRY SCHWABSKY 

 BODY:
IF you're an assistant professor of French history hoping to make tenure at your university, achieving your goal these days may not be as simple as it used to be. One of the most important criteria in tenure decisions is the candidate's publishing record. While journal articles are fine, a book (perhaps derived from your doctoral dissertation on, say, Oratorian education and the origin of French revolutionary ideology) would be even better. Preferably, it would be published by a leading university press -- a shining badge of scholarly merit.
Unfortunately, times have never been so tough for publishers of scholarly monographs on French history, among other once-standard areas of research in the humanities. Twenty years ago, an assistant professor's monograph might have been expected to sell as many as 1,500 copies. Since its publisher might have broken even at 1,100 copies, everyone was satisfied. Today, an author in the same position would be lucky to sell 800 copies, but the publisher's break-even point remains about the same. 
 So that monograph may never be published. Thus you may not win tenure, the tenure committee may not even be sure how to make such decisions, and students as well as other scholars may lose access to the knowledge the book would have shared.
The face of scholarly publishing is changing in ways that may affect universities for years to come. Money has become scarcer, not just for the presses but also, perhaps more alarmingly, for libraries, once the academic presses' most dependable customers. Some presses are hoping that the new superstores like Barnes & Noble and Borders will pick up the slack, but while the chains are ordering lots of scholarly books, it remains to be seen whether they can sell them. Beyond these immediate concerns, there are worries about how electronic publishing will affect its paper-based progenitor.
Which of these factors are most important? The directors of New Jersey's two major academic presses -- Walter H. Lippincott of Princeton University Press, which releases 200 titles a year with a staff of 95, and Marlie Wasserman of Rutgers University Press, whose staff of just 20 produces 140 books a year -- have divergent views.
For Ms. Wasserman, the big question is the effect of superstores. "Our part of New Jersey is loaded with the kind of superstores where I love to spend an afternoon sipping coffee and looking at books," she said, "though I lament the loss of so many of the mom-and-pop stores at the same time.
"But as these superstores proliferate, they need to line their shelves. What's new is that we've never had so many linear feet of shelf space to fill. In a sense, these books are being used as wallpaper. There's no evidence that any more of them are being bought. Instead, we've been seeing record returns."
Returns have always been the thorn in book publishers' side. Under longstanding tradition, booksellers who cannot sell what they order have the right to return them to the publisher for a full refund. The practice is specific to the book business; as Ms. Wasserman points out, "Macy's can't return a blouse they haven't sold." And while publishers have always grumbled about this system, the escalating rates of returns from the superstores have them more worried than ever.
One result is that "we do the opposite of what people might think," Ms. Wasserman said. "We try not to sell too aggressively. We want to try to have an order that realistically reflects what they can sell. Sometimes authors call and want to know why they didn't see their book on the shelves. Seeing that makes the author feel good, but we like to see our books in someone's hand at the cash register."
At Princeton, Mr. Lippincott is far more sanguine about the effect of the superstores. "So far they've been a big help," he says. Returns of Princeton's books increased by 12 percent last year, he acknowledged, but net sales increased by 9 percent, so "it's not something we're nervous about."
To him, the fundamental problem is the precipitous decline in the purchasing power of libraries -- a problem that some publishers had hoped expanded sales at superstores would solve. "We used to be able to sell 800 to 900 copies of each of our books to research libraries worldwide," Mr. Lippincott said. "Now, that figure is down to 300. That's just not enough to sustain the publication of a monograph. With only a few exceptions, even the most brilliant book in French history is unlikely to sell more than 500 copies."
Ms. Wasserman, too, is concerned. She estimates that 20 years ago, libraries accounted for half the sales of a typical Rutgers publication, but now the average would be closer to 5 percent. "It's an enormous change," she says, "and it's not going to get better, with the lack of funding to libraries and the growth of interlibrary loans."
But Rutgers's strategy involves developing a certain independence from the institutional market, which is why the consequences of the superstores' spread worry her so much more than Mr. Lippincott.

Catching the Eye Of the Browser
 Like many other university presses around the country, both Princeton and Rutgers publish a certain number of trade titles, books they hope may reach the broader book-buying public beyond the campuses.
At Princeton, many are in the sciences, like this spring's lead title, "T. Rex and the Crater of Doom," by the geologist Walter Alvarez of the University of California at Berkeley, who contends that the dinosaurs were rendered extinct by the Earth's collision, 65 million years ago, with a comet or an asteroid larger than Mount Everest. That book's first print run is a healthy 15,000 copies (a mid-size run for commercial publishers), and it's been picked up as a selection by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club, as well as a number of more specialized clubs. (A cute title seems to be one good sign for a trade science book. Also forthcoming from Princeton is "Why Toast Lands Jelly-Side Down: Zen and the Art of Physics Demonstrations," by Robert Ehrlich.)
Rutgers devotes an even larger portion of its list to trade titles than Princeton does, and many are books of regional interest. "We are the best and biggest publisher of books on New Jersey," Ms. Wasserman likes to say, adding that she also looks for books that focus on New York City, the Hudson River and the Poconos.
Among Rutgers's books this spring that fall into this regional rubric are "Fields of Sun and Grass: An Artist's Journal of the New Jersey Meadowlands," by John R. Quinn of Ridgefield Park; "Newark's Little Italy: The Vanished First Ward," by Michael Immerso, who grew up there, and "Subway City: Riding the Trains, Reading New York," by Michael W. Brooks, a professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania.
Regional books account for 15 percent of those Rutgers publishes, and Ms. Wasserman says she has been so pleased with their performance that she hopes to raise that figure to 20 percent, if only she can find enough good ones. She says she has a list of books she would publish if only she could find the right authors.
"For 10 years I've been looking for someone to write a social history of the Jersey Shore," she says. "I'd love to find the right person to write a guide to the area's fresh- and salt-water fishing, or a kind of lyrical guide to New Jersey's northwest counties."
She laments that so few authors think to champion the Garden State. "In many states, it's the opposite," she says. "In the South, in California, this kind of regional writing is a very active field. Here people look elsewhere for their subjects."
The idea of going out in search of authors for books that might find a market niche among general readers might once have raised eyebrows at university presses, whose editors were more used to passing judgment on scholarly monographs. Princeton is sticking more closely to the traditional model. Mr. Lippincott points up the distinction by remarking: "We're not going out to get someone to write 'The Best of New Jersey Cooking.' If I were Rutgers, I would." Princeton's strategy has been to try to increase the average dollar volume per book by changing the mix to include somewhat fewer titles in the humanities and more in fields like science and economics, in which more copies can be sold at higher prices.

Acceptance, Rejection And the Bottom Line
 Typically, the editorial process at a university press begins when an author submits a finished manuscript for consideration by an editor with expertise in the field. If the editor thinks the manuscript is a good candidate for publication, it is then sent out for readings by two scholarly experts in the field, who write detailed reports that are sent both to the editor and, anonymously, to the author. The readers may recommend that the book not be published, or that the author rework it before a final decision is made.
The power these readers wield over a book's fate makes their selection one of the most delicate aspects of this editorial process. Stories of outrageously arbitrary reasons for rejection are legion in the academic world; one philosophy professor, speaking on condition of anonymity, mentioned a case in an anonymous reader disparaged one of his books on the ground, among others, of his decision to use "she" rather than "he" as an indefinite pronoun.
If these outside readings are favorable, the editor submits the manuscript to an editorial committee for approval. Although the committee, consisting of members of the university's faculty, usually follows the recommendations of its editors and the outside readers, it need not do so. While "in a vast majority of cases there is consensus" at Rutgers, Ms. Wasserman said, "about once a year we are disappointed" at the rejection of a manuscript.
So what about that assistant professor's new monograph on French history? Does it languish unpublished? Mr. Lippincott insists that while "our goals can't be filled by publishing only monographs, any editor is free to propose a book that will lose money."
One reason scholarly books can lose money is that their publishers needn't turn a profit. Rutgers makes up its losses through support from its parent university -- a subsidy that, as Ms. Wasserman ruefully points out, has remained flat over the years even as expenses have grown. Princeton is in the more comfortable position of being able to operate without any direct financial contribution from the university; the press owns its own building and land and has its own endowment, through which its deficit is financed. By contrast, Mr. Lippincott points out that the University of Chicago has determined to convert its distinguished publishing arm into a profit center, which could radically change the nature of its list. "If we were forced to break even, there are a lot of books we could no longer do," he says. "If you want a press to make money, it won't do what the faculty wants."
Still, even money-losing institutions need to meet their budgets. If they lose more money than expected, the consequences may be even more dire than for a company whose profits fall short, As a result, academic presses need to sell more copies of each book than in the past.
For Ms. Wasserman, a sales figure of 2,000 copies over four years is a minimum goal for most books, although, she adds, "3,000 would be better." For now, she estimates, only about a quarter of the books Rutgers publishes meet that goal, but the shortfall is made up by a few books that sell much better than average.
Rutgers's top seller so far is " 'Quicksand' and Passing.' " That 1986 reissue of two short novels by Nella Larsen, a rediscovered protagonist of the Harlem Renaissance, has sold nearly 70,000 copies. Another best seller has been "Black Athena," by Martin Bernal, whose thesis is that Greek civilization derived from Egypt, and that the ancient Egyptians were black. Mr. Bernal says this history has been suppressed because of the racial biases of classical scholars, from whom the book has prompted spirited rebuttals. Ms. Wasserman attributes her press's emphasis on multiculturalism and on books dealing with racial issues not only to the region's demographics and her editors' interest, but also to the fact that there is a market for such books.
Mr. Lippincott cites a more conservative goal of selling 1,250 to 3,000 books for the average title, although he is quick to add that some of Princeton's books are never intended to sell that many, while some sell considerably more. For example, "The Nature of Space and Time," by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, has sold 19,000 copies, mainly on the strength of the authors' names, Mr. Lippincott says, "although you'd need a Ph.D. in astrophysics to understand it."

The Future Is Here, But It May Not Last
 One much-discussed factor that Mr. Lippincott and Ms. Wasserman agree has had little effect on their business is the brave new world of electronic publishing. One reason is that computers are more suited to short chunks of text than to book-length ones, so electronic publishing has had a more immediate impact on publishers of journals than of books. Princeton publishes just two journals, "Annals of Mathematics" and "Philosophy and Public Policy"; Rutgers none at all. In any case, Mr. Lippincott insists, "no one anyway has made a dime in electronic publishing."
Nonetheless, Princeton has recently experimented with the publication of its classic Richard Wilhelm-Cary F. Baynes translation of the ancient Chinese I Ching as a multi-media CD-ROM.
As Douglas Kincade, Princeton's publisher for electronic products, points out -- and the book's many users know full well -- "the I Ching has always existed uncomfortably in book form"; its structure is already a kind of proto-hypertext demanding that users flip back and forth from one section of the book to another to follow its multi-layered commentaries. There also seems to be a natural overlap between computer users and the New Age types who have made this scholarly landmark into a perennial seller.
But to develop such a disk, even from an existing book (or rather two books, since the CD also incorporates a separate volume of commentary by Hellmut Wilhelm, Richard's son, who is a distinguished China scholar in his own right) turns out to be an extremely expensive proposition, and as a result, Mr. Lippincott "would be very surprised to see it break even," he now says. "Although the product is very good, it's an experiment I don't see repeating."
Indeed, he points out that many publishers, among them Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins, are closing down their CD-ROM divisions because no adequate distribution system has emerged to handle them.
"There are 10,000 titles out there," he says, "but if you go out to the stores, only 50 titles are stocked, and those are games." Mr. Kincade admits, just a bit more optimistically, that "right now there's a tremendous down market for CD-ROMS, which we're hoping 'The Multi-Media I Ching' survives."
For now, Mr.Lippincott foresees limiting Princeton's ventures into the realm of CD-ROM to ones that are packaged with books, and in which the CD has been developed (and its development financed) by an outside source -- for instance, a tutorial in intermediate Chinese ("basically a talking workbook," as Mr. Kincade puts it) currently in the works.
What both the Rutgers and Princeton University Presses seem to agree on is that, as Ms. Wasserman says, they are facing a "harder, more challenging environment" for publishing, in which the demands of the intellect and of the market must be more carefully coordinated. For Mr. Lippincott, the challenge comes down to selling more copies without increasing the number of titles published, "so we can keep our jobs and prosper."
That assistant professor had better learn to write clearly, and perhaps with a broader focus. "The burden is now on the author to show there is a readership for what he or she is writing," Ms. Wasserman says. "Most of what doesn't get published just isn't good or has no audience. It's not that there are a lot of good books looking for publishers. There are a lot of good publishers looking for books."

Real Beach Kitsch, Not the Fake Stuff

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
AS amusement parks go, Disney World gives me the willies: All those preternaturally rapturous people wearing shirts plastered with advertisements, strewing disposable incomes across manicured Technicolor midways, while that dreadful mouse-face beams down over all like a penitentiary's searchlight. A day of this is enough to send me to the phone book for the number of an exterminator. One more rendition of "It's a Small World After All," and I'm ready to call Amnesty International.
All things considered then, on those infrequent occasions when the urge to visit an amusement park hits me, I'd rather be in Wildwood, New Jersey's most exuberantly declasse boardwalk resort. As the millenium approaches in a world where entertainment is all, Wildwood is the anti-Disney. 
 But there is startling cultural news from Wildwood, where the boardwalk curls for two miles along the Sahara-sized beach that piles up near the southern tip of the Jersey Shore. Last week, a squadron of earnest architects and design students was crawling all over the place, taking notes and snapping pictures and using sentences not normally heard in Wildwood, such as "look at that porte-cochere!"
The scholars were from the architecture school at Kent State University in Ohio, on a field trip to document (for the Library of Congress) Wildwood as a unique architectural trove of seaside boardwalk-town architecture from 1955 to 1965, the last golden age of America's endless summers. Besides the academics from Kent State, cultural historians from Cornell University have also begun studying Wildwood this year.
This will probably shock many South Jersey baby-boomers who once summered in Wildwood and have peeled away to more genteel spots like Avalon, Long Beach Island, the Hamptons, the Cote d'Azur: Wildwood, it seems, has been unearthed as a virtual Pompei of the school of design known as "doo-wop" (or, sometimes "populuxe") architecture, an exuberant late 1950's style of motel-building in which Gothic arches evolve into 40-foot plastic palms and flying buttresses become "Jetson Fins" painted cherry-blossom pink.
"We've been sitting on this huge collection of 1950's and 1960's architecture," said Jack Morey, the 37-year-old executive vice president of Morey's Piers, which operates several first-class amusement-park piers that are the major attractions on the otherwise tacky, honky-tonk boardwalk.
"Don't get me wrong, I love Disney World," said Mr. Morey, whose family has stubbornly upgraded its attractions every summer since his father and uncle left the motel business for the world of roller-coasters and Ferris wheels in 1969. "But where Disney creates nostalgia for things that never were, we have the real thing," said Mr. Morey, who has emerged as the head cheerleader for what some business people hope is an incipient revival of Wildwood, which has been having hard economic times in recent years, based on its "doo-wop" style.
Wildwood still occupies a time zone of the past in which neon signs are shaped like champagne glasses. Motels -- which only began taking credit cards in recent years -- still do business under oddly old-fashioned space-age names like Galaxie, Satellite and Astronaut.
"The style evokes a time when there was so much optimism in this country, when things were just sort of functioning well," Mr. Morey said.
But it will be a long haul, reviving Wildwood, which only recently was so desperate to turn things around that local officials hoping to open a gambling casino were in talks with an Indian tribe in Oklahoma. The tribe claimed it had aboriginal land rights in Wildwood inherited from ancestors who once roamed South Jersey.
Don't even mention the last flurry of publicity before that, in 1989, when five local businessmen were arrested on the beach, where they were tossing handfuls of chlorine tablets into the sea to try to improve clean-water ratings.
Mr. Morey insists that Wildwood is finally getting its act together. "Our boardwalk is the real thing," he said. "And we also have that beach."
That beach gathers in bewildering abundance and keeps growing in the five-mile nook above Cape May, while the rest of the shore screams about erosion. This is not always welcome. In some places, the beach is more than a quarter-mile wide, and lifeguards need to watch not only for floundering swimmers but also for those who faint of heat exhaustion on the way to the ocean.
Mr. Morey takes that in stride. "Heck, the amusement piers wouldn't be half their size if the ocean didn't keep moving back," he said.

HEADLINE: State Dollars: Whalers Arena Vs. Rails, Schools

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
THE vast majority of patrons at Bobby Valentine's Sports Gallery in Norwalk who watch hockey on one of the restaurant's two 42-inch television screens prefer to watch the New York Rangers. And when there is no game on and talk turns to hockey, it usually centers on the New York Rangers.
"This is Ranger territory," said Mike Allegra, the manager of the sports hangout, one of two Bobby Valentine-owned Sports Galleries in the state. Mr. Valentine, a native of Stamford (where the other one is situated) is the manager of the New York Mets. 
 Indeed, the same situation applies at practically all the sports bar-restaurants in Fairfield County. Likewise, sports sections of newspapers in Fairfield County tend to play up stories about the Rangers and even the New York Islanders, while relegating reports about the Hartford Whalers into wrapups about other National Hockey League games.
"There's not much interest in the Whalers around here," said Bob Birge, a sportswriter for The Connecticut Post in Bridgeport, only 50 miles from Hartford. "We cover the Rangers on a fairly regularly basis, but we don't cover the Whalers. To us, they're a Hartford team."
And they may not even be that for much longer, unless the state agrees to build the team a new arena. Peter Karamanos, the owner of the Whalers, has said he will move the club elsewhere, most likely to Nashville, or St. Paul, Minn., or Columbus, Ohio. And though the Whalers have a lease to stay at the Hartford Civic Center through the 1997-98 season, the state is expected to permit them to leave after the current season if a deal for a new arena cannot be worked out within the next few weeks.
This marks the second straight year that Mr. Karamanos has threatened to pull his team out of Hartford. A year ago, he said the Whalers organization would try to get out of its lease and move before this season began unless the team could increase its season-ticket sales from 5,800 to 11,000 by last May 1. (The Whalers did sell 9,200 season tickets, which, although less than the goal specified by Mr. Karamanos, apparently was sufficient to keep him from trying to move elsewhere.)
At the time, Mr. Karamanos and other club officials said the Whalers also would eventually need a new arena, even though the Civic Center is only 25 years old. But the Whalers general counsel and consultant for business affairs, Lou Beer, said, "It's ludicrous to think about a new arena when we can't fill the one we have."
The Whalers, again enduring a losing season, still can't fill the Civic Center Coliseum, although the team is averaging about 13,500 spectators -- largely because of a good start -- But the Hartford Civic Center seats only 14,660 for hockey and average attendance in the league is 15,000. Now the team says it needs a larger arena that would include more sky boxes (30 of 45 are currently leased for about $60,000 each) and "club seating" suites along with other amenities that would tend to increase the Whalers' income. Mr. Karamanos says losses have totaled about $40 million since he bought the team in 1994.
Under an agreement with the Connecticut Development Authority, a quasi-public body that bought the Civic Center from Richard Gordon, Mr. Karamanos is free to take the Whalers elsewhere after next season if the team has lost $30 million by then.
Gov. John G. Rowland, who has been the state's key negotiator in the effort to keep the Whalers in Hartford, and others who support that initiative, have made it a point to stress that the Whalers are in effect a state team and that to lose them would be calamitous.
Not everyone shares that feeling. Practically all the Whalers' fans -- and there have not been enough of them to suit Mr. Karamanos -- are from the Hartford area only. Gary Samek, the sports editor of the Norwich Bulletin in eastern Connecticut (where some hockey fans historically have followed the Boston Bruins), said, "We never staff their games and I've never had a single complaint."
Despite an apparent indifference to the Whalers across most of the state, Governor Rowland has indicated he would like to build a new arena for the Whalers (cost has been estimated at between $150 million and $250 million).
At a time when the Governor is trying to cut state college and university spending -- and eliminate the Danbury and Waterbury branches on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad along with the Shore Line East service from New Haven to New London -- any attempt to spend state money on an arena for a professional hockey team owned by a millionaire is likely to face resistance in the legislature. That the team's payroll has more than quadrupled from $5 million to about $20 million in less than a decade is also not likely to help the Governor's case.
Yet Mr. Rowland is on record as saying that he feels that it is essential to keep the Whalers in Hartford because they are an important asset to the state and give the capital the imprimatur of a big league city. Should the Governor recommend that state bonds be used to build an arena in order to keep the Whalers in Hartford, the issue would be bound to be one of the most provocative on this year's legislative calendar.
Though Mr. Karamanos says it has nothing to do with his hope of having the state build his team a new arena, he recently said he was considering establishing a branch of his Michigan-based company in the Hartford area. He said that such a move could create as many as 1,500 jobs. He said he would pursue the matter even if the Whalers do not stay in Hartford.
No one doubts that the loss of the Whalers would have a substantial impact on the Hartford Civic Center itself, since it would deprive the center of its prime tenant.
"We certainly have a vested interest in the Whalers remaining at the Civic Center," said Fred Laberge, a spokesman for Aetna Inc., which owns the Civic Center mall, including its stores and restaurants, along with the atrium and the building's office space.
Mr. Laberge said that since the Civic Center mall opened in 1972, it has lost $56 million, even though the occupancy rate has remained "fairly good."
Restaurateurs and store owners in the mall say that much of their business is based on Whaler home games, even though the team has enjoyed only three winning seasons since moving to Hartford from Boston during the 1974-75 season. "As for their potential departure, it would not help," Mr. Laberge said.
Indeed, it would leave a huge void, the Whalers' perennially poor performance notwithstanding. In recent years the Civic Center has also lost virtually all the concert business that was a major staple.
Mr. Karamanos, the chief executive officer of a computer software company, the Compuware Corporation, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., maintains that "it will be impossible for us to stay unless we get a new building," and that "the team can't afford to pay for it."
"We're losing money, don't get any of the concession or parking revenues and are one of the smallest markets in the National Hockey League," he said. "Other cities and states have built arenas that create economic conditions which generate revenues that can help pay for them."
Governor Rowland has indicated that he agrees, and that surcharges on game tickets, along with other tax revenues from a new arena could help pay off state bonds that would be needed to build the arena.
Thomas D. Ritter, a Hartford Democrat who, as the House Speaker, is one of the state's most influential political figures, has offered similar sentiments.
"The assumption is that the arena would pay for itself," said Mr. Ritter, who favors building a second sports center alongside the one for use by an upgraded University of Connecticut football team. "I'm apprehensive about building just one facility," he said. "But any arrangement has to be structured in such a way so that it doesn't place a burden on the taxpayers."
Two prominent Democratic lawmakers seem a bit less sanguine. "Mr. Karamanos is in a wonderful position," said Moira K. Lyons of Stamford, the House Majority Leader. "He can either get a new arena and stay in Connecticut or he can move to a new arena elsewhere. But we have to be careful about our priorities. The major question here is whether sufficient money would be generated by the Whalers staying in Hartford to pay for the new arena."
Even though few people in Fairfield County seem to care much about the fate of the Whalers, Ms. Lyons said keeping the team in Hartford could affect taxpayers throughout Connecticut.
"Revenues generated from the Whalers can help revitalize a city like Hartford," said Ms. Lyons, who described herself as an avid hockey fan but who has seen very few Whaler games. "And when urban centers are revitalized it helps the whole state because not as much outside taxpayer support is necessary."
Another Stamford Democrat, George C. Jepsen, the State Senate Majority Leader, agreed with Ms. Lyons that the Whalers' issue goes beyond regionalism.
"I would love to see the Whalers stay, but a new arena has be justified on a statewide basis," Mr. Jepsen said. "And advocates for building a new facility face an uphill battle. My own impression, based on a number of studies, is that more often than not the cost outweighs the benefits."

HEADLINE: Women Really Mean Business

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
DEBRA LEWIS remembers her father's advice from many years ago: learn to type so you can earn pin money when your children are grown. Today, she's making better than pin money, and doing so by publishing a new business directory that proves women have branched way out from the typing pool. Her father, she says, would have been proud.
It's another example of the sort of mutual support that has women's groups excited. 
 "The old boy network has been very difficult to crack," said Ms. Lewis, a former sales manager, "but we're now inventing what I call the young girl network."
Ms. Lewis is identifying hundreds of businesses around the state owned and managed by women for inclusion in the annual directory, the Connecticut edition of the Women's Yellow Pages, which was published for the first time last fall.
That doesn't surprise Connie Galley and Carol Wallace, both presidents of sizeable Connecticut companies, who have held leadership roles in the state's two largest, mainstream business associations for the past couple of years. Tokenism? No, they say, but rather a sign that women are succeeding in business in big numbers.
"This is really a terrific time for women," said Ms. Galley, chairwoman of the board of the business organization called SACIA, and president of T.S.I. International Software Ltd., a $25 million company based in Wilton. "The doors are wide open. A new generation is coming up that has grown up with the expectation that they can do anything. And that generation is here now."
For the past decade, the number of women-owned businesses nationally and statewide has shot up, say experts, and 1996 was no exception. According to estimates from the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, the number of companies owned by women rose 78 percent between 1987 and 1996 to almost 8 million nationwide. As of last year, these companies employed more than 18.5 million workers and generated nearly $2.3 trillion in sales.
In Connecticut, the rise in that same period was 56 percent, to 104,00 businesses, for a ranking of 25th out of 50 states. These companies employed more than 250,000 workers and generated more than $38 billion in sales, according to the foundation.
It's been 20 years since many national organizations were created to promote and support women. Today, the state's Permanent Commission on the Status of Women publishes a directory listing 500 organizations around Connecticut that serve the health, social, business and political needs of women. "The good news," says Barbara Potopowitz, the commission's spokeswoman, "is that there are so many and they are fast-growing."
As the number of women executives and entrepreneurs has grown, so have the number of associations for such women, focusing primarily on networking, mentoring and economic development assistance -- and attempting not to overlap each other. But their number doesn't appear to disturb traditional business leaders.
"America is a very diverse place and we do business in a diverse set of ways," observed Christopher Bruhl, president and chief executive officer of SACIA, the second-largest business association in the state. "We have an association for everything; why shouldn't there be a lot of associations relating to women in business? It's a natural outgrowth of women's place and presence in the work force as leaders."
But Sue Glasspiegel said she noticed two years ago that the existing associations did not focus on the latest phenomenon -- the more established women-owned businesses in the state. Ms. Glasspiegel was among the early members and now serves as president of the 18-month old Connecticut chapter of the National Association for Women Business Owners, based in Simsbury. The chapter has 100 members whose companies are at least five years old and have 1 to 1,500 employees.
The national association estimates Fairfield County has the most women-owned businesses of any county in the United States, but there are no hard figures, says Ms. Glasspiegel.
"There are a lot of organizations that cater to women, but each has a special focus," said Ms. Glasspiegel of the overlap issue. Her group, one of 64 chapters of the national organization, lobbies the state and Federal governments for legal changes, helps secure government contracts, and brainstorms on issues that apply to its members.
In January the chapter sponsored (along with the Small Business Administration and Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican of Stamford) a forum in Norwalk designed to bring government contractors and women business owners together. More than 20 contractors and 70 women business owners participated. Although the goal for government contracts to women-owned businesses is set at 5 percent, currently the figure nationwide is 2.4 percent, said Mr. Shays.
"We're not so much a networking group as a support group," Ms. Glasspiegel said. "We face a different set of issues than men, all tempered by the issue of balancing work and family." Women need their associations, in addition to mainstream chambers of commerce and business groups, she said, adding "It's not a disservice to have these all available to you. I pick and choose how I want to spend my time."
Fran Pastore, director of training and counseling for the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation's Stamford office, said women feel more empowered and safer in their own groups. "There's a synergy and freedom of expression." she said. "It's amazing to see the bond that forms in the first 20 minutes. A lot of them end up doing business together."
Ms. Glasspiegel said "I would do business with a woman over a man, if all things are equal. I think most women feel that way. There's a sense of loyalty and support among women." Since its formation three years ago, AWED has helped 500 women start and grow businesses, linked some with mentors and held workshops, she said. The IBM Corporation recently donated computers and $15,000 to help AWED's establish a resource center with free access to the Internet for clients and members.
The first issue of the Women's Yellow Pages features 250 advertisers across the state, ranging from herbalists, counselors and lawyers to furniture movers and the owner of a septic tank removal service. The second edition is in the works.
"One of the things that came out from our initial marketing study," said Ms. Lewis, agreeing with Ms. Glasspiegel, "is that, given the option, women would rather work with other women." Although there is no typical female business owner, Ms. Lewis said many are better educated than in the past and have had corporate experience.
"When we start our own businesses, we know all the stuff that came out of those corporate environments that we didn't like and we've determined that we're going to be different," Ms. Lewis said. "I also think that we're much, much better prepared. The failure rate of women-owned businesses is absolutely miniscule."
While Ms. Lewis allows men to advertise in her directory if they provide services or products for women, Rolande Hodel's newly published Purple Pages directory lists businesses in the Connecticut, New York and New Jersey area owned only by women. Ms. Hodel, a research chemist from Ossining, N. Y., lists 600 businesses, one-third of which are in Connecticut, mostly in Fairfield County. The Purple Pages are published bimonthly, but Ms. Hodel said her goal is to publish one annual directory.
The growth of women-owned businesses around Connecticut has been a trend since at least the early 1980's, said Lee Lemaire, president of the Connecticut Small Business Federation. Of the 50 inquiries a day to his association, he said most are from women. Many are starting unusual businesses, including manufacturing companies in such areas as metal stamping and machine tool production. A growing number of companies are started by women working flexible hours so they can care for their families, he explained.
"Most of the new businesses started today are by women," said Mr. Lemaire. "The principle breadwinner is going to shift at some point. I'm not going to say in the year 2000, but pretty well early into the next century, I see that happening. I see them as the generators of income and wealth. It's very very slow at this stage, but it's going to skyrocket.
"Women are smarter -- that's a point blank statement I can make," added Mr. Lemaire. "In business, women are smarter. They are better at people relationships. They are not as impatient. The two major ingredients are already there. Pretty soon, the new style -- accommodation, negotiation, concession, conciliation, all of those nice words -- they're becoming more and more a part of our business life. It's a better workplace in my point of view."
Mr. Lemaire will move to chairman this fall after 22 years as president and be replaced by Anne Evans, who is an owner and president of Elm Energy and the Performance Services Corporation, two energy companies in Hebron.
Although associations only for women help retain and increase women-owned businesses, said Mr. Bruhl of SACIA, "it's important that women don't only work in those groups because then you accidently reverse-catagorize yourselves."
For almost two years, Connie Galley has served as chairwoman of SACIA's board, the first woman and first president of a small business in that post. Ms. Galley earned a degree with majors in mathematics and chemistry from Duke University and came from a family of entrepreneurs. "I never felt uncomfortable in the regular business world," she said. "Maybe it has to do with how you are raised."
Carol Wallace, president and chief executive officer of the Cooper Instrument Corporation in Middlefield with 110 employees, is vice chairwoman of the board of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest, and will take over the leadership post in November. Cooper, a time and temperature instrument manufacturer, was founded in 1885 and bought by her father in 1960. Ms. Wallace, a biology major, has been president since 1993.
"It's a real tribute to C.B.I.A. and its members that they recognize there are more women business owners and executives who do need to be represented," Ms. Wallace said. "I do think I probably was put ahead of some of the men who have paid their dues, but I think it was for good cause."
Overall, she said, "I've always had to be a step ahead as a woman."
Growth areas for female entrepreneurs are seen especially in technology and financial services, said Mr. Lemaire. He advises women to go back to school and take more business, personnel, labor relations and general management courses.
"Women are waking up to the whole slew of opportunities that were not available before," said Ms. Glasspiegel. "All of a sudden, they're unifying and fighting for a piece of the pie."

HEADLINE: Seeking to Promote Arab-Jewish Harmony

BYLINE: By HERBERT HADAD 

 BODY:
LAST year Dr. Lee Katz of Rye, a former vice president of Purchase College, took on the educational mission of a lifetime -- to teach Arabs and Jews to coexist peacefully in Israel.
She became executive director of the Abraham Fund, named for the biblical patriarch of both Arabs and Jews. 
 Returning recently from observing some of the projects the fund supports in Israel, Dr. Katz said she was heartened. "I have to tell you about a profoundly moving experience," she said, referring to a visit with a group of battered women. "I saw Jewish and Arab women sharing their common problems together. All ethnic differences had disappeared. One individual was talking to another. These people were being helped by Arab and Jewish staff, and they were being reached in a way never reached before."
Accompanied by Alan B. Slifka, a New York financier who provided seed money to help establish the fund eight years ago, Dr. Katz also met with a woman who came up with the idea of creating a magazine called Windows, printed in both Arabic and Hebrew and distributed in schools.
"This woman, a single parent, assembled in her home 10 Arab and Jewish children," Dr. Katz said. "These children were intelligent, alert, animated, involved with each other. And these children were the editorial board. It was a remarkable thing to see."
Dr. Katz, who was vice president for external affairs and development at Purchase College for 10 years, joined the fund last March and directs its activities from a Madison Avenue office with a staff of eight. On the doors leading to the office is the name of the fund in English, Hebrew and Arabic, and on the office walls and coffee tables are artworks and books reflecting Israeli and Arabic cultures.
The nonprofit educational and fund-raising organization considers itself apolitical and motivated by humane values. Its motto is, "In Israel, coexistence is the only alternative."
Dr. Katz said there had been no change in the reception given the fund's projects in Israel after the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu replaced that of the late Yitzhak Rabin and that no official approval was needed to carry out projects. "Both Governments have greatly supported our efforts," she said.
Starting in 1989 Mr. Slifka, who was also founder of the Big Apple Circus, became involved in trying to make Israel a more harmonious state and helped found the Abraham Fund, to which he donated about $500,000.
He is president of the board of directors of the fund.
Mr. Slifka will talk about "Coexistence as a Rising Issue on Israel's National Agenda" on Thursday at 8 P.M. to members of the American Jewish Congress at the Scarsdale Synagogue. The talk is open to the public free of charge. The number to call for more information is (800) 301-3863.
The Abraham Fund is better known in Israel than in the United States but is building a membership in this country. It provides grants for projects related to community cooperation, the arts, curriculum development, economic development, interfaith dialogue, medical care and advocacy, teacher training and women's issues.
Last year it spent more than $1 million to support 68 such projects and has awarded $4 million to 230 projects since it began giving grants four years ago. The fund also operates outreach and educational programs in North America and has established forums in Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans and Washington to spread the word of Arab-Jewish coexistence in Israel.
In addition, an-adopt-a-program matches coexistence projects with individual donors, families, community groups or foundations that underwrite them. The projects range in cost from $5,000 to $100,000.
The United States is the primary source of funds, Dr. Katz said, with some amounts beginning to come from Canada and Israel. She said support in the United States included donations from a small number of Arab-Americans.
One donation that particularly touched officials of the Abraham Fund came from a child in the Middle West. "His parents were deeply involved in philanthropy and Israeli activities," Dr. Katz said. "The boy was bar mitzvahed and gave us a gift of several thousand dollars."
She said donors now numbered in the thousands with 500 new contributors added last year. "It's a young organization and the word is spreading," she said.
One man in England responded dramatically. He had been listening to an audio tape of an Arab-Jewish musical group called Bustahn Avraham, Avraham being Hebrew for Abraham and Bustahn the word for garden in both Hebrew and Arabic. He then called the fund in New York.
"He saw that the Abraham Fund sponsored the group," Dr. Katz said. "And he said he would like to support us. He sent $15,000."
She said every project was evaluated each year and suggested that not every one had been a success, although she declined to give details. "If you don't have failures you have not really tried," she said. "We're not afraid to take a risk."
Another project Dr. Katz and Mr. Slifka visited earlier this year was an integrated kindergarten in the Y.M.C.A. in Jerusalem, which features cultural and language exchanges between Arab and Jewish children, the tasting of each group's foods and field trips to one another's homes.
"Change comes about one on one," Dr. Katz said. "My great joy in doing this work is that I am privileged to see the kind of change that is possible."

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Jim Brown;
Producing a Showcase for Harry Belafonte

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
CONCERTGOERS at Purchase College on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 had the chance to see and hear Harry Belafonte. What they experienced, however, was more than just a concert -- it was the making of a television special and record album.
It was the brainchild of Jim Brown, a resident of Putnam Valley, and his wife, Ginger, who were coproducers and directors of "An Evening With Harry Belafonte and Friends," which was broadcast last night on PBS and will be repeated throughout the month. The Browns have a production company, the Ginger Group. 
 Mr. Brown grew up in Croton-on-Hudson. He has been producer and/ or director on a number of television specials for PBS, the Disney Channel and others, including "We Shall Overcome," which won an Emmy Award in 1989; "Child of Mine," which won a Cable Ace Award in 1994 and "In the Spotlight: Mary Chapin Carpenter at Wolf Trap" in 1995. He also teaches film and television at New York University and is working on a documentary biography of Harry Belafonte.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Brown:
Q. How does a show like the Harry Belafonte concert originate?
A. It's Harry Belafonte's first television concert in over a decade. Basically, it started because I was doing a documentary on Harry's life. We were in Jamaica with him last year and on returning we decided to go to one of his concerts, and that's when I thought it would be particularly good for the PBS audience. When we got into it, it became not just a concert but a record as well.
Q. Did he already have the concert at Purchase College booked, or was that a specially created event?
A. No. I mean he had been touring sometimes as many as 100 days, but to prepare this concert was about six or seven months in the making from the time that we started to talk about it. He brought in really world-class musicians from Senegal, from Cameroon, from Brazil to augment his already wonderful band. We rehearsed materials this summer. He made the rounds with it in Canada and tested it at his regular concerts. Then for about a month we just did rehearsals before this concert.
Harry has long been involved in world music, but in the last years he has been very active in trying to get new songs together that I would say are Afro-centric in origin. Also, he has taken his older songs and given them a new-suit approach. So for this concert, besides bringing in the new band members he prepared some new material.
Q. What did you, as the co-producer, do?
A. In this case we came up with the idea, sold the show, then also made the deal with the record company and for the video distribution. We oversee the promotion of the show and the exploitation of it.
Q. What about how it actually looks?
A. We brought in, I think, one of the best crews in the world for doing music specials. We were responsible for bringing in Harry's lighting, really transferring a stage show to television. You light a television show in an entirely different way than a concert hall.
Q. Did you light it while it was going on, or did you alter the tape later?
A. It's basically a live show, so we record it with, in this case, eight cameras. There were a lot of huge trucks, a 48-track digital sound studio encased in one truck, a control room monitoring all the cameras. We had to bring in probably 150 people to be involved with doing this, and we did it over two nights.
As producers, we had to facilitate anything that Harry Belafonte and the band wanted and negotiate all the deals.
Q. How is the show put together?
A. It's pretty much like live television. It's all edited live.
Q. Meaning you are making decisions on which camera angle to use as it happens?
A. Yes. Then you can clean it up if you have to.
Q. What is Harry Belafonte like?
A. Oh, a dream. Everything you can imagine and more. He's a consummate entertainer; he's a perfectionist. He's probably, out of all the entertainers that I have worked with, the most conscious about every little detail of the show. He has a great presence. The camera just loves him. He's about to turn 70, but he looks about 55.
Q. His voice is still strong? And his energy level is still there?
A. Yes. He's probably one of the most -- I would put him certainly in the top three -- energetic people I've ever met.
Q. Why has his voice been preserved? Clean living? Good genes?
A. I think a combination of both things. He's an artist who thrives on the things that he does, and because of his early, enormous success he has had an economic base to really just do those things that were meaningful to him.
I think what attracted me to him as an artist and as a person to be the subject of a biography is that he has got several different careers and he has excelled in all of them. He's a recording artist -- one of the first recording artists ever to sell a million albums. He was probably the first black heart-throb of America through movies and Broadway and television and his recordings. He was the first black producer of feature films and television shows. In addition to that, he was a statesman. He was a very political person, one of Martin Luther King's best friends. He was an architect of the civil rights movement. He was a go-between between John Kennedy and the civil rights movement and provided a lot of money and backing for the movement. And he was the guy who came up with the "We are the World" campaign for Africa. He has been a Unicef ambassador for years. He also was responsible for promoting Bishop Tutu's first tour, then Nelson Mandela's first tour to the United States.
Q. Is he basically self-educated?
A. Harry grew up in Jamaica, was born in Harlem but his mother was a domestic and his father was a cook. His father left early on, and Harry's care was entrusted to relatives in Jamaica. He went there at a very early age, and it was kind of a lonely time. He was a little bit of an outsider. It was undiagnosed at that time, but he was dyslexic, so he had problems at school. Last year he returned to Jamaica to celebrate his getting an honorary degree, one of several he has been given. This was especially poignant for him.
Q. Where would you market a biography?
A. I think we're going to try and release it as a feature film. It's a collaborative effort, his life through his eyes.
Q. Has Harry Belafonte crossed the generation lines? Can he attract people of all ages?
A. Yes. We're trying to do something very much like what was done with Tony Bennett. Harry is one of the hippest people I know -- intellectually, politically, stylewise.
Q. Where do you want to take your career from here?
A. I very much enjoy what I'm doing. I feel like I lead a very charmed life. I get to work with my wife, and our daughter, who just turned 12, often comes to the studio. I get to work with some of the people I really admire in the world, either in translating their work to television or concert or documenting some aspects of their lives.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Pomona, N.Y.;
Easy City Access In a Ramapos Setting

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
FROM her 10-room colonial with sweeping decks and a panoramic view of the Ramapo Mountains, Leslie Sanderson enjoys the simple pleasure of greeting the deer that sometimes peer into her window in the morning as the dew sets on her one-acre wooded property.
"Compared to Westchester or Connecticut, this style house was a pretty good value at $419,000," said Ms. Sanderson, who with her husband, Nicholas, built their home in the Rockland County village of Pomona seven years ago. 
 Houses in the village's developments are especially appealing because "the homes are not cookie-cutter houses," said Dorothy McNamara, a broker for Century 21 Len Carr Realty in Pomona, adding that today the Sandersons could realize at least what they invested in their house.
The original old farmhouses, bungalows and Revolutionary War Colonials on Old Route 202, Route 306 and Camp Hill Road were built on large lots that once drew wealthy people seeking a summer retreat to what was then an unincorporated area, even then known as Pomona. In 1967 part of the community straddling the Towns of Haverstraw and Ramapo was incorporated into a village to control zoning. A main issue was a proposal to build a large condominium complex. Those favoring incorporation wanted to retain the rural ambiance.
Many farmers began selling off their land and new subdivisions with one-acre lots for detached houses replaced the orchards that gave the community its name -- Pomona was the Roman goddess of fruit.
"We did a little pioneering back then," said Sam Schechter, a local developer. "We built and kept most of the trees and foliage when it wasn't fashionable."
Show business is well represented among present and former residents such as Joe Harris, who produced and managed "Sweet Charity," "Dancing at Lughnasa" and "Mame." And Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner wrote "My Fair Lady" in Mr. Lerner's 1732 home. In his book, "The Street Where I Live," Mr. Lerner called his Pomona a "unique community." The house was previously owned by, among others, Charlie Chaplin when he was married to Paulette Goddard and Burgess Meredith when he was married to Ms. Goddard.
Buff Blass, 47, a creative director in advertising, said she was "very, very happy" living in a community with easy access to Newark, La Guardia and Stewart Airports over the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the Garden State Parkway and the George Washington and Tappan Zee Bridges.
"The village also has all the conveniences the city has, but at a more civilized pace," said Ms. Blass. Strip malls along Route 202 just outside the village provide diversified shopping, services and food outlets, and the huge Nanuet Mall is just a short drive away.
BUT for many of Pomona's residents, whose median income is 4 percent higher than the county average, the village, with its 60 acres of parkland, is an amalgam of serenity and challenge.
Most people in Pomona get involved, said Deputy Mayor Herbert Marshall, "to produce the best educational product we can in spite of budget and any political infighting that occurs."
"When we built our home we could have gone anywhere," said Ms. Sanderson, who has two children and is co-president of the Grandview Elementary School P.T.A. "I specifically wanted to stay in the East Ramapo Central School District. I know the school district, I went through it. I definitely like it because of its ethnic and cultural diversity. I didn't want my children to go anywhere else. Here my children get a true picture of the real world."
With 9,200 students enrolled in the East Ramapo Central School District, 65 percent of the children represent 40 different nationalities; the district encompasses three towns, including heavily Hispanic Haverstraw, and eight villages, including Spring Valley, which has a concentration of Haitian immigrants. "The only problem that this presents is that there are 500 students enrolled in English as a second-language classes, which are task-intensive and expensive," said Dr. Jack R. Anderson, the district superintendent. "But we try to mainstream students within three years."
He said that he preferred to consider diversity in the community and public schools as something to celebrate. (Another measure of diversity in the district is the fact that 9,500 students within it -- from the Orthodox Jewish communities of Kaser, New Square and Monsey -- are enrolled in private schools.)
"We work toward maximizing and teaching students to live and work in the real world," Dr. Anderson said. "We have students coming back from their first year of college telling us how easy their academic and social life have been."
Of the district's 631 high school graduates last year, 88 percent went on to higher education, said Dr. Anderson. The average Scholastic Assessment Test scores were 511 on the verbal section and 525 on the math part, above the New York State average of 497 and 499, respectively.
"Both of our high schools are in the top 1 percent of all high schools in the United States in regard to the advanced placement courses we offer," Dr. Anderson said, noting that more than 100 college credits were available. But after many years of success, the East Ramapo Central School District, which has eight elementary schools -- four for kindergarten to third grade, four for fourth to sixth grade; three junior high schools and two senior high schools -- has come under fire by some.
"I think the school district does an amazing job in integrating everything," said Scott Shabot, who moved to Pomona in 1983. "But the bottom line is we'd all like it to be better. We serve a wide economic spectrum with all the problems of the urban poor. Sometimes it becomes politics in the school district and educational considerations become secondary. "
Harvey Katz, a school-board member and Munsey businessman, disagreed. "We don't have politics in the school system," he said. "I am here to see to it that there is as cost-effective high quality education in the district as possible."
WHILE East Ramapo is one of five school districts in the state where more students are enrolled in private schools than public schools for religious reasons, the parochial-school parents are nevertheless obliged to pay taxes to support public schools. Yet some public-school parents see the high proportion of parochial-school parents as a threat to the school system, arguing that residents who send their children to private schools are likely to have less of a commitment to public schools.
Not so, said Mr. Katz, one of four Orthodox Jews on the nine-member school board. "Just because my children are not in the public schools doesn't mean I don't care about all the children," he said. "Children are our future, wherever they may be."
For all the complexities of the school system, the village parks can offer the solace of quiet, wooded trails, swimming, tennis courts, or fishing. Burgess Meredith Park, dedicated in 1971 and named for the actor who helped incorporate the village, offers residents 21 acres of walking paths, a playground and baseball field. The 16-acre Jon Van Den Hende Park has two tennis courts; the 17-acre passive Tamarack Lane Park has trails. The newest addition, the 3.6-acre Secor Park, will offer a stocked fishing pond when it opens in late spring.
Early last month, the Pomona Cultural Center, a fieldstone building that was a one-room schoolhouse in the early part of the century, exhibited challenge quilts. Participants in the contest that created them were given a certain amount of fabric and asked to use only that in their projects. While the quilts were being viewed by visitors, a workshop on Japanese brush painting was in session in the center's basement.
Not far from the Cultural Center is Camp Hill Road, where George Washington's soldiers encamped during the Revolution. A short distance to the west of the road is the Ladentown United Methodist Church, built in 1865, one of the oldest still active churches in the county. The only other house of worship in the village is the Pomona Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue. A Hindu temple is on the drawing boards.
Carole Novick, proprietor of Carole Novick Realty, said the housing market, with homes in the village starting at $180,000 and going to $1 million and more, was getting stronger. "Right now," she said, "there are excellent values because there are a lot of failed bank properties up here."
Bruce Sokol, a real estate appraiser, said that in the wake of the bankruptcy of the developer of a 200-lot mountain subdivision in 1989, lots that had been selling for $225,000 in 1987 are now selling for as little as $50,000 from banks that acquired the properties.
When homes can be built more cheaply in the same subdivision, he explained, values of existing properties are driven down. A further factor in prices in recent years, he said, has been the multiracial character of the school district, and the conflicts over school policies and spending.
As for prices in different parts of the village, Mr. Sokol said, homes in the Haverstraw section of Pomona are generally less expensive because they are taxed at lower rates. Taxes on a four-bedroom house on the market in the Ramapo section for $268,000 are $8,900. In the Haverstraw tax district, a four-bedroom home for $269,000 is taxed at $6,200.
Mary Whelan, who moved to the village from Woodside, Queens, in 1993 said she discovered the area when she came to Rockland County to pick apples. "It reminded me of where we lived in Ireland because of the trees and it was rural," she said. "I don't believe I got something like this. Nowhere compares to Pomona."

When the school district amended the referendum, an amended petition was filed. This time, the Commissioner ruled that the petition was insufficient to block a vote on the bond issue, now scheduled for March 18.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Buying In a New Building

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
FEW savvy consumers would buy a new car without at least taking a test drive in a floor model. Fewer still would make such an investment based solely on a car dealer's glossy brochure.
Yet, when it comes to what is often the most significant investment of a lifetime -- the purchase of a home -- some people get downright giddy at the prospect of buying a house or apartment that hasn't even been built yet, a decision that is often based largely on a developer's glossy brochure. 
 "In certain circumstances, buying a house or apartment under construction can be a wonderful thing," said Nathaniel Plotkin, chief executive officer of S. Goodstein Realty in Manhattan. "On the other hand, there's always risk involved as well."
For nearly a decade potential buyers in New York City did not have to worry too much about those kinds of decisions, because residential construction was rare. Now, however, it appears that residential construction in Manhattan is on the threshold of a resurgence.
"We're seeing a resurgence of a trend," said Vicki Chesler, executive editor of The Cooperator, a Manhattan-based publication targeted at co-op and condominium owners. "In the 80's, people would go into a developer's office, look at plans and buy apartments that didn't even exist yet. And now, we're starting to see that happen again."
Ms. Chesler said that a combination of factors was responsible for the apparent resurgence of interest. With the economy fairly stable, Wall Street booming and rents hitting all-time highs, she said, the inventory of available apartments has essentially dried up. "The biggest problem for real estate brokers today is not having enough apartments to sell," Ms. Chesler said. "So any new construction coming on line is in great demand."
Less than a year ago, for example, the Jack Parker Corporation, a Manhattan development company, opened an on-site sales office at the Knickerbocker, the company's 75-unit luxury condominium then under construction at Second Avenue and 72d Street.
"We sold out in six months," said Robert S. Skolnick, director of marketing and new development for the company. "We obviously hit the market at an unbelievable time."
While economics may play some role in a buyer's decision to invest in an apartment that hasn't yet been built, Mr. Skolnick said, there are more personal reasons at work. "It really offers a tremendous opportunity for buyers to pick and choose where they want to live in a building," he said, explaining that the first buyers in new buildings have the luxury of getting the pick of available apartments.
A more subtle advantage to buying in a new building, Mr. Skolnick said, is the absence of established interest groups and the presence of fellow pioneers. "When you buy in a new building, everybody's moving in at about the same time," Mr. Skolnick said. "So there are no established cliques or hierarchies and the atmosphere is usually more friendly."
Edward T. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that to the extent that economics drive preconstruction buyers to invest in little more than blueprints and offering plans, the buyers themselves also help drive the economics.
"Developers structure their pricing policy to create the impression of a fast-rising market with a heavy demand," Mr. Braverman said. "That means that early buyers can often do very well in the pricing."
At the same time, he said, there is always the possibility that a developer will promise more than he or she can deliver.
"You might be dealing with a developer who is selling you by using models or plans and then you find out that the finished product doesn't equal the puff," Mr. Braverman said. Accordingly, he said, buyers and their lawyers should insure that contracts for apartments under construction be as specific and detailed as possible. "Make sure you get a copy of the layout and that the offering plan includes all of the amenities that are supposed to go along with the apartment," Mr. Braverman said, adding that it is essential to insure that any deposit paid by the buyer is placed in a lawyer's trust account and not turned over to the developer.
It is also wise, he said, for buyers or their lawyers to negotiate a clause in the contract that gives the buyer the right to assign the contract to a third party if the closing doesn't take place by a specific date.
In fact, one of the most common, frustrating and potentially costly problems associated with buying new construction is the often significant amount of time it takes to go from buyer to owner.
"The sale documents are usually drafted in such a way that you don't really know when you're going to be moving in," said Errol Brett, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law. Even reputable and experienced developers occasionally end up behind schedule, Mr. Brett said. And when a closing is delayed, he said, the result can range from minor inconvenience to major hardship for the buyer.
"What happens if the buyer is renting an apartment, gives notice to his landlord that he's moving out, and then finds out that the closing has been put off for two months?" Mr. Brett said. "And more importantly, what about the buyer who sold his previous home to buy the new one and has to roll over the profit within two years to avoid paying capital gains tax. What happens if two years go by and he still hasn't closed on the new apartment?"
Generally, Mr. Brett said, while a lawyer can protect a buyer by insisting on a clause in the contract that allows the buyer to assign the contract or walk away from the deal if the closing doesn't take place within a specified time period, even that wouldn't help someone whose capital gains tax clock is ticking away.
"You can tell I'm not a fan of preconstruction deals," Mr. Brett said.
Mr. Plotkin of S. Goodstein Realty said that one way buyers can avoid being surprised is to avoid being bashful when dealing with their lawyers and developers. "Make sure your attorney knows how to read a set of plans," Mr. Plotkin said. "And it never hurts to have a clause in the contract that says if the developer is having trouble and reduces prices, your price will be reduced as well."
It is also worth the effort for potential buyers to get into the building and get a feel for the location and layout of their apartments.
"If you're thinking of buying apartment 10A and 8A is almost done, then tell the sales agent you want to see 8A," Mr. Plotkin said. "And even if there's nothing but open space on the 10th floor, ask the agent to take you up there in the construction elevator so you can at least get an idea of the view."

HEADLINE: 1926 Broadway: Behind the Facade;
The Anatomy of a 'People Building'

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
EVEN in their name -- "Class B" -- old office buildings like 1926 Broadway take a back seat to the centrally air-conditioned and centrally located Class A towers that define corporate New York.
Yet Class B buildings, typically of prewar vintage (the First World War in some cases), are the workhorses of commercial real estate. They are home to light industry, small service businesses, emerging creative enterprises and nonprofit organizations who cannot pay the $40-a-square-foot annual rent that a top building might command but can certainly afford $20. 
 "These tenants truly fuel our city," said Stephen L. Green, chairman of S. L. Green Real Estate, which owns or operates almost two dozen Class B buildings. Such tenants also fuel an enormous sub-market. For example, there are 595 Class B buildings in mid-Manhattan, Mr. Green said, but only 85 Class A buildings.
By their nature, Class B buildings tend to operate in the background. But the spotlight fell recently on 1926 Broadway, a six-story, 90-year-old loft building at 64th Street, with 154,000 square feet of space and 25 tenants.
Millennium Partners reached an agreement last month with the three owners of 1926 Broadway -- Richard M. Cohen, Arnold Sollar and Stephen Blank -- to acquire a longterm lease on the property and redevelop the site in a joint venture. They contemplate clearing out the building "at or about the turn of the century" -- a deliberately vague horizon. Millennium envisions another in the cluster of high-rise, multi-use structures it has been building around Lincoln Square in recent years. This one may include a new Lincoln Center theater at its base.
Even if these plans do not materialize, it is plain that the days of 1926 Broadway are numbered. It is dwarfed by its neighbors to the north and south and has become one of the likeliest development sites in the area.
This moment of transition affords the chance to look at the history and anatomy of a Class B building. Typical in its age, condition and tenancy, 1926 Broadway is also distinguished by a cast of characters ranging from the patrician Goelet family to the rock-'n'-rolling Cousin Brucie, with a cameo appearance by Dustin Hoffman.
"I see this as more of a people building, as opposed to an office building," said M. Annette Ensley, director of human relations for the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which has occupied much of the sixth floor since 1993.
People dine out on the ground floor, work out on the second floor, rebuild antique violins or peruse contemporary art on the third floor, sell furniture on the fourth floor, archive countless hours of film and video on the fifth floor and devise marketing campaigns or give out $14 million a year in grants on the sixth floor.
Not bad for a building that came into existence as a garage.
In 1905, when he was 25, Robert Goelet arrived at Broadway and 64th Street with $500,000 in his pocket. He purchased nine lots forming an odd-shaped parcel through the block, with 174 feet on Broadway and a notch cut out at 65th Street.
The transaction was noteworthy, The New York Times reported, as the first major real-estate purchase by any member of the Goelet family in recent years. The Goelets, who arrived in the New World in 1676, would have been as celebrated as the Astors for their extensive Manhattan land holdings -- they were said at one time to own 55 acres of the East Side -- had they not been so averse to publicity.
What Goelet built, from 1906 to 1907, was the Goelet Garage. This was a logical development choice, since the parcel sat on Automobile Row, which ran from the West 40's to the West 70's, and was lined with showrooms, garages and the offices of major motor-car and tire companies.
GOELET employed two architectural firms for his Broadway garage. Maynicke & Franke had just completed another project for the family, the enlargement of the Goelet Building, which is still standing at Broadway and 20th Street.
The other architect was Frank M. Andrews, who also designed the 1,500-room Hotel McAlpin, at Broadway and 34th Street, which was the largest hotel in New York City on its completion in 1913.
No mean utilitarian structure, the Goelet Garage is a forceful yet delicate composition. Its broad window bays have 7 1/2-foot-wide center panes flanked by smaller side lights, reminiscent of the Chicago school of architecture. These bays are framed by terra-cotta borders, pediments, brackets and medallions. The freight elevators, which had to transport horseless carriages, are larger than some studio apartments: 10 feet wide, 20 feet long, 10 feet high.
To contemporary eyes, 1926 Broadway looks extravagant for a garage, but it was on a par with the esthetic tenor of Automobile Row. Other elegant survivors of the era are the Peerless Motor Car and A. T. Demarest Motor Company Buildings at 57th Street and the United States Rubber Company Building at 58th Street.
The Goelet Garage was renamed the Macfadden Building in the 20's, after Bernarr Macfadden, the eccentric publisher of Liberty, True Story, Physical Culture and The New York Graphic, a forerunner of supermarket tabloids, according to "Upper West Side Story," by Peter Salwen.
The building was purchased in the 1940's by Louis D. Cohen, Ira Sollar and Robert Blank, whose sons continue to own it; not as partners but each with a roughly equal interest, the largest of which is controlled by the Cohen family.
By the late 1950's, the neighborhood was known popularly as the slum setting for the gang battles of "West Side Story." But in the early 60's, the buildings of Lincoln Center started to rise, kicking off a transformation that is still playing itself out.
Following the Lincoln Center lead was Louis Cohen's son, Richard, who built the five-story Empire Mutual Building in 1963 at Broadway and 66th Street. Mr. Cohen founded what is now Goodrich Associates of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and Los Angeles. He has developed 200 shopping centers and office buildings around the country, said David R. Rogol, president of the Goodrich Development Corporation and Goodrich Management Corporation.
It was the O'Neal brothers, Michael and Patrick, who put 1926 Broadway back on the map and in the guidebooks. In June 1964, they opened a 60-seat restaurant called the Ginger Man on the 64th Street side of the building, in what had been a ground-floor storage room for National Cash Register.
Although they were pioneers, Michael O'Neal says today that it did not take genius to anticipate what was about to happen.
"We weren't stupid," he said, "but we weren't that smart. Philharmonic Hall had been finished and the State Theater was a hole in the ground. We knew what was coming." Indeed, Mr. O'Neal could watch the construction at Lincoln Center from his $20-a-week room in the Empire Hotel.
"When we applied for a liquor license, we got turned down," Mr. O'Neal recalled. "The State Liquor Authority said, 'We don't issue licenses for high crime-rate areas.' " The O'Neals prevailed with a petition signed by friends and neighbors, including Leonard Bernstein, testifying to the need for a nice restaurant near Lincoln Center.
Mr. O'Neal remembers a constant stream of cash registers being trucked into and out of the building, where N.C.R. maintained a large service center. He also remembers the Cadillac that was always parked across the street. It bore the license plates "CUZ-7," for Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow), a disk jockey who commanded the airwaves from the 1960's through the early 70's with his "WABC Superhit Survey."
As a fledgling network, ABC improvised a broadcasting campus in the West 60's out of a riding rink, a skating rink and a couple of old garages. It ultimately occupied two-thirds of 1926 Broadway.
"I grew up in that building," Mr. Morrow recalled. "This is where the Cousin Brucie persona developed. That building had a magic to it, a glow to it."
It also had cranky elevators. On one memorable evening, Mr. Morrow was escorting the Dave Clark Five to the studio when they got stuck between the fourth and fifth floors. With no time for repairs, WABC crews lowered provisions (a chocolate malted for Cousin Brucie) through a hatch at the top of the cab. They also lowered in a microphone and the show originated in the elevator.
"Very frankly, we didn't want to get out," Mr. Morrow said. "Dave Clark said, 'It's the first time I've been able to collect my thoughts in months.' " When they emerged two hours later, 1926 Broadway was surrounded by throngs of teen-agers.
ABC correspondents like Lynn Sherr, Richard Threlkeld and James Walker also had offices in No. 1926, said Jane Maxwell, director of research and video resources, who worked there. On the third floor was the special events division, where election-night and space shuttle coverage was coordinated and programs were produced for the 11:30 P.M. slot. "If a plane went down or a foreign leader died, we'd try to slam together a special," said Michael G. Duffy, vice president of operations for ABC News. "We were the precursors of 'Nightline.' "
The Ginger Man, meanwhile, expanded into the adjoining Liberty Warehouse building, which is topped by a small version of Bartholdi's colossus. Eventually, the O'Neals vacated 1926 Broadway altogether. Their space is now the Lincoln Tavern. There are three other restaurants in the building: the Saloon, which replaced the Magic Flute in the early 1980's; Sfuzzi, which opened in 1988, and Opera Espresso.
BY 1990, with the departure of N.C.R. and ABC, the five upper floors were vacant. In the midst of the deep real-estate recession, the owners set out to fill the building again.
They looked for tenants who could help "carry the building on an economic basis until market conditions were such that the redevelopment of the building made sense," said Mr. Rogol, speaking on behalf of Mr. Cohen and in consultation with Mr. Sollar.
There was no mistaking the new tenant on the block in July 1992, when the World Gym took over the 25,000-square-foot second floor. Those 7 1/2-foot-wide windows provided a splendid panorama to gym members as they climbed Stairmasters and pedaled Lifecycles, but the view worked both ways, as diverted passersby could attest.
Because World Gym is open non-stop from 5 A.M. on Mondays through 11 P.M. on Fridays, it effectively turned 1926 Broadway into a 24-hour-a-day building. The constant traffic is cited by other tenants as contributing a sense of safety.
"Every time we move into a completely empty building, it suddenly fills up with upscale tenants," said Karen Wong, vice president of World Gym Fitness Centers.
World Gym now has about 2,000 members, Ms. Wong said, and anywhere from 450 to 700 people use it every day. She emphasized that World Gym is continuing to renovate its space, purchase new equipment and sell new memberships.
As they tune up their bodies, few gym-goers are aware of the painstaking work going on overhead, in the third-floor workshop of Machold Rare Violins. The other day, for example, Julie Reed-Yeboah, a restorer with 21 years' experience, was cleaning and adjusting an 1826 Vuillaume.
The 5,000-square-foot Machold suite includes a soundproof playing room lined in acoustical baffles and closed off by doors that are three inches thick. In the vault is a wall of violin cubbyholes, lined in blue velvet, with nameplates like "Antonio Stradivari" and "Guarneri del Gesu."
Dietmar H. Machold, heir to a family business based in Bremen, Germany, opened his first United States office in 1926 Broadway two years ago, in large measure because the building was across the street from Lincoln Center. "You have to be in the right spot for these musicians," said his assistant, Leah H. Ramirez. "They keep odd hours. If a sound post falls down, they can literally come across the street."
Mr. Machold may have been the only tenant not to recognize Dustin Hoffman when he moved his film company, Punch Productions, to the third floor. "I don't have a TV," Mr. Machold reportedly explained to Mr. Hoffman. "I don't watch movies. No, wait. I saw a movie. In 1970."
Proximity was the key for A.F.D. Contract Furniture, which moved from 8 West 38th Street not to be close to Lincoln Center but to be within walking distance of Steelcase Inc., which had just bought a building at 4 Columbus Circle. "We're the largest Steelcase dealer in the country," said Richard Aarons, president of A.F.D., which occupies the entire fourth floor at 1926 Broadway, where it employs 120 people.
When Rick Gell moved into the fifth floor in 1992, it was something of a homecoming. He had worked in the building 13 years earlier as an intern at ABC. Today he is a principal, with Todd and Rob Pavlin, in a group of companies that specialize in stock film and video images. There are two library companies, Action Sports Adventure and Hot Shots/Cool Cuts, and a research and licensing company, Second Line Search.
The companies have doubled in size, to about 70 employees, since moving from the former McGraw-Hill Building, 330 West 42d Street. They now occupy 15,000 square feet of space, which is filled with a jumble of monitors, editing machines, 20,000 video cassettes and 50 million feet of film.
Some sense of the variety of their offerings can be gleaned from the labels on just one shelf: "Senegal," "Cow footage," "Deep-sea divers" and "Vegetables."
Another fifth-floor tenant is Strings and Things, a 3,000-square-foot violin shop run by Christophe Landon. He is also the proprietor of the 4,000-square-foot Landon Gallery on the third floor, together with his wife, Annette, who is the director. Boldly colorful paintings by Fares Rizk were on view there recently. A grand piano sat at the end of the long, white room, attesting to its other role as a concert venue.
"There's a big artistic life around this place," Mr. Landon said, "but we're basically the only art gallery in the neighborhood."
They are not the only tenant concerned with the arts, however. On the sixth floor is the Nathan Cummings Foundation, named for the founder of Consolidated Foods, now known as the Sara Lee Corporation. The foundation has 20 employees.
It had been on the 31st floor of the "Lipstick Building," at Third Avenue and 53d Street. "The views were magnificent," said Ms. Ensley, the human relations director. "But being so high up, you couldn't see people. It was so far removed. It didn't represent what this foundation is about."
More practically, however, the foundation needed more room. At No. 1926, it found an open, airy, 12,000-square-foot space that it organized as a village whose main street parallels Broadway. Each "house" along the way corresponds to an area of the foundation's interests: the arts, the environment, health and Jewish life. The "village green," under a skylight, has garden furniture and a fountain. The architects were Wormser & Associates.
NEXT door to Cummings is the Kreisberg Group, a public-relations firm that represents cultural clients. It moved to the building four years ago from a brownstone on West 56th Street and occupies 2,700 square feet, remodeled to designs by Christopher Barriscale. There are 12 employees. "Being across from Lincoln Center, we're associated in people's minds immediately with the arts," said Claire Whittaker, senior vice president.
About 95 percent of the tenants gathered for a meeting Thursday morning in the Saloon at the invitation of Michael Weinstein, president of Ark Restaurants Corporation. "The tenants are very concerned and that's about all we really want to say," said Mr. Reed-Yeboah of Machold.
But the owners are unmoved, noting that tenants walked in with their eyes open. "Each and every lease which was signed for space in the building contained a so-called 'demolition clause,' " Mr. Rogol said in a written statement. "These demolition clauses enable the landlord to terminate the lease after giving advance written notice to a tenant. The combined effect of all these clauses will give the landlord the right to clear out the building and redevelop the property at or about the turn of the century."
The statement said the owners "appreciate that a tenant required to relocate may encounter some disruption and attendant costs" but added that "these 'demolition clauses' are a matter of contract."
Exactly how much advance notice tenants will receive is unclear because each lease was negotiated separately.
"It's very much a David and Goliath situation," said Laurence Price, who runs an art gallery bearing his name and a television production company, Paley/Price Productions, in 1,200 square feet on the third floor. "Suddenly we face the prospect of being swallowed up by a developer who wants to put up a huge building and destroy what almost amounts to an artists' colony on the Upper West Side."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Hotel Business;
In an Up Market, Rooms by the Month

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER JEFFRIES of Millennium Partners had no intention of going into the hotel business. His company was too busy developing residential and retail properties in the Lincoln Square area and other projects around the country.
But he and his partners, Philip Aarons and Philip Lovett, started noticing that people were trying to lease apartments for several months, but less than a year. Since they did not lease apartments for less than a year, the business was simply turned away. 
 At the same time they found that some potential customers were looking for furnished apartments and asking for assistance in renting furniture for extended, but temporary, stays in the city.
Millennium's response to this apparent market demand was the Phillips Club, a cross between an apartments and a hotel that opened at 1965 Broadway at 67th Street in December, just north of Lincoln Center. The facility, which occupies four floors of a 32- floor building, has 96 furnished studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments that rent for a minimum of a month at monthly prices ranging from $4,950 to $11,000.
"We realized that New York is the center of the investment banking industry and that there are a lot of high-income earners coming in and out of the city" who would be attracted by an extended-stay facility, Mr. Jeffries said.
Declining to give figures, he said occupancy has met projections and is doing so well that Millennium is including a Phillips Club in a project now under construction in San Francisco and is looking for sites on the East Side and in Lower Manhattan.
The key to managing the property is to realize that it is more than an apartment house but less than a full-service hotel, Mr. Jeffries said.
Because the stays are lengthy, there is no need for a large clerical staff to check people in and out and to prepare bills. There is no dining room, but local restaurants will deliver meals to guests who do not feel like cooking in the fully equipped kitchens that are part of each apartment.
"We talked to the major hotel operators, but they wanted to run it too much like a hotel, and that is too costly," Mr. Jeffries said. "The chains did not get the concept."
Stephen Rushmore, the president of HVS International, a hotel consulting company, said that Millennium "should do well in terms of occupancy."
"A typical hotel does well Monday to Thursday, but dies on the weekend," he said. "With extended stay, they have the weekend covered."
Certainly, Millennium could not have timed the opening of its new hotel much better, although extended stay hotels, such as the Bristol Plaza and the Sutton, have been on the scene for years. Occupancy rates at hotels in New York City are at near record levels and room rates are surging. But at the same time, with the exception of a few conversions and renovations, none of the new hotels for which plans have been announced is yet under construction.
The most recent plan was announced last week, when Sofitel, N.A. said it would build a 27-story, 400-room hotel on a site stretching from 44th to 45th Streets, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
According to figures compiled by Coopers & Lybrand, hotel occupancy in Manhattan rose 2.8 percent in 1996 to an average of 83.6 percent. The average room rate increased 10.5 percent to $160.57 for the year, from $145.35 in 1995.
Although the entire year was good for New York's hoteliers, the end of the year was particularly bountiful.
In October, for example, the lower-priced convention and tourist-class hotels had occupancies of 96.4 and 97.5 percent respectively. Even in the high-priced deluxe and luxury categories, where room rates are over $200 a night, October occupancy was over 90 percent.
In January 1996, the deluxe and luxury hotels had occupancies of 58.5 and 58.0 percent, while the convention and tourist class properties were 73 percent and 59.5 percent. Although January is typically a low activity month, growth is evident in occupancy rates of 61.9 percent and 63.7 percent for deluxe and luxury segments in January 1997.
"The city is nearing capacity; you can't have 100 percent occupancy," said Arthur Adler, a partner in the hospitality consulting practice of Coopers & Lybrand. "The current occupancy rates are as high as I have ever seen."
In addition to boosting room rates, Mr. Adler said, upper-crust hotels are starting to concentrate on the transient commercial and leisure business and turning away wholesale deals, such as group tours.
The reason is simple, he said. Individuals who are going to stay in New York for a few days on business or for tourism typically pay the full rate. Wholesale operators typically negotiate a lower rate.
In practice, he said, the tour operators will attempt to switch to periods of the year that historically have had lower occupancy rates or shift down to a lower class of hotel, which benefits from the added business.
 ANALYSTS say a robust local economy and a surge of tourism -- an estimated 30.3 million people visited New York in 1996 -- are the reasons for the demand for hotel rooms. And with the closing of the 428-room Dorset Hotel in July to expand the adjacent Museum of Modern Art, the supply of rooms actually declined during the year.
Michael A. Fishbin, a partner in the E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group, pointed out, however, that plans to convert the Mayfair and St. Moritz Hotels into condominiums were an indication that the residential market in Manhattan is even hotter than hotels.
"The highest and best use of these properties is conversion to housing, which tells you something about the market," Mr. Fishbin said.
Most of what has been happening in the hotel business recently is conversion and renovation. The 167-room Trump International Hotel, part of the renovated former Gulf and Western Building, officially opened for business in January.
One of the most prominent of the renovators is Bernard Goldberg, whose Gotham Hospitality Group has refitted four hotels on the Upper East Side and in midtown and is working on projects near Grand Central Terminal and at 31st Street and Madison Avenue.
Mr. Goldberg, a real estate lawyer by trade, said he had not planned to get into the hotel refurbishment business.
"I live on the Upper East Side and I used to walk by the Hotel Wales all the time," he said. The hotel, on Madison Avenue, was rundown, filled with loiterers and only able to charge $50 to $60 a night. But it was located within blocks of some of the city's major cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Guggenheim Museum.
"I started thinking, 'What is the best use for this property,' " he said. "A condo conversion was one way to go. But it seemed to me there was an increasing need of a medium priced, luxury hotel."
Eventually his group did buy the building, restored it and operates it with and emphasis on art and music.
"You can listen to the harp on Friday and chamber music on Sunday," he said. Since then Gotham has restored the Franklin Hotel on the Upper East Side and the Shoreham and Mansfield Hotels in midtown.
All are operated on an all-inclusive pricing policy that includes breakfast, cappuccino, all-day tea, desserts in the evening and video libraries. Rates at the hotels vary, but most are under $200 a night for a standard room.
Recently, Mr. Goldberg offered the four completed properties for sale or some financial arrangement that will allow him to raise cash to do more projects in New York and other cities.
"We think the concept of the luxury boutique hotel is exportable and we want to take it on the road," Mr. Goldberg said. He said the Gotham group was looking at projects in the Washington and Chicago areas, as well as bidding on the Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street and seeking other projects in New York.
He said that the final answer may be a real estate investment trust or a sale and leaseback that would allow the group to continue managing the hotels.. "But if someone wants to pay us a lot of money to create a flagship with one or two of our hotels, I'll adapt to that scenario," he said.
Hotel analysts say there is nothing on the horizon to trouble New York's hotel industry, short of a major economic shock. "We are going to get some new rooms, but that is good, we need them," Mr. Adler said. "If something happens it will be external; something like a stock market crash or a steep recession."
"New York is the center of the world today and it will only become more so as the end of the century approaches," Mr. Goldberg said. He said some hotels in the city were taking reservations for New Year's Eve 1999 at rates of $1,500 to $2,000 a room, and some are insisting on three-night minimums.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
A Balanced Budget? Yes! But Not This Way. Not Now.

BYLINE: By Brett Pulley; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican from Utah, was sitting at his desk on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon, a stack of 28 years of unbalanced Federal budgets in front of him. Like many people in town here that day, Mr. Hatch, the sponsor of his party's proposal to balance the budget by the year 2002, was eagerly waiting to hear whether New Jersey's freshman Senator, Robert G. Torricelli, would agree to cast the deciding vote in favor of the balanced-budget amendment.
The moment of truth came when Mr. Torricelli walked over, sat down next to Mr. Hatch, placed his arm around the senior Senator's shoulder, and started speaking quietly in his ear. After a few moments, the decision was painted all over Mr. Hatch's stern face. "I told him I do not feel comfortable placing that amendment in the Constitution," Mr. Torricelli later said of the conversation. "I don't like to disappoint anybody. But I saw too many potential problems." 
 As it turns out, Mr. Torricelli's decision to break his campaign promise to support a balanced-budget amendment has disappointed more people than just Mr. Hatch. Although his reason for refusing to support the amendment may be correct, the fact that Mr. Torricelli had supported identical bills during his days in the House, and even made that support a part of his platform last year, could cost him some credibility among constituents.
After he announced his decision this week, the criticism machine started churning. Radio talk-show hosts, from former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York, to the ultra-conservative Bob Grant, lashed out. Richard A. Zimmer, the Republican candidate who was defeated by Mr. Torricelli last November, issued a statement saying the constituents "have a right to be dissapointed." Governor Whitman, who kept her lofty promise to cut taxes by 30 percent, warned the new Senator that "keeping campaign promises is something New Jerseyans have come to expect." And the red meat quote of the week came from Mr. Zimmer's former campaign consultant, Lawrence Weitzner, who said that Mr. Torricelli "lied about his philosophy" and "he's going to be wearing the stamp of fraud for a long time." (And you thought that nasty little campaign ended in November.)
In defending his decision, Mr. Torricelli said he would vote against the measure this Tuesday when it comes to the floor because the Senate refused to adopt changes he recommended that would give Congress the ability to borrow money to pay for long-term capital projects, like bridges and highways, education programs, and public transportation systems. Mr. Torricelli also proposed changing the amendment to allow for deficit spending during times of economic recession or national emergencies.
Noting that he voted for a balanced budget on three occasions as a member of the House, Mr. Torricelli said that Mr. Hatch's bill was "good, but not good enough." Mr. Torricelli was aware of the weight that his one vote carried, and he seemed to enjoy being in that position. "I am aware of the uniqueness of the moment," he said during debate, a few hours before he announced his decision. "The U.S. Constitution is a precious document."
A skillful politician, Mr. Torricelli knows that he has almost a full six years to place between this decision and re-election. His future actions could far outweigh this one flip-flop. But voters are sure to wonder whether Mr. Torricelli switched positions because he has really come to realize that the measure he supported earlier has some real flaws, or because he wanted to earn some points with the White House and his Democratic colleagues?
And then in the view of many voters, campaign promises don't mean much anyway. Is it not important that our elected officials have the ability -- independent of some promise made in the past -- to weigh a decision based on all of the information that is available at that moment?
About an hour after he announced his decision in a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Torricelli was back in his office, relaxed and basking in the slaps on the back he had just received from his fellow Democrats. As telephone calls from the media came in, he never ceased being the politician. At one instant, he told a caller, "I found your editorials so persuasive." A few minutes later, he told another caller the same thing -- verbatim.
But Mr. Torricelli still pledged to some day vote for a balanced-budget amendment. "I have to choose the ones that I think are in the national interest," he said. "I have voted for the Democratic version offered in the House of Representatives, and I'm going to do so again."
Promises, promises.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT;
GT, as in Grand Touring (Or Is It Great Traction?)

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
I WAS out there being a daredevil, dashing along, flinging Subaru's sporty new sedan, the Legacy 2.5 GT, through the curves, wringing out every bit of power and testing the G-forces. Sure I was.
Actually, I was driving like everybody else, which is to say reasonably. And when I got home from my trip to the hardware store, curtain-rod brackets safe in their bag on the bucket seat beside me, I began to wonder about the popularity of the sport-sedan concept. 
 I mean, I had just shared the road with everything from BMW 328i's to Hyundai Sonatas to an old Peugeot 505S, many of them designated sport sedans and all of them going quietly about their business. Almost every car maker now puts the sports tag on at least one of its models, and the designation sells, but I was wondering why.
So I carried my brackets into the house and called Subaru.
"Well," said a company spokesman, Alex Fedorak, "I guess you could call the 2.5 a sport sedan, but it's more of a GT in our opinion -- a grand touring sedan as opposed to an all-out performance car. We think it's a nice all-wheel-drive touring vehicle, a vehicle in balance."
All right. But that didn't give me much perspective on the public passion for sport at the wheel, so I thought I'd try for some historical notions from John Gunnell, a friend who edits Old Cars Weekly, a newspaper for collectors that has its fingers firmly on the past.
"Ah," John said, "this goes all the way back to the 20's. Some of the cars then had what was called a California top, a removable hardtop that gave a big touring car a sporty look. Studebaker was famous for those. And Duesenberg actually had a car called the Sport Sedan from 1933 to 1936."
As early as 1925, Stutz also had a car called the Sports Brougham, he said, adding that the multivalve engine gave sedan buyers the hot performance of a roadster. "Those cars could really get up and go," he said. "And some of them even had leatherette-covered bodies. They were outrageous, but really gorgeous."
Gorgeous was not a word that jumped to mind when I first surveyed the Subaru, even dressed as it was in "Rio red," which along with "granite black pearl" is a new color for 1997. Nor did the semi-econobox four-door seem to equate with the "grand" image of a big Stutz or Duesenberg, but I guess inflation has taken its toll on the language just as it has affected prices.
And cost may be the compact GT's biggest drawback, with its hefty base price of $23,290 putting it head-to-head with some stiff competition, both domestic and imported. Of course, there is the car's all-wheel drive, which is always valuable and always there -- although the only time you'll know it is when you sail by other cars that are skittering on the ice or stuck in the mud.
The GT, manufactured in Lafayette, Ind., comes as a sedan or a wagon, and, for 1997, the visible sportiness derives from a different bumper with an integral air dam, a new grille and large fog lamps, as well as a spoiler across the trunk of the sedan. Bigger tires than in the past also grace 16-inch molded wheels that look as if they came off a BMW. A working scoop in the low hood helps to cool the GT's redesigned four-cylinder 2.5-liter engine.
That engine is flat, with the pistons opposing each other in "boxer" fashion. The power plant is a bit noisy on acceleration, but it is fast-revving and gutsy, putting out 165 horsepower, 10 more than last year and a healthy 28 more than the 2.2-liter engine in the base $19,600 Legacy sedan.
This year, too, it runs on regular instead of premium gas, and its economy rating is 21 miles a gallon in the city and 27 on the highway. With a 16-gallon tank, that translates into a cruising range of about 440 miles, which helps the "touring" part of the grand-touring equation. The test car was also surprisingly roomy, with a deep, flat-floored trunk and a rear seat that folds down, making it a good vehicle for hauling.
With the seat up, the rear compartment affords lots of room. But passengers back there won't want to take any long trips, however much they can stretch out, because the bench is unfortunately uncomfortable, hard and without contour. Up front, the cloth-clad buckets are somewhat better, but still not the lap of comfort.
The GT offers the usual amenities, and the standard equipment even includes a power sunroof. Interior storage is also ample, with a glove box that is, surprisingly, bigger than that of many larger cars. For the driver, there is a four-spoke wheel wrapped in leather, and the driving position is excellent.
On the road, the GT is indeed sporty and tight, offering a pleasant connection to the road. Anti-lock brakes are standard, so the car stops as well as it goes. And a five-speed stick is available this year, a good choice over the automatic that was the only transmission in the past. Firm and positive shifts let you run through the engine's new torque curve, which gives you more power at the lower speeds where you need it and makes the car more fun to drive.
And maybe that's the real answer to my original question. Whether you go back in time or take a trip today, sport sedans are always fun. Even when your treks are mostly to the store.

INSIDE TRACK: A tourer, maybe. But grand? I don't think so.

Water's Fine! Worms Dine On the Pier

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
When the 69th Street Pier closed in November, Brooklyn lost one of its most popular spots for strollers, families and especially fishermen. And oddly enough, the fact that the water is now clean enough to fish in is what led to the pier's demise.
The City Economic Development Corporation, which maintains the pier, said pollution had ebbed so much in New York Harbor that there has been a rapid growth in marine bore worms that feed on pilings. City inspectors sent to examine the 69th Street pier in the wake of the collapse of a nearby pier in Sunset Park last September were stunned by how badly its pilings had deteriorated, said Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the corporation. 
 Refurbishing the 69th Street pier would cost $5 million, according to an estimate by the Brooklyn Borough President's office. The Borough President has committed $2 million for repairs, but the funds will not be available until the 1999 fiscal year.
"It's really a shame," said Joe Basile, 64, a retired salesman who frequented the pier. "I'd be willing to have them put up a sign to say, 'Do this at your own risk.' "
Denise Virga, district manager for Community Board 10, questioned how the pier was allowed to fall into such disrepair. It was refurbished to allow for ferry service run by Express Navigation to Wall Street, but somehow the decay was missed. "If the money had been allocated before the disaster happened, it could have been fixed." Ms. Virga said.
Economic Development Corporation officials said agencies previously responsible for the pier failed to perform necessary maintenance. The Port Authority, the City Department of Business Services and the City Department of Ports and Trade are among the agencies that maintained it in the past, Ms. Virga said.
The ferry service, suspended since November, is to resume tomorrow at Pier 4 at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. It will run to Pier 11 at Wall and South Streets in lower Manhattan. DAVID ROHDE

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
After the Talk or the Touching Gets Too Personal, Where to Turn?

BYLINE: By BARBARA B. BUCHHOLZ 

 BODY:
BING the victim of sexual harassment is bad enough. But what do you do when the offender is a member of senior management? Will your complaint end your career? And is there really anyone in your company to whom you can realistically complain?
Sgt. Maj. Brenda L. Hoster asserts that she was harassed last year by her boss, Gene C. McKinney, the Sergeant Major of the Army who was named last fall to a commission charged with reviewing the Army's sexual harassment policies. Sergeant Major Hoster said that when her complaint was ignored, she felt compelled to retire. The Army suspended Sergeant Major McKinney last month. 
 Mary Dixon also quit her job, after contending that she was harassed by Dan K. Wassong, the chief executive and president of Del Laboratories, a cosmetics company in Farmingdale, L.I.
"When I complained to my boss, he said, 'Find another job,' " said Ms. Dixon, a former executive assistant who sued the company and eventually shared a $1.19 million settlement with 14 colleagues. "There were so many incidents over the 19 months I worked there that I was in absolute terror, but I needed the job. I was newly married and had a mortgage. I finally quit after he grabbed my buttocks."
Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Del Laboratories, said Mr. Wassong and the company deny wrongdoing and the company settled "only to avoid protracted litigation and extraordinary publicity." He said the company had also changed its policies on sexual harassment to make it easier for employees to seek help.
LAWYERS say the corporate environment for women has improved since Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991, but the process of filing charges is still daunting, especially if the accused offender is the chief executive. Still, there are smart steps that workers can take to win a claim.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal agency responsible for enforcing discrimination laws, said that since the Civil Rights Act of 1991 allowed plaintiffs in these cases to sue for compensatory and punitive damages, the number of charges filed with the agency had more than doubled, to about 15,000 last year.
Trisha Brinkman, of Brinkman & Chersky, a consulting firm in San Francisco, said companies tended to settle quickly and quietly in quid pro quo claims -- involving supervisors who seek sexual favors in return for job benefits -- because they fear the liability and adverse publicity.
More difficult to prove, but more commonplace, are complaints of a hostile work environment. These often involve unwelcome, repetitive and subtle harassment, said Pauline T. Kim, an associate professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.
"Your boss might call you a slut once or 10 times, but a court might not consider it harassment because it doesn't affect your ability to perform your job," said Laurel Bellows, a Chicago lawyer and the president of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession. "But if the person brushes up against you several times, that may be viewed differently because it's not what's considered reasonable behavior."
In its suit against Del Laboratories on behalf of Ms. Dixon and her co-workers, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission contended that Mr. Wassong had sexually harassed employees by blatantly seeking sexual favors in return for job benefits and by more subtly creating an intimidating or hostile work environment.
Ms. Dixon now works from her home in Commack, L.I., filing medical billing claims for doctors and consulting for supermarkets. She said she would never feel safe working again outside her home.
Many who have filed harassment claims concur with Ms. Dixon that even when they win, they lose, because of the emotional and financial toll of the process. Because those who complain may be labeled troublemakers, they often decide to find another job.
SUCH is the case of a 36-year-old former professional at a Fortune 50 company who quit her job two months ago after what she described as a year of enduring remarks like "How is your sex life going?," harassing calls to her home and an inability to obtain a transfer because her harasser was protected by upper management. The company settled out of court.
Single and unemployed, she vacillates between feeling good about speaking up and feeling terrible. "It's not like my life is ruined, but depending on your work life and community, you can be perceived as a pariah and a woman who wants to shake down an organization," she said. "There's a lot of guilt by association." The terms of her settlement prevent her from revealing her name, her employer or the industry in which she worked for a decade.
Lawyers say the burden rests on the worker to prove a claim, which requires following a long list of steps that differ by company, but that often involve going to a human resources supervisor, who investigates the complaint.
And therein lies the problem. "It's an oxymoron to think that an H.R. person can keep a complaint confidential when investigating," said Freada Klein, a consultant in Boston who advises companies on their sexual-harassment policies. "When the harasser heads a company or is in management, follow-up and action become less likely."
Jeffrey Liddle, a lawyer with Liddle & Robinson in New York, said: "H.R. personnel represent management, not employees. Even when they say, 'Yes, this is awful,' you may find the harasser in your face the next day, or subtler discrimination, such as your work criticized."
What do you do if you have been harassed? Here are experts' recommendations:
* Read your company's policy. "Know what procedures it offers to voice complaints," said Marcia L. Worthing, senior vice president for human resources and corporate affairs at Avon Products. "Know how it defines sexual harassment and understand what such behaviors are."
* Speak directly to the harasser. Immediately tell him or her that a comment or action is unacceptable and you want it stopped. "Be specific rather than general," said Joann Keyton, an associate professor of communication at the University of Memphis. "Say, 'I feel uncomfortable when you touch me unprofessionally,' rather than say, 'I don't like the way you treat me.' "
* Document all actions and comments. If words and actions persist beyond a few incidents, keep notes of what was said, how you responded, who was present, where the conversation or incident took place and how you felt, Ms. Bellows advised. Some states permit tape-recording of conversations in which you are a participant, though some companies prohibit taping, said Bradley Kafka, a lawyer with Gallop, Johnson & Neuman in St. Louis.
* Speak up to company management. Tell the appropriate supervisor about the harassment and follow up the conversation with a memo. If he or she isn't responsive, go to others until you get a response.
If the company has a harassment policy and fails to investigate, it may be liable. Conversely, if you don't give the company a chance to investigate your complaint, you risk losing in a lawsuit. Even though the human resources department represents management, you may have no choice but to file your first complaint there.
* Get emotional and legal support. Because those who complain often feel -- and sometimes are -- ostracized, tell someone you trust at work. Also have a confidant outside of work. Consider hiring an employment lawyer to walk you through the process, read documents you may be asked to sign and weigh any company offers.
* Refrain from the urge to sue. A lawsuit should be a last resort because of the time, money and emotional distress involved, said Nina Stillman, a lawyer with Vedder Price Kaufman & Kammholz in Chicago.
Before suing, be sure to file a charge within the equal employment commission's statute of limitations -- 180 days, unless the agency has contracts with a state or local agency, which extends the period to 300 days, said Michael Widomski, a spokesman for the agency. A commission employee will investigate and issue a letter of determination to the company. If conciliation fails, the agency may file a suit.
* Move on. If you file a complaint and the company begins passing you over for promotions or plum assignments, lawyers say it is difficult to prove that this is retailiation. Dale Winston, chairman and chief executive of Battalia Winston International, an executive recruiting firm in Manhattan, says it is better to simply leave the company and start over someplace else. And the quicker the better. "Put your resume on the market and get out of there," Ms. Winston said. By moving quickly, she said, there will be no gap in your resume that will have to be explained during job interviews. But if you are asked about why you left, don't lie.
* Don't bank on a big monetary award. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 capped punitive and compensatory damages based on the number of employees at the company. A company with 500 workers would have to pay a maximum of $300,000; one with 100 or fewer would pay up to $50,000, said Mary Stowell of the Chicago law firm of Lang Stowell Friedman & Veron.

City Yields on $600,000 for Housing

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
After Community Board 9 in West Harlem raised a ruckus, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has changed its mind and decided to use $600,000 from a special city fund to reclaim housing in the community itself rather than throughout the city.
Instead of yielding to Board 9's request that it be allowed to use the money for various projects, the department will rehabilitate 260 buildings within the board's boundaries -- from 110th to 155th Streets and from Morningside Avenue to the Hudson River -- according to the outgoing Commissioner, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli. "If you are a housing agency and you have an overwhelming housing need," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said, "it's not unreasonable for the money to go to housing." 
 The city began the fund, known as the Tax Syndication Sharing Program, in the late 1970's. It was intended to energize neighborhood renewal by requiring developers who received Federal financing to build low- and middle-income housing to deposit 2.75 percent of profits from those projects into an escrow account. The department planned to distribute the money to local nonprofit groups. But because the agency did little to publicize the fund's existence, few groups knew about it. Of the $7.1 million collected between the late 70's and mid-80's, when the requirement was phased out, $6 million remains.
Over the years, Board 9 has pressured the city for the $1 million collected from developers who put up housing in West Harlem. Its chairwoman, Marita Dunn, said the board had wanted to upgrade its computer system, install fence and outdoor lighting at community gardens and open an adult education center, among other projects.
But since 1991, the city has approved only 2 of 11 board proposals: restoration of Annunciation Park, at 135th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and renovation of the 369th Regiment Armory, at Fifth Avenue and 143d Street, which together cost $390,00. That, combined with $27,000 given out during the early 1980's, left almost $600,000 collected in the community.
Last month, the city notified the board that that money, along with the rest of the fund, would be used to rehabilitate 2,000 buildings citywide, a decision that outraged Ms. Dunn and other board members. She said she had called the agency and wrote letters demanding that the money remain within Board 9's boundaries. On Thursday, Ms. Barrios-Paoli said she had decided to reverse the agency's decision, a move Ms. Dunn applauded. "There is a tremendous need for the money in this community," she said. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Doing the Right Thing in a Capital Gains Vacuum

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
IT has been excoriated as a handout to the rich at the expense of the middle class and the poor, and it has been promoted as the key to unlocking the nation's true growth potential. Whatever its effect on the economy, a reduction in the capital gains tax is back at the top of the political agenda, and after years of bitter partisan debate it now stands a good chance of being adopted -- at least in part.
For investors, a reduction in the tax rate on gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets could have profound effects. But planning for a change is difficult, because the Clinton Administration and Congress are only beginning to negotiate a deal and the ideological and economic differences between them remain substantial. 
 In broad terms, Republicans are seeking a reduction in the top rate on capital gains to 19.8 percent, from 28 percent. They want the reduction to apply to gains from all types of assets, and they would ideally like to find a way to exempt from taxation the portion of any future gain attributable to inflation.
The Democrats have put a variety of much narrower proposals on the table. President Clinton supports exempting some profits on the sale of a home -- up to $500,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly. Congressional Democrats have introduced proposals that would provide expanded breaks for gains on the sale of investments in small businesses and of farmland.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, is pushing an innovative plan that would create a sliding tax scale for all assets, with the rate declining the longer the asset was held. If held for more than two years, the top rate would drop to 26 percent, and it would drop two percentage points for every additional year the asset was held, up to a total of eight years, when the rate would bottom out at 14 percent.
But assuming that any compromise includes a reduction in the top rate and applies to equities, history provides some clues as to how investors -- especially those who want or need to cash in gains from the market's breathtaking run-up -- might proceed.
When the rate was last reduced, in 1981, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged about 15 percent in the few months after the effective date of the change. The market appears to have been driven down in part by pent-up selling from investors who had been waiting to cash in profits at a lower tax rate.
Analysts say there is no reason to think that pattern will not emerge again this year if a deal is struck to reduce the rate.
"There are reasons that appeal to intuition as to why the market should behave this way," said Geoffrey Brod, vice president for equity investment at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford.
But while investors in 1981 seemed to have firm views, the trade-offs on timing may seem more complicated to many people. If you have to sell soon, is it best to lock in the gain now, with the market at fairly frothy levels, and give up the opportunity for a lower capital gains rate? Or is it better to risk a possible downturn in the market -- either from pent-up selling after a tax cut or from other causes -- in order to reap the benefits of a lower tax bill?
Consider this example: An investor subject to the current top 28 percent rate who recorded a $10,000 gain on a $50,000 portfolio would have an after-tax profit of $7,200 if he sold the portfolio. But if he waited until after the tax rate was lowered to, say, 19.8 percent, and recorded the same gain, he would have $8,020, after taxes. That's a difference of $820.
But what if the market fell 10 percent between now and when the investor sold the portfolio? If the holdings fell in sync with the overall market, the gain would decline to $5,000. Even at the lower tax rate, the investor would net just $4,010 after taxes, compared with $7,200 if he paid the higher tax rate but sold before the market drop. That's a much bigger difference of $3,190.
Precisely because of such possibilities, most investment advisers start with the conviction that "the tax tail should not wag the dog," as Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates in New York, put it. In other words, the potential gains or losses on the underlying investment decision are likely to be greater than those resulting from any change in tax policy.
Some forces that can affect stocks' values may catch investors unawares. A lowering of the capital gains tax, for example, could increase the attractiveness of high-growth stocks and decrease that of stocks that produce high income.
Nevertheless, there are some plausible strategies for exploiting tax changes. For example, an investor who owns a stock that is performing so well that it might not suffer from a market decline could sell a portion of the shares before the tax cut and save a portion to sell afterward. Another approach, Mr. Brod said, would be to "wait until the date of enactment and then sell immediately," before the market had a chance to decline.
But investors planning on tax plays should keep in mind the great political uncertainties. The President's budget, for example, would require cost-averaging of all holdings rather than allow investors to identify specific shares as they calculate capital gains and losses. If this becomes law, it may overwhelm any investor savings from a new, lower capital gains rate.

Recent talk of a capital gains tax cut my tempt investors to delay selling. When rates last fell, in 1981, many people tried this tactic. But their rush to sell after passage of the cut temporarily pushed overall stock prices down. Graph shows the S.&P. 500 index plotted weekly through that period.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Are You Worth More But Enjoying It Less?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
YOU jumped into the market well before the Dow hit the once unthinkable level of 4,000. You kept making monthly contributions to your retirement account. You even placed some side bets with nonretirement money, as you watched -- first with glee, then in shock, now in awe -- the Dow soar, clicking off 1,000-point gains almost as fast as a car zipping past highway markers. Oh, yes, those stock options you snickered at a few years ago are now worth a small bundle, too.
You may not be rich, but you are certainly starting to feel wealthier. So surely you're now driving a flashy new car to your new drop-dead second home, aren't you? 
 Not if you are Scott Meyer, a 36-year-old sales representative for Cadence Design Systems in Tempe, Ariz. He has six figures worth of stock just in his "money to acquire things" account. It is jammed full of high-flying high-technology stocks -- from Compaq Computer to Intel. Is Mr. Meyer feeling richer? "Absolutely," he says.
But he doesn't have a new car or vacation home to show for it. "I used the money to get our family out of debt -- mortgage and everything," he said of the gains he harvested from the account over the last couple of years.
Mr. Meyer is one of the millions of affluent Americans who are confounding economists and economic policy makers alike; instead of spending even a modest chunk of their new-found wealth from the stock market, they appear to be holding back. And that is sending the experts to their models of consumer behavior to rewrite the equations for the so-called wealth effect, the theory that consumers will spend more simply because the value of their financial assets has risen.
"In our forecast for 1997 we are marking down the wealth effect in our model," said Joel Prakken, a prominent proponent of the theory and the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. "Our confidence in it has been modestly undermined."
Federal Reserve policy makers are also worried. While the increased spending from the stock market rally has been less than forecast, that pattern could change, as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, noted when he testified before Congress last week.
"The unusual uncertainties in the overall outlook," Mr. Greenspan said, "are especially focused on the behavior of consumers," whose spending equals two-thirds of the nation's output. And that seemed only to add to Mr. Greenspan's concern that the stock market gains of the last two years or so are making it more difficult for the Fed to maintain a balanced economic environment.
The stock market surge since 1994 has added nearly $3 trillion dollars, or 50 percent, to the total of household financial assets in the United States. And the amount is continuing to rise.
The current total is equal to more than a third of the nation's output of goods and services last year. According to most studies, Americans would traditionally be expected to spend 3 percent to 5 percent of that new wealth, or $60 billion to $150 billion over several years, on longer vacations, bigger cars, second houses, yachts -- or just more frequent visits to restaurants or the theater.
In an economy with an annual output of more than $7.5 trillion, that may not seem like all that much. But $60 billion, if spent over two or three years, should provide a greater boost for the economy than the new spending that would be generated by the $98 billion tax cut over five years that President Clinton has proposed in his new budget. And $150 billion would be a stronger stimulant than the five-year, $193 billion tax cut that Congressional Republicans are pushing.
But economists who believe in the wealth effect are concluding that there has been a lot less bang for the buck than they had expected.
"People are not spending as much as the wealth effect would imply," Mr. Prakken concedes.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan, in his Congressional testimony last week, noted that most econometric models had predicted that the stock market's climb would have "a larger positive influence on consumer spending than seems to have actually occurred."
Other economists see new ammunition for the argument that there never has been much of a wealth effect.
Income is the biggest driver of consumer spending. People who take home more pay tend to spend most of it. But many economists say an increase in a person's wealth from a rise in the value of a home, a surge in the stock market or an increase in the value of a small business should prompt additional spending, even if the gains are still on paper.
The spending of such gains, however, is not immediate, because it takes time for the investor to decide how permanent the gains may be. There can be a lag of several years, especially if the increase is from the stock market. And the extra spending usually comes from reducing contributions to savings rather than from cashing in any of the new wealth.
The portion eventually spent -- the wealth effect -- is not large, because people generally view their new wealth as something to be used over a lifetime. But a lot of economists have argued that the impact should not be dismissed. It could mean the difference between an economic slump and just slow growth. Or it could provide just enough kick to the economy to cause the Federal Reserve to push up short-term interest rates to ward off inflation.
Some economists point to the wealth effect to explain the surprising spurt in spending in the second quarter last year. That spurt (which lasted only briefly) put Wall Street on alert for a Fed tightening of interest rates (which did not occur). Others tie the wealth effect to the surge in the purchase of luxury goods throughout 1996, a year after the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 33.5 percent while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 34.1 percent.
And the flurry of sales of Ferrari Mondials, Lamborghini Diablos and million-dollar condominiums and cooperatives has signaled the more intense wealth effect felt in the nation's financial capital, New York City. But a lot of that extra spending in the New York area may have less to do with the wealth effect than with the big bonuses that Wall Street executives have taken home in the last couple of years.
SO why is the wealth effect turning out to be such a poor predictor of human behavior?
A principal factor is the same force that has powered the stupendous rise in the stock market: the desire of millions of baby boomers to prepare for retirement, a drive that seems heightened by their growing fear that Social Security benefits will be much stingier for them.
Debt burdens may also be getting in the way of spending. For many middle-class Americans, a rise in debt may have offset the wealth effect from gains in their portfolios. At the same time, wealthier Americans may have restrained their spending while paying off their debt.
Baby boomers -- and other investors -- are also worrying about losing jobs, and many would rather spend less than risk being out of the market for a split second and missing another market rally. All this means conserving rather than spending.
"Now is not the time to spend the money; now is the time to grow the money," said Mike Mazza, 39, a creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide in San Francisco. "I am not going to run out and buy a boat because the stock market is up."
Mr. Mazza, married and the father of a son, Marco, who is almost 2 years old, is "maxing out" in his contributions to his retirement program contributions and buying stocks and mutual funds on his own and through a broker.
But despite a 30 percent rise in the value of his portfolio over the last two years, he says he is actually spending less, and for two reasons.
First, he thinks the stock market is due for a correction and then a decline in its rate of growth.
"At some point, we won't get the returns we have had for the past few years," he said. Recently, he has stopped buying as many stocks as he did in the past and has been building up a little cash, which he hopes to use to buy more stocks if the market falls.
Second, he wants a strong-enough financial base so he can be flexible about his career; he is not sure how long he will be able to parlay his talent into a well-paying job. "I don't see that many people practicing on the creative side through their 60's," Mr. Mazza said.
Mr. Meyer of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software and provides services for electronic design, said job security was another reason for saving over spending. Many people in the high-technology industry, he said, "have felt a lot of the effects of downsizing and because of that they do not want to put their families at risk."
While he has never been laid off, he wants to be ready. Conserving rather than spending his new wealth, he said, gives him "the saving power to regroup the family."
IN paying off his mortgage and other debt, Mr. Meyer reflects a recent trend among a number of wealthier Americans. And money used to pay off debt is money that is not available to buy things.
Between 1992 and 1995, the median debt burden of households with incomes over $100,000 dropped 21.6 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Board's new Survey of Consumer Finances.
But among less affluent families, some of whom may even have borrowed to buy stocks, a different mechanism seems to be at work. As Mr. Greenspan noted last week, many middle-income Americans have built up such substantial debts that they cannot borrow more and sometimes even have to rein in spending to meet interest payments. The median debt burden rose 5.6 percent from 1992 to 1995 for families with incomes of $25,000 to $49,999, according to the Federal Reserve.
Economists also say many Americans may not be feeling so wealthy because a growing portion of their stocks are held in 401(k) accounts and other retirement plans. Many consumers see this money as a nest egg that may still be too small.
Of the nearly $3 trillion increase in the value of stocks held by households from the end of 1994 through the third quarter of last year, about 40 percent was in retirement or other indirectly held accounts. The number of households with retirement accounts jumped to 43 percent in 1995, from 37.9 percent in 1992, while the percentage of households owning stocks directly or in mutual funds remained at 27.3 percent.
Even some economists who trumpet the wealth effect -- and have seen their own fortunes rise -- have trouble pointing to significantly increased spending on their own part.
N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University who is writing a new introductory textbook, said the rally in the stock market "increases my sense of financial security and increases the chances that I would go to the $45 restaurant.
"But to be honest," he added, "I am finishing up this book now and I am not spending anything."
Assessing the wealth effect will be most critical for the Federal Reserve, which many economists expect to raise short-term interest rates this year in an effort to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
"The wealth effect is something that has to be considered," said William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a permanent member of the Fed's policy-making committee. "A positive wealth effect does lead to stronger economic growth."
And in his remarks in December about "irrational exuberance" in the stock market, as well as in his testimony last week, Mr. Greenspan made clear his concern about the impact of stock prices and the wealth effect on the economy.
But Fed officials say that although the wealth effect does matter, it probably does not matter as much as many economists once thought.
Laurence H. Meyer, one of the two newest Fed governors, has been a longtime believer in the wealth effect, honing his views at the company now known as Macroeconomic Advisers.
But Mr. Meyer says that witnessing a discussion between his son, Ken, and daughter-in-law, Kathy, gave him a new insight into the relationship between wealth and spending. His son, a management consultant, had received a pay raise and he and his wife were disagreeing over how to use it.
"She wanted a couch, and he wanted a mutual fund," Mr. Meyer said. "My son won the fight."
The wealth effect has been dismissed by many economists since the stock market crash of 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent, on Oct. 19, a fall that sharply reduced the value of the stocks owned directly or indirectly by households.
Econometric models predicted a steep decline in spending because of a negative wealth effect from the crash. But when the economy avoided the recession that many analysts had predicted, the wealth effect did not look so potent.
SINCE 1987, however, the makeup of the market has changed markedly, so even that relatively recent experience is probably not a reliable guide.
The Survey of Consumer Finances shows that stocks jumped to 40.4 percent of the average family's assets in 1995, from 34.4 percent in 1992 and 26.3 percent in 1989. For households with incomes of $100,000 or more, that share has jumped to 47.6 percent, from 31.4 percent in 1989.
This greater dependence on stocks has prompted some economists to think more about the reverse wealth effect, wondering if consumer spending might really take a sharp hit if the stock market plunges again.
Another change in recent years is in the level of consumer confidence, which hit an eight-year high in January, according to the Conference Board, and is well above its level when the current leg of this bull market began, at the end of 1994.
Even among those who see the wealth effect as genuine, there is a wide range of opinion over how it affects the economy. John Lipsky, the chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank, summed up the "consensus" this way: "There is no argument. The wealth effect does have an impact on consumption. The argument is over the impact."
Mr. Lipsky noted that the financial net worth of households rose nearly 16 percent in 1995, with the increased wealth from rising stock prices and other assets outweighing the increase in consumer debt. And that trend continued last year.
"The magnitude of the improvement in household net worth was so striking," Mr. Lipsky said, "that it had to have an impact on consumption."
But experts in this camp acknowledge the longer lag between increased stock-related wealth and spending than is seen with other financial assets, like a house, that grow in value.
"In the stock market," Mr. Prakken said, "there is some evidence that there is a longer delay because people understand that what goes up may come down."
While sticking with the wealth-effect concept, Mr. Prakken is scaling back quite a bit on the impact.
"I am tending toward 3 cents instead of 5 cents," he said, referring to the spending from a dollar of increased wealth.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former governor of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists who thinks Mr. Prakken should be scaling back even further, perhaps to near zero. Mr. Lindsey, who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, argued that stock ownership outside of 401(k) plans is very concentrated among the rich, who own nearly three-quarters of all such equities. And they are less affected by increases in wealth.
"If you have $100 million and it goes to $110 million, will you spend more?" Mr. Lindsey asked. "I don't think so."
As proof, he said he had not seen the spending one would expect from the traditional calculation of the wealth effect. The wealthy, he said, "would have had to have bought two additional cars each year."
Mr. Lindsey said wealth derived from the stock market casino was less powerful than that generated from real estate and individual entrepreneurship. There is real wealth and "lottery wealth," he said, and people tend to "consume out of real wealth, not lottery wealth." Investors also may be deterred from spending because they discount their new wealth for the taxes they will have to pay.
James M. Poterba, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has taken an approach that is similar to Mr. Lindsey's, finding only the weakest of links between the stock market and spending. He looked at the types of goods -- like cars, yachts and second homes -- that rich people might buy if they felt wealthier. But he could find little evidence of that type of buying in retail spending data.
 "There is not a strong linkage between a run-up in the stock market and the consumption of luxury goods over the first year after the stock market goes up," he said. The wealth effect from an increase in the stock market, he estimated, "may be 1 cent" on the dollar.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, doubts that there is a wealth effect from the stock market because all he has seen since 1993 has been a slowdown in the growth of personal consumption expenditures, adjusted for inflation.
"The surprise," Mr. Yardeni said, "is why consumer spending isn't stronger, given the wealth in the stock market and the high level of consumer confidence."
Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, who continues to pep up his forecasts with a wealth effect, conceded that it hadn't worked out yet. "You might ask: Where is the spending?"
The answer may depend on whether people like Michael A. Tognetti, 48, a team leader for a new Banc One loan service center in Phoenix, changes his behavior. So far, he has been quite cautious, balancing a little extra spending with a lot of additional savings, even though the rally in the stock market has clearly exceeded his expectations.
Mr. Tognetti said that whenever he has a choice between spending and saving, "I hold some of it for our fun money and the rest of it is invested."
"We pay ourselves first in terms of investing for our future," he said.

HEADLINE: Calling All Campers

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
ALEXANDER SCHWARTZ sat back on the couch of his parents' town house on Riverside Drive and watched as the man he refers to as "the camp director guy" reached into a large canvas bag and pulled out a stuffed cloth hamburger, plastic rolls, a patch bearing the insignia of Camp Winadu and orange and green fingernails.
Why the fake nails as part of the sales pitch for the camp, in Pittsfield, Mass.? 
 "When your parents aren't around," Alexander explained, "you don't have to clean or cut your nails."
Sleepaway camps like Winadu are once again big business throughout the Northeast and beyond -- as far beyond as California, Hawaii and Austria. Their rebound, after a lull that mirrored the economic slump of the late 80's, is fueled in large measure by New York City families seeking a more bucolic, less edgy place for kids to spend all or part of the summer. The largest share of the 5 million youngsters who go to day- and sleepaway camp each year nationwide are from New York City, the executive director of the National Camp Association, Jeffrey Solomon, said.
"It's an urban phenomenon, trying to get back to the country," according to Nan Rothschild, an anthropology professor at Barnard College, who teaches a class on contemporary New York and its neighborhoods. "It is a pastoral myth: when people lived in the country, life was simpler and better."
It was simpler, too, when there were fewer single-parent households in the city and fewer families in which both parents worked so one could stay home in June, July and August and look after junior. But the number of such families has soared in the last few years, as have property values on Cape Cod and in Maine and the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, persuading more than 50 camp owners to sell their properties and walk away with big profits, according to several camping experts.
That nexus, helped a good deal by the social ambitions many parents harbor for their children, translates into higher tuitions, as much as $8,000 for an eight-week session, at many of the remaining traditional camps. What does a camper get for $8,000? Lessons in water polo and equestrian jumping, a personal tennis instructor and a hefty charge account at the camp store are just some high-end amenities.
"Parents are driven and they're driving their kids," said Laurie Edelman, the executive director of the New York section of the American Camping Association, a nonprofit accrediting group, comparing the phenomenon to the parental obsession with enrolling youngsters in the "best" private schools. "They think the right camp could set them up for life."
Even the association does not seem immune from the hype. One of its brochures on camp selection is entitled, "The Biggest Decision Until . . . Which College?"
Not all camps, though, are mini versions of resorts on the Cote d'Azur. The number of specialty camps, including wilderness programs, those for handicapped children and those that require campers to participate in some kind of community service, is growing, Mr. Solomon said. Many camps charge tuition in the three-figure range and even some of the priciest offer financial aid, especially if some wealthy former camper dies and bequeaths a scholarship fund. But high-end camps rarely advertise such help and many parents don't think, or are too embarrassed, to ask.
For many youngsters, summer camp is an idyllic place where a best friend is discovered, the breaststroke is mastered, the first kiss experienced. For others it is a hellish environment fraught with homesickness and feelings of not fitting in. Unless Mom and Dad are sadists, they try to choose the first alternative. But with more than 4,000 camps nationwide, picking the right one can be tougher than the most competitive color war. Do you want your child traipsing through Europe, sleeping in tents and youth hostels, and having virtually no phone contact with you all summer? Or would you rather have him or her waking up to reveille at dawn in a cabin with no electricity, deep in the Maine woods?
Dr. Harold Koplewicz, a child psychiatrist and the director of the Child Study Center at New York University Medical Center, warns that the most important thing to figure out is whether your child is ready for camp in the first place. See how he or she reacts to spending the night at a friend's house, Dr. Koplewicz advises. Sometimes a child experiences "separation anxiety disorder," which is marked by the belief that "something bad will happen to you when you're apart or that something bad might happen to him."
While some sleepaway camps take children as young as 5, many camp advisers recommend waiting until a youngster has finished the third grade. And Dr. Koplewicz and other child psychiatrists stress that going away to camp should be a gradual experience. While some camps offer nothing shorter than an eight-week session, a stay of one or two weeks is probably more appropriate for younger campers or you may want to start them out in day camp.
Once you're sure your child is ready for overnight camp, decide with your child what kind of camp best suits his personality and interests. Remember, your child is not a pint-sized clone of you or your spouse. Camp advisers and other experts warn against automatically sending your child to the same camp you attended. While your sentimental side might be nourished, your child might be miserable.
Alexander Schwartz's parents, Allan and Carol-Ann, purposely stayed clear of the living room when their son listened to the director from Camp Winadu and his counterparts from other sleepaway spots.
 
'They'd Better Like Where They're Going'
 "It's his decision," Mrs. Schwartz said. She will also send Alexander's brother, Gregory, 10, and his sister Katherine-Anne, 8, to camp for eight weeks. "None of the kids really want to go to camp. They'd rather spend the time in Mykonos, Greece, on the beach with us. But it's time they go. It's really time, so we let them pick. They'd better like where they're going; these camps charge a fortune."
Mrs. Schwartz said she did not have the time to conduct a full-scale camp research project so she asked parents of her children's friends for recommendations. Other parents pore over the directory of more than 2,000 summer programs published by the American Camping Association, the accrediting group, and watch videotapes put out by the camps themselves.
Each fall parents from around the city begin showing up on East 82d Street at the headquarters of the Parents League, a not-for-profit group of parents and independent schools in Manhattan. There, a bulging card file yields comments about all types of camps like: "Desperate parents shouldn't ship their overweight child to weight loss camp. Unless the child is willing, she'll come back fatter. They sneak food. Mine did."
And a small industry of consultants and referral services are available to help narrow the choices. These services, though free to the consumer, are paid for by the camps. The services receive commissions of up to 15 percent of each child's tuition, and most have no reason to tell you about the programs that are inexpensive or with which they have no commission arrangement.
When it comes to camps, parents are "certainly are more picky than ever," Lois Hutzler, a summer adviser at the Parents League for the last 20 years, said. Some want to make sure that their children associate only with others of the same religion or economic background.
Dr. Rothschild, the anthropologist, called camping mainly "a middle-class phenomenon." She said that "because of all the different types of camps, the lower classes can tap into this phenomenon."
"I don't know whether elite families necessarily send their children to camp," she said. "They generally have country houses and take their kids with them. In part, the elite are more concerned as to who their kids will meet. They want more control of their environment."
Molly Jong-Fast, the 18-year-old daughter of the writer Erica Jong, remembers that her mother wanted her to experience a certain liberal environment and to relive Ms. Jong's own positive experience from the 60's. So when she was 12, she was sent to Buck's Rock in New Milford, Conn., where her mother had spent many happy summers.
"When my mom went there it was like a socialist summer camp, a big Jewish liberal Upper West Side camp, where they did chores and cooked the food themselves," she said. For her, the experience was somewhat different. She called Buck's Rock "a crazy, hippie artistic place" with few rules. "I had gone to very conservative schools," she said, "I had led a very overprivileged life and I had never been exposed to anything like this."
 
A Lesson From Camp: Become Anorexic and Bulimic
 Looking back, though, Ms. Jong-Fast, now a student at Barnard College, thinks of the camp as a positive experience. Its staff members she said, "were the first people that nurtured any type of creativity in me."
She found Buck's Rock, which is coed, far more interesting than the girls camp she went to the next year. "All the girls were obsessed with ballet," she said. "I was 13 and overweight and not really into their ballet conspiracy. I would say 90 percent of the girls were anorexic, and if the head of the camp found out you were anorexic she would make you sit at her table and eat all your food."
That method often backfired. "By the end of the summer, all the girls became bulimic. You can't believe how many kids learned how to throw up their food. That's where I learned."
But Lynn Appelbaum, the director of program development of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House on the Upper East Side, took away far different lessons from the six summers she worked at Camp Walt Whitman in Piermont, N.H., first as a counselor, then as head of the counselor-in-training program.
For several years after she graduated from college and got a job, Ms. Appelbaum, now 31, used most of her vacation time from work to take part in and to teach programs at Walt Whitman. Even today she and seven of her closest "camp-affiliated" friends spend two long weekends there each year, once while camp is in session and the other during the fall.
"It's not like I'm trying to recapture my youth, but it was an intense experience in a very self-contained environment," she said. "There was no television, no E-mail. You don't have the guy at the corner in the bodega. The friendships were so much stronger there."
Whether good or bad, camp experiences seem to make lasting impressions, sometimes more than the nine months of school each year. "Summer bonds are so strong," said Dr. Koplewicz, the child psychiatrist from N.Y.U. "Mom and Dad are not around and these kids are spending an intense amount of time together without the influence or supervision of parents directing who they should be close to. And when do they ever have that much time with the same age group of kids, sharing in fun events?"
 
Parents Have Fears, Children Have Fun
 Renee Cooper, a senior court clerk who lives on the Lower East Side, never went to camp. She had never been allowed to because her mother had heard, believed and passed on horror stories of accidents and child molestation at overnight camps.
But now that she has two daughters -- Naima, 10 and Wasoni, 15 -- Ms. Cooper says she doubts that all those tales could be true. Last summer she decided it would be good for both girls, who had never been away from their parents for an extended time, to go to camp, although her husband, Dickson Kim, did not share her enthusiasm. Mr. Kim, also a court clerk, says today's world "is not the same place I grew up in."
"Nuts gravitate towards areas with little children," he said, "and I worry that I can't help them when they are that far away."
But his wife prevailed and after Naima and Wasoni learned how to swim at a Parks Department pool, they went to Camp Ohnehtah in Windham, N.Y., which is supported by the Girls Vacation Fund, a nonprofit organization that raises money to send low-income youngsters to camp. Ohnehtah charges a sliding-scale tuition based on parents' income, with the maximum $160 for a two-week session.
Last summer, Wasoni saw her first big moth in the latrine, which sent her and several friends screaming back to their cabin, and Naima learned the backstroke. Both girls said they loved the experience so much they can't wait to return in July.
"They came back big girls," Ms. Cooper said. "More responsible, less clingy."
While she knows some parents click their heels as their children's camp-bound buses pull away from the curb, Ms. Cooper said she had butterflies in her stomach as she kissed her daughters goodbye. But she and her husband both adjusted to the separation, in part because they had confidence in the camp because it was accredited by the American Camping Association.
 
If Complaints Increase, So Do Inspections
 Ms. Edelman, the group's executive director, said A.C.A. representatives visit each camp every three years to check living areas, food, emergency preparedness and programs. If several parents complain about a camp, the inspections will be more frequent, she said. And if parents suspect a camp has a truly serious problem, like an epidemic or child abuse case, they should call the local health department or child abuse phone line.
Jane Estabrook, who with her husband, Walter, owns Camp Kawanhee, an all-boys camp on Webb Lake in Weld, Me., concurs.
"I don't want to sound like Pollyanna," she said. "It's not like nothing like that has ever happened in the past 26 years, but boys gossip just as much as girls and as soon as we smell anything like that we have them going home."
Mr. Estabrook pointed out that camp screening can work both ways. He, his wife and staff members also research prospective campers.
"We do turn down some," he said. If we feel a boy has had too many obstacles physically, mentally or morally. He may be a bad influence."
In the last few years, he said, boys' civility and manners seem to be declining, a result, he thinks, of more divorced families. One of Camp Kawanhee's missions, he said, is to instill basic values like a belief in the merit of manners and hard work. While he or his advisers try to visit the families of all applicants, they do not bring trinkets like Alexander Schwartz got from Camp Winadu.
In the end, though, Alexander gave a thumbs-down to Winadu. Instead he picked Camp Winaukee in New Hampshire "for no particular reason," he said.
And if he's good between now and the end of the school year, his parents have promised to take him, his brother and sister to Mykonos, before they go off to camp.

"INFORMATION, PLEASE: Trail Guides for Camp"
Here are some organizations, books and referral services to help city parents pick a summer camp:
 
American Camping Association
12 West 31st Street, New York, N.Y. 10001
(212) 268-7822 or 800-777-CAMP
National nonprofit accrediting group publishes the annual "ACA's Guide to Accredited Camps," available in most libraries and bookstores or by mail ($16.95). Supported by dues from some 2,200 member camps. A.C.A.'s New York section sponsors camp fairs and runs referral service to about 120 camps. Provides information on scholarships.
 
Parents League
115 East 82d Street, New York, N.Y. 10028
(212) 737-7385
Nonprofit group offers library with camp brochures, videos and extensive card files of parent evaluations of camps and summer programs. Five volunteer advisers work with parents by appointment. Unlike those in private referral agencies, advisers have not visited all the camps, but they are not paid by them either. Supported by annual dues of $40 per family.
 
Association of Jewish-Sponsored Camps
130 East 59th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022
(212) 751-0477
Allied agency of United Jewish Appeal Federation publishes directory of 33 member camps, mostly nonprofit "Jewish culture" camps, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Also makes referrals over the telephone.

Private Referral Agencies
Cost-free to families and can save a lot of time. But no organization monitors referral agencies, and they are paid by camps depending on how many campers they sign up. A reputable consultant will reseach a camp even if it not one she deals with regularly and will narrow the list of recommendations to 3 to 5 camps. Be wary of consultants who try to persuade you to change camps every year or two. They may be more interested in fattening their commissions than in your child's well-being.
 
Tips on Trips and Camps
(212) 772-0339, (212) 722-3962
One of the largest and best-known referral services, with consultants in most major United States cities, as well as Paris and Brussels. Represents about 400 camps and sponsors camp fairs at several private schools in the city.
 
KB Camp Services

HEADLINE: BID Can Cut Two Ways For Stores on Columbus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article "New Split on Columbus, Over BID Plan" (Feb. 9) misrepresents my views. When I was interviewed, I said I was in favor of the Business Improvement District, although I had reservations. Now I find myself being quoted as a merchant who is decidedly against forming this BID. 
 I did mention that many merchants fear that a successful BID would result in large rent increases. Should my business improve dramatically as a direct result of the BID, then my business should be able to absorb any rental increases. On the other hand, if the BID is only a minor success, my business may not be able to absorb the costs. I feel that I must align myself with any organization that can improve the neighborhood and the local businesses, but nonetheless we must proceed with caution.

HEADLINE: The World;
Crows Are White. We Swear.

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Government once dealt with ugly truths by lying to the public. That wasn't a U-2 spy plane the Russians shot down, it was a weather satellite. Americans had nothing to do with the Bay of Pigs. There was light at the end of the tunnel in Vietnam.
All this convinced too many Americans that the Government could not be believed. So the Government came up with a new idea. It lies to itself. This is called certification -- that is, formally stating to Congress that something is true, whether it is true or not. It lets the Government say, in Richard Pryor's deathless phrase: "Who you gonna believe -- me or your lying eyes?" 
 The mendacious modern history of certification in American foreign policy begins in El Salvador, proceeds to Pakistan and now resides in Mexico. The Clinton Administration, grinning stiffly in the face of Mexico's profound political corruption and official narcosis, is now certifying that the war on drugs proceeds apace in Mexico (in contrast to Colombia, which was again denied certification as an ally against the drug trade).
On its face, certification is a device, brought into vogue after the high-handed lies of Vietnam and Watergate, with which the President of the United States can reassure Congress that the Government isn't hiding unpleasant facts about countries it wants to help. If the President wants to send other nations military or economic aid, for example, Congress can insist on having the Government's word that those countries are helping to curb drugs or human-rights abuses or the spread of weapons. At first, it seemed like a powerful weapon. Congress placed conditions on sending guns or money overseas: no cooperation, no aid. But even forcing the Government to put things into writing turns out to do little to improve the credibility of its word.
In reality, the White House often uses certification as a convenient cover to do what it pleases, no matter what the nation's diplomats or intelligence analysts say is really going on abroad. For Congress, too, it is a dodge: a way to say it has done its bit for human rights or arms control or drug control without really putting its foot down. It has become a game with rules that are "vague and inconsistently applied, while the punishments are often more apparent than real," says a new study by the Council on Foreign Relations.
In January 1982, Congress struck a deal with the Reagan Administration. It would approve military aid to El Salvador if the President would certify that El Salvador respected basic standards of human rights.
A few weeks earlier, a United States-trained battalion of Salvadoran soldiers had swept through six villages on a search-and-destroy mission. The soldiers massacred more than 500 civilians, concentrating on a village named El Mozote, where, as a 1993 United Nations report said, "the men were tortured and executed, then the women were executed and finally, the children."
The New York Times and The Washington Post reported the massacre. An American Embassy officer reported interviewing a refugee couple who said they saw dozens of bodies at the hamlet. The Pentagon had just issued a secret report calling the Salvadoran military "an army of occupation." The Reagan Administration's Ambassador in El Salvador had just reported that a cashiered major who led death squads and was still influential had overseen the assassination of San Salvador's Archbishop, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, in 1980.
Days later, President Reagan certified that El Salvador was making progress in adhering to international human rights standards. The Reagan Administration repeated the certification charade four times in four years.
Overwhelming evidence in a recent United Nations report showed that the Reagan Administration knew of the worst human rights abuses in El Salvador and withheld the information from Congress. The war on Communism in Central America took precedence. Finally, unable to vouch for the integrity and professionalism of the Salvadoran military any longer, President Reagan abolished the certification process for El Salvador with a pocket veto.
That same year, 1985, Congress passed a law requiring the President to certify that Pakistan was not producing nuclear weapons. Without that certification, Congress would cut off military aid. For five years, President Reagan and President Bush certified with a straight face that Pakistan had no nuclear weapons program.
 
'Unambiguous Evidence'
 The State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon knew perfectly well that this was malarkey. "There is unambiguous evidence that Pakistan is actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program," reads a recently declassified State Department memorandum dated June 23, 1983. It goes on to describe in detail how Pakistan had bought, borrowed and stolen the technology to build the bomb.
Again, the war on Communism took precedence. Pakistan was the conduit for the C.I.A.'s $3 billion weapons pipeline to the brave and crazy guerrillas of Afghanistan, who were fighting off Soviet invaders.
This went on for five years. Finally, in 1990 -- after the Soviets had left Afghanistan -- President Bush said he could no longer certify that a crow was white.
Which brings the narrative to Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States, in the words of Porfirio Diaz, the dictator overthrown by the Mexican revolution. "No country in the world poses a more immediate narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico," reads a recent State Department report, which fails to note that America's addictions invite the threat.
The arrest of Mexico's latest drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who is suspected of being a paid employee of one of Mexico's largest drug cartels, did not go unnoticed in Washington. It was particularly painful that Washington's own drug czar, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, recently praised his Mexican counterpart as a man of "absolute unquestioned integrity."
And it was simply the latest proof that there is a certain pungency to the political leadership and the law-enforcement institutions of Mexico. It is the smell of money: the $30 billion pumped into the higher echelons of the Mexican economy by the drug trade.
President Clinton faced a choice last week. He could have decertified Mexico, and cut off most economic assistance. He could have chosen a Clintonian compromise: decertify, but waive the penalties. Instead, he chose to reaffirm that Mexico fought the war on drugs tooth and nail last year, after extracting promises from Mexico that it would really and truly fight drugs tooth and nail in the future.
The certification process is a "disaster," Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said recently. "If we subjected our own country to this test, we wouldn't pass it." So the United States continues to tell itself noble lies in the name of national security, a tradition defined by the Renaissance scholar Erasmus as "falsifications by which the crass multitude is deceived in its own interests."

Build Those Houses

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Palestinian Arabs are calling on the world to stop Israel from building houses for Israelis inside the city limits of Jerusalem.
That presents the Palestinian claim to sovereignty over part of what Israel dares to consider its capital in the starkest of terms. If Jews were to defer to this demand, that would automatically put the status of today's undivided Jerusalem "in play" -- and raise Arab expectations to heights that would make a negotiated settlement impossible. 
 Realistic expectations on both sides are the keys to peace.
Last month, after the Likud-approved withdrawal from Hebron, even the most hard-line Israelis grasped the reality that a large portion of disputed West Bank land would be turned over to Palestinian self-rule -- and that the resulting "entity," to use the word rejectionist Arabs long applied to Israel, would have many attributes of a nation.
Many Israelis never expected that. The prospect of a Palestinian nation on the border took a lot of hard swallowing. Now that its likelihood is realized, Prime Minister Netanyahu must negotiate limits on Palestine's coming sovereignty to protect Israel's airspace, water supply, and population.
This month, we have the test of the realism of Palestinian expectations. Do those include the partition, euphemized as "sharing," of Jerusalem? Such a demand would be a deal-breaker; to insist on creating a foreign island inside Jerusalem would be as provocative as Israeli annexation of the entire West Bank.
Israel just had a free election about the future of its capital, and 56 percent of Israel's Jews supported Netanyahu; one cause of that landslide among non-Arab Israelis was a conviction that he would be the most certain to preserve Jerusalem's unity.
That is why this construction of homes in the neighborhood called Har Homa -- which Arabs see as on the pathway from their future state to East Jerusalem -- is no mere tacking to the right. It is an affirmation of Israel's intent to keep its capital whole. Netanyahu, having waited until the Supreme Court approved the legality of building on the land, showed an interest in amity by providing half again as many homes inside Jerusalem for Arab families.
Within Israel, a consensus has been struck accepting a half-the-West-Bank state with its capital outside Jerusalem. Some of Labor's ardent doves, including Oslo architect Yossi Beilin, joined Likud leaders in an informal manifesto that included maintaining undivided sovereignty in Jerusalem.
In that remarkable embrace of realism, Israelis of left and right supported special status for holy places and local power-sharing in Arab neighborhoods, but the unofficial coalition's central message to the Arabs and the world was plain: Most Israelis envision a final settlement that respects the unity of Jerusalem.
"You cannot make peace on the outside if you cannot make peace on the inside," Netanyahu told Sir David Frost the other night. Israelis are making peace with each other on the inside about territory, despite the fiercest rows about politics; now the challenge to the Palestinians is to make their internal peace as well, which calls for getting their expectations in line with reality.
When Yasir Arafat arrives at the White House tomorrow morning (sorry, that bedroom is booked) President Clinton should make clear what Palestinians can realistically expect: a state with a flag and a U.N. seat but limits on air and water rights; half the arable land of the West Bank, made contiguous around Israeli settlements through the most creative gerrymandering; and economic opportunity linked to democratic progress.
How should Clinton and his James Baker-trained advisers help negotiations move ahead?
Not by pumping up false hopes for certain letdown; not by tolerating crowd-pleasing hate rhetoric; not by failing to press for arrests of Arab terrorists; and surely not by tut-tutting at Israel for making clear that Jerusalem is not on the table for sectioning into competing capitals.
The clear signal Israel sends now about the inviolability of Jerusalem makes final settlement more likely later. U.N. or U.S. pressure on Israel to delay sending any signal at all, or to show by silence or inaction any weakness of resolve, would invite unrealistic expectations by Palestinians and thus subvert a final agreement.

The Bulls and Bears and the Little Pigs

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
IF American investors don't have the sense God gave geese, what's it to Alan Greenspan?
Mr. Greenspan, the ordinarily oracular chairman of the Federal Reserve, again suggested rather bluntly last Wednesday that the stock market might be suffering from a bout of "irrational exuberance," which could ultimately force the Fed to raise interest rates. If that happens, stock prices would inevitably fall. 
 Investors pretty much shrugged off the warning -- stocks edged down about 2 percent by the end of the week. Some market seers rushed to attack Mr. Greenspan as a stuffy old party pooper who failed to appreciate the wonders of the new age of investing (in which stocks always go up).
 
Cooking Books
 As if that was not enough to prove Mr. Greenspan's point about irrationality, consider the case of Centennial Technologies, which early last week zoomed from $2.75 to $14.75 based on the offhand remark of the company's new chief executive that sales were "exceptional." Any sales should have been, considering that the company, last year's biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange, had been cooking its books. Its recently fired president was arrested on Valentine's Day.
Investors knew all of this but apparently were hoping against hope that things were not as bad as they looked. They were worse. Centennial, which is described as being in the computer equipment business, announced Thursday that it had never earned any money in all the years it has been public. The stock dropped back below $2.75.
But so what? Why would Mr. Greenspan worry if a lot of silly, greedy people lost money? Or even if all those people "saving" for retirement with stock funds suffer if the market tumbles?
The problem for Mr. Greenspan is that, in complicated ways, what happens on Wall Street affects the real world, too. And in that world Mr. Greenspan is charged with keeping the economy growing, which means keeping inflation down.
Or as he put it in his testimony before Congress last week, "History demonstrates that participants in financial markets are susceptible to waves of optimism, which can in turn foster a general process of asset-price inflation that can feed through into markets for goods and services." In other words, inflated stocks and other assets can cause increases elsewhere.
One way this happens is through the so-called wealth effect: people whose investment portfolios have grown feel richer and so are more willing to spend money. Though people investing for their retirements do not seem to be spending more, the rich people who own three-quarters of all the stocks that are not in pension plans are spending, not saving, Mr. Greenspan noted. Left unsaid but true is that the more people want to buy something, the more its price tends to go up.
Markets that soar are also more likely to plunge, and that can cause recessions. People who see their life savings shrivel cut back radically on spending.
 
Fed to the Rescue
 And the effects of a plunge could be more widespread than ever. A recent poll by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the Nasdaq Stock Market found that since 1990, the percentage of Americans who own stocks directly or through mutual funds has more than doubled, to 43 percent. Most of those folks expect stocks to go up; only a few have ever been through a real bear market.
A market drop can end up causing the inflation that is Mr. Greenspan's nightmare. After the market crash of 1987, "the Fed came to the rescue of broker-dealers and the banking system, and created so much liquidity that it engendered inflation in 1988 and 1989," said David Shulman, the chief strategist for Salomon Brothers. If the market plunges and the Fed bails out the financial system again, he added, "we risk inflation in 1998 and 1999."
Finally, the stock market is important because it reflects the real world and what people think about the future. "It holds up a mirror to the societal mood" said James Grant, who wrote "The Trouble With Prosperity" (Random House, 1996). Mr. Grant argues that "the Whitewater scandal failed to catch the public's attention for approximately the same reason the Dow Jones industrial average is near 7,000 -- people want to see that the glass is half full." Watergate might not have seemed so cataclysmic, he suggested, if it had not occurred during the worst stock market in decades.
Psychology may be as important as reality in determining what happens to the economy and inflation, which is why Mr. Greenspan sometimes sounds more like a Freudian analyst than an economic one. One problem with unbridled optimism is that people take risks that are basically wacky, as real estate developers did in the 1980's. Another is that the higher people's expectations are, the more likely they are to be disappointed.
Some people on Wall Street think Mr. Greenspan was not telling people that stock valuations are too high as much as he was reminding them that things can go wrong. "He thinks free markets set the right price in the end, but he's forcing people to re-examine their assumptions more carefully," said Richard Hoey, the chief economist for the Dreyfus Corporation, the large mutual fund concern.
But a cynical few suggest that he may simply be sounding a note of caution for the history books, in case the market does crash. After all, nobody wants to be remembered as the guy who said stocks were swell in 1929, or called the Titanic unsinkable. In the end Dr. Doom gets more respect than Dr. Pangloss.

Pass the $16,666.67 Danish, Please

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
COFFEE with the President? Yes, but what did the White House serve with the small talk?
You might expect the menu at a White House kaffeeklatsch to include better-than-average coffee and exquisite pastries. 
 Well, the Democratic donors who went cup to cup with President Clinton drank neither an exotic, expensive blend nor one that East Coast consumers can find at their supermarkets. It was MJB, a brand that originated in California and is marketed mainly to hotels and restaurants for about $3 a pound, although the White House probably wanted the large economy size. The Democrats scheduled 103 coffees with the President, which helped raised $27 million for the 1996 campaign.
Ah, but the sweets. The White House is blessed with one of the best pastry chefs in the nation, Roland Mesnier. When his fantasy desserts are served at state dinners, guests wish for seconds. The Democratic contributors could choose from an assortment that included Danish stuffed with almond paste and topped with fresh raspberries. Sometimes the Danish had mango slices. Sometimes miniature croissants and pain au chocolat were served.
The coffees, which were an integral part of the Democrats' effort to raise large amounts of unlimited funds, threw the pastry kitchen into overdrive because the guest lists were so small.
"It's a pain in the neck to do Danish for 18 people," said Franett McCulloch, who has worked as the assistant to Mr. Mesnier since 1983. "If I'm going to go to the trouble of mixing and folding and rolling I'd rather do it for 500 people."
She and Mr. Mesnier work in a kitchen so tiny that three people is a crowd. Day after day, as they filled tray after tray with freshly baked confections, they wondered why the White House schedulers were putting so many morning events on the calendar. It was not until a few weeks ago, when news of the gatherings was publicized, that they realized where the pastries had been going.
"We thought the coffees were for campaign brainstorming," Ms. McCulloch said. "One morning I walked in and said, 'You know, we were one of the last to know.' "
President Clinton has said that fund-raisers never solicited contributions at the White House or sold admission to the coffees or to overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Even donors in the modest (say, four-figure) range were treated to some of Mr. Mesnier's best work. "I was invited to high tea and the petits fours were fabulous," said one of the contributors, Marie Ridder, the former head of the Virginia Council on the Environment and the widow of the newspaper executive Walter T. Ridder. "It was like a Viennese pastry shop."
Overnight guests in the Lincoln Bedroom or the Queen's Bedroom had no such treats. Breakfast, which can be ordered from a card like those found in many hotel rooms, comes from the main kitchen.
 
A Bagel for Mr. Clinton
 For the coffees, the two pastry chefs made three Danish for each person. Based on a contribution of $50,000, each pastry cost $16,666.67 (beverage included). Even one of the most expensive bakeries in New York City where the prices are always remarked upon -- except by those who shop there -- does not come close. At E.A.T., on Madison Avenue, one miniature Danish goes for $3.
The coffee, while fairly cheap, was served elegantly. A steaming mug with the President's picture on the side? Certainly not. The windowless White House Map Room, which was Franklin D. Roosevelt's command post in World War II and which Mr. Clinton used for many of the contributors' gatherings, is a cup-and-saucer kind of place.
Before Mr. Clinton arrived, a butler served the guests coffee as well as tea and orange juice.
The MJB brand is a product of the American arm of Nestle S.A., the Swiss conglomerate. For guests who disliked caffeine, the White House offered Folger's decaffeinated coffee, which sells in supermarkets for about $6.35 for a 13-ounce can. They could take it with half-and-half, artificial sweetener or sugar.
But eating was clearly not the point. "The only person I saw eat anything," said one guest, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, "was the President. He had two bagel halves."
Leftover pastries went back to the pantry; White House staff members could nibble them all day long.
Once the President was in the Map Room, each guest took an assigned seat around a rectangular table covered with a white cloth.
The donors were either across from Mr. Clinton or to his immediate left and right. Democratic National Committee officials were at either end of the table.
Ms. McCulloch said the Clinton Administration was the busiest she had worked for.
"There are events back to back," she said. "But they are the youngest Administration since the Kennedys, and they have a lot more energy."

Wired or Wireless: Whatever Turns You On

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY, says the author and futurist Nicholas Negroponte, is forcing a grand switch in the way Americans communicate. Things that used to flow through wires -- like telephone conversations -- will soon be transmitted via the airwaves. And things that used to come via the airwaves -- like television signals -- will be carried over wires. There is a switch going on, all right. But these days, it seems to be going only one way: from wired to wireless.
Last Monday, Rupert Murdoch announced he would invest $1 billion in the Echostar Communications Corporation, a little-known company that beams crystal-clear television pictures from satellites to 18-inch dishes clamped on rooftops. Unlike other such services, his venture plans to carry local television stations, which makes it the first genuine threat to cable TV. 
 The following day, AT&T took the wraps off a new technology it says will allow it to offer local phone service by bypassing the sprawling wired networks of Nynex and other Baby Bell companies. AT&T would connect your home phone to its wireless network by mounting a transmitter the size of a pizza box on the side of your house, in effect erasing the distinction between a cellular phone and a regular phone.
It's enough to make one think wires are going the way of windmills -- and that's a terrifying thought for cable and phone companies, which have dug up the streets of just about every city, town and hamlet in America, laying in copper wire and coaxial cable at a cost of more than $300 billion.
"This is like the race between the tortoise and the hare," said David J. Roddy, the chief telecommunications economist at the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche. "Wireless networks cost about a third of wired networks and they can be built in a third of the time."
Even politicians and regulators are riding the airwaves. The Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $23 billion by slicing up and selling the nation's airwaves to new competitors like wireless phone companies and satellite-television services. The Clinton Administration has budgeted $36 billion for auctions of wireless licenses.
Before Nynex and Time Warner trade their spades for radio towers, though, they should take comfort in a few facts. Wires remain the best way to transmit information in a reliable, high-quality way. Despite all the japes about poor service, Nynex and other local phone companies routinely connect 99 percent of all phone calls on the first try. And the sound is excellent.
Moreover, many of the wireless wildcatters will find it tough to compete with the wired companies, if only because they must build their antennas and base stations from scratch, while the incumbents have already sunk most of their investment into their networks.
"It would be foolhardy to put all your chips on red or black," said Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C. "For example, I believe data is going to be one of the biggest businesses of the future. And it will be delivered mostly over wired networks."
Indeed, after an initial gust of enthusiasm about AT&T's announcement, experts looked at it with a gimlet eye. Can AT&T's network of radio antennas transmit thousands of calls simultaneously? Is is reliable enough to complete 911 calls? "AT&T has been rather sketchy about what this breakthrough actually is," said Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Schwab Washington Research Group, an investment research firm.
The potential flaws in Mr. Murdoch's plan are mostly regulatory. He wants to launch enough satellites to beam local stations to 75 percent of nation by the end of 1998. The trouble is, under current law no satellite service can beam local stations into regions where those stations can be received with an antenna or by cable. Mr. Murdoch stands a good chance of getting that rule struck down. But he would still have to pay costly fees to the stations for the right to retransmit their fare. And even then, his service might be poorly suited to places like New York, where large apartment buildings offer precious few places to hang an 18-inch dish.
Then there is interactive programming. Satellite services cannot offer two-way communication -- allowing a viewer, for example, to order a movie by pushing a button on a remote control keypad.
The war between wired and wireless isn't a zero sum game. While most of the world's communications will still be carried over wires, wireless technology is a good plan for developing nations, which have not yet dug up their streets or strung millions of miles of wires. Mr. Roddy says it could be a hit in Asia and Latin America.
Wireless is also a vehicle for entrepreneurs to indulge their wildest fantasies. Motorola is building a global telephone network that completes calls by bouncing them through a necklace of 66 satellites floating 55 miles above the earth. And the cellular tycoon Craig O. McCaw and his software counterpart Bill Gates want to ring the globe with 840 satellites to transmit data at lightning speeds. Just try that with wires.

Why You Can't Tell What Things Cost

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
AMERICANS can be forgiven if they don't understand the rise and fall of Wall Street, but what happens when the price gyrations of household electronics become too tricky?
A few weeks ago, Lisa Drake, a bookkeeper in Chapel Hill, N.C., thought she had found a good deal on a satellite dish from an on-line computer retailer, until the invoice arrived in the mail. The store's shipping and finance charges had raised the dish's price some 20 percent. 
 "I was more than a little surprised by what that dish really cost me," she said. "It's hard enough to know what's a deal today and what's not without all these tricks with service and finance charges. How do you know what you're really paying?"
Price confusion -- the inability to figure out who's offering the best bargain, or even to know the true cost of something after you've bought it -- has seldom seemed so universal. The traditional laws of supply and demand once imposed a semblance of order and clarity on prices, but today they are being so haphazardly amended by pell-mell technological changes and new marketing wrinkles that the American marketplace now offers all the certainty of a Mideast bazaar -- maybe less.
Look at McDonald's. Last week it announced price cuts likely to leave you suspicious over whether a 55-cent Big Mac is really a 55-cent Big Mac if the fries and drink you have to buy with it leave you a total of three and a half bucks light. Airlines, hotels and rental car companies are even more mystifying on prices: they often change them several times a day. And after years of charging lofty rates, long-distance phone companies now write checks to lure customers away from their competitors. In recognition of the confusion over rates, ads for AT&T now feature the actor Paul Reiser pitching a no-gimmicks, fixed rate -- but even the ads' other characters have a hard time believing him.
 
Technology and Gimmickry
 How did buying -- the core act of the free market -- become such a conundrum? There are plenty of reasons. Not only are technological advances fueling obsolescence or price volatility; they are also allowing airlines and other businesses to better monitor consumer demand so they can change prices at a moment's notice. Government deregulation has spurred price competition in many businesses. And computers, with their potential for on-line buying, may speed the decline of the cash economy and make transactions even more intangible.
At the same time, Americans' stubbornly robust spending habits have created a competitive hurly-burly of marketing innovations and outright gimmickry: credit card companies offer a bewildering range of interest rates, fees and octopus-like tie-ins to other products and services, which further blurs the prices of goods bought on credit.
Outlet malls, mail-order catalogues, corporate discount plans and TV direct-marketing schemes have assaulted retail markets by offering goods at reduced or "wholesale" prices -- whatever that means. Posh department stores, where sales were once rare, trumpet them almost daily. And sales taxes, which vary from state to state by as much as 7 percentage points, only add to the confusion.
Consumers and mass marketers share the blame for the Big Price Fog. Persuaded by mass marketing that this land of seemingly limitless choices offers a better deal just around the corner, customers (who have long been told they are always right) have become ever more demanding and fickle. The marketing meisters respond with sales, coupons and discounts, you name it -- inspiring even greater confusion and expectations that perpetuate a never-ending cycle.
Economists and politicians fret that much of this price flux eludes the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation and regulates annual adjustments to a third of Federal spending, including Social Security benefits. And if, as they suspect, the C.P.I. has been exaggerated, Americans have been paying too much in taxes -- meaning that the cost of price confusion affects pretty much everyone, even if you don't buy anything.
 
Rebate, Rebate
 In fact, though, consumers evidently see little alternative but to play by the ever-shifting rules of the American bazaar. As consistently high levels of credit card debt suggest, vast numbers of Americans eschew cash purchases nowadays for fear of missing out on the sundry perks of plastic. Why pay cash, which offers no discounts or freebies (unless you and the seller are conspiring to avoid sales taxes), when a credit card purchase puts you one step closer to a round-trip ticket to Tahiti?
But life is seldom so simple. Some deals have become so complex that even a Harvard M.B.A. would struggle to find the true price. Often this allows merchandisers to charge what they want and pocket a substantial profit, with the poor consumer none the wiser. The granddaddy of them all: car leases, which contain as many baffling caveats as a bank merger.
"Friends of mine ask me questions about their leases and I'm amazed about how clueless people are about them," said Edward Harting, managing editor of Automotive Lease Guide in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Leases have gotten simpler, but I have a buddy who's a lawyer, and even he gets confused when he reads them."
One New York car dealer recently advertised a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo for $295 per month with no down payment. Anyone who rushed to the dealership was in for a $1,285 shock. In the fine print, this 36-month, nothing-down lease required the first month's payment, a $395 security deposit and a $595 bank fee.
Miffed by such shenanigans? Then try to figure the price of a credit card that offers a rebate or discount -- or the true price of anything bought with it.
Once limited to frequent-flier miles, rebates now include everything from gasoline to cash, making them virtually impossible to price. One of the most popular is Citibank's American Airlines AAdvantage card, which awards one frequent-flier mile for every dollar charged. While this card is enormously popular, it comes with a few downsides. A consumer has to decide how much he is willing to pay in fees and interest before he finally charges $7,000, the minimum total required to get any reward from the card.
 
Befuddled
 Card holders who don't pay off their balances could owe a bundle. On top of 17.65 percent interest, the card carries a $50 annual fee, more than twice the national average, according to BanxQuote Inc., an interest rate tracking company in Fairfield, N.J.
"The rebate cards all depend on life style," said Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a credit card tracking company in Frederick, Md. "Frequent fliers may pay extra for miles, but drivers may want the cards that provide gas rebates. The banks do these cards because they don't want to compete on price."
Similarly, and across the marketplace, many retailers of goods and services appear to have concluded that in an economy heavily dependent on sales and discounts to maintain demand, a bedazzled, befuddled consumer is the best kind of customer. That sort of attitude inspires resentment, and an appetite for getting even.
Bill Rubin, a manager with I.B.M. in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., recently got a deal on a lawn mower at his local Sears -- paying $225, or $155 below the list price.
"I pointed out to the salesmen that they couldn't keep that mower there until the spring," Mr. Rubin said. "I said I'd take it that day if they gave me a discount. It worked. The stores want to play games with their prices; it's nice to come out on top every once in a while."

There's a Boat That's Leaving Soon, Islanders Fear

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN 

DATELINE: ANACORTES, Wash.

 BODY:
To the people of the San Juan Islands north of Puget Sound, few things are as reliable -- or important -- as the ferries that run from island to fir-trimmed island, carrying freight, mail and tourists, especially tourists.
With natural beauty joining timber and fish as a major money-maker in the region, the ferries are an important attraction. But now the Washington State Ferry System, which has operated the ferries for more than 40 years, wants to curtail some of the service. The proposal has islanders in an uproar. 
 Specifically, ferry officials want to end the international trip linking the main San Juan ferry terminal, here on Fidalgo Island, with Sidney, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The three-and-a-half-hour run weaves through the islands daily -- twice a day in summer -- offering spectacular views of water, wildlife and rugged cliffs.
Officials in Anacortes (pronounced anna-CORT-ez) estimate that 300,000 people pass through their town every year to ride the ferry to Canada, spending at least $30 million along the way.
The system's 25 green-and-white boats, descendants of the "mosquito fleets" of smaller craft that began plying the sound more than 100 years ago, make up the largest ferry operation in the nation. But the state operates the boats for local residents, not as a tourist attraction, ferry officials say. Though the boats draw tourists, the system said, "tourist routes are not within the scope" of its mission.
The officials say the run already loses money and would lose more if the state complied with new international safety standards for routes leaving the country. Just bringing the run's two ferries, the Elwha and Evergreen State, up to the standards would cost $3.3 million, they say.
Islanders reject these arguments. Only one of the state's 10 routes, the profitable and heavily traveled link between Seattle and Bainbridge Island, covers a higher proportion of its expenses than the Anacortes-Sidney run, said Mayor Dean Maxwell of Anacortes, a leader in the fight to save the ferry. Andrew T. Mayer, executive director of the Anacortes Chamber of Commerce, said simple steps like improving the reservation system and altering the fare structure might even put it in the black, even under the stricter standards.
And while the ferry system's mission might not be tourism, its supporters say, it is administered by the State Transportation Commission, which is charged with improving economic development, enhancing tourism and encouraging good connections across state and international borders, all of which the ferry does. Besides, the weekly San Juan Islands Journal said on its editorial page, nowadays "we are all in the tourist business."
To rally support, people in Anacortes have hung a huge "Save Our Ferry" banner across Commercial Street, the four-lane road lined with motels and restaurants that is the major approach to town. Signs bearing similar messages, along with the phone number the ferry service established to hear public comment, have sprouted on lawns. Supporters of the ferry run put petitions in the Anacortes terminal gift shop and workers there say 9 out of 10 passengers sign. Mayor Maxwell said 8,000 people in British Columbia signed similar petitions after the ferry plan was announced in January.
On Feb. 19, four busloads of islanders, accompanied by a busload of British Columbians who rode the ferry from Sidney to join them, traveled 140 miles to Olympia to testify before the commission. "They had only been briefed by the Washington State Ferry System," Mr. Mayer said. "They really heard a different perspective." The commission is to vote on the proposal at its next two-day meeting, on March 19 and 20.
Mayor Maxwell said he did not understand why the ferry system would want to end the run. "We suspect a little politics," he said, possibly on the part of Seattle residents who hope that taking boats off the Sidney run would mean better service for them. There is also talk, Mayor Maxwell said, that closing the state ferry to Sidney might make things more lucrative for private operators. Or, he said, it might all be a bluff by ferry officials who think the furor will produce more state money.
For their part, ferry officials say they are willing to consider the objections and suggestions of the islanders. "That's why we're having public hearings," said Susan Harris, a spokeswoman for the system.
People in Anacortes and elsewhere in the San Juans say they hope their protests will turn things around. "We're not ready to declare victory by a long shot," Mr. Mayer said, "but we do think we opened their eyes."

HEADLINE: U.N. Plans To Streamline While Aiding Poor Nations

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 28

 BODY:
In an effort to end the United Nations' financial troubles by persuading Congress to pay the United States' late dues, the new Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is working on a plan to streamline the organization by eliminating some $200 million a year of administrative spending and shifting the money to development aid for poor countries.
The Secretary General hopes to secure these savings in the administrative budget by eliminating 500 jobs from a work force that has already shrunk from 12,000 to 9,000 since 1985, by ending duplication in some agencies and by reducing red tape. The moves would slash administrative spending nearly in half, and reduce administrative costs to 20 percent of the United Nations' $1.3 billion budget, from 38 percent. 
 "What we aim to do is to cut administrative expenses within a frozen budget so as to free more cash for our programs," Mr. Annan said in a recent interview, recalling that at their summit meeting in France last summer, the Group of Seven major industrial democracies agreed that money saved by slimming the United Nations bureaucracy should go to development assistance rather than be returned to member countries.
The new economies that the Secretary General is considering will be the centerpiece of the package of changes he plans to propose this summer in an attempt to make the unspecified reforms the Clinton Administration and Congress are demanding in return for paying the $1 billion the United States owes in unpaid dues.
While the Clinton Administration has asked Congress to make an immediate payment of $100 million to the United Nations, it wants the remaining $900 million appropriated now but held back until 1999, when it has had time to judge the changes Mr. Annan makes.
The bureaucratic pruning the Secretary General has in mind clearly falls well short of the "50 percent cut in the entire U.N. bureaucracy" demanded last year by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the most powerful congressional critic of the United Nations.
But the economies he proposes may well be judged excessive by other members, many of whom deeply resent the United States' attempt to put conditions on payments it has a legal obligation to make.
The Secretary General's proposals will be one element in a wider debate on overhauling the United Nations.
While Mr. Annan has considerable discretion over how he spends the secretariat's budget, five working groups of the 185-nation General Assembly are working to prepare recommendations for change in other areas.
To meet the United States' demand for a cut in its share of the regular budget to 20 percent, from 25 percent, and of peacekeeping bills to 25 percent, from 30 percent, members are debating a new scale of assessments under which the rest of the world would pay a larger share.
Also under debate is a plan to enlarge the Security Council by creating new permanent seats for Germany and Japan in recognition of their economic power as well as for other leading developing nations.
Finally, member states are considering how to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peacemaking and development and transform the General Assembly into an effective forum for debating world problems.
Taken together these proposals are supposed to help the United Nations deal more effectively with the problems of the post-cold-war world. But it is already clear that all of them are linked by the need to resolve the organization's financial difficulties if the United Nations is to have any future at all.
Germany and Japan say they are to help fill the budget gap a reduced American assessment would create -- provided they get the permanent Security Council seats they covet.
And there is little point in trying to strengthen any aspect of the United Nations' work unless the institution returns to solvency, with the United States paying off its debts and becoming a reliable contributor again, diplomats say.
As Japan's representative, Hisasi Owada, recently put it, "We will never agree to improve the U.N. unless we know it has the means to be effective."
Since taking office, the Secretary General has already taken several steps to make the organization more effective and to eliminate red tape and duplication. He has brought in Maurice Strong, a Canadian businessman, to oversee the drive for administrative reform at a nominal salary of $1 a year.
He has also reorganized all United Nations activities into four "clusters" -- peace and security, humanitarian relief, economic and social affairs, and development -- and instituted regular meetings among those involved in each area.

HEADLINE: In Pacific, Growing Fear of Paradise Engulfed

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: TARAWA, Kiribati

 BODY:
One sunny day in January, as Teunaia Abeta stood by and watched horror-struck, a high tide came rolling in from the turquoise lagoon and did not stop.
There was no typhoon, no rain, no wind, just an eerie rising tide that lapped higher and higher, swallowing up Mr. Abeta's thatched-roof home and scores of others in this Pacific island nation. 
 "This had never happened before," said Mr. Abeta, 73, who wore only his colorful lava-lava, a skirtlike garment, as he sat on the raised platform of his home fingering a home-rolled cigarette. "It was never like this when I was a boy."
That tidal surge was followed by another one in February. The flooding has helped focus minds here on warnings that global warming could cause the seas to rise enough in the next century or so to obliterate island nations like this one scattered in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
"The only resource we have is water," said Phillip Muller, Foreign Minister of the Marshall Islands, another country that could easily be drowned by rising seas. "Our livelihood is the sea. Now all of a sudden, it's not a friend. It's threatening our existence."
Officials of some 160 countries are gathering in Bonn to try to negotiate cutbacks in the emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. Although most experts agree that these gases may cause the seas to rise, there are major disagreements about the scale of the change and the severity of the problem.
Gases like carbon dioxide are suspected of causing global warming by effectively creating a greenhouse around Earth. Warmer temperatures, in turn, are linked to a rising of the seas in two ways: by causing the water to expand as it warms, and by melting glaciers and icecaps.
"It's so close to the heart here," said Giff Johnson, editor of the Marshall Islands' newspaper, "because you're talking about people's very existence being wiped out by the ocean rising. It scares the hell out of people to think that their country might just be gone."
Industrialized countries like the United States are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, and they are reluctant to curb industry much while the scientific jury is still out on the seriousness of the effects. That annoys the island nations, which argue that by the time the jury reaches its verdict they may be visible only at low tide.
"It's like little ants making a home on a leaf floating on a pond," grumbled Teburoro Tito, President of Kiribati. "And the elephants go to drink and roughhouse in the water. The problem isn't the ants' behavior. It's a problem of how to convince the elephants to be more gentle."
Many of the island countries in the Pacific, including Kiribati (pronounced KIH-rih-bus), are collections of coral formations. Usually a string of islets around a turquoise lagoon, they resemble not so much nations as sandbars.
Each island peeps just a few feet above sea level and is only about a hundred yards wide, sometimes less. Many homes offer bicoastal views, from sea to shining sea, and a country like Kiribati, situated about halfway between California and Australia, can at low tide be three times as big as at high tide.
In such countries the lagoon is central to the economy and national identity, for children play in the water from infancy, and many adults fish or sail for a living. The Kiribati men in their loincloths go out in outrigger canoes each day to catch tuna, and the women wade out on the coral reef to dive for shellfish and net smaller fish for dinner.
The countries most likely to go under the sea include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, all in the Pacific, and the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean. Many other island countries, including Tonga, Palau, Nauru, Niue and the Federated States of Micronesia, may lose much of their territory but for now are probably not in danger of total submersion.
The populations are tiny: Kiribati has 75,000 people, and only 10,000 live on Tuvalu. Those numbers pale beside the 150 million additional refugees worldwide forecast as a result of climate change by 2050, according to a 1993 academic study published in the journal BioScience. Other studies suggest that a rise of 3 feet in ocean levels would force the evacuation of perhaps 70 million Chinese and 32 million Bangladeshis. One-fifth of Bangladesh would also disappear.
Yet at least countries like Bangladesh would survive, though perhaps in truncated form. The Pacific islanders fret not only about whether their countries will exist outside of history books, but also about changes they see in their climate today. For all the scientific uncertainty about global warming, they insist that the weather has been getting stranger in recent years and has produced some unprecedented tidal surges.
"These aren't storms, they're surges," said Mr. Johnson of the Marshall Islands. "It's nice weather, and all of a sudden water is pouring into your living room. It's very clear that something is happening in the Pacific, and these islands are feeling it."
By some accounts, there have also been more frequent storms, changing weather patterns and other unexpected events, like a tidal wave that recently washed over the island of Kili in the Marshall Islands. Nobody has any evidence that global warming is the culprit, but there is a tendency now for people to point to any odd weather and blame the greenhouse effect.
Perhaps the most comprehensive study was issued last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of experts. It suggested that seas may rise 18 inches by 2100. But it emphasized the enormous uncertainties and suggested that the real figure could be much lower or higher.
Even a rise of two or three feet would devastate Pacific island countries like Kiribati. President Tito says such a rise would leave the country uninhabitable.
Some people find the notion that their country might disappear so overwhelming, and so frustrating because there is so little they can do about it, that they choose not to worry too much.
"What can we do?" asked Johnny Johnson, a middle-aged Marshall Islander. "Nothing but sit around and see our people washed away by the water."
Roote Claude, whose home was flooded recently in Kiribati, simply laughed -- a bit nervously -- when asked if her country would sink below the waves.
"God will protect Kiribati," she said, in a tone that seemed to reflect more hope than faith.
Technical solutions like sea walls are available to protect low-lying lands. In Japan, some two million people live below the high-water mark.
But the solutions are unaffordable for most low-lying island countries. In Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where the islets are in some places only as wide as the two-lane road that traverses each of them, a single wave often sprays the country from coast to coast. One study found that protecting the capital alone would cost up to three times the total national economic output.
To be sure, some studies also point to benefits from global warming. Mid- and high-latitude countries might enjoy not only warmer weather but also longer growing seasons.
This is small consolation to the Pacific islands, which last year began a climate monitoring project to gather evidence of rising seas and changing weather. So far, 39 countries have formed the Alliance of Small Island States to press for an obligatory 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2005.
The United States endorses the idea of legally binding cutbacks, to be adopted late this year in an international conference in Japan, but only by 2010 and with various conditions. In the meantime, America's industrial carbon dioxide emissions are growing by 8 percent a year, environmental groups report.
Developing countries are also a growing source of greenhouse gases. A corollary of China's economic boom is that it is projected to overtake the United States as the leading source of such gases early in the next century.
And in the Pacific, people are beginning to look at the sea in a new way, with suspicion.
"People here think of the ocean as their source of livelihood, as their friend," said Ross Terubea, a Kiribati radio reporter. "It's hard to think that it would destroy us."

HEADLINE: CHINA FACES TEST OF RESOLVE TO JOIN GLOBAL ECONOMY

SERIES: THE CHINA BUSINESS -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Chinese Government next week will face the first test of its resolve to speed the opening of the country's economy since the death of its paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping.
The moment will come not in Beijing, but on the shores of Lake Geneva, in the giant mansion that serves as the headquarters of the World Trade Organization. Starting on Tuesday, at a three-day meeting with American and European officials that was scheduled long before Deng's death, Chinese officials are expected to make their strongest case for their long-desired entry into the World Trade Organization, the leading club of trading nations. 
 They are supposed to describe in painstaking detail just how far their Government is willing to go in dismantling layers of protection from competition for its state industries. They are also supposed to reveal how many billions of dollars the Government spends propping up many of those enterprises, which employ nearly two-thirds of the urban population and are a mainstay of the Communist Party's control of the country.
Technically, the trade negotiations involve only the conditions of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. But for both China and the United States the talks transcend questions of commerce. They are really about the pace at which China will reform its economy and open its society.
While China tries to manage Western pressure to change the workings of its booming economy, the Clinton Administration is attempting to prove that its policy of economic engagement with China can work -- both to reverse a $39 billion trade deficit that is on the cusp of overtaking Japan's, and to alter China's behavior in human rights and arms proliferation gradually.
But Mr. Clinton clearly cannot afford to make many concessions to China. A rising anti-China sentiment in Congress, combined with the many questions surrounding what the Clinton campaign's Asian donors sought from the White House, will make these ordinarily obscure trade talks the subject of enormous scrutiny here.
After years of stalemated talks with China on a variety of subjects, American officials hope to use this meeting to jump-start the relationship. Finding a way for China to join the trade organization "is likely to be the area where we have the best chance to make serious progress in our relations with China this year," said Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States Trade Representative.
First, though, China's leaders face vexing choices. They must decide whether they have traveled too fast on the road to reform, or not nearly fast enough to join the global economy. And those leaders must make their decisions as they jockey for position in the vacuum created by Deng's death, judging whether the economic benefits of joining the club of trading nations are worth the potential upheaval and political risks at home.
If the consequences of opening China's economy are even more unemployment and further weakening of state-run enterprises, some of which are near bankruptcy, could joining the trade organization weaken the Communist Party's hold on power? Or does China have the power, given its enormous size and its potential as the world's greatest emerging market, to join on essentially its own terms, delaying the opening of its markets while the world continues to pour billions of dollars a year into the Chinese economy, building factories to pump out exports and transferring technology to Chinese workers?
China must weigh domestic imperatives against its clear ambition to become a world-class competitor in the industries -- including electronics, telecommunications and aircraft -- that have brought wealth to the United States, Japan and Europe.
China is seeking membership in the trade organization to assure that it can get into all of those markets and others around the world and that its products are charged minimal tariffs.
"This has to be an agonizing decision for these guys," one of President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers said after Deng's death. "They know that to play in the global economy, the world demands that they open up their own. But they also know how quickly the market eats into their control."

Little Evidence Of American Gains
Yet it is no less delicate a problem in Washington. Here, the trade organization negotiations have begun to bring to a boil the constantly simmering debate over whether the American policy of engaging the Chinese through trade and investment has any chance of yielding both the commercial and political benefits once envisioned.
Many in Washington view China's desire to enter the trade organization as a last opportunity to use economic incentives to change China's behavior, not only in trade, where its mounting surpluses with the United States have caused alarm, but also as leverage over China's treatment of Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan and a host of other political issues.
On the left and the right, from the Democratic minority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, to the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, critics of the Administration's China policy argue that Mr. Clinton should recognize that separating the issues of trade and human rights, the major shift he made in 1994, has failed. By the State Department's own accounting, China's treatment of dissidents is as harsh as it ever was before Mr. Clinton took office.
Clearly, the views in both capitals differ greatly. China sees itself as a developing nation, struggling to catch up, while some in the United States see it as the next Japan. Hard-liners in China believe the United States is trying to contain their country's economic power. The mainstream view in Washington is simply that China must be compelled to play by the international rules by which most other nations abide.
The tremendous sensitivity of the China issue on Capitol Hill was particularly evident last month, during confirmation hearings for Ms. Barshefsky. Of 17 written questions submitted to her by the Senate, all but one concerned China. Ms. Barshefsky still awaits Congressional confirmation to her post.
During her hearings, Max Baucus, the Democratic Senator from Montana, issued the kind of warning that is heard often these days. "Take a realistic view," he said. "My concern is that the Administration will be a bit too naive, a bit too Pollyannaish on China, that it will let China accede to the W.T.O. and hope it will all work out."
Mr. Clinton and his aides say they are anything but Pollyannaish, and that they will only let China into the trade organization on "commercially viable terms," not as a political gesture to Beijing. While President Clinton acknowledged recently that economic engagement had not yet yielded the results he sought, he repeated that it was the only way to keep China from turning inward, isolated and militaristic.
But there are many definitions of engagement, and the Administration's interpretation of the phrase is clearly a moving target. None of Mr. Clinton's top economic officials, for example, use the term "commercial diplomacy," a favorite of the late Secretary of Commerce, Ronald Brown, during his trade missions around the world. As one senior Administration official noted recently, the term sounds too much like commerce and too little like hard-nosed diplomacy.
At the core of the Clinton Administration's problems selling "economic engagement" with China is this statistical reality: While China's economy has made a great leap forward, American exports to China are standing still. That in turn has undercut one of the central arguments that Mr. Clinton and many large American companies with interests in China have made to justify the separation of trade from political disputes -- that business with China is creating jobs in America.
Last year, for example, China's economy grew at a remarkable 9.5 percent. But overall American exports to China barely rose at all. By all economic logic, those exports should be soaring, as a fast-developing China sucks in food, industrial equipment and expertise to build the nation's telephone systems and factories, its roads and its computer industry. In fact China is importing more -- but largely from countries like Japan, its largest supplier of foreign aid, whose exports to China have surged far ahead of the United States' since 1992.
"China is not buying American," Mr. Helms wrote recently in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. "Belgium buys more U.S. goods than China does," he continued, citing a figure borne out by numbers the Commerce Department just released.
Not surprisingly, those numbers have become a magnet for a host of special interest groups that are enormously frustrated by America's lack of progress with China: human rights groups who believe the Administration has largely abandoned their cause; conservatives who warn that the technology-hungry Chinese military is an enormous beneficiary of current American trade policy; nonproliferation groups that doubt China's commitments to stop arming nations like Iran and Pakistan; pro-Taiwan groups fearful of threats to the island, and many groups fearful that Beijing is already scaling back liberties long enjoyed in Hong Kong.
"Trade becomes the lightning rod because trade happens," said Ms. Barshefsky, the Administration's negotiator -- with China and Congress -- over Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization. "It is the one constant, back-and-forth interchange between the two countries, and it is the one that China needs. So, naturally, it is often viewed as the vehicle to address any number of other issues."
Until now, the chief vehicle has been the annual renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status -- a misleading name, because the status is accorded to virtually every one of America's trading partners. But after 16 years of saber-rattling by Congress, followed every year by a renewal of China's privileges, that debate has become sterile.
Renewal became a foregone conclusion because the price of canceling most-favored-nation status rose astronomically: American retailers would send in mounds of faxes to their Congressmen pointing out that all their toys and many of their clothes came from Chinese factories -- meaning that consumers would be hurt by higher tariffs -- and lobbyists from Boeing, I.B.M. and the Big Three auto makers would detail how much extra they would have to pay for Chinese-made parts.
In fact, a growing number of American companies -- led by Boeing and other large American manufacturers that have seen business slip away when political tensions with China rise -- have been lobbying for two years now for Congress to abandon the annual ritual and simply grant China "permanent M.F.N.," which most countries in the world enjoy. They argue that the annual debate over renewal has not only become a pointless exercise but also a debilitating one, because it makes America appear to be an unreliable trading partner.
Now China's move to enter the World Trade Organization has set off furious lobbying on both sides. The American "China lobby," led by the U.S.-China Business Council, has pressed for China's admission, making a familiar case that the only way to bring discipline and change to China's economic behavior is to bring it inside the world's trading system.
Perhaps the most persuasive case for that position is that China is already enjoying a free ride: Its annual most-favored-nation renewal assures that Chinese products enter the United States under the very low tariffs applied to goods from members of the World Trade Organization, but China does not now have to adhere to any of the trade organization's trading rules.
Administration officials have hinted that they would press for permanent most-favored-nation status after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. But its entry would make the issue almost moot.
At the same time, a countermovement has begun on Capitol Hill. Both Republicans and Democrats are beginning to argue that Congress, acting on powers it gave itself in the bill that approved the global trade treaty that created the World Trade Organization in late 1994, must "review" China's application to join the trade organization before the United States gives its assent.
"Here is the problem," said Mr. Gephardt, the Democratic minority leader, who has openly split with the White House on China policy and is leading this effort. "In the case of China you have a country that does not have the rule of law, that does not abide by the trade agreements we already have with them. You have a country we have tried to change through 'commercial engagement,' and we have gotten nowhere. You have a country where we lurch from one crisis to another, and when we reach an 11th-hour settlement we say 'Whew, at least we preserved the relationship.'
"And so perhaps we have to say to them that membership in the W.T.O. involves more than just their economic behavior and their economic relationships."

Negotiations Rooted in Mistrust
Even when it comes to dealing with purely economic behavior, negotiating over trade with China is wildly different from negotiating over trade with Japan.
As generations of American trade negotiators have learned, striking a deal with Japan is almost always a lengthy, frustrating affair in which months are spent haggling over phrases. But in the end compromises are usually struck and obeyed, often for reasons that have as much to do with preserving a broader relationship -- especially a military alliance in which 60,000 American troops are stationed on Japanese soil -- as they do with trade.
"There's a political and strategic relationship underlying every negotiation," said Mickey Kantor, the former Commerce Secretary and trade representative, and a veteran of negotiations with both countries. "There is a huge cross-investment, and a mutual interest in a peaceful Asia. That carries the implication of trust."
None of that exists in negotiations with China. In fact, direct pressure from the United States often backfires, as it did last year when the Chinese, to demonstrate their pique at Washington, switched a major aircraft order from Boeing to Europe's Airbus.
As a result, some in the Administration believe the best way to deal with China on trade issues is through the World Trade Organization. "That way it does not look like Washington is always the one raising the stick," one State Department official argued recently.
The first step is to force China to change the complex rules that prevent foreign companies that invest in China from selling their goods to the Chinese. One reason that Chinese exports to the United States have surged so dramatically is that foreign investment in new factories there has risen steeply. And the Chinese Government requires most foreign investors in electronics and other high-tech industries to export virtually everything they produce, so that the goods do not compete in China's home market with state-owned industries.
Inch by inch, China is backing off from those rules. In the showdown last year over the "pirating" of billions of dollars in videos, software and compact disks, China agreed to open the way for Hollywood to invest in the plants that were stealing their goods, and sell legitimate wares to the Chinese.
Now, in the negotiations over China's entry to the World Trade Organization, the United States has insisted that China do away with the laws that treat foreign investors very differently from Chinese entrepreneurs. For example, under Chinese law no foreign companies have "trading rights," meaning that they must negotiate permission to import goods and sell them to the Chinese public. For example, when Cargill Inc., the American agricultural concern, wants to sell wheat to a Chinese flour mill, it is prohibited from making a direct sale. Instead, it must sell it to the China Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, which then sells it to an internal Chinese trading company, which then sells the flour.
Last month Chinese trade officials assured Lee Sands, the lead American negotiator with China on trade issues, that they would eliminate such rules. The only thing that counts, though, are the written commitments contained in China's "offer" to join the World Trade Organization, and Mr. Sands noted that "we don't know what the top leadership believes, how far it is willing to go."
Even if China gains entry to the trade organization, however, it will hardly be a wide-open market. Chinese officials know that their status as the world's leading emerging market gives them tremendous negotiating leverage. And they use it.
For years, for example, China has demanded that in return for buying American aircraft and other high-technology equipment, companies like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas must teach Chinese the art of building airplane parts and train Chinese workers to do work that previously was performed in Seattle and St. Louis. That is why Boeing produces tail sections for many of its planes in China, and why McDonnell Douglas has built a vast aircraft factory near Shanghai. And when Chinese officials are unsatisfied with the technology they obtain, they play the American makers off against Airbus Industrie, which is eager for a piece of the China market.
These days China's efforts to squeeze more technological know-how out of the West extend far beyond aircraft. The demands for technology extend to computer and telecommunications companies. By some estimates, China's military has set up dozens of companies in the United States to both obtain technology and earn profits that flow directly to the military's coffers. Their operations are an increasing focus of attention at the Central Intelligence Agency.
That is why Mr. Clinton was particularly embarrassed by the revelation that Wang Jun, the head of Polytechnologies, China's largest weapons maker, was invited to join a White House "coffee" last year, apparently by a large donor to the campaign who was trying to curry favor with the Chinese Government. Weeks later officials of an American subsidiary of the companies were arrested for trying to smuggle assault weapons to gangs in Los Angeles.
Other prominent Asians and Asian-Americans who played a role in the Presidential campaign -- including the Riady family in Indonesia -- are major investors in China, and thus have a strong interest in seeing it enter the World Trade Organization.

The Bottom Line: Where's the Deal?
The specter of China as an unfair trader, a covert acquirer of technology and an influence peddler puts enormous pressure on the Administration to drive a hard deal if China is to join the World Trade Organization.
And China, naturally, is resisting the kind of speedy changes that the United States -- and to a lesser degree, Europe and Japan -- insist must take place. Its trade barriers that are designed to protect state-owned enterprises came into being at a time when Communist leaders worried about five-year plans, not about international competitiveness. If foreign competition is allowed in too fast, those enterprises are almost certainly headed to bankruptcy and vast downsizing.
So China is pleading for time, and Mr. Clinton's advisers say that timing -- though not principle -- is negotiable.
"The appropriate analogy is buying a house," Nicholas Lardy, an economist who argues that it is essential that China be brought into the trade organization, wrote recently. Everyone wants China to buy the house, but only at an acceptable market price. Mr. Lardy argues that what the United States should do "is lower the down payment on the house to a level that is politically affordable to China." In other words, it would be given time to open up its markets. But that will only work if the Administration can argue that it has set up a strict review procedure to make sure that China complies with the rules.
Of course, come July 1, when Hong Kong reverts to China, the world will see an odd political anomaly. Hong Kong is already a member of the World Trade Organization -- and it will remain so as an ostensibly separate "autonomous" region in China. That status is largely a fiction, and China will undoubtedly be able to use Hong Kong's status to its trading advantage. But not long ago, Wu Yi, China's Trade Minister, told Ms. Barshefsky that this situation was intolerable.
"China is the parent," she said. "Hong Kong is the child."
Ms. Barshefsky recalled that she smiled at her Chinese counterpart and said: "That's right. But in America, the children always do better than their parents."

Long-running trade tensions between the United States and Japan have their roots in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when American imports of Japanese goods began to grow rapidly while American exports to Japan lagged. America's deficit with Japan has widened since then, but in the context of huge growth in overall trade flows in both directions. If anything, the yawning American deficit with China that has developed in the 1990's appears more one-side than America's deficit with Japan, because the overall trade relationsip is smaller.

HEADLINE: New Agency Is Proposed For Managing Indian Assets

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Citing longstanding Government incompetence, a Federal trustee has proposed that responsibility for billions of dollars of American Indian assets be transferred to a new independent agency run by financial professionals.
"I've never seen a worse operational mess than exists at the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs," said Paul M. Homan, a former bank regulator and banker appointed 18 months ago by President Clinton to devise a plan for overhauling the administration of Indian money, land and other assets. 
 For example, he said in an interview, of 300,000 individual Indians' accounts, no name or address could be found for 45,000 of them containing a total of $27 million.
The Indian assets come from sources like leasing land to energy companies or collecting grazing fees.
Mr. Homan has proposed the creation of what is tentatively called the American Indian Trust and Development Administration, which would function like a bank trust department.
As described by Mr. Homan at a news conference on Wednesday, the agency would consist of a chief executive and two board members, financial experts; three beneficiaries of Indian accounts, and three members from the public at large. Creation of the agency would require an act of legislation.
Initial reaction to Mr. Homan's plan, which was considerably more sweeping than most observers of the process had expected, was skeptical.
Indian groups agreed that drastic measures were required to improve the oversight of their $2.67 billion of federally held assets but they worried about separating trust management from the Government's social responsibilities for the first time.
Among other things, Washington provides substantial support for tribal education, housing, welfare programs and law enforcement.
"There are some great things, but it's also trying to be a catchall for a lot of longstanding problems -- and there's a lot of suspicion," said Dave Tovey, treasurer of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, representing 54 tribes. While enthusiastic about the plan, Mr. Tovey said that to many of his constituents "it looks like our rights are being privatized."
Elouise Cobell, a Blackfoot Indian who advises Mr. Homan's Office of the Special Trustee, endorsed the plan but said tribes would need time to be convinced that Washington is acting in good faith. "They've been burned so often," Ms. Cobell said.
Mr. Homan's 67-page strategic plan calls for transferring trust management duties from the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, currently headed by Ada Deer, a Menominee Indian, over a two-year period at a cost he estimated at $80 million to $100 million.
These activities include approving and monitoring oil, mineral and grazing leases; selling timber; collecting, investing and disbursing revenue, and managing land records.
Keeping track of who owns land has become inordinately expensive, Mr. Homan found, reflecting the Government's assignment of common land to individuals more than a century ago and the fact that since then, law governing Indian probate causes property to descend to heirs as undivided, ever-shrinking pieces to a growing number of owners.
While legislation would be required to consolidate fractionated interests and free land for development, the new agency would move on its own to remedy the understaffing and underfinancing that Mr. Homan said had plagued the bureau's administration of Indian assets.
Fiduciary standards have been compromised because of "politically expedient" trade-offs in which resources have been channeled to popular programs, the report said, while responsibilities fall within 16 separate organizations and are carried out by more than 100 field offices.
Mr. Homan, who was a senior regulator for the Comptroller of the Currency and later specialized in the rescue of failing banks, also cited $575 million of unreconciled disbursements from Indian accounts and the bureau's total lack of accounting professionals.
"Managers and staff of the B.I.A. have virtually no effective knowledge or practical experience" in financial management, the report said.
A second stage of the trustee's plan would create a bank as a dependable source of credit and investment for tribal economic development.

HEADLINE: As Mines Fade, Workers Hunt for Jobs

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SUMITON, Ala.

 BODY:
The nice paycheck made up for the fact that Douglas Sanders seldom saw the sun. For more than 20 years, Mr. Sanders worked deep underground in the coal mines of northern Alabama, providing for his family and surviving the layoffs commonplace in this part of the country.
Just like his father and his two brothers, Mr. Sanders would ride the mine elevator six days a week to almost a mile beneath the earth's surface. "A lot of days, in the wintertime especially, you would go underground in the dark and you would get out in the dark," Mr. Sanders said. "All you knew was darkness, five days a week. You'd come out of the shaft and see the sunshine, and it would just blind you." 
 In this area of the southern Appalachians, where coal has been the primary fuel of the economy for nearly a century, mining goes through phases. As finite reserves are depleted, mines close and workers are displaced. But new mines have always opened, and the miners with the most seniority have been called back, even as the overall number of miners steadily declined.
Now, that decline, like a slow cave-in, has finally swallowed men like Mr. Sanders, robbing even the most senior miners of their jobs.
"Every day you work, you are working yourself out of a job," said Mr. Sanders, who, at 42, was one of the younger miners still working. "When they run out of resources in an area, then it is over."
This time, however, there may not be any callbacks.
The Drummond Company, the largest coal producer in Alabama, closed two of its largest mines in January, Mary Lee No. 1 and Chetopa, laying off about 725 miners. The economics of mining -- Western strip-mined coal is much less expensive to produce than deep-mined coal -- means that there are few underground mines left in northern Alabama, leaving virtually no hope for future employment in the industry for the idled workers.
Many of these middle-aged men, most of whom had been in the mines for more than 20 years, are now finding it necessary to leave the only career they have ever known because of the decline of the coal mining industry in this area. Many are being retrained at Bevill State Community College here, using state and Federal funds, for skilled jobs like electrician and welder. Those jobs offer the hope of employment and job security, but at a cost: pay that is far below the average of $45,000 a year that miners here made.
"You are going to see coal mining fade out in the area," said David Knight, executive director of the Walker County Economic and Industrial Development Authority. "The miners are looking for opportunities elsewhere, to learn new skills, if that is what is needed."
Earl Hudson is in the second layoff in his 22-year career. This time, he does not see a future in coal mining. "I don't look for the big call," said Mr. Hudson, who was laid off from the Mary Lee No. 1 Mine. "I don't think it is going to come this time."
Miners in this area had never before thought this way. If asked a few years ago, coal miners like Mr. Hudson would have responded that they would be in the mines until they died or until they retired.
Right now, however, Mr. Hudson, who is 46, said that he was satisfied to seek a new career outside the mines. Mr. Hudson is in a six-week training program for truck drivers and is a part-time tree trimmer to help supplement the income of his wife, Derry, who is an assistant supervisor at a day care center. "Financially, I miss it," Mr. Hudson said. "Coal miners made good money and they are going to have to make some adjustments. We are cutting back tremendously, but I'm going to bounce back because I'm a fighter."
This determination is expressed over and over again by the laid-off miners. Marc Lockhart is in the first, and probably only, layoff of his 17-year mining career.
"It is bad and it is hard," said Mr. Lockhart, who, since his layoff from Mary Lee No. 1, has turned to the ministry, becoming associate pastor of Old Mount Carmel Baptist Church. "For two days, I took it hard. I'm not going to tell you a story. I took it like a death in the family or something. It hurt."
Jefferson and Walker Counties were among the most heavily mined areas in Alabama, which ranks 13th in coal-producing states. Together, Jefferson and Walker Counties accounted for 62 percent of Alabama's coal supply, said Andrew Blumenfeld, a senior consultant at Resource Data International, which is a data base and consulting company for the coal and electric utility industries.
"It is a real devastating blow to the economy up there," said Jerry C. Ray, Alabama's Labor Commissioner whose office is in Montgomery. "It is not like this is 700 or 800 Wal-Mart jobs or Kentucky Fried Chicken jobs. These were $45,000-a-year jobs. It is going to be devastating."
Neal Capps, a 17-year veteran of underground mines, was the local president for the United Mine Workers of America. Every two weeks, Mr. Capps received about $1,000 after taxes. He is now making $180 a week on unemployment while he is training to become a truck driver.
Even when Mr. Capps finds employment as a truck driver, he will not be making what he did as a mine worker. "Mining was a good-paying job," Mr. Capps said. "Most of us are going to try to go to other occupations. I am going to truck driving. Big demand for drivers."
"I told some people, the Monday after we got the notice, I told them my wife and I have planned and worked and saved hard, and we have got enough to live off the rest of our lives, if we don't live over two months," Mr. Capps said. He said such jokes were necessary. "That's the only way you can take it."

HEADLINE: Brinkmanship in Atlantic City;
Tense Talks Behind a Casino Road and Tunnel Project

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The phone rang late in the afternoon last July 3, not long after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had returned to her office. She had just announced that New Jersey and Mirage Resorts had reached an agreement on building a $330 million road and tunnel that would speed casino goers to Mirage's planned Atlantic City resort.
The caller was Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman and chief executive of Mirage, complaining that Mrs. Whitman's announcement did not accurately reflect their agreement. If the terms were not changed, he warned, the deal was off. 
 Mrs. Whitman did not flinch. Instead, she told the casino mogul that he could either accept the terms she had announced -- which she insisted reflected their agreement -- or she would immediately issue a news release stating that there would be no partnership and no tunnel.
Apparently unhappy with the ultimatum, Mr. Wynn delivered a parting shot. "This is Steve Wynn," he announced over the speaker phone. "I don't accept this deal. Good night, ladies and gentleman."
But, according to one of the state employees in the room, neither called off the deal, instead agreeing later that night to go back to the table. And in January, they signed an agreement to build the road and tunnel. Still, the brinkmanship last July signaled how rough the negotiations over the next six months would be, as both sides struggled to coordinate their inherently disparate concerns.
With some 30,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in casino revenues on the line, the two sides fought over a wide range of issues, from the placement of a traffic light to cost overruns to the state's representative at the negotiating table.
The Mirage resort, with three casinos and 7,000 hotel rooms planned in the marina district, is part of Atlantic City's effort to transform itself from a gambling town for day travelers to a major vacation destination. The road and tunnel project would provide access to the marina district and improve other roadways around the city, including those that serve casinos by the boardwalk.
The pact is expected to clear the way for major growth, and developments are being watched throughout the nation by the casino industry.
Interviews with some of the participants in the talks offer rare details of how a state government and a large publicly traded company work out a deal. Each side wanted the highway project to go forward, but neither wanted to bear the ultimate responsibility for getting it built. While Mrs. Whitman fought to limit the taxpayers' cost, Mr. Wynn tried to limit his company's liability.
Both sides said they were pleased with the final agreement, but both had to accept more responsibility.
"Everybody's been beat up," Mr. Wynn said in a recent telephone interview. "This is the most complicated deal we've ever done." Mirage operates four casinos elsewhere, has two more under construction and had revenues of $1.5 billion in 1996.
Mr. Wynn has rarely commented publicly on the negotiations between Mirage and New Jersey. Nor has he discussed the fervent opposition to the project led by Donald J. Trump, the operator of three casinos in Atlantic City. In recent days, two more casino operators have sided with Mr. Trump and said that they also were concerned that the road plan served the area around Mr. Wynn's casino and neglected the casinos along the boardwalk.
Mr. Wynn has contended that his casino will attract more gamblers to Atlantic City, stimulating business for all the casino owners. Of Mr. Trump's opposition, Mr. Wynn said, "He's scared; he doesn't want the competition."
 
Cost Overruns Are Critical Issue
 The July 3 phone call by Mr. Wynn centered on who would pay for cost overruns. On a project of that size, contractors often run into unexpected problems and their costs go higher than anticipated.
Mrs. Whitman had announced that the agreement called for Mirage to serve as the developer and accept all responsibility for completing the project, including any excess costs. But Mr. Wynn contended that no such agreement had been reached. The Governor had "the wrong impression" about the agreement, Mr. Wynn said. "The fact that the Governor's staff did not have their arms around some of the parts, the very technical parts, confused them."
Mr. Wynn stayed in Las Vegas, Nev., for most of the talks, leaving Mirage's negotiating in Trenton to Richard Bronson, a former Connecticut developer who now heads the company's project development unit.
According to people involved in the talks, Mr. Bronson employed a classic good cop, bad cop strategy. Mr. Bronson would recount "these homespun 'aw shucks' stories about Steve Wynn and how Mr. Wynn has to see this project finished before he loses his eyesight," recalled one of the state's negotiators, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. (Mr. Wynn, 55, suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a debilitating eye disease that could severely reduce his vision or cause blindness.) "Then he'd leave, and his lawyers would start undoing everything," the state negotiator said. "They'd rewrite the language to undo the deal. We did that for months, back and forth."
But Mr. Bronson and Mr. Wynn contend that the state's negotiators slowed the talks. Mrs. Whitman's lead negotiator was Frank J. Wilson, who had managed transit systems in San Francisco and Chicago before he was appointed Transportation Commissioner by Mrs. Whitman in 1994. Facing pressure from Mr. Trump, Mr. Wilson often said his purpose was to build a highway that was "fair and equitable" to everyone in Atlantic City.
But Mr. Wilson's devotion to parity led the Mirage officials to accuse him of going overboard to accommodate Mr. Trump. "Wilson was sympathetic to the other side," Mr. Wynn complained recently.
Mr. Bronson said Mr. Wilson shared the details of their negotiations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Bronson said he thought this was unfair, since the talks were between the state and Mirage. "It was obvious to us," Mr. Bronson said. "We thought we had concurrence on items, and he would come back and change. Obviously, he was talking to someone in the Trump organization."
Mr. Trump confirmed in an interview that state officials showed him the plans before they were announced. "It was shown and negotiated with us," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Wilson, who recently left his job with the state, was reached at the private engineering firm where he now works, but he said he was prohibited by the firm's policy from discussing the negotiations conducted in his former position.
But Michael P. Torpey, the Governor's chief counsel, said it was important to discuss the talks with other casino owners. "This is not a project for Steve Wynn," Mr. Torpey said. "This is really a much larger economic development project."
One heated exchange between the negotiators took place last fall, when Mr. Wilson changed the highway plan, adding new cloverleafs, off ramps and traffic lights. The Mirage officials called the changes superfluous, and Mr. Bronson protested one of the traffic lights specifically, saying it would only create traffic jams.
 
A Stoplight Halts Negotiations
 According to Mr. Bronson, Mr. Wilson was in favor of the light as a less expensive solution to a traffic flow problem than additional ramps and highway. Since there were already traffic jams around the other casinos, Mr. Bronson recalled, Mr. Wilson reasoned that it was only fair that there be traffic jams around the Mirage. " 'That's for parity,' " he quoted Mr. Wilson as saying. " 'I want to even it up."
Mr. Bronson said he responded: "Who asked you to do that? Trump?"
To which, he recalled, Mr. Wilson said, "I resent that."
Mr. Bronson then stormed from the room and called Mr. Wynn in Las Vegas. The dispute over the traffic light went on for three weeks, until it was finally removed from the plans, Mr. Wynn said. "I'm sitting in Las Vegas, saying, 'What the hell is going on in good old New Jersey,' " Mr. Wynn recalled.
On at least one occasion, Mr. Wynn did fly to New Jersey, where he met the Governor at Drumthwacket, the executive mansion in Princeton. "I complained about why it had taken so long," Mr. Wynn said. "I said, 'Please give us someone who will take this to closure.' "
Mr. Bronson said he also complained to the Governor about Mr. Wilson. "Wilson would set up a meeting at 1, and he'd come sauntering in at 3 P.M.," Mr. Bronson charged. "It was obvious we were not going to get this thing done with Wilson."
Mrs. Whitman responded by putting two new staff members in charge of the talks: Mr. Torpey and Richard S. Mroz, who oversees state authorities.
Mr. Wilson, meanwhile, was preparing to leave for his new job and was preoccupied with accusations of conflict of interest over a discussion of employment opportunities with a company seeking to do business with the state.
Mr. Wynn contended that the change in negotiators led to the agreement. "One week after he left, it got done," Mr. Wynn said.
One of the major issues worked out in the final days was the cost overruns. The two sides had earlier agreed that Mirage would be the lead developer because a private company could avoid the onerous bid processes required for the state.
Mr. Wynn, who wanted the highway completed in time to open his casino in two to three years, went along with the arrangement, but fought accepting the responsibility that a developer normally assumes. "We don't build roads," said. "We're not the State of New Jersey."
To compromise, the two sides have said they agreed to pass the responsibility for cost overruns to the general contractor, which the developer must find. A general contractor, however, has not been selected, and the January agreement avoids discussing cost overruns, which could reach millions of dollars.
The agreement does stipulate that the state will be liable for no more than $220 million and Mirage for no more than $110 million. "We got our bottom line," Mr. Torpey said. "The Governor has always said the state would not be responsible for cost overruns."
But some critics of the deal said they did not see how a contractor could hold costs to $330 million and still build the road as planned. Even Mr. Torpey sounded uncertain about what would happen if the project ended up costing more. "At this point, it's contemplated the contractor will be responsible," he said.
As for the seemingly ambiguous resolution to the issue, Mr. Wynn said, "The state didn't give a damn, as long as they weren't on the hook, and we didn't give a damn as long as we weren't on the hook."
 
State Accepts More Responsibility
 In those final days, however, the state did accept more financial risk. It agreed to pay $4.5 million for highway plans that are now being developed -- an amount that could be lost if either side backs out before the transaction is completed in July. Mirage was also given the right to end the partnership if the state has trouble putting up its share of the money. The state would then be responsible for all expenses Mirage paid up to that point.
Mirage also insisted on having the South Jersey Transportation Authority sign the agreement. The authority, which runs the Atlantic City Expressway, will sell bonds to raise $60 million of the $220 million in state funds for the project. The bonds are to be repaid with the increased expressway toll receipts anticipated as a result of the Mirage resort. But to sell the bonds, the authority itself would probably have to guarantee investors that the project would be finished -- a guarantee that could leave the authority on the hook for additional costs. Authority officials recently said that the 25-cent toll on the expressway might have to be raised for the first time since 1969 as a result of financing the project.
Mr. Wynn insisted that he did not gain any advantage in the negotiations. The Governor "stuck to her guns," he said. He conceded, however, that any perception that the Governor folded during negotiations will provide fodder to those who opposed the project in the first place. "This was a learning experience for all of us," he said. "And a complex one."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "What's at Stake"
A road and tunnel project would provide access to Mirage Resorts' Casino and improve access to other. Will it make Atlantic City a routist destination? Will taxpayers benefit from the revenues or foot the bill for a developer?
 
STEPHEN A. WYNN -- He wants to be a major player in another major casino center and push as many of the development costs as he can onto taxpayers.
 
GOV. CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN -- She can't appear to be caving in to business interests. But she also doesn't want to lose the jobs, tourism and tax dollars more casinos would bring.
 
DONALD J. TRUMP -- Mr. Wynn's arrival will have to share Atlantic City's limelight -- and profits. And he says that Mr. Wynn's casino is getting too many taxpayer benefits. (pg. 29)

Negotiating icicles the size of trees, winter climbers had a hard enough time scaling the blue ice cliffs of Bridal Veil Falls without worrying about the police.
"The first time I tried this, I left with cuffs on," Joe Melley, a professional ice climber, said, recalling his two arrests for illegally climbing this old mining town's landmark in winter. "This time it was sweet, no paranoia." 
 In Telluride, where men used to risk their lives mining gold and silver, it became legal this winter for men and women to risk their lives climbing the 360-foot-high frozen falls at the east end of this town's box canyon. Off-limits ever since the first ascent two decades ago, the frozen waterfall was opened to climbers after lengthy negotiations exempted the land owners, the Iderado Mining Company, of any liability.
In a society where risk is systematically removed from work and play, high-risk, or "extreme" sports are gaining followers. Here in the southern Rockies, this Victorian mining town, long a center for conventional downhill skiing, has become a center for these high-risk sports: ice climbing, rock climbing, parasailing and wilderness skiing.
"Extreme sports make for a better society," argued Eric R. Jacobson, who leases the falls for a hydroelectric plant and was a party to the legal pact that opened them to climbing. "The experience of ice climbing gives you the feeling that you can control your own destiny -- and that improves the citizenry."
Stephen B. Johnson, a Telluride lawyer who worked for four years to win a winter easement for ice climbers here, said: "As rock climbing gets more popular, climbers want to go to higher, harder and wilder places."
"Climbers are attracted to the danger," said Mr. Johnson, ebullient after his first ascent of Bridal Veil Falls, in mid-February.
Roughly half a million Americans now rock climb, according to the Access Fund, a nonprofit climbing group that helped to negotiate the system of liability waivers and exemptions that opened up Telluride's forbidden ice. To keep in shape, and to keep the adrenaline pumping in winter, a growing minority of rock climbers have taken up ice climbing, which can be more physically and technically challenging.
"My friends who are ice climbers complain all the time that there are so many people on the cliffs," said Sally Moser, executive director of the Fund, which has 7,000 members nationwide. Based in Boulder, Colo., this climbing association is to have its annual convention, or "climbers' rendezvous," here in late May.
Much the way that snowmobiling has breathed new life into rural communities from Maine to Michigan, ice climbing now provides a year-round economy to Ouray, an old mining town on the far side of Black Bear Pass from here. Without a ski area, Ouray used to live off summer tourists who came for a scenic railroad that winds through the Rockies.
Four years ago, climbers worked out liability problems with local owners, then ran the overflow from a town reservoir through half a mile of plastic piping with an array of spigots along a mountain ridge. The result was Ice Park, a challenging ice mass that offers 70 ascent routes from a base parking lot next to a state highway.
"Ice climbers now account for more than half of our business," said Bill Whitt, an owner of one of the largest hotels in town, the Ouray Victorian Inn. "Ice climbers have jobs and money to spend. We get very few bottom feeders -- people who come and climb, and then sleep in their cars."
Making ice the way ski areas make snow, Ouray held an Ice Festival in January, attracting about 500 ice climbers and an additional 300 curious.
Here in Telluride, a main stop on the way to the ice is Telluride Mountaineer, a shop festooned with climbing hardware, including ropes, crampons, pitons and carabiners.
"It's becoming more mainstream to go ice climbing," said Cris Ann Crysdale, a saleswoman who climbs in her spare time. "In the past, it was only the hard-core macho men. Now all kinds of women are being involved in it. Not just being dragged up there by their boyfriends, but leading groups."
Although there have been no known accidents on Bridal Veil Falls, risk and danger are major attractions, Ms. Crysdale said.
On her first attempt on the Falls a few years ago, a snowcat vehicle approached below and a man bellowed through a megaphone, ordering her party to descend. By the time they reached the base of the falls, an avalanche had swept away the caterpillar tracks of the snowcat.
"The danger of falling ice is the biggest danger," Ms. Crysdale said, recalling a friend's aborted ascent of the falls last December. "He climbed the first pitch, had a bad feeling about the ice, and went back down. That night a huge, 50-foot chunk of ice broke off on the second pitch."
Beyond the usual hazards, Bridal Veil offers a special risk for climbers who stray off approved routes.
On a recent afternoon, as powder snow harmlessly cascaded down high mountain chutes, Mr. Jacobson pointed out that the Bridal Veil ice is created by the outflow of his hydropower plant, perched atop the falls, which supplies Telluride's electricity. Power cables, sheathed in metal, run alongside the falls, in an out-of-bounds area. But like the rest of the falls, they are encased in ice.
"We have notified people that the power lines are there," Mr. Jacobson said. "But if someone hammered it with an ice ax, or screwed into it with an ice augur, there is no telling that the metal conduit would resist."

HEADLINE: Keeping Human Contact in Economics Isn't a Renegade View;
The Popcorn Puzzle

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alan Ehrenhalt's Op-Ed article of Feb. 23 uses one of our papers to attack the methodology of modern economics. We are accused of ignoring the "common-sense" truth that the price of concessions at movies is irrelevant, and that "all that really matters is the movie being shown and the location of the theater." If Mr. Ehrenhalt is right, what prevents movie theaters from charging twice what they currently charge? 
 If the admission price matters, is it not common sense that the cost of popcorn and other concessions, which can easily exceed the cost of admission, also matters? Popcorn in theaters is expensive not because that is "the price of leisure-time social harmony," but because it is a form of price discrimination that can be practiced even by competitive companies.

Court Backs Law to End Mob Control of Garbage

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court has given its approval to a new law aimed at eliminating what it called a black hole in New York City's economic life: the mob-controlled garbage collection industry.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the law permitting the city to regulate the garbage collection industry was "narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling governmental interest in terminating 40 years of criminal control of the carting industry in New York City." 
 The ruling upheld a decision last year in which Judge Milton Pollack of the United States District Court in Manhattan found that regulation of the garbage collection industry fell within the traditional powers of the police.
The appeals court rejected a legal challenge by 256 local carters who said that the law violated privacy and also denied due process because the commission can end licenses without a hearing.
The three-judge panel said in its unanimous decision that the Constitution did not permit a blanket prohibition against joining a trade association with both lawful and illegal goals. But it added that an association could not be shielded from "government action taken to root out the illegal activity."
"This targeted criminal cartel is a black hole in New York City's economic life," the court said.
The law was enacted after an indictment alleged that a mob-controlled cartel dominated the business and stole $500 million a year in inflated costs from city businesses. It requires haulers to reapply for licenses and disclose company finances and finances of close relatives of the company owners.

HEADLINE: Doctors Withhold H.I.V. Pill Regimen From Some

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG and LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Tyeisha Ross, an 18-year-old who has H.I.V., is street smart but childishly innocent. She does not understand the full import of the virus that she carries, believing that it requires only a "minor adjustment" in her everyday life. So she often misses doctor's appointments and fails to take medications.
Through her Medicaid coverage, Ms. Ross, who lives in the Bronx, can afford the costly new drugs that might halt her progress toward AIDS. But her doctor will not prescribe them to her. She does not think that Ms. Ross can handle a complex drug-taking regimen, in which missing doses could have serious consequences, making her virus resistant to future treatment. 
 "I don't trust her ability to stick to a schedule," said Dr. Jeanne Carey, a physician at Beth Israel Medical Center's H.I.V. clinic in Manhattan.
With the early successes of drug cocktails built on a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors, national concern has focused on whether their high cost puts them out of the reach of many AIDS patients. But in New York State, which has the most comprehensive drug assistance program in the nation, everyone is covered for the new AIDS drugs.
But not everyone can get them. And cost is not the deciding factor; doctors are. Since the exacting regimen for taking the new drugs taxes even the most stable patients, many doctors do not want to prescribe them to those, like Ms. Ross, with chaotic lives and a poor record of taking care of themselves. (There are no statistics on how often doctors withhold the drugs. )
The doctors maintain that poor compliance with the drug-taking regimen could not only spell disaster for an individual patient, but also create a potential public health risk through the spread of a virus resistant to many drugs.
So, as the gatekeepers for a life-prolonging drug therapy, the doctors who treat people with H.I.V. are walking daily through a minefield of ethical, legal and public health concerns. And with the drugs theoretically available to all, AIDS experts see New York as a kind of laboratory for developing an ethical medical approach free of economic concerns.
"It's become a really loaded situation with profound implications, unlike anything I've ever seen in medicine," Dr. Howard A. Grossman, a Manhattan internist with a large AIDS practice, said. "Doctors are making assumptions about who can handle this and who can't, which inevitably brings a lot of prejudices to the surface. And for the individual patients, the stakes are very high -- if not life or death, then at least prolonged life and postponed death."
Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, the head of the infectious diseases division at Harlem Hospital Center, said the decision to prescribe the new cocktails, or mixtures, grows from the unusually intimate relationship between an AIDS doctor and patient. "We're not picking and choosing," she said. "It's a dynamic."
But Dr. Bruce D. Agins, the State Health Department's chief AIDS doctor, said the state was "very concerned about people being denied access to the drugs in a wholesale way because they belong to a category of people, like junkies."
And indeed, in New York City, patient advocates believe that this is occurring, particularly at busy, nonspecialized clinics.
"It is definitely happening," Beth Barusek, planning director for the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan, said. "There is frustration on the part of social workers, case managers and such because they know some doctors won't prescribe to people who are drug users."
About a third of the H.I.V.-infected patients covered under the state's $100 million AIDS Drug Assistance Program -- 3,262 people -- are taking the protease inhibitors. The program covers uninsured patients.
About a quarter of Medicaid-covered H.I.V. patients -- 11,540 -- were taking the drugs as of September, the last month for which there are statistics. But that number is likely to have risen by now.
There are no comparable numbers for private patients, but many AIDS doctors in New York City say that at least 75 percent of their patients are taking protease inhibitors. (That a patient is not taking the drug does not mean that a doctor has decided to withhold it; the treatment is not right for everyone, and some refuse it.)
Many doctors say they have an ethical responsibility to withhold the drug cocktails from some patients after judging them, not as people, but rather as compliant or noncompliant patients. Others, however, believe that no patient should be deprived the chance to prove himself up to the task of taking them.
"I don't think we have a right or a scientific background to exclude anyone as a general rule," said Dr. Charles Carpenter, chairman of the National Institutes of Health panel that is writing guidelines for the use of AIDS drugs. "I have been astonished by how many people, including those who are using IV drugs, have been able to stick to the regimen. I don't think we can tell a good or bad candidate in advance."
Medical ethicists, who have been giving the new issue much thought, say that the morally defensible approach is to consider everyone a candidate for the drugs, be they illegal drug users, adolescents, homeless people or psychiatric patients.
"The presumption should be that everyone is eligible, to lessen the likelihood of discrimination against entire classes of people," said Dr. Ruth Macklin, a bioethics professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. "After all, the history of medical judgments on who may or may not receive scarce or expensive treatment is a very sorry history."

A Doctor's Decision
Searching for Clues In a Patient's Past
In a brightly lighted cubbyhole at a Beth Israel clinic, Dr. Carey tracks the tumultuous lives of 180 H.I.V.-infected patients. She effectively sits in judgment of them, deciding who gets access to the new drugs.
For a young doctor, it is an awesome responsibility. But Dr. Carey, 32, says she is comfortable with the role. She says she prescribes the protease inhibitors to about 40 percent of her patients and withholds them from about 5 percent.
The way she came to decide that Ms. Ross was not a good candidate for the treatment provides a glimpse into one doctor's thinking.
Dr. Carey first met Ms. Ross in October, and liked her immediately, although it was quickly clear she would be a difficult patient.
Ms. Ross has dreams of big things in her future: a fabulous house, a flush savings account and, chillingly for one surrounded by illness, a career as an undertaker. She contracted the virus through unprotected sex, she said. Her mother, too, has H.I.V.
Ms. Ross had a difficult childhood. While her mother used drugs and was in prison, she shuttled between an aunt's home and foster care. When her mother got breast cancer, Ms. Ross dropped out of 12th grade.
Dr. Carey says a patient's past behavior is a guide to future behavior, so she took time to get to know Ms. Ross. "I didn't make a decision right away," Dr. Carey said. And she did not tell Ms. Ross much about the new drugs.
Since Ms. Ross started seeing Dr. Carey, she has missed six appointments and kept three. And she has become pregnant. During the last 15 weeks, while considering an abortion, she has not regularly taken the prescribed prenatal vitamins or AZT.
Ms. Ross did not press for information about the new drugs. And she concurred with her doctor's assessment of her as "irresponsible."
"I'm the type of person who, when I'm ready to get up and go, I'll get up and go, and so I don't think about taking medications," she said.

A Treatment's Rigors
Lives Are Rebuilt To Fit the Drugs
To follow the debate over the new AIDS drug cocktails, it helps to understand the regimen.
The typical $15,000 to $20,000-a-year cocktail generally combines a protease inhibitor with older antiviral drugs like AZT. The protease inhibitor blocks a key viral enzyme called protease, and the older drugs block a different enzyme. Together, the multiple-drug assault on the virus prevents its replication.
Many AIDS patients also take a host of other medications to treat or prevent related infections.
This amounts to a dizzying pill-popping schedule. Every day must be choreographed to coordinate such basic activities as working, eating and sleeping with the consumption of a score of pills and liters of water. (Dr. Grossman has a patient who takes 72 pills daily.)
Some drugs require fasting; others must be taken with high-fat meals. Some are taken once a day, some twice and some three times.
"It is a rigorous treatment routine that wreaks havoc on already difficult lives," said Dr. Roy Gulick, an AIDS doctor and researcher at Bellevue Hospital Center and the New York University School of Medicine.
Julio Torres, who swallows 16 pills a day in his Bronx apartment, said it took him months to devise a schedule that did not leave him hungry. Now he starts his day with a protease inhibitor, washed down with several glasses of water. Then he has to wait an hour for breakfast.
Between breakfast and lunch, he takes three more pills, and he must eat lunch by 2 P.M. so his stomach can be empty enough for his next protease inhibitor dose at 4:30 P.M. Then he must eat dinner by 6 P.M. to have a full stomach for the next round of drugs. His final challenge is to stay awake to take his last protease inhibitor at 12:30 A.M.
"It's a good thing I can actually feel it prolonging my life, because the whole thing is so hard, especially with H.I.V., which makes you really forgetful," Mr. Torres said.
For some patients who are not sick, the drugs are also an unwelcome, unending reminder -- with side effects like nausea, diarrhea and kidney stones -- that they have H.I.V.
"It can make me really sad, especially when I'm swallowing away with my grandson on my lap," said Deborah Gordon, 43, a Brooklyn resident who has H.I.V. but has been asymptomatic for 11 years. "Without all the pill taking, maybe I could forget once in a while that I had it. But I'm taking it for a real good reason."
The pharmaceutical companies say that orthodox compliance is necessary to avert resistance to the drugs: there should be no missed doses or even doses taken at the wrong time. Any number of factors, from an unplanned nap to a bout of depression, can throw off a routine.
"The million dollar question is how many doses can you miss before it matters," Dr. Gulick said. "At what point does the virus rebound, and at what point do you become resistant?"
If a patient's life is complicated by poverty, homelessness or drug abuse, the situation is that much more complex:
How does a patient with little money for food manage to fill his stomach sufficiently for certain medications?
Where does a homeless patient store pills that need refrigeration?
How does someone without a watch keep track of time?
How does a patient high on illegal drugs remember to take his Crixivan?
"I know guys who are caught up with their addictions, and they're taking these new drugs and doing their old drugs," said Eddie Ramos, 36, a counselor for homeless men who has AIDS, used to be homeless and is taking the new drugs.
"And they're missing doses, definitely."
Looking to the medical community's experience with tuberculosis, doctors and AIDS advocates have debated whether it would be feasible to start a program in which pill-taking would be observed at clinics. But the quantity of pills and the complexity of the routine would make it much more cumbersome than with tuberculosis.
"We've actually thought of a kind of adult day care, where you can offer a whole plate of services while overseeing someone's drug regimen," said Jeanne Bergman, senior policy analyst for Housing Works, a service and advocacy group for people with H.I.V. and AIDS. "But the tricky thing would be getting people to volunteer to something that approximates self-inflicted house arrest."

A Patient's Surprise
Life-or-Death Fight Turns a Life Around
 Doctors have long known that patients do not religiously comply with most medication regimens. They point to studies that indicate that even physicians do not complete a full, 10-day course of antibiotics, or that patients prescribed medication for chronic hypertension take it only about half of the time.
Still, some AIDS doctors say that past studies do not apply. To their astonishment, patients who did not take their AZT three times a day are somehow managing a stringent regimen built on a triple-drug cocktail that they could be taking for the rest of their lives.
Some doctors think, then, that everyone should be given the benefit of the doubt and started on the regimen. In very little time, they say, it will become evident who cannot handle it. "Certainly there are people who have failed to stick to the regimen, and they have dropped it," said Dr. Carpenter, half of whose patients have a history of intravenous drug use. "But you just cannot tell in advance."
With this drug regimen, AIDS patients often see quick results that change not only their attitude but their behavior: the virus becomes undetectable in their blood, or they actually start feeling better.
Mr. Torres is a touching example. Most of his friends had died; his immune system was essentially shut down and he had lost 75 pounds. He stopped seeing Dr. Gulick and stopped taking any medication. Panicked, Mr. Torres's friends called Dr. Gulick and said that they wanted to get him started on protease inhibitors. Despite Mr. Torres's track record, Dr. Gulick gambled that his friends would help him cope and that the powers of the medication would spur him on.
"Now he's like a poster child for protease inhibitors," Dr. Gulick said. Mr. Torres has regained 40 pounds, and the virus is undetectable in his blood.
"I was just sort of fading away," Mr. Torres said. "And now, well, I'm back."

Doctors are deciding that some people should not have access to new AIDS drugs because of complex drug regimen to which HIV and AIDS patients must adhere. Failure to stick to the strict schedule could make the virus resistant to treatment and cause a apotential health risk by creating drug-resistant strains of the disease. Chart shows how a patient, Julio Torres, described his daily medication schedule. (pg. 35)

HEADLINE: Sewing: 30 Million Women Can't Be Wrong

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
LAUREN HUTTON sews. So do Mary Alice Williams and Deborah Norville, the news anchors. Daphne Maxwell Reid, best known for her role on the 1987-88 television series "Frank's Place," wears her own handiwork when she and her husband, Tim Reid, attend the Emmy Awards.
"I like things to be in my color, fitting me the way I like," Ms. Reid said last week from her home in Charlottesville, Va. She was working on two home-sew projects: a "very, very yellow" gabardine double-breasted jacket and a blue-and-black silk suit from a Vogue pattern. Why sew when she can easily afford a designer dress? "This is how I relax, how I create," Ms. Reid said. 
 Once, home sewing was perceived as so resolutely unmodern as to be an affront to the freedom of women. It was archaic, time consuming and fraught with economic distinctions: the poor sewed, the rich bought.
Today, nearly one-third of the country's adult female population -- more than 30 million women, mostly college educated, between ages 24 and 54 -- are revving up their sewing machines, reports the American Home Sewing and Craft Association, a trade organization. (The number of sewing-skilled men, it seems, is too insignificant to tabulate, perhaps because male-oriented patterns are largely limited to chinos, vests and Bermuda shorts.)
In 1992, for the last Census of Retail Trade conducted by the Commerce Department, $5.1 billion was spent on sewing and related supplies, up 21.4 percent from $4.2 billion in 1987. And for the last few years, "the home sewing industry has been increasing 3 to 5 percent a year," said Louis Morris, the chief executive of the Simplicity Pattern Company, which offers 700 to 800 patterns a year.
In these days of outlet shopping, practicality seems to have little to do with all this thread-and-bobbin activity.
"We've found that sewing to save money is No. 3 or 4 on the list of whys," said Beth Mauro, the director of the American Home Sewing and Craft Association, pointing out that the cost of a dress made from a pattern can run into hundreds of dollars, depending on fabric. "The primary reason is relaxation." Another: for styles in sizes and colors that women say they cannot find in stores and that can be created in a couple of hours on the latest computer-enhanced sewing machines.
Faith Popcorn, the consumer-trends oracle who ennobled yuppie couch potatoes in the late 1980's by coining the word "cocooning" for their stay-at-home ways, sees home sewing as an example of the thoroughly 90's do-it-yourself creativity she calls "egonomics."
"Just say the words 'home sewing,' and you get all warm and runny and cozy and fuzzy inside," said Ms. Popcorn, who in her 1996 book "Clicking" (HarperCollins) anoints home sewing as hip and hot. "The popular idea was that you had to be poor to sew your own clothes. That's just not the case. A lot of women went out to work and found it wasn't so much fun, and they started to romanticize what their grandmothers and great-aunts did, back when things like sewing and arranging flowers were valued talents."
In tribute to all this, the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan has mounted "Dreams on Paper," an exhibition on the history of home sewing, which opened on Tuesday and runs through April 19. Featured are modern and antique sewing machines, more than a century of home-sewn garments (including one of the identical gowns worn at the Unification Church's 1983 mass wedding at Madison Square Garden), and some of the more than 30,000 patterns left to the museum by Betty Williams, a costume designer, who died last June.
The show is being co-sponsored by American Home Sewing and a Mount Rushmore of pattern makers: Simplicity, McCall's and Butterick.
The catalogues published by these companies almost monthly are the sewer's bibles. Any weekday morning, the basement pattern department of Paterson Silks, a three-floor fabric shop on Union Square, is packed with women flipping through the latest volumes.
"They like to be original," Lynette Vincent, a saleswoman, said of her customers as she searched a file cabinet for an Issey Miyake pattern of a coat that makes the wearer look like a quilt-wrapped caterpillar. "We get a lot of students from the Parsons School of Design. They buy the more difficult patterns, the designer ones."
Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Nicole Miller, Claude Montana, Karl Lagerfeld, Anna Sui, Isaac Mizrahi, Oscar de la Renta and Geoffrey Beene all now transform selected designs into patterns six months after runway presentation.
While Calvin Klein's Jackie-O-style sheaths are a novice's dream, Carolina Herrera's evening gowns are astoundingly complicated. But challenge seems to be part of the attraction.
"The difficult ones are like putting together a jigsaw puzzle," said Daphne Maxwell Reid, who produces a signature line of clothing patterns for Simplicity as well as a video called "Suddenly, You're Sewing."
IN the beginning, patterns were the domain of tailors and dressmakers; everyone else had to use available clothing as a model. But by the middle of the 19th century, patterns became a pivotal element in American fashion, thanks to Ebenezer Butterick, who introduced paper patterns in graded sizes in 1864.
"First was the rise of the sewing machine as an affordable domestic appliance," said Dorothy Twining Globus, the director of the F.I.T. museum. "Second came the fashion magazines, which were published by dress-pattern companies to push their products. And third was that the American postal system became an effective nationwide system by the third quarter of the century.
"Suddenly," she continued, "every woman in America had the opportunity to sew the kind of relatively complex, fashionable clothes she couldn't get at her local store or afford even if they were there."
The home-sewing industry didn't begin to wane until the middle of the 1960's, a decline precipitated by the fading of its former economic imperative and by the increasing popularity of egalitarian fashion choices."Blue jeans did it, basically," Mrs. Globus said. Then there was the snob factor: in the designer-mad 80's, homemade clothes were anathema, no matter how finely wrought.
In the early 90's, sewing began to reclaim its prestige, in part because of the project-oriented climate championed by the likes of Martha Stewart Living. In that magazine's February issue, "Sewing 101," a four-page primer, illuminates everything from securing a loose button to the anatomy of a sewing machine.
Technological advances are also attracting new converts. "There are machines out there so advanced that you don't even have to thread the needle," said Ms. Mauro of the craft association. Indeed, computerized sewing machines have lessened the number of hours it takes to embellish clothing with special stitches, monograms and embroidery.
The Swiss company Bernina manufactures what aficionados regard as the Ferrari of sewing machines. Consider the price: the average machine costs around $1,000. Bernina's top-of-the-line model, the 1630, has a suggested retail price of $3,799.
For that, there are enough features to transform a kitchen table into couture central. Thanks to a plethora of computer chips and programmable memory banks, the 1630 offers 70 stitch patterns, eight buttonholes, four alphabets and customized monograms. It is also PC compatible: connect it to a personal computer loaded with Bernina software, draw a design on the screen with the mouse, and the sewing machine translates it into stitchery.
Such advances, however, fail to impress some experienced home sewers. "The sewing part's easy," Teresa Sierra, a Manhattan housing-rights advocate, said recently as she studied a Butterick catalogue at Paterson Silks. "It's the cutting out that takes so much time. I could make this in four hours for maybe $30 or $40," she said, pointing to a cocktail dress. "I can't afford $350 for a dress from the store. And anyway, I'm a plus size. So there isn't much out there to buy that's good looking."
THE production of accurately sized patterns has also become increasingly sophisticated. Most pattern sizes are based on Government standards set in the 1940's. But Sew Fast Sew Easy, a sewing center in midtown Manhattan, offers basic patterns that can be computer tailored to customers' bodies and used as foundations for fanciful personal creations, effectively transforming the home sewer into a couturier.
Prepackaged patterns offer similar opportunities. "You can take the top of one dress and combine it with the skirt of another," Mrs. Sierra said. She shrugged and laughed. "I like it all. Basically, it's a lot of fun."
It's also therapeutic. According to a 1995 study sponsored by the craft association, sewing reduces three stress indicators: heart rate, blood pressure and perspiration rate. "When I sew, I don't smoke, I don't eat, I don't think about anything that bothers me," Mrs. Sierra said. "All I do is focus."
Laura Plimpton, a photography stylist who lives in Weston, Conn., uses her three Bernina machines to make clothes for her daughter, Sophie Herbert, 12, and her younger son, Charlie Plimpton, 4 1/2.
"It saves me a lot of money, which is how I rationalize it, but it's primarily because I'm fast and good at it," Ms. Plimpton said as she cut out a short-sleeve cotton blouse for her daughter. "It gives me great satisfaction to see something I made."
This can-do attitude could be genetic: she is Martha Stewart's younger sister.
Ms. Stewart, for her part, recalled that her first sewing project, as a seventh grader in Miss Baer's class in Nutley, N.J., was "a basic white blouse: buttons, collar, inset sleeves, facings, buttonholes, everything. I wish I still had it." She paused. "Mine was perfect, of course."
At Junior High School 56 on the Lower East Side, Roni Elovitch, a home-economics teacher, is doing her part to pass the sewing torch to the younger generation. She teaches the boys by handing them a McCall's pattern for boxer shorts and setting them in front of one of the school's 25-year-old Singer machines.
"Initially, they don't love it and complain they'd rather be in metal shop," Mrs. Elovitch said. "But just wait. In 10 years, they won't remember what problems they solved in math, but where they learned to sew on a button? That they'll remember."

HEADLINE: An American Exile in America

BYLINE: By Vivian Gornick; Vivian Gornick is the aurhor of "Approaching Eye Level," a collection of personal essays.

 BODY:
Naomi Wallace is an Amerian playwright whose work has gone largely unproduced in America, her plays routinely described as "strong but political," whereas in England she has had four major productions in as many years, with a striking amount of critical attention awarded each of them. Last year, however, her newest play, "One Flea Spare," was the consensus hit at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Ky. Now, having won a raft of awards, it is set to open next Sunday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York, with Dianne Wiest in the lead role. Wallace is finally about to be discovered by her compatriots - although some of them have known for years that recognition at home was foregone conclusion.
 
 In England, Wallace has been widely repsonded to. Her adaptation of William Wharton's "Birdy" is opening this week in the West End, and a film script she wrote, "Lawn Dogs," has been produced in Britain and will be released this year. Wallace has also had a book of her poetry published in, yes, Britain and not yet in the United States. But her four plays - not only political but often imbued with an almost otherworldly sexuality - are what have made her reputation abroad. It is previsely that blend of politics and sexuality, laced with relentlessly lyrical writing, that seems to have made her welcome in Britain and a stranger in her homeland.
 In "The War Boys," Wallace's first play, three young men are hunting illegal immigrants on the Texas-Mexico border for bounty. The second, "In the Heart of America," concerns a pair of gay marines who get caught in the internal viciousness of the gulf war. In the third, "Slaughter City," a strike is taking place in a meat-packing plant. In "One Flea Spare" (the title comes from a John Donne poem), a group of Londoners, low and high, are quarantined together during the 1665 plague. Each of the plays is set against a piece of social realism, but none of the plays are presented realistically. All are made to serve a language, rich and poetic, that is associative and dreamlike, often surreal and in every case haunted by history.
 History is what exciteds her, history and politics. "Politics is history," Wallace says, "and history is what sparks my imagination. That's where my fire comes from. For me, politics and art can never be divided. Once you see that politics affects our daily lives - our loves, our desires, our needs - that's terribly exciting." She knows that this is not a fashionable way to approach the making of art. "But it's my way," say says, and her intelligent, serious face breaks up unexpectedly. "Hey, listen," she grins, "whatever stirs your soup."
 Tony Kushner, whose "Angels in America" seems to have led the way to a resurgence of serious, often political playwriting ("Political Theater Is Alive," page 30), has been a champion of Wallace's since 1990. "I was doing a one-week stint at the playwriting program at the Iowa Playwrights' Workshop," he says. "The students were all O.K., smart, talented, some of them better than O.K. And then there was Naomi. I'd given them all this theory, Marx and modern drama - you know, that stuff doesn't go over well in playwriting courses. She not only loved it, went right for it, she already knew a lot of it. I remember thinking, 'Who is this?'
 "She gave me 'War Boys' to read, and I was blown away. The power of language in it! And the way she thought, the things she was thinking about." Kushner laughs at the recollection. "I said to myself: 'Now, take it slow. Dont's overwhelm her.' Then she walked into class the next day and I gushed: 'This is one of the most astonishing play by a student I've ever read.' I came back to New York and took her play to may agent. I said to her: 'This woman is going to be big someday. Please read her play and take her on.' And she did. Naomi's language bowled her over, too."
 NAOMI WALLACE WAS BORN 36 YEARS ago on a farm in Kentucky to a son of the gentleman-farmer class who had once been a Time-Life reporter and a vigorous Dutch mother who had once been a member of the Netherlands' Communist Party. Wallace has been marching in protest parades since age 8, which made it exciting to go to Washington but not so easy to stay home.
 The Wallace farm was set in a conservative area outside Louisville where independent-minded politics was not welcome. Naomi's grandfather, Tom Wallace, had been the editor in chief of The Louisville Courier-Journal, and when Naomi was growing up, her parents were considered radicals. Inevitably, the Wallace children became social oddities in the neighborhood.
 Life inside the family was complicated as well. Naomi's mother, and artist, was a city girl from a working-class family who was alarmed to find herself rearing five children on a farm in Kentucky. She made so many trips back to Amsterdam that the marriage ended in divorce and with her return to the Netherlands.
 Ill at ease almost everywhere, Naomi hung around the only people she felt at home with - her neighbors, the children of the rural poor. She spent all her time after school inside the houses of kids whose parents were sometimes farmhands, sometimes mechanics, sometimes unemployed. She ate what they ate and drank what they drank. She shopped with them and she danced with them. She listened to the rhythms of their speech, heard their secret thoughts and marveled at how both got put into stories. They had a habit of turning every small event into a story so wonderfully told that it was like listening to poetry.
 Wht she saw and felt and heard among the rural poor in Kentucky 25 years ago entered into her: the poverty, the richness of language, the peculiar grace of hard-worked lives. Hardworked and going nowhere. She knew even then that she would get out, and that most of them would not. When she looked in the mirror, she saw a face that looked just like the faces all around her. What made the difference?
 "Class," she says quietly, matter-of-factly, over a plate of Indian food in Iowa City, where she lives with her husband, who teaches literature at the University of Iowa, and their three daughters. "It's all a matter of class." The class she came from, she explains, invited her into her own mind; the class her firends came from not only didn't invite them into theirs, but did everything it could to keep them out and break them down. Her expression is intent as she speaks, the forkful of food in her hand forgotten midway to her mouth.
 Wallace is thin and angular, somewhat raw-boned, with a thatch of cropped black hair that frames a long, narrow face and a manner strongly marked by a kind of reserve common to country people. The reserve makes her face in repose very nearly inexpressive - the eyes opaque, the features immobile. But ask a questions, elicit an opinion, and the impassivity instantly collapses into an unbroken flow of speech. During the two days I visited Wallace in Iowa the conversation was constant and without closure. It consisted entirely of a discussion - focused and urgent - not of how her plays get put together, but of the ideas and experiences out of which they grow. It's not so much that Wallace thinks about politics all the time as that she is continually registering its consequences on the lives of all the people she knows.
 "I don't know why everyone doesn't see this," she says. "We live in a culture where social forces are so present. They make us what we are. As an artist, how can I ignore what has created us?"
 "The system" is a reality for her, and inevitably, perhaps even reluctantly, she rates the people she knows according to how responsive they are to the meaning of politics in ordinary life. At one point I idly asked her is she like her father. She turned the question over in her mind (as with every question I asked) and then, with her usual quiet reserve, said: "I think he must be a good man. Two of his daughters are gay. That can't be easy for him." Her face lighted up. "But he marches in the parades." She likes him because he's a good man. He's a good man because he resonates to social injustice.
 This is home-grown American radicalism, the kind that has been coming out of the heartland for 100 years and more. It is a radicalism rooted not in theory but in a vivid, emotional flash on the way social inequity pushes lives out of shape. "I am moved," Wallace says, "by the way the system breaks people in half, and still they rise up to tell their story again, with grace and eloquence. People I went to school with have become farmers and factory workers and electricians. They pump gas and drive trucks and dig wells, and they are old in their mid-30's. One of my schoolmates, a man of 35, has been laying carpet for 20 years. The last time I was home he told me that his back and his knee hurt so much now that he can't get on top of his wife when they're making love. But he told me in a kind of wild, funny, self-mocking tale full of Kentucky humor and smarts, and I could see, not in what he said but in how he said it, that he was trying to make sense of things. Just behind his words, he was saying: 'What did I do wrong? How did I end up like this?' "
 Wallace left Louisville for Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., then the writing program at the University of Iowa. But the voices in her head, the ones that pull lanaguage from her, are back there in Kentucky. It's the carpet layer whose life seems metaphoric to her. "He's a man whose body has been used up by the system and then thrown away," she says. "In our society, the body is a thing made instrumental use of, and then asked to be - meant to be, unable to be - a thing of love." This, above all else, is the contradiction that excites her. "Capitalism," she says, quoting Terry Eagleton, "plunders the sensuality of the body," and her eyes shine as she repeats the British Marxist's poetic indictment.
 THE MOST STRIKING ELEMENT IN WALlace's work is the use she makes of the erotic. Invariably, at the unexpected moment, between an unlikely pair of characters - an old woman and a young man, two boys, two women - a sexual flare will occur that is mysterious and disturbing. "In Naomi's work something is always being done to the body," says Ron Daniels, who is directing "One Flea Spare" at the Public and who also directed "Slaughter City" at the Royal Shakespeare Company. "It is always being touched, caressed, burned, perforated, poured on a spat on. I'ts standing in a river of life-and-death fluids: alive to blood, sweat, snot, running sores and cozing wounds. For Naomi, it has to do with making the body - for which read 'class' - burst its bounds. Now here's the catch: it's all in the name of change, hope, possiblity."
 This intimate relation among sensuality, the cruelty of politics and the hope of redemption is crucial in Wallace's plays. Sensuality has not much to do with romantic love and everything to do with the primitive longing to connect. "Desire - that's really what I'm talking about," she says. "I don't mean love. I'm not sure I know what that means. Desire serves the need to end one's singular state. It creates the space in which to reimagine oneself. That alone ends loneliness."
 "One Flea Spare" is, at this moment, a culminating work. The play is set in London during the great plague of 1665 in the stripped and boarded-up house of William and Darcy Snelgrave, a wealthy, elderly couple quarantined because their servants died of the plague. Their confinement period is about to expire when Bunce, a seaman fleeing impressment, and Morse, a 12-year-old girl also seeking refuge, steal into the house. This condemns the Snelgraves and the intruders to 28 days of shared quarantine.
 Angry, frightened, confused and unable to escape, these people will engage with one another - and therefore with themselves. It will soon transpire that Darcy Snelgrave, married at 15 to William Snelgrave, was hideously burned in a stable fire at 17 and has not been touched in 30 years by her husband or any other human creature, and that Bunce has a wound in his side that refuses to heal, and that Morse is a mysteriously wise child who will become the catalytic force that brings the play a dramatic power. At last, in a memorable and remarkably erotic scene, Bunce will "touch" Darcy, and she will "penetrate" his wound.
 The situation may fee contrived, but the language is stirring and the play brilliantly constructed. "There are at least two moments in it," Kushner says, "when everything comes together - emotionally, symbolically, intellectually - and you hear the voice of the play. Not of the playwright, but of the play. Those are thrilling moments, and they don't always occur."
 The London review for "One Flea Spare" were spectacular, praising not only the richness of the language but also the way the language serves the subtext. "What the plague throws into relief about class division and the nature of human intimacy comes under a scrutiny both poetically sensitive and beadily comic," wrote a critic in The Independent, echoing many others in England. And indeed, this was the play that would bring Wallace home. "I did find it ironic," she says, "that they play I wrote about a young gay man from Kentucky who goes to the gulf war - that Louisville passed on that play. And they passed on 'Salughter City', about a meat-packing plant 20 minutes away from the theater. Then my British play, about the plague, that's the one they took."
 It was actually the Los Angeles riots in 1992 that started Wallace on "One Flea Spare." "I'd been reading Daniel Defoe's 'Journal of the Plague Year' when the riots broke out," she recalls, "and I began to see them both - L.A. and the London plague - as the same event. A time of crisis. A time when rich and poor get thrown together - and, suddenly, one sees alternatives. I began to think about what happens when the containment of a presumed danger through the regimentation of space breaks down, such as when South-Central L.A. began to 'invade' Beverly Hills. I wanted foreground a society in crisis. By writing about a time other than our own, it's possible for issues that have become locked in rhetoric, or dismissed as too overdetermined for the stage, to become visible anew."
 NAOMI WALLACE IS A PLAYWRIGHT WHO thinks of herself as a public intellectual with a responsibility to make theater audiences feel and understand the urgencies of their time. Deeply influenced by modernist theater, she is nevertheless, in spirit, a descendant of 1930's and 40's social realism. This apparent anomaly has created major problems for her poetic plays, at least in this country. "There's a more open tradition for political theater in Britian," she says. "Somehow, the British are able to say, 'Yes, there's a class culture and it's still worthy writing about.' "
 But 30 years of liberation politics and a culture steeped in therapy have made most Americans feel the reality of their lives in a language strongly at a odds with the one that focuses on class struggle. To American ears, Wallace's work can sound like Beckett rewriting Clifford Odets. Yet her talent is large, her intelligence strong; the word reminds us of how often writers like Brecht, Yeats and Gordimer have felt compelled to celerate life and still bear open, undisguised witness.
 When asked if she is bitter about having been so long ignored in her own country, Wallace says: "Hey, I'm happy to have my plays done anywhere. If I wanted to be romantic, I'd think of myself as a writer in exile. But I have never though to of myself that way. Oh, sure, I've been frustrated. I'd think: 'Why the hell is Louisville taking so long to recognize me? I'm from here!' But there's always been a small core of good people who've supported me." The country reserve gives way to that irresistible grin. "I always knew that sooner or later it would get itself organized."

 
'One Flea Spare'
 
Naomi Wallace's latest play opens at the Public Theater on March 9. It is set in the home of a wealthy London couple during the 1665 plague. Darcy Snelgrave and her husband have nearly served out their guarantine time when two strangers break into their house, seeking refuge from the plague. One of the strangers is a querulous 12-year-old girl named Morse. An excerpt:
 
Morse: My mother said to me that once a tiny piece of star broke off and fell from the sky while she slept in a field of wheat and it pierced her, here, (motions to Darcy's heart but doesn't touch her) and from that piece of star I was born.
 
Darcy: And you father. What did he say? That he molded you from a sliver of moon?
 
Morse: My father is dead.
 
Darcy: I know. But what did he say about his little girl?
 
Morse: My father was born dead. He stayed that way most of his life.
 
Darcy: I met your father, at the Opera, once. He seemd a decent man.
 
Morse: My father hit the maids. I saw him do it. Sometimes twice a day.
 
Darcy: Well, then he kept order. A household must have order.
 
Morse: He used a piece of leg from a chair. He kept it in the drawer of his writing desk.
 
Darcy: Sometimes servants misbehave. That's not your father's fault.
 
Morse: Do you hit your servants?
 
Darcy: My servants are dead.
 
Morse: Did you hit them?
 
Darcy: No, I didn't. But when they did not listen, I told my husband and he dealt with them as was necessary.

 
Political Theater Is Alive
Especially in England. But American playwrights - and theaters - are beginning to make plenty noise.
 
 
Strong Voices
An increasing number of American playwrights are dealing with political and social issues. You've never seen their plays on Broadway - rarely in New York, in fact - but the climate for their work is improving. A sampling:
 
KIA CORTHRON
A Maryland native who has written several plays examing the effects of poverty and prejudice on the underclasses, especially black women.
 
JOHN STEPPLING
A Los Angeles playwright and screenwriter (above), influenced by Sam Shepard and David Mamet; his plays often chronicle lives on the fringe of society.
 
JOAN ACKERMANN
A co-artistic director of a theater troupe in Great Barrington, Mass., whose plays include the New York-bound "The Batting Cage," an edgy comedy about the politics of family mourning.
 
STEVEN DIETZ
Based in Seattle, with plays produced in regional theaters around the country. Best known for "Lonely Plant," a two-character allegory about friendship in the age of AIDS.
 
MARY ZIMMERMAN
A Chicago director and playwright whose performance pieces combine music, speech and movement. Her adaptation of the "Odyssey" is scheduled to play at Circle in the Square next season.
 
 
Playwright-Friendly Theaters
Certain regional theaters, with their loyal audiences and adventuresome artistic directors, have become havens for the serious emerging playwright. Five of the leaders:
 
 
ACTORS THEATER OF LOUISVILLE, KY.
Jon Jory, the theater's producing director, has turned the Humana Festival of New American Plays into a launching pad for serious plays and playwrights. Once a year, stately old Louisville becomes a vital theater town.
 
THE MCCARTER THEATER, PRINCETON, N.J.
The McCarter's artistic director, Emily Mann (below), has welcomed plays with political themes. She has also written several political pieces, as well as the Broadway hit "Having Our Say," which began life at the McCarter.
 
MARK TAPER FORUM, LOS ANGELES
Gordon Davidson, a godfather of the regional theater movement, has used the Taper to almost single-handedly turn Los Angeles into a town where serious theater can be seen. In 1992, the Taper served as the cradle for Tony Kushner's landmark "Angels in America."
 
SEATTKE REPERTORY THEATER
Seattle Rep's main offering this year, an adaptation of "The Cider House Rules," John Irving's novel about an abortionist, was considered so sensitive that the theater didn't ask some of its usual corporate sponsors for support.
 
ARENA STAGE, WASHINGTON
This fall, the Arena, a longtime home for plays with political themes, will mount Anna Deavere Smith's new theater piece, a documentary look at politics and the press.
 
 
An Angel in America
The success of "Angels in America" four years ago gave a psychological boost to many playwrights working with explicit political themes. NAOMI WALLACE is one playwright who has been actively championed by the author "Angels," TONY KUSHNER (above); he has been enthusiastic about the work several others, including: ELLEN MCLAUGHLIN (alos an actress, who appeared in "Angels"); CHAY YEW (whose "Language of Their Own" portrays the friendship of gay men), and ROBERT O'HARA (whose time-bending "Insurrection: Holding History" was mounted at the Public in the fall).
 
Americans Abroad
Naomi Wallace is hardly the only politically inclined American playwright to have found Britain more receptive to her work. Her are five more whose fortunes in London have, so far, outshined those at home.
 
TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER
American by birth, educated largely in France, she has long lived in England, writing plays (including "Our Country's Good," which had a brief Broadway run) that nearly always concern class struggles and social divides.
 
TRACY LETTS
His first play, "Killer Joe," was derided as "evile" in its 1993 Chicago premiere (it is full of matricide, incest and loutishness), but it drew raves in London. His next play, "Bug," was called "deeply disturbing, fiercely original," by London's Daily Telegraph.
 
RICHARD NELSON
Chicago-born, lives in Rhinebeck, N.Y., but keeps his creative home in London. While we'll produced in America, he is practically revered in England; generally writes about history and clashes of culture.
 
PHYLLIS NAGY
A native New York who, as she had admitted, can't get arrested here. But Nagy (below) is a fixture within London's equivalent of Off Broadway. Her vision, like Kushner's, includes a fair share of millennial angst.
 
MARTIN SHERMAN
Sherman, born in New Jersey, has found London eager to embrace the eccentricity and dysfunction - be it political, social or sexual - that mark his plays. "A Madhouse in Goa," which starred Vanessa Redgrave, is due Off Broadway this year.

HEADLINE: Food Stamps for Job Seekers

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki of New York has done a sensible thing by applying for a waiver from the new Federal welfare law that would deny food stamps to adults who cannot find work. But his plan is flawed because it is a temporary waiver that would end on Nov. 21.
The new Federal law bars able-bodied, childless adults under 50 from collecting food stamps for more than three months in any three-year period unless they work at least 20 hours a week. This harsh rule applies even to those actively seeking work but unable to find a job who have no other means of support. The maximum amount of food stamps individuals in this category can receive is low to begin with, just $120 a month. 
 Last November Governor Pataki filed for a waiver from the new rules for areas in the state with an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent. That applied only to the Bronx and Hamilton County in the Adirondacks, leaving thousands of food-stamp recipients in other areas without relief. Simply living in a county with a lower unemployment rate does not necessarily make it easier for a low-skilled worker to find a job.
Under pressure from anti-hunger advocates, the Governor has now broadened his waiver request to include all communities where the unemployment rate is at least 20 percent above the national average of 5.4 percent. Federal law does not allow a waiver for areas that do not meet this criterion.
Communities eligible for the waiver will get only temporary relief from the food-stamp cutoffs. Come November, individuals dependent on food stamps in those areas would once again be threatened with a loss of aid. Governor Pataki says the purpose of the temporary waiver is to give cities and counties time to develop enough workfare or volunteer slots so that all recipients can find work to qualify under the new food-stamp rules. But communities will be hard pressed to find enough workfare slots for all the single mothers who currently receive cash welfare benefits. Childless food-stamp recipients will inevitably be pushed to the back of the line.
The Governor thinks recipients can find community service work if they want to eat. But in practice, unpaid volunteer jobs are rare in the private sector. The bulk of community service work is in nonprofit agencies. In most communities, those organizations will not be able to supervise all the food-stamp recipients who need work credit.
The issue is not whether to compel able-bodied adults to work. Anyone who refuses to accept a job or a workfare slot automatically loses food-stamp benefits, even with a waiver in place. A waiver protects only those who show they want to work from going hungry. Governor Pataki has said that "No one should be penalized because they're able-bodied and willing to work." Unfortunately, his humane sentiment runs out in November.

Rethinking China, Part I

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The death of Deng Xiaoping has triggered a new round of debate on U.S.-China policy. But it's a debate that remains highly unsatisfying. As always, the moralists make a passionate case for ratcheting up pressure on China, but they have no strategy. And the strategists make a sobering case for why continued engagement with China is a U.S. interest, but they have no morality. It's time to extract ourselves from this choice.
But first, how did we get here? It started in June 1989. Shocked by the televised murder of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen, the human rights community and Congress looked for a club to punish China's leaders. They opted for threatening to withdraw China's most-favored-nation trade benefits if China didn't release jailed dissidents or give the Red Cross more access to them. 
 M.F.N. was the wrong club. Threatening to withdraw M.F.N. hurt U.S. business as much as China. So China found it easy to go to U.S. corporations and ask: "Are you ready to sacrifice your interests so a few troublemakers are released from jail?" Since the answer was a loud "No," the Chinese easily divided and paralyzed the U.S. into two rival camps. Worse, the human rights debate got reduced to M.F.N. or no M.F.N. This also suited China, because once it got the Administration to set aside the M.F.N. club, China had clear sailing. Human rights activists had no other means for influencing China and became irrelevant.
But while human rights and business groups were screaming at each other, they both lost sight of developments in China. Many Chinese reformers started reacting negatively to the U.S. human rights debate because it was so focused on a few dissidents that it ignored those Chinese who were working within the system -- bureaucrats, lawyers, factory managers -- to advance the rule of law, something the Chinese Government, for its own reasons, also had an interest in doing.
For example, says Jonathan Hecht, a research fellow at Harvard Law School and a Chinese-speaking consultant to the Lawyers Committee For Human Rights: "The real guts of the Chinese Government's arbitrary powers reside in administrative law. Since Tiananmen, China has actually enacted new administrative laws that allow Chinese to sue their Government, to seek compensatory damages and to establish limits on the range of penalties that bureaucrats can impose on people. They are now working on an administrative procedure law that codifies how Government agencies make and publish rules, and what sort of appeals against administrative decisions people would have."
How many people know that China just revamped its criminal procedure law in ways that provide some greater safeguards for defendants and create more separation between courts, prosecutors and police?
"These new laws are far from perfect," adds Mr. Hecht, "and serious human rights abuses continue despite them." But they are a real step toward rule of law in China -- as opposed to arbitrary Communist Party rule -- and they are being put in place because people inside China have an interest in that happening. You would never know that from the debate here.
No question -- freeing dissidents is a necessary condition for human rights progress in China, but it's not sufficient. The only sustainable improvement in human rights in China will come when the system begins to change and the most promising way for the U.S. to promote such change is by building on China's own self-interest to have more rule of law.
It's not easy. There is a serious argument that says China's leaders will never let the rule of law apply to them. But clearly China's leaders feel some pressure to move in this direction, or it wouldn't be happening. That pressure is due to one fact: The only legitimacy China's leaders have derives from their ability to keep improving the economy and they can't build a fully modern economy, or keep attracting massive global investment, without instilling into the Chinese system more predictability, fairness and transparency based on a rule of law.
Our task is to keep China moving in this direction, building more rule of law, brick by brick, in hopes that one day these bricks will connect. It's a strategy that has some allies and momentum inside China and one that serves the interests and values of U.S. human rights advocates, big business and geostrategists alike. Thursday's column will examine how.

HEADLINE: Official's Blending of Duties Questioned

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
When business lobbyists went to the White House for briefings on legislative proposals in the first two years of the Clinton Administration, some were surprised to find a staff member of the Democratic National Committee there.
The briefings were held by the White House Office of Public Liaison, which was headed by Alexis M. Herman, now President Clinton's nominee to be Secretary of Labor. Current and former Government officials say the Democratic staff member, Caren Wilcox, was there to do something that the White House is legally barred from doing: getting business groups to lobby on Capitol Hill for the President's proposals. 
 This coordination between Ms. Herman's office and the Democratic committee, which has not been previously reported, is one of a series of ties that have raised questions about how she and her aides blended their official and political roles. The questions have jeopardized her nomination, despite strong support for her from the President and labor and women's groups.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said last week that Ms. Herman "still will likely be confirmed." But the Senate Labor Committee is looking into her activities and has not scheduled hearings on the nomination.
Most of the concerns about Ms. Herman have stemmed from the furor over fund-raising practices by Government officials and other links between her office and the Democratic Party.
But the attendance at dozens of briefings in 1993 and 1994 by Ms. Wilcox raises another concern.
The main task of the liaison office is to explain the President's policies to interest groups, including business, labor and civic organizations, in hopes of gaining their support for his legislative proposals. But the office's staff, and other White House employees, are prohibited from prodding supporters to lobby members of Congress for those plans.
That law is one of several restrictions intended to keep separate the governmental responsibilities of the White House and the political needs of the President. Such restrictions place liaison employees in a delicate position, so a separate White House political office normally handles such partisan concerns.
People who worked in the liaison office in Republican administrations said they never invited party officials to briefings at the White House.
"That is partisan political activity that is divorced from Government," said Wayne H. Valis, who had a liaison role in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan Administrations. "It is not a wise and appropriate thing to commingle them."
Ms. Herman has declined all interviews while her nomination is pending. But Joseph Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said Ms. Herman's office did nothing wrong. "The D.N.C. actively does grass-roots lobbying on behalf of the President's programs," he said, "and for a D.N.C. person to come over and attend one of these briefings is both permissible and legitimate."
But some Republicans disagreed. While acknowledging that the Republican Party helped promote policies when Republicans were in the White House, Frank J. Donatelli, who was a deputy in the liaison office in the Reagan Administration, said Ms. Herman's office "clearly went beyond what we did" in inviting a party official to attend briefings with outside groups.
"I'd be uncomfortable with that because it was almost like a direct handoff of the lobbying," he said.
Ms. Wilcox, who was then director of business outreach at the D.N.C., said she got involved in the briefings because "I had done a great deal of work in the business community" as a corporate lobbyist before that and knew some of the participants.
She said she sat in on perhaps one meeting a week in the first year or more of the Clinton Administration, when the President was seeking business support for changes in tax laws, health care policy and the development of economic empowerment zones. "Occasionally," she said, "we would talk about what I was doing with the D.N.C." to rally support for the proposals.
At most of the meetings, either Ms. Herman or Amy Zisook, who was then Ms. Herman's assistant in charge of business liaison, would talk about what the President was trying to do and answer questions.
Ms. Zisook said in an interview that Ms. Wilcox would later follow up with some of the business groups.
"We couldn't ask people to lobby, and she could," Ms. Zisook said. "We'd usually say, 'We need your help' or whatever without being specific. And she'd later talk to them about how they could best help."
Mr. Lockhart said that Ms. Wilcox held the business liaison job at the D.N.C. until May 1994, when she went to work in the White House liaison office, though she was still paid by the Democratic committee. Mr. Lockhart said Ms. Wilcox did nothing to promote business lobbying while she was in that White House job.
The White House acknowledged last month that it had employed about 20 workers in recent years who were paid by the committee. Amid news reports about it last week, Administration officials decided to shift to the White House payroll the few aides now in that situation.

HEADLINE: In Thai Camps, Fear of Burmese Troops Grows

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PU NAM RAWN, Thailand, March 1

 BODY:
Choo Dill Charles, a 58-year-old schoolteacher, was on his knees in a eucalyptus grove just across the border from Myanmar, begging a Thai official for protection.
"We are afraid," he said, spreading his arms wide. 
 Around him in the woods were more than 2,000 other ethnic Karen refugees, tending cooking fires and dozing among sacks of belongings, hoping to be allowed to move farther into Thailand, away from the danger of Burmese troops.
Just two miles away, the jagged silhouette of the Bilauktaung Mountains marked the border of Myanmar, the former Burma, and hid what Mr. Charles and others said were scenes of horror as the Burmese military mops up the last of a patchwork of ethnic insurgencies that have carried out a jungle war for nearly 50 years.
For the first time since the end of World War II, it appears that the central Burmese Government is in control of the entire 1,000-mile border with Thailand, and Karen villagers like Mr. Charles have nowhere left to run.
The Thai official, District Chief Pituck Sakate, a military-style peaked cap on his head and a pistol on his hip, told Mr. Charles that for now, the Thai military would not allow the 2,300 refugees to move from their camp here.
In addition, he confirmed a new Thai policy: for the first time in nearly 20 years of giving haven to refugees, Thailand will now send young men back to Myanmar, whether or not they are soldiers. Only women, children and the elderly will be allowed to stay.
"It is a question of safety," he said. "If some young men stay here, because they are the enemy, maybe the Myanmar soldiers will destroy the camp and maybe people will die."
Though Thai officials have strenuously denied that they are sending people back, and this weekend chided American officials who protested, many refugees and aid workers say that noncombatants have been sent back across the border to an unknown fate.
Earlier this week, 330 men and boys, some as young as 10 years old, were taken from the encampment here and sent back across the mountains, the refugees said.
"These boys are schoolboys," said Cristobal Paul, 42, in tears. Her 16-year-old son was taken without a word of farewell on Tuesday. "They don't know how to live in the jungle. They don't know their way. They don't know how to hold a gun. They have never seen fighting."
In addition, in at least one instance, women and children have reportedly been sent back from Thailand. In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said the United States had confirmed that 900 women and children were forced back to Myanmar when they tried to enter Thailand on Wednesday.
The Thai policy appears to reflect new cooperation with the Burmese military Government as the junta tries to open Myanmar to trade and moneymaking. It reverses a long policy of allowing various ethnic guerrilla groups to find safe haven along the border, thus providing a buffer against the traditionally hostile Burmese forces.
In recent years, Thailand has joined a rush in Southeast Asia to do business with Myanmar, taking advantage of that country's newly liberalized economy.
The area of fighting across the Bilauktaung Mountains lies to the south of a $1 billion natural gas pipeline being constructed by the American oil company Unocal and Total of France. The pipeline is to span Myanmar and become a major supplier of energy to Thailand.
In addition, Thai companies are among the bidders to build a deep-water port at the Burmese town of Tavoy, which would be linked to Thailand by roads.
Both projects are in territory where rebel soldiers of the Karen National Union have held sway, and the rebels have threatened to disrupt the pipeline project.
Since the start of the month, tens of thousands of Burmese soldiers have swept through the area, which is home to 20,000 people, driving an estimated 2,500 Karen fighters from their camps. As they do so, reports accumulate from refugees that women have been raped and men have been marched away to act as porters for the military.
In one incident, Mrs. Paul said 10 women were taken away from a village.
In another, Kaw Paw, a 55-year-old farmer, said she watched from a hiding place as her neighbor, Cree May, 42, was raped by a dozen soldiers until she died. Mrs. Cree May's husband and father were tied up and made to watch, she said.
"They were crying and she was crying," Mrs. Kaw Paw said, breaking down in tears herself. "She was saying, 'God, please help me.' "
Mr. Charles said he had heard rumors that Burmese soldiers were poised to attack the encampment here. On Thursday, about 50 Burmese soldiers exchanged small-arms fire with Thai village self-defense forces here before withdawing.
Over the months, Burmese soldiers and a breakaway Karen faction that is allied with them have attacked and burned several refugee settlements.
"My question is, are we safe here?" Mr. Charles said to the Thai district chief. "In the daytime we see Thai soldiers protecting us but at night we see nobody."
The Thai official, Mr. Pituck, wrapped his arm around Mr. Charles's shoulders and gave an encouraging smile.
"Cool heart, cool heart," he said, using a Thai expression that means, "Relax, take it easy."
"Cool heart, cool heart," Mr. Charles repeated a little later. "That is what they keep telling us. But we don't even know if it will be safe for us to sleep tonight."

HEADLINE: Albania Calls An Emergency As Chaos Rises

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, March 2

 BODY:
The Albanian Government imposed a nationwide state of emergency tonight to try to assert control as anarchy engulfed Europe's poorest and now angriest country.
The southern half of the country spiraled out of the Government's hold today, as enraged protesters, firing weapons, ransacked from military warehouses, burned buildings and looted banks and stores in the southern coastal city of Sarande. 
 At least four people were reported killed by gunfire in other Albanian cities.
The state of emergency, which bans people from gathering in groups of more than four and authorizes "all force" by the army, the police and the secret police, was seen as a last-ditch gamble by the widely unpopular President, Sali Berisha, a former ranking member of one of Communism's most isolated and hard-line parties.
On Saturday, in an attempt to "resolve the problems," Mr. Berisha announced the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi and his Cabinet, but the gesture did not allay unrest.
And it was unclear whether Mr. Berisha, who warned in a televised address tonight that an "iron hand" would be used to end violence, would be able to crush the rebellion, which was set off by the collapse of fraudulent financial schemes in which many Albanians lost all their savings.
Faced with a police force that has deserted most of its posts out of sympathy with the protesters and a miserably paid, disaffected army that has abandoned its barracks, the Government announced tonight that the feared secret police, known as Shik, would take a lead against what it called "terrorist bands."
Transmissions of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America were cut after Parliament, where only Mr. Berisha's party sits, unanimously approved the state-of-emergency law.
For both the United States and Europe, an Albania out of control means more than the country's population of 3.2 million and backward economy might initially suggest.
European nations, particularly nearby Greece and Italy, fear a repeat of the large exodus of Albanian refugees who fled in 1991 after the collapse of Communism.
For Washington, Albania is considered vital to the stability of the volatile Balkans. After Mr. Berisha came to power, the State Department supported him as a helpful ally in containing the potentially explosive tensions in Kosovo, the region in Serbia where restive ethnic Albanians far outnumber Serbs.
While he was the American Defense Secretary, William J. Perry twice visited Albania to highlight Albania's significance in the southern flank of Europe.
But in a sign of Washington's disillusionment with Mr. Berisha, the American Ambassador here, Marisa Lino, gave an unusually candid interview to the opposition newspaper Koha Jone last week. She said Mr. Berisha, who presided over blatantly fraudulent parliamentary elections in May, should call new elections and start rewriting the Constitution.
A State Department spokesman said last week that it was "deeply concerned" by Mr. Berisha's refusal to make any concessions to the protesters.
Demonstrations of frustration in the last month over the loss of savings in the pyramid schemes ballooned in the last week to what amounted to civilian uprisings against Mr. Berisha's rule.
Student hunger-strikers and other protesters, backed by a coalition of opposition parties, Forum for Democracy, have called for the President's resignation, a caretaker government and new elections.
The opposition to Mr. Berisha comes from the Socialist Party, whose leader, Fatos Nano, is in prison after what human rights groups call an unfair trial, as well as from a far-right coalition that controlled Shkoder, the biggest city in northern Albania.
Vlore, a coastal town 70 miles south of the capital where drug runners, smugglers and money launderers drive through dusty streets in new-model luxury cars, has become the central point of the unrest, in part because residents of that city had more cash and thus invested more money in the investment schemes.
A gun battle in Vlore on Friday night left at least 10 people dead, Western diplomats said today. Most of the 10 were secret policemen, the diplomats said. Three were students, who were buried in a public funeral on Saturday.
Today, the Interior Ministry reported that two civilians had been killed in Vlore, including an 8-year-old girl. Looters pillaged the seaside presidential villa in the city, and armed men shot into the air on the fringes of an angry rally.
After the state of emergency was announced, Vlore residents said they heard increased gunfire. It was not clear who was firing, they said. At the daily rally in Vlore, protest leaders said they were holding an unspecified number of secret policemen as hostages and threatened to march on Tirana unless depositors in the pyramid schemes were reimbursed for 100 percent of their losses.
In Gjirokaster, where students are also on strike, 20 to 30 masked demonstrators were reported today to have fired at the police headquarters with assault rifles, forcing the police to leave. The demonstrators then set the building on fire. Hospital officials said one person had been killed and two wounded by gunfire in the city.
In Sarande, a resort south of Tirana that the Albanian Government boasted could become a big attraction for Western tourists, witnesses said the center of town was in flames. The police and the army offered no resistance, they said.
In the town of Fier, a hospital employee was reported killed.
The violence has increased in large part, many say, because as the poorest people in Europe, Albanians dreamed of becoming suddenly rich. The promise of big returns from the investment schemes -- and in the beginning the reality of big returns -- gave the illusion of a booming economy when, in fact, the meager industrial production sustained under the Communists had virtually stopped.
For many, the money they put into the schemes -- often raised from the sale of apartments or from remittances from relatives abroad -- was the first real money they had tasted after 50 years of Communism.
And anecdotal evidence suggests that almost every Albanian, from Government ministers to street vendors, bet on the fantastic rates of return. The most outlandish schemes promised 25 percent interest a month; the most conservative and biggest scheme, Vefa, promised 8 percent.
All the investment schemes were seen by the population as being blessed by the Government. During local elections in October, posters for members of Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party included symbols of the pyramid funds. And governing party politicians regularly turned up at functions held by Vefa.
Because of the Government's apparent endorsement, investors say they feel betrayed that Mr. Berisha did not warn about the perils of the pyramid funds, which inevitably collapsed.
Every day during the last few weeks, thousands of Vefa investors have lined up against the fence of the fund's flashy offices here, waiting for names to be read out of people who are to get their deposits back, without interest. But the depositors say the names never seem to correspond with anyone in the crowd.
Western governments, including officials from Washington, warned the Berisha Government that the pyramid schemes would collapse, diplomats said. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also warned of disaster.
Western financial experts have suggested that the schemes lasted as long as they did because initially they got large infusions of cash from Albanians running sanction-busting businesses during the war in Bosnia as well as from even more dubious sources, like drug dealers and weapon traders.
In November, the Government became more antagonistic and more nationalist in its pronouncements as it became clear that the investment schemes were tottering.
Mr. Berisha reiterated this anti-foreign sentiment tonight in his address, saying, "Armed Communist rebels helped and financed by foreign espionage services have started military actions to overthrow the Government with force and establish their rule across the country."

HEADLINE: Sweden's Courteous Police Spoil A Hell's Angels Clubhouse Party

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, March 2

 BODY:
This was a bad weekend for the Hell's Angels in Scandinavia.
With about 300 Swedish uniformed and undercover police officers keeping a vigil over "Angels Place," the motorcycle gang's new clubhouse here, nothing was allowed to get out of hand. 
 The large burgundy wooden shack under suffocating surveillance was where Hell's Angels from all over the world gathered to celebrate with loud rock music and rivers of beer the opening of their newest chapter in Scandinavia, the third to open in Sweden in five years.
The normally liberal, courteous, friendly Swedish police made sure the 250 to 300 international members of the brotherhood, as the Angels refer to themselves, had a miserable time.
One gang official was even arrested for neglecting to wear a safety belt in the back seat of a car. In Hell's Angels' parlance, that was a pretty humiliating put down.
But the gang's trouble here this weekend might have been only a minor setback in their expansion into new territory. Law enforcement officials and experts in motorcycle gangs say the alarm of the Stockholm police was well justified.
"When the Hell's Angels set up a chapter, it's like a dog watering a fire hydrant; it's marking territory," said Yves Lavign, who has written two books on the gang. "Increasingly they are looking at Scandinavia, with its open seas and sparsely populated spaces, as good territory for drug smuggling and manufacturing. They can set up a laboratory to process heroin, pills and cocaine."
But the Angels aren't the only American-based gang looking for new territory. They have been engaged in a deadly competition with the rival Bandidos, and in the last three years 10 gang members have been killed and 50 wounded.
Machine guns, grenades and antitank rockets have been used in gang violence in Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki, and many civilians have been wounded too.
Last March, the serenity of Copenhagen's airport was shattered in a gunfight as Hell's Angels came to "greet" leaders of the Bandidos, leaving one dead and two seriously wounded. Last October, a car bomb exploded outside the Angels' Oslo headquarters. Also last year, several homes were destroyed in Malmo, Sweden, when a Bandidos headquarters was bombed. As the cycle of attacks and revenge continue, a rocket-propelled grenade was shot at a Danish jail last month in an attempt to kill an imprisoned Bandidos leader. It missed him, but several inmates were wounded.
At least 100 gang members have been jailed across Scandinavia since 1991. The police here and in Norway, Finland and Denmark are operating with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Theodore C. Baltas 2d, an agent from the bureau who was here this weekend, said a joint task force had been set up.
"It is the least we can do," Mr. Baltas said this afternoon. "After all, we exported the problem to them. Containing it has got to be a multinational effort."
Indeed, about 7:30 P.M. Saturday, law enforcement officials from the United States, Finland, Norway and Denmark watched from a distance as the Swedish police stopped scores of Angels, their wives, girlfriends and guests flocking to the party in a nondescript industrial suburb of Stockholm.
All were searched for weapons, drugs or anything illegal. Their identity papers were duly noted, yielding what Detective Inspector Finn Wurtz of Denmark described as a huge bonanza of "intelligence, information and data" about Hell's Angels members, supporters, and hangers-on who act as apprentices in the hopes of joining the ranks.
Denmark, the worst hit of all Scandinavian countries, has now banned Hell's Angels clubs and motorcycle gangs, detaining and searching known members on sight, Mr. Wurtz said. Sweden has passed provisions allowing a significant infringement on the bikers' freedom. Norway and Finland are heading in the same direction.
"The message is not just zero tolerance," said Detective Per Jaldung of the Swedish National Criminal Intelligence Service, who tracks motorcycle gang activities. "Increasingly what we are saying to motorcycle gangs is: we don't want you around Sweden or Scandinavia."
The Angels are based in California, while the Bandidos originated in Texas. Accompanying their arrival in Scandinavia in the early 1990's was a palpable increase in the supply of amphetamines, cocaine and other hard drugs as well as gang wars over territory, the police said.
With a worldwide membership of 1,200 to 1,500, Hell's Angels has an estimated 85 members in Sweden, 110 in Denmark, 70 in Norway and 25 in Finland. The police in those countries say the group is organized into 15 official chapters. They said thatalso applying for membership are a score of unofficial clubs filled with petty motorcycle criminals.
The Bandidos have 130 members across Scandinavian countries in at least seven chapters, police officials said.
For both gangs, here as in the United States, membership is restricted to white males 21 or older. An unofficial requirement is the possession of a criminal record including time in jail.
At the Hell's Angels' shack this morning, the mood was sour under the suffocating police surveillance.
"There is no one to talk to here," a surly, bearded, heavily tattooed Swedish man with earrings told an inquiring visitor. Glancing at one of a dozen police armored vehicles patrolling only yards away ever since the gathering began on Thursday, he slammed the steel door shut.
The shack is on Ranhamarsvagen, a gray, lifeless street, on which the police had set up two checkpoints. Police cameras recorded every movement. Every car that wanted to pass a checkpoint was stopped, and some passengers were searched.
Siw Persson, a Member of Parliament who is trying to stop the spread of motorcycle gangs here, said the immediate priority for Scandinavian Governments is to prevent people from getting hurt.
"When gunfire erupts in such a savage way, most of the time people stand there, just gazing in disbelief," she said. "They don't even take cover, because we are not used to this kind of violence in this part of the world."
She warned that the problem is growing as more Scandinavian youths drift toward gangs, driven by unemployment, family problems and the pressure of rising criminality emanating from organized crime in Russia and the former Yugoslavia.
"We have only three clubs now in Sweden, but there are dozens of prospect clubs who applied to become Hell's Angel chapters," she said. "For this they have to be tested, which means they have to elevate themselves to higher levels of criminality. This is how you qualify for Hell's Angels trust."
Mrs. Persson said the only way to counter the trend is force.
"We have to show them we are strong and willing to use our force," she said. She added with a laugh that before she undertook the task of fighting gangs with new laws in Parliament she consulted her husband and three daughters. "They were very supportive," she said.

HEADLINE: Teamsters Are Challenging G.E. Chief's Compensation

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
John F. Welch Jr., one of the most successful and highly compensated chief executives in corporate America, is about to be asked to defend how much he is paid to run the General Electric Company.
A shareholder resolution seeking to eliminate a form of deferred compensation for Mr. Welch, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, will be in the proxy statement that G.E. is expected to mail to shareholders in the next few days. 
 The resolution, brought by a pension plan of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, calls for placing a $1 million limit on the base salaries of G.E.'s five top executives. It is intended to challenge a 1995 arrangement under which Mr. Welch deferred half of his $2 million base salary until retirement in return for a promise to receive generous interest payments on the balance.
G.E. directors will recommend that shareholders reject the proposal, which will be voted on on April 23 in Charlotte, N.C., at the company's annual meeting.
"We feel it would undermine our ability to retain and attract leaders in the future," said Vance Meyer, a G.E. spokesman. "We need the flexibility to develop competitive individual compensation plans."
The managers of the teamsters pension plan said they learned of Mr. Welch's deferred compensation agreement from an article in The New York Times that was part of a series late last year. The article detailed the ways many wealthy Americans manage to reduce, delay or avoid taxes, using sophisticated techniques not generally available to most people. The teamsters provided The Times with an advance copy of the shareholder resolution and a letter from G.E. confirming that it would appear in the proxy statement.
The union filed a similar resolution with Pepsico, whose chief executive, Roger A. Enrico, deferred $1.3 million in 1994. Another Pepsico executive made $199,967 in 1995 in above-market interest on deferred compensation. The teamsters said Pepsico should disclose the interest rate paid.
Pepsico, in a statement that will appear in its proxy in opposition to the resolution, said none of its executives' base pay exceeded $1 million and that the deferred amounts were entirely tax deductible.
Teamsters' officials said they filed the resolutions as part of a campaign to draw attention to executive pay, which the union considers excessive.
"As long as there are loophole lawyers, there need to be shareholder watchdogs and we still think a million dollars means something," said Bart Naylor, the union's director of corporate affairs. Mr. Welch, who owns G.E. stock worth more than $300 million, received total compensation over $22 million in 1995.
The teamsters' resolution says "deferred compensation is being used as a method of avoiding shareholder votes on compensation plans."
Under a 1993 Federal law, the maximum amount of base pay that a company can deduct from taxes for its top five executives is $1 million each. There is no limit on how much a company can deduct if the pay is based on a pay-for-performance plan that was approved by a shareholder vote. But base pay greater than $1 million qualifies for a tax deduction, even if it is not part of an approved pay-for-performance plan, if the money is deferred until retirement.
Mr. Welch deferred half of his $2 million base salary until retirement in return for being paid 14 percent interest, which will compound untaxed until he retires. Mr. Welch also received a $35,000 sweetener payment, which also earns 14 percent interest, to encourage him to make the deferral. If the deferral lasts five years Mr. Welch will have $263,600 more, after taxes, than if he had found an investment on his own paying 14 percent interest.
The General Electric resolution was proposed by the Teamsters Affiliates Pension Plan, which owns 13,800 shares of G.E. stock and covers top union officials. All teamster plans together own 7.2 million G.E. shares, the union said, or less than one-half of 1 percent of the nearly 1.65 billion G.E. shares outstanding.
G.E. sought permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Dec. 20 letter to ignore the union's resolution. The S.E.C. denied the request, though it did require two minor changes.
Last year, at least 63 shareholder resolutions on executive pay were submitted, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, which tracks proxy and other corporate-governance filings at 1,500 companies. Shareholders voted on 37 of these proposals. All lost, on average receiving the support of 11.1 percent of the shares voted, the center said.

HEADLINE: Gore's Fund-Raising Casts a Political Shadow

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
On a September afternoon in 1993, eight months after the Clinton Administration had taken office, Vice President Al Gore used a borrowed room at a Los Angeles law firm to meet with about 30 members of the local Asian-American business community.
The 45-minute session had been requested and partly coordinated by John Huang, then an executive of the Lippo bank, which is part of the business empire of the Riady family of Indonesia. And the Vice President had taken the opportunity to cultivate a prosperous immigrant group for the Democratic Party. 
 Mr. Gore's aides describe that afternoon as a political outreach session. While it was not a fund raiser, a Gore aide acknowledged that one aim of such a meeting would be that those attending might eventually become donors.
Mr. Huang subsequently joined the Administration in the Commerce Department and then became a senior Democratic Party fund-raiser. Now he is at the center of several investigations into questionable and unlawful contributions to the Democratic Party, and whether money from overseas businesses or governments illegally found its way into Democratic campaign coffers.
And Mr. Gore, who throughout his political career has benefited from a reputation for integrity, is now coming under sharp scrutiny for his role as President Clinton's loyal political second, a role that threatens to undermine a man who has been waiting for his own turn to make a run for the Presidency.
Today two Democratic Senators, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, criticized Mr. Gore in response to a report in The Washington Post that the Vice President had personally telephoned donors to ask for contributions in the 1996 campaign.
"I'm not going to be in the business of defending the undefendable," Mr. Torricelli said on "Fox News Sunday." "And what is more, I do not personally believe it is appropriate for the President or Vice President of the United States to directly solicit contributions through telephone calls." It is not illegal for the President or Vice President to solicit campaign contributions, but Federal officials cannot solicit or receive campaign money on Federal property.
It has long been the role of a Vice President to do the less glamorous political work of an Administration and devote himself to the backbreaking and time consuming task of raising money.
In fact, Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, today produced a letter that Senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, sent to members of a Republican fund-raising group, the Inner Circle, in 1990 inviting them to "meet the Vice President and his wife at their home," when Dan Quayle was Vice President. Mr. Waxman, the senior Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, called for those activities to be scrutinized by the committee along with the Democratic fund raising.
Mr. Gore performed his task avidly, Democrats say, intent on building a loyal network of supporters and fund-raisers who would be at his side in 2000 in a probable Democratic primary fight. "When there's a good fund-raiser out there, Gore goes after him," said one Democrat who has been courted by the Vice President.
It was Mr. Gore's own political network that proved its mettle by holding the first $1 million fund-raiser for the Clinton-Gore campaign, a gathering of about 50 Gore supporters in Washington's lavish Ritz-Carlton hotel in June 1995.
The Vice President attended 8 of Mr. Clinton's White House coffees and acted as host himself at 23 coffees with donors, his sessions held in the Vice President's ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House. One of his aides, David Strauss, sat in on the weekly White House meetings in which a core of Mr. Clinton's senior advisers huddled with the top echelons of the Democratic National Committee to map out weekly fund-raising goals.
And as the Clinton-Gore campaign urgently sought ever more money for television advertising in 1995 and 1996, Mr. Gore picked up the telephone and made personal appeals for donations, Democrats say, a task Mr. Clinton refused to do. It was not clear where Mr. Gore made his calls from. George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's former special adviser said today on the ABC News program "This Week" that the White House reserved political work for special telephone lines paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore succeeded to such an extent that they raised a record amount for their party and won re-election, while still being significantly outspent by the Republicans. But the fruits of their victory have been nearly weekly questions about the seemliness of their fund-raising drive as well as investigations into whether a small core of Democratic fund-raisers, including Mr. Huang, were illegally funneling money into Democratic coffers from foreign sources. Last week the Democrats announced that they were returning another $1.5 million, most of it raised by Mr. Huang and two other Asian-American businessmen.
Even as the controversy swirls around him, Mr. Gore has been trying to court donors as usual and to place his people in crucial positions for four years from now. Karen Skelton, who had been Mr. Gore's political director, has moved into the White House to become a deputy political director. Steven Grossman, the new national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is a Gore ally. And Daniel A. Dutko, a Washington lobbyist who is considered by Democrats to be part of the Gore fund-raising network, has been put in charge of the Democrats' latest "Victory" fund to raise money for the 1998 off-year elections.
The Vice President's allies argue that he can survive the focus on campaign finance excesses. "With Gore you have an impregnable record of integrity," said Carter Eskew, a Democratic political strategist with ties to Mr. Gore.
But several other Democratic political strategists, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said Mr. Gore was now in danger of looking like the ultimate inside player in a political system that appears ever crasser to the public. Mr. Gore declined to be interviewed for this article.
Mr. Gore began assembling his own fund-raising network when he ran for President in 1988, and he keeps his own database of donors and supporters at the Democratic National Committee.
The Gore network includes people like Howard Glicken, who runs a Miami consulting and merchant banking firm; Noach Dear, a New York City Councilman with fund-raising prowess among Orthodox Jews, and Mitchell W. Berger, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., lawyer who was the Clinton-Gore finance chairman for Florida. Peter S. Knight, the Washington lawyer and lobbyist who was the Clinton-Gore campaign manager, was a senior staff member to Mr. Gore in the Senate and is considered his chief fund-raiser.
Mr. Gore has also had his own independent contacts with Mr. Huang, separate from Mr. Clinton's ties to him through his former employers, the Riady family of Indonesia. One year after his Presidential run, Mr. Gore, still a Senator from Tennessee, accompanied Mr. Huang and Maria L. Hsia on a trip to Taiwan that was paid for by the Fo Kwang Shan Buddhist organization.
Mr. Gore took with him Mr. Knight, then his senior staff member, and Leon S. Fuerth, who remains Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy adviser. During the visit Mr. Gore met the Taiwan's Prime Minister and visited the Venerable Master Hsing Yung at the Buddhist temple that paid for his airfare.
Lorraine Voles, Mr. Gore's spokeswoman, said the visit was partly economic, with Mr. Gore trying to sell Tennessee as a good place to do business. Ms. Voles said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had been instrumental in setting up the trip. Another longtime Gore adviser, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that the campaign committee pushed Mr. Gore hard because it wanted a prominent senator to travel to Taiwan with California's Lieutenant Governor, Leo McCarthy, and his Asian-American financial supporters.
Mr. McCarthy, now in private business, said in an interview last week that he traveled to Taiwan that year in an effort to promote California trade in Asian markets. Asked why Mr. Gore went, he said: "I don't know. I met him over there. I'm not sure what his mission was."
Mr. Gore went on to meet with Mr. Huang at the 1993 session in Los Angeles. And last year Mr. Gore had contact with Ms. Hsia and Mr. Huang again. They were the organizers of a fund-raising lunch that he attended at a Southern California Buddhist temple, which is affiliated with the group that paid for his 1989 trip to Taiwan. The Democrats later termed the event inappropriate because of the temple's tax-exempt status, returned donations and reimbursed the temple for expenses.
Much of Mr. Gore's fund raising in 1995-96 was composed of the traditional Vice Presidential appearances before political dinners and lunches. Democratic Party records show that Mr. Gore headlined 39 party fund raisers that raised $8.74 million.
Mr. Gore, however, also held coffees at the Old Executive Office Building with fund-raisers and donors, which are more controversial because they step close to fund raising on Government property.
"Fund-raisers in the White House are illegal," Mr. Nickles, the Senator from Oklahoma, said today on "Fox News Sunday," hours before the Democrats produced his 1990 letter inviting Republicans to a reception at the Quayles' official residence.
The White House has insisted that no money was solicited at the coffees while acknowledging that those who attended could have already given money to the party or been asked some time after they were entertained. Democratic fund-raisers say that at his coffees Mr. Gore met primarily with members of the Democratic Business Council, who gave the party donations of $10,000 and $15,000. Mr. Clinton's time was reserved for bigger donors.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A Colorful Family Made for Memoirs

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

 THE SUN AT MIDDAY
 Tales of a Mediterranean Family
 By Gini Alhadeff
 226 pages. Pantheon Books. $23. 
 Toward the end of this affecting memoir, Gini Alhadeff writes of the ability possessed by her uncle Piero and his lover to turn "life into anecdote, and anecdote into language, so that an expression we used at any time among ourselves, once remembered, could recall precisely the atmosphere of all that had surrounded it."
Ms. Alhadeff shares a similar storytelling gift, and in "The Sun at Midday," she uses it to conjure up the lives of her family members and the far-flung homes they came to inhabit in the course of a century, from the palatial house she grew up in in Egypt (its garden has since been replaced by three apartment buildings and a mosque) to the two-room apartment she now rents in Manhattan. It is a story of dislocation and exile, a story of one woman's search for her past in the interstices of familial memory.
The author, fluent in half a dozen languages, was born in Alexandria and has lived in Cairo, Khartoum, Tokyo, London and Chianti, as well as New York City. She describes herself as a kind of cultural Zelig. "I was sent to Florence and became Italian," she writes, "to England and became English, to New York and became a New Yorker, if not an American. I am the worst of the chameleons: I have swallowed several ethnic identities whole and no single one lords it over the others."
"I sometimes find it hard to distinguish between identity and mimicry," she goes on. "At this rate, it is easy to see that our origins will soon have become invisible."
The story of Ms. Alhadeff's family is a tale of multiple identities and metamorphosis -- and in a sense, the Jewish diaspora. Ms. Alhadeff's family on both her mother's and father's sides were Sephardic Jews who lived in Andalusia until the Inquisition. From there, her father's ancestors moved to Rhodes, where their business flourished: Salomon Alhadeff Fils, family legend has it, was at one time "the main commercial and banking firm in the Middle East," controlling 90 percent of the Rhodes economy, the export of cotton, sesame and figs.
Rhodes was then an Italian colony, and when Mussolini's racial laws were passed in 1938, the family relocated to Alexandria, where Ms. Alhadeff's father met and married her mother, herself the descendant of a distinguished family that had built (and lost) a fortune in cotton. The couple converted to Catholicism soon after having their first son, a decision no doubt shaped in part by the Nazis' internment of one of Mr. Alhadeff's brothers. By the 60's, the family was living in Tokyo and Ms. Alhadeff was sent to a Catholic girls school and taught to sing "Jesus wants me for a sunbeam." She says she had no idea she was Jewish until she was nearly 20 and arrived in New York.
Ms. Alhadeff does not relate these events in a straightforward manner but reveals them bit by bit through an oblique, fragmented narrative that loops backward and forward in time, doubling back on itself like a serpentine maze. Because the resulting book is so willfully elliptical, because there are so many aunts and uncles and great-grandparents, the reader frequently wishes that a family tree had been provided with the book to offer a cursory guideline to the author's myriad ancestors and their peregrinations.
Still, Ms. Alhadeff's portraits of her relatives are remarkably vivid, drawn with both the emotional insight of a novelist and a journalist's unforgiving eye. But while she does not flinch from disclosing painful secrets of her own -- including a longtime adulterous affair and the abortion of a fetus with Down syndrome -- there is a dignity and reserve to her revelations, a refusal to court self-pity that makes this book feel more like a Chekhovian rumination than one of those confessional inventories so popular in America today.
In the course of the book, Ms. Alhadeff introduces us to her cousin Pierre, who converted to Catholicism and became a priest: a priest who learned to shoot with William Burroughs and who played footsie with Robert Mapplethorpe, a priest who "drops names the way certain women put on too many jewels." We also meet Uncle Aldo's wife, Mariuccia Mandelli, who founded the fashion house Krizia in the 50's, built a business empire and acquired an island in the Caribbean.
There's Uncle Nissim, who spent a year in Auschwitz and Buchenwald and passed himself off as a Frenchman of Russian descent. There's Aunt Rachel, who calls Uncle Nissim -- now a gynecologist in Queens -- seven or eight times a day to discuss her medical complaints. And finally there's her grandmother's sister, Nelly -- a "woman whose bookshelves were lined with read and reread original editions of Corneille, Moliere, Racine" -- who moved in with the Alhadeffs and devoted herself to the care and maintenance of their underwear and socks.
Like Andre Aciman's stunning memoir "Out of Egypt" (1994), which also chronicled the life and exile of a well-to-do Alexandrian family, "The Sun at Midday" evokes a world of luxury and ease in pre-Nasser Egypt. "Everyone went to Europe in the summer and sent their cooks to the Cordon Bleu in Paris," Ms. Alhadeff's cousin Pierre recalls. Women spent their days shopping and getting fitted for new gowns; at night, they adorned themselves with jewels and furs to go to dinner. Each year, Ms. Alhadeff's maternal grandparents took friends and relatives by boat from Alexandria to Venice and back, holidays that often lasted three months.
That Alexandrian world of wealth and privilege, however, came to an abrupt end. After the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, growing anti-Semitism and the nationalization of more and more businesses forced Ms. Alhadeff's family to pack their bags once again. Her grandfather's cotton business went bankrupt, and he spent the last 20 years of his life dependent on a son-in-law and grandsons. As for the rest of the family, it dispersed to England, Italy and the United States.
Later, the 45-year marriage of Ms. Alhadeff's parents also came to a close when her father left home for a younger woman. In some respects, however, Ms. Alhadeff says their marriage isn't really over: "They had three children -- that is all that history will record: genetic continuity, and so, memory."
Memory, in this case, that has been articulated and preserved in an eloquently observed book that recreates, if not recaptures, the elusive past.

Dollar Up as U.S. Rate Rise And Delay in Euro Are Seen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday, bolstered by mounting expectations for higher United States interest rates and continuing speculation that Europe's efforts to forge a single currency would be delayed.
A member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, Ernst Welteke, told reporters that the stumbling German economy had prevented higher interest rates in Germany, but added that the weak German mark and the likelihood of higher United States rates ruled out a cut in German rates. 
 "The prospect of even more favorable interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Germany is very supportive for the dollar," said Seth Garrett, a director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse First Boston.
In trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 121.27 yen from 120.22 yen on Friday and to 1.6980 marks from 1.6903. The British pound fell to $1.6176 from $1.6295.
Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rate this spring, a view that gained supporters after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a Senate committee on Wednesday that the rates could be increased even ahead of any inflation signs.
Mr. Welteke also said that further appreciation of the dollar against the mark was undesirable and that a delay in the proposed European economic and monetary union would bolster the mark strongly. His first comment hurt the dollar, but investors later pushed the dollar higher against the mark.
"Welteke made a couple of comments, the first of which was bullish for the mark and the second seemed to offset it," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Another Bundesbank council member, Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, was quoted in the Berliner Zeitung as saying he was not sure the proposed European monetary union would begin in 1999 as scheduled. Those comments set off sales of Spanish pesetas and Italian lire for marks, and investors sold the mark against the dollar and the Swiss franc.
And traders in Europe said the central banks in Italy and Spain had entered the foreign exchange markets to sell marks in an effort to prop up their currencies.

HEADLINE: Campaign Hearings: Another Boondoggle?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Don't Sabotage the Hearings" (editorial, March 2) is mistaken when it assumes that the public is "weary and cynical" about campaign finance scandals. 
 Of course President Clinton rewards his friends and punishes his enemies, although not nearly enough. Yet if the President didn't raise money for his party, the other party would soon be in power. The public knows this and understands it; thus President Clinton's 60 percent approval rating.
In fact, the public is far more concerned about public schools that are deteriorating, a nonprogressive tax code that punishes labor and rewards capital, prisons that are overflowing, and an economy that continues to lay off workers making a decent living and replace them with hamburger flippers.
If Senator Fred Thompson gets the $6.5 million he's looking for to finance hearings into the Democrats' fund-raising practices, that will be $6.5 million down the tubes, right behind the untold millions wasted on Whitewater and other hearings. Here's one taxpayer who hopes that Senator Tom Daschle is able to scuttle this boondoggle.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Retreat As Economy Shows Muscle

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were battered again yesterday and remained near session lows as reports that manufacturing was showing strength added to persistent investor concern that the Federal Reserve was inching closer to an increase in interest rates.
The 30-year bond dropped 11/32, to a price of 97 14/32 to yield 6.83 percent, up from 6.80 percent on Friday, and the highest yield level since Jan. 30, when it was 6.86 percent. 
 To the relief of dealers and traders, the numbers in yesterday's economic reports did not set off a full-scale flight by investors nervously awaiting testimony by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the House Banking Committee tomorrow. Last week he roiled the markets by telling the Senate that a pre-emptive policy move to avert inflation might be in order, and the markets have been on the defensive since.
Market participants are now preparing for the Labor Department's release on Friday of February's payroll data, including the number of jobs that were added to the economy last month.
Bond prices fell yesterday morning as investors sold on a report that American incomes grew an unexpected three-tenths of a percent in January, and consumer spending increased by a larger-than-expected seven-tenths of a percent. It suggested that the first quarter was picking up more strength than people had thought. Personal income was expected to be unchanged, with spending up half a percent.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index of manufacturing activity rose to 53.1, from 52 in January, higher than the 52.3 forecast by some economists, suggesting that manufacturing was expanding. All components within the index were up, and that led to increased speculation that the Fed might move to push up rates at its monetary policy meeting on March 25.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons, St. Louis, said: "The numbers today, particularly the purchasing managers, still show we have a well-balanced economy, but there are potential problems down the road, including rising commodity prices, rising wages, which we have seen in previous reports. But the concern now is focused on the Friday payroll data."
Some market participants, discounting the prospect of a rate rise, have suggested that Mr. Greenspan used his testimony as the alternative to a tightening.
Mr. Thayer agreed that "Mr. Greenspan would like to maintain current policy as long as he can without raising rates," and said that "so far the Fed has been successful in promoting growth with very little inflation." But market participants are a pessimistic lot and have begun to price in the increased risk of an interest rate increase, he added.
Looking ahead to Friday, Mr. Thayer said he expected a healthy increase in the payroll number, which he said was not necessarily something to be alarmed about. "The unemployment rate may come down, and we may see high consumer confidence, usually a sign of a good employment situation," Mr. Thayer said. "We might see a 7 percent long-bond yield, but not too much higher in the short run, since foreign yields are still very low relative to ours and that may attract foreign money to our market."
Yesterday's Treasury bill auction was, as expected, a bit on the weak side, traders said. The three-month bills were awarded at an average rate of 5.10 percent, up from 5.01 percent last week, while the six-month maturity was awarded at an average rate of 5.19 percent, up from 5.03 percent a week ago. Rates have risen because of the risk of an interest rate increase by the Fed, which would affect short-term rate first, then ripple out to the longer maturities. The number of bids to cover were low for both maturities.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.711	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.10%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.24%	5.40%	High Price	98.713	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.09%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.23%	5.40%	Low Price	98.708	97.371	Discounted Rate	5.11%	5.20%	Coupon Yield	5.25%	5.41%	Accepted at low price	15%	12%	Total applied for	$53,333,692	$47,335,473	Accepted	$13,082,149	$13,074,947	Noncompetitive	$1,488,055	$1,147,398	

Both issues are dated March 6. The three-month bills mature on June 5 and the six-month bills on Sept. 4.

HEADLINE: Asia's Giant, After Detours, Takes Familiar Growth Path

SERIES: THE CHINA BUSINESS: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SUZHOU, China

 BODY:
On what was a cow patch not long ago, young women in white gloves and jackets snap together pieces of plastic with a pop that announces the completion of a computer mouse, each a tiny symbol of China's growing strength as an exporter. About 40 percent of these devices are exported to the United States, including four of every five computer mice sold with Apple computers.
The women at this factory, run by a Taiwan subsidiary of Swiss-based Logitech International, earn an average of only $75 a month, but that is still more than they made on the farm. Logitech's business, by combining local labor with imported parts and management, is growing fast: Exports zoomed to $160 million in 1996, from $500,000 in 1994, the year the factory opened. 
 All along China's coast, and inland as well, thousands of companies are churning out simple electronics like the computer parts produced at Logitech, attracted by this kind of cheap, reliable labor. And these goods, along with the footwear and the toys in which China dominates global production, are fueling a tremendous surge in exports. That, in turn, has brought untold economic benefits and personal freedoms to ordinary Chinese citizens.
China's total exports reached $151 billion in 1996, a thirtyfold increase in 20 years. During some months last year, American trade figures show, China actually surpassed Japan as the nation with the greatest trade surplus with the United States.
To anxious Americans, it may seem ominously familiar. In Washington, where China is again a front-burner concern after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the question is heard over and over again: Is China becoming the next Japan, threatening American manufacturing jobs?
The tempting answer, often heard in Congress, is that America's trade problems with Beijing in 1997 look much like its problems with Tokyo in 1976.
American trade officials have contributed to such thinking by contending that China's economy operates with a host of protectionist trade barriers and by calculating that the American trade deficit with China has more than tripled in five years -- from $12.7 billion in 1991 to $39.5 billion last year. Only Japan's surplus with the United States -- $47.6 billion -- was larger last year.
Yet the differences with Japan are profound. And even the true size of China's trade imbalance with the United States is debatable. Chinese officials count it at $10 billion, and independent economists place the truth somewhere between the American and Chinese figures because each side fiddles with the way it counts goods that pass through Hong Kong.
Whatever trade statistics are used, they offer an incomplete picture of China's overall economy and its commerce with the rest of the world. China's emergence as an export powerhouse is as much a measure of broad economic trends throughout Asia as it is a consequence of Beijing's own trade policies. Unlike Japan, with years of stubborn and huge trade surpluses, China has alternated in recent years between surpluses and deficits.
Many goods once made elsewhere in Asia -- in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea -- are now produced in foreign-owned factories, like Logitech's, that have been moved to Chinese territory. First it was toys and footwear, and now it is electronics. Even by American figures, the growing deficit with China is offset to a large extent by a declining American deficit with other Asian nations. Over the last 10 years, China's annual trade imbalance with the United States has risen by $36 billion as the combined annual American trade imbalance with Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore has fallen by $26 billion.
Although Chinese products may compete on a broader scale with American goods in the future, the gains by China so far have generally not translated into job losses in the United States. China's leading exports are products that have not been produced in large quantity by American factories for more than a decade. Nor are the Chinese products competing with American goods to the degree that Japanese autos, steel and machine tools -- all industries nurtured by Tokyo -- have in the past.
"China is open to foreign direct investment and has low wages, so a lot of companies are moving production there," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "They're not selling us high-technology goods that are produced in a hothouse set up by the Government. This is pretty low-spectrum stuff. It's mainly an assembly function."
China is still full of obstacles to free trade. In addition to contending with a maddeningly disorganized bureaucracy, foreign manufacturers must bow to Government demands that they share technological expertise. Foreign-owned companies are also required to export a certain percentage of what they produce and must ship goods overseas only through Chinese trading companies. And China provides huge subsidies to state-owned industries, which are shielded from competition.
Chinese officials have offered to reduce trade barriers in exchange for membership in the World Trade Organization, a step that would allow the country to enjoy low to zero tariffs. But in China there is always a vast gulf between changing a law and enforcing the change.
Still, over the long run the United States has enjoyed benefits from China's export boom, even if they are not as plentiful as American policy makers desire.
By granting "most favored nation" trade status and the low tariffs that come with it, the United States has steadily encouraged China to develop its economy, in part so that China would eventually open itself to American goods. And it has, as any visitor to China today can see: In recent years, Motorola has sold more beepers, Coca-Cola more soft drinks and Boeing more airplanes than have any of their competitors in China, foreign or domestic. Of those three products, however, only airplanes are reflected in trade figures because the beepers and soft drinks are produced within China.
China, in the process, has knit itself into the global economy to a greater extent than ever before in a trading history that reaches back to silk routes and Marco Polo. Logitech is an example: Each mouse that the company sells overseas is counted as a Chinese export, but profits go to its shareholders, including the Italian and Swiss founders who met as students at Stanford University. Logitech International has applied to sell shares in the United States later this year.
"China-U.S. trade has become all wrapped up in politics, and you can debate it this way and that," said Qiu Xiangrong, a Chinese economist. "Yet trade is basically about buying and selling, so it's always good for both sides."
 
Transformations
Opening Up Jobs And Workers' Eyes
Over the last two decades, steadily growing trade has helped transform what was an isolated Maoist state not long ago. Money making has become the priority of most government-run enterprises, replacing the traditional emphasis on feeding, clothing and housing workers. Opening China to trade, and the information that comes with it, has substantially improved the lives and liberties of hundreds of millions of Chinese, even if many are still poor and the Government remains authoritarian.
Outside Shanghai, Zhu Wenjun says her life has changed immeasurably since she quit being a schoolteacher earning $25 a month and joined the Nanhui Foreign Trade Corporation, where she is a $360-a-month office manager.
Blushing slightly as she admitted enjoying her higher income, Ms. Zhu, 45, said that working at a company that exports toys and garments has opened her eyes to people, ideas and fashions she did not know existed.
"Now I am talking with people overseas and thinking about economic issues," Ms. Zhu said. "It used to be that when you became a teacher, you were a teacher for life. Now you can switch jobs."
Asked about the downside to her more urban, more modern life, she said: "My son is 18, and he's so spoiled. He only wants to wear designer brands."
In a sense, the flowering of trade with China is an extension of American intentions in Asia that date to the 1950's and 1960's, when the United States threw open its markets to exports from Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong to help counter Communism through economic growth.
In 1972, when Richard M. Nixon became the first American President to visit the People's Republic of China, ordinary Chinese citizens risked imprisonment for communicating with foreigners. In 1975, the year before Mao Zedong died, China's combined imports and exports totaled just $4.75 billion, and its role in the world's trade was smaller than it had been 50 years earlier.
But after Mr. Deng began overhauling China's economy in 1978, foreign trade companies were set up to coordinate dealings with outsiders, and profit incentives gave Chinese companies a reason to make garments and toys that could be exported. At the same time, China began allowing imports of foreign cars, airplanes and consumer goods.
Washington took steps to assist China's economic development. Congress bestowed most-favored trade status on China in 1980, a year after President Jimmy Carter established diplomatic relations, even though China's restrictions on emigration violated the standards set for the granting of lower import tariffs.
By the early 1990's, China was attracting significant amounts of foreign investment, which totaled $170 billion by the end of 1996, though Western and Japanese companies have often found doing business in China dauntingly bureaucratic and unpredictable. They have moved slowly, and have been outpaced by investors from Hong Kong, and later from Taiwan, whose language and culture are as helpful as their modest-sized goals, like the assembly of toys and shoes in southern China.
Outside investment has improved China's ability to make export-quality products. As a result, the percentage of its exports made by enterprises with foreign investment grew steadily, from 1 percent in 1985 to 40 percent in 1996. And, because foreign operations are more closely regulated by Chinese authorities, the factories run by outside investors almost always have better working conditions than those in their lackluster state-owned counterparts.
Some Chinese trading companies have tried to sell goods made with prison labor, but the scale of such trade has always been hard to determine. American investigators have been unable to prove that prison-made products have actually been exported to the United States, in part because they have been routinely denied access to prisons.
Huge portions of China's imports, meanwhile, apparently go uncounted. Tens of billions of dollars worth of consumer goods, notably cars and cigarettes, are believed to be smuggled into China each year to avoid onerous import duties. Chinese officials admit that high tariffs led to cigarette smuggling so rampant that in 1994, out of 80 billion American and other foreign-brand cigarettes that were sold in China, not a single one was legally imported.
With the exception of a scant increase last year, China's imports from the United States have shown a strong and steady rise, mainly in such costly items as aircraft and power generation equipment. Beijing says its American imports hit $17 billion in 1996, although Washington says $12 billion. But because exports to the United States increased even faster -- Beijing puts them at $27 billion in 1996; Washington says $50 billion -- the trade gap has grown steadily. And Chinese exports are highly visible to ordinary Americans, whether they are buying clothing or electronics.
"Americans may feel like their stores are full of things made in China, but they're all small items like shoes and toys," said Ma Xuejie, a trade official in Shanghai. "We're buying airplanes and machinery from America, and think how many shoes we have to sell to pay for one airplane."
 
Transplants
Taking Factories From Others in Asia
The way exports are rising at Logitech in Suzhou, 50 miles west of Shanghai, an airplane should be affordable this year and perhaps two next year.
"All the manufacturing is coming over here from Taiwan now," said Chet Wong, plant manager at Logitech. "We're ramping up pretty fast."
Eager for foreign investment, local officials in Suzhou, an ancient city once known for its exotic gardens, staked out a chunk of farmland and promised high-technology companies a steady supply of reliable, inexpensive factory workers, and a minimum of bureaucratic interference.
Acer Inc., Taiwan's computer giant, opened a plant in Suzhou last year to produce computer monitors and keyboards that it once made in Taiwan. It began by making 200,000 keyboards a month last year, and expects to make 4 million a month by the end of this year.
"We would never have come here five years ago," said J. S. Pan, Acer's deputy managing director here. "The infrastructure was too weak. But now we can do it. Taiwan is too expensive."
With the movement of assembly-oriented production to China from other Asian countries, the changes for ordinary people are palpable.
Ye Xiuying, 26, runs a small clock shop in Dongguan, a city in Guangdong Province. Her fortunes have followed those of that area in southern China, which boomed in the mid-1980's but has slowed in recent years.
On a recent afternoon, business was slack enough that Ms. Ye, a cheerful woman with puffy cheeks and thin wire-rimmed glasses, could sip green tea as she told her story.
Assigned to a farm-machinery factory by her high school when she finished eight years ago, she found the work boring and the pay -- $35 a month -- "really pathetic." She married a fellow worker after persuading her father to lend them a few thousand dollars to start their own tiny clothing factory. They hired half a dozen seamstresses and started making cotton skirts that they sold to Hong Kong, for export to the United States and Europe.
"Everything was moving so fast, I learned new things every day," said Ms. Ye, recalling the excitement of running a business and of seeing her income climb to $1,200 a month.
She was able to buy her own home, for $10,000, and to travel overseas, something rare for Chinese until recently, but now available to millions. She went to Thailand last year on a six-day tour. Next she wants to visit the United States, though a three-week tour available to residents of Dongguan costs $6,000, too expensive for Ms. Ye.
More important, she was able to have a second child. That is forbidden under China's one-child policy, but enforcement varies from town to town and in Dongguan it takes the form of a one-time fine of $1,800, which Ms. Ye said was well worth it.
"I wanted a girl," she said. "I already had a boy."
When the economy here slowed in 1994, Ms. Ye and her husband had to shut their operation. He now manages a company making plastic shells for cigarette lighters that are exported, and she runs the clock shop. Still, they are far better off than they were as factory workers.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Posts Gains, Ending 3-Day Losing Streak

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday, snapping a three-session losing streak that followed a warning by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, last Wednesday about high stock prices and raising the possibility of higher interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 41.18 points, to 6,918.92 after losing more than 160 points the last three sessions. The 30-stock average, which set a record of 7,067.46 on Feb. 18, was led higher by Du Pont, which gained 4 1/8, to 111 3/8, after its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,292 to 1,270, on moderate volume of 437.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors were also rudely surprised yesterday when the AT&T Corporation outlined plans to enter new local telephone and wireless markets that will require huge spending, eating into earnings; indeed, the company warned that its first-quarter earnings per share could drop about 10 percent below the fourth quarter's 76 cents. AT&T fell 3 1/8, to 36 3/4.
Weakness in the bond market, where the price of the 30-year bond dropped 11/32, to 97 14/32, coupled with AT&T's decline, made the stock market's moderate gains appear all the more impressive, analysts said.
"You had two major negatives today and the market was still able to basically reverse course," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.
When buyers did emerge, they descended on the technology stocks, which had led the market to highs in mid-February and lately have led it back down. Intel rose 4, to 145 7/8, on optimism that chip makers may be on the verge of recovery with the worst of their inventory problems past. I.B.M. was up 1 3/8, to 145 1/8, and Microsoft rose 2, to 99 1/2.
Analysts called the rebound encouraging but stopped short of predicting an end to the market's recent weakness.
"It's going to be a while before these stocks regain their luster," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Company.
Analysts said that Mr. Greenspan's scheduled appearance before the House Banking Committee tomorrow and a key monthly employment report due on Friday were likely to preclude any meaningful rise in stocks in the meantime.
But with the broad market following technology stocks higher and shrugging off the AT&T surprise, analysts said it was clear that at least one major change had occurred on Wall Street.
"I'm not certain AT&T is viewed as a bellwether anymore," Mr. Barthel said. "Now we look to companies like Intel and Microsoft."
Among individual issues, Conrail Inc. surged 7 1/8, to 111 5/8, as expectation mounted that a four-month takeover battle for control of the railroad was nearing an end.

Analysts predicted Conrail's assets would be divided between its rival bidders, the CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Corporation.
CSX jumped 2 7/8, to 49, and Norfolk Southern rose 2 3/4, to 93 7/8.
BHC Financial Inc. soared 11 7/8, to 31 7/8, after the company agreed to be acquired by Fiserv Inc., which climbed 3 7/8, to 36 5/8.
COR Therapeutics Inc. slid 2 15/16, to 9 3/8, after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended against approving intrifiban, a derivative of rattlesnake venom the company hoped to market to treat some heart ailments.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.18 points, 1,311.18.

HEADLINE: Clinton Figures On the Budget Are Questioned

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that President Clinton's budget plan would leave the Government with a deficit of $69 billion in 2002, rather than a surplus of $17 billion, as Mr. Clinton asserted last month.
Most of the discrepancy is caused by the Administration's having more optimistic economic assumptions. 
 In addition, the Congressional Budget Office said that Mr. Clinton's proposals to slow the growth of Medicare would not save as much as he has predicted. The program finances health care for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled, and the conflict over it was a large factor in the stalemate between Mr. Clinton and Congress in 1995 and 1996.
Commenting on the report, Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said, "The President should submit a new budget, one that is in balance in 2002."
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the new figures from the budget office, especially the Medicare numbers, were disheartening.
Mr. Clinton submitted his budget on Feb. 6. The nonpartisan budget office reviews the President's plan on behalf of Congress. It often disagrees with the White House.
On Feb. 13, the director of the office, June E. O'Neill, said the Administration's plan would produce a deficit of at least $50 billion in 2002. But that estimate was based only on differences in economic assumptions. Today's estimates reflect a more detailed analysis of the substance of the President's proposals.
With no change in law, the Congressional Budget Office said, the Federal deficit would rise to $153 billion in 2002, from $107 billion last year. Mr. Clinton's proposals would cut the deficit in that year by 55 percent, the office said.
Mr. Clinton has said that his Medicare proposals would save $34.6 billion in 2002 and a total of $100 billion from 1998 through 2002. But the Congressional Budget Office said that Mr. Clinton's proposals would save $29 billion in 2002 and $82 billion over all five years.
In his budget, Mr. Clinton proposed expanding Medicare benefits and cutting payments to doctors, hospitals and other providers. The Congressional office found that the new benefits would cost more than Mr. Clinton said, while the cuts in payments to providers would save less.
Without a change in law, the office said, the deficit would rise to $121 billion next year and under Mr. Clinton's plan it would be $145 billion.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Strengthening For Industry American Incomes And Spending Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Activity among American manufacturers improved in February from a month earlier as orders and production accelerated, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday.
A separate report, by the Commerce Department, showed that Americans' incomes unexpectedly grew during January, prompting consumers to increase their spending. Much of the rise in incomes, however, was attributed to special factors. 
 The two reports showed enough economic strength to prompt concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon.
A third set of economic data issued yesterday showed that construction spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index rose to 53.1 last month from 52 during January. A reading of 50 or more means manufacturing is expanding, while one below 50 signals a slowdown. Analysts had forecast that the index would rise to only 52.3 in February.
 The closely watched price index, an indication of the inflation rate, rose to 55.1 in February from 51.4 in December. That suggested that more manufacturers were paying higher prices.
 In the report on income and spending, the Commerce Department said personal income rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January, slower than December's increase, which was revised to seven-tenths of 1 percent from eight-tenths of 1 percent. But it was in contrast to the expectations of analysts, who had forecast, on average, that January's report would show no change in incomes.
The Commerce Department said, however, that January's increase was inflated by special factors, including cost-of-living increases for Federal programs like Social Security and pay increases for civilian and military personnel. Without the special factors, personal income increased less than one-tenth of 1 percent, the department said.
Personal spending grew seven-tenths of 1 percent in January, faster than December's gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, which was revised downward from half a percent, and above analysts' forecasts for a January rise of half a percent.
Economists have said that Americans will continue to spend money and that their willingness is being fueled by more than rising incomes. The stock market's boom, job creation and near-record levels of confidence in the economy are also cited by economists.
In today's report, the Commerce Department also said that disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased six-tenths of 1 percent in January, while the savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- stood at 5.4 percent, unchanged from the previous month.
In the report on construction activity, the Commerce Department said spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, to an annual rate of $589.8 billion. Spending declined nine-tenths of 1 percent in December as harsh weather in many regions kept builders indoors. December's decline was originally reported as seven-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in January's construction spending.
In all of 1996, construction spending rose 4 percent, to $568.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Charles Dederich, 83, Synanon Founder, Dies

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Charles E. Dederich, a reformed alcoholic who founded Synanon, the drug rehabilitation program that won widespread acclaim and amassed great wealth before it became associated with violence, died on Friday in Kaweah Delta Hospital in Visalia, Calif. Mr. Dederich, who lived in Visalia, was 83.
Mr. Dederich had several strokes beginning in the late 1980's. The cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure, said his wife, Ginny. 
 Founded in 1958 with a $33 unemployment check in a seedy flat in Ocean Park, Calif., Synanon eventually attracted thousands of drug addicts and dropouts from the social turbulence of the 1960's to therapeutic communities for a course of tough, innovative treatment.
"Crime is stupid, delinquency is stupid and the use of narcotics is stupid," Mr. Dederich once said. "What Synanon is dealing with is addiction to stupidity."
Synanon and its methods became the subject of books, articles, television documentaries and a 1965 film, "Synanon," which starred Edmond O'Brien as Mr. Dederich and Eartha Kitt as his third wife, Bettye.
By 1980, with millions of dollars in donations from American businesses, vast real estate holdings, overseas branches and its own lucrative enterprises Synanon, which was exempt from Federal and state taxes as a charitable trust, had compiled assets of $30 million to $50 million, according to the estimates of law-enforcement authorities.
But the organization, which claimed credit for thousands of rehabilitations, evolved from a renowned drug rehabilitation agency into what California officials described as a wealthy, authoritarian cult.
Accounts of violence and the insistence by Mr. Dederich on forced vasectomies for men in Synanon, mandatory abortions for women and the divorce of more than 230 of its married couples who were to switch to other partners led to investigations and unfavorable newspaper publicity.
In 1980, Mr. Dederich pleaded no contest to charges that he and two members of Synanon's security force had conspired to commit murder by placing a four-and-a-half-foot rattlesnake in the mailbox of a lawyer who had sued the organization.
The lawyer, Paul Morantz, who was acting on behalf of former Synanon members and relatives of members who maintained they were being held in the organization against their will, was bitten and hospitalized for six days.
Mr. Dederich, who said he was in poor health, was sentenced to five years' probation, fined $5,000 and ordered not to participate actively in running Synanon.
By the middle of the 1980's, when the organization declared itself a religion, was condemned by the Government for a corporate policy of "terror and violence" and was stripped of its tax-exempt status, Synanon was declining in influence and prestige.
Charles Edwin Dederich, who was named for his father and known generally as Chuck, was born in Toledo, Ohio, on March 22, 1913.
When he was 4, his father, an alcoholic, was killed in an automobile accident. He was 8 when a brother died and 12 when his mother, the former Agnes Kountz, a classical concert singer, married a man he loathed.
Mr. Dederich was drinking heavily before he graduated from high school. He dropped out of the University of Notre Dame after 18 months because of poor grades and lost good jobs and two wives because of his drinking. When he was 43, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous, and after a while he turned his apartment in Ocean Park into a sanctuary first for alcoholics and soon for drug addicts as well.
"I say this with as much humility as I am capable, which isn't very much, but when I sit down and start to talk, people start gathering," he said in a 1980 deposition. "It is inevitable. No matter where I do that, it just happens. I can't stop it."
Underlying Synanon's approach was the conviction that addicts were not adults, and it was futile to try to cure them with adult procedures.
Mr. Dederich discarded Alcoholics Anonymous's emphasis on religion and built a methodology around a therapeutic community, a tough, disciplined, drug-free environment with a dash of tender loving care.
Attack therapy was an essential component of the treatment. Three times weekly, members met in small groups, for violently outspoken discussions, called games or synanons, in which they released pent-up hostilities.
On Sept. 15, 1958, Synanon -- a name coined when an addict stumbled over the words "seminar" and "symposium," gave up and called them "synanon" -- was incorporated as a nonprofit California foundation with 40 members.
Mr. Dederich's widow said it was in the early days of Synanon that he created the saying, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life."
Mr. Dederich was married four times. Two of his wives left him because of his drinking. His third wife, Bettye, died in 1977. Besides his widow, the former Ginny Schorin, whom he married nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Dederich is survived by a son from his first marriage, Chuck, of Visalia; a daughter from his second marriage, Jady Dederich of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Greenwich Declines to Put Its Manicured Hand Out

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., March 3

 BODY:
Practically every town in America pines for Federal money to enhance its appearance, and local politicians campaign on their success in corralling grants. But the political leaders here have decided to thumb their noses at $500,000 in Federal money that would have brightened this town's main shopping street.
The money was there for the asking. But most of the town's leaders said they decided it would be unseemly for a town as wealthy as Greenwich to accept scarce Federal dollars for luxuries like wrought-iron benches, quaint street lamps and potted plants when there are far poorer towns in need of basic commodities like decent shelter. 
 It is more than a decision of conscience, Greenwich leaders say. They are also making a political point -- one they would like the nation to hear -- that too much Federal money is available for relative frivolities.
"If we're going to balance the Federal budget," said James G. Boutelle, who is a member of the town's legislature, the 240-member Representative Town Meeting, "you need to say no to pork. It's easy to criticize somebody else's pork, but when it comes to the bacon in your own backyard, you've got to be able to say no also."
The $500,000 was available under the Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which pays for improvements to highways, streets and rail and transit systems. While some Federal money is geared to income level, the money from Istea (pronounced "ice tea") is available equally to the South Bronx and Greenwich. Recent Istea grants in the region have been used to restore the concourse ceiling at Grand Central Terminal and for Sleepy Hollow Landing in North Tarrytown, N.Y.
The streetscape money could theoretically help a rundown stretch of Tremont Avenue in the Bronx attract new merchants, but Greenwich does not need to attract new merchants. The tony mile-long shopping strip does not have a vacant store. As Greenwich leaders saw it, retail shops that sold $400 pocketbooks, and outposts of upscale chains like Ralph Lauren, could afford to do their own fixing up.
"If I as a citizen woke up and read that the Federal Government was going to spend half a million dollars on planting new palm trees along Rodeo Drive, I'd be angry, and I don't see this as being very different from that," said Mr. Boutelle, who was state chairman of Ross Perot's 1992 Presidential campaign.
The decision to rely on Greenwich's own resources was popular today along Greenwich Avenue. "It's good to see communities with a conscience," said Bill McCoy, a lawyer who lives in Queens but works at Price Waterhouse here. "Hearing this makes me feel a whole lot better about this community. However, it makes you wonder, what is the government criteria for handing out money?"
Angie Sall, who lives in Greenwich and was shopping for baby accessories at the Whitney shop, said, "I think the town should be responsible for its own improvements."
One dissenter was Trudi Fackler, a travel agent from Purchase, N.Y., who was shopping at Saks.
"I'm so sick of the sanctimonious attitude," she said. "I believe for life to be pleasant, there should be beauty. Anyway if this money doesn't go toward something beautiful, what will it go for? Are they being noble here in Greenwich or what?"
The project, of course, had its proponents, chief among them the Chamber of Commerce and Thomas Ragland, the First Selectman, the equivalent of mayor in Greenwich. Mr. Ragland, an architect, contended that Greenwich Avenue had experienced a 25 percent vacancy rate in 1990 and that its economy could be threatened again if it did not take the necessary precautions.
"The town sends $1 billion down to Washington, D.C., in tax revenues, and I don't think that getting $500,000 back is the end of the world," he said.
The idea for a $750,000 renovation of the shopping strip germinated in 1994, and officials soon obtained a promise from Federal and state officials that $500,000 in Istea money would be available.
All that was needed was approval by the town's legislature. Last May, it rejected the move. Then, two weeks ago, Mr. Ragland and other supporters tried to restart the project by asking for an initial grant of $60,000 of Federal planning money. But the town's Board of Estimate and Taxation immediately turned that down before the legislature even got a chance to vote it down again.
Now the only way the street can be beautified is with town and private funds. To make sure that everyone understands that the town is unalterably opposed to spending Federal dollars on beautification of an affluent boulevard, Marie Hertzig, a member of the Representative Town Meeting and chairman of its Budget Overview Committee, is composing a committee letter to Federal and state legislators.
"Lack of resources should be the first requirement of eligibility of funds," a draft of her letter says. "Unfortunately, the only requirement is a municipality's ability to get an application in on time. The result of which is that wealthy communities such as Greenwich have the ability to squander away funds for possible frivolous projects at the expense of more needy towns."

HEADLINE: Welcoming Arafat, Clinton Rebukes Israel

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
With Yasir Arafat at his side, President Clinton delivered a mild but relatively rare rebuke of Israel today, saying the Israeli Government's decision last week to allow construction of thousands of new homes for Jews in East Jerusalem had created "mistrust" and could damage the peace effort in the region.
The President made his remarks as he began an extended meeting this morning with Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who raised the subject of the new Jewish housing in a tone that Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, later described as "very concerned and emotional." 
 Today's meeting was the sixth between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Arafat, but it had added significance as the first meeting held directly between the two men without the presence of other Middle East leaders, or, as Mr. McCurry put it, "in the context of some other gathering."
Mr. Arafat's meeting at the White House came on a day when Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as in East Jerusalem, took part in a general strike to protest the Israeli decision to build the first of 2,500 of 6,500 homes on a hill in East Jerusalem known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim and in Hebrew as Har Homa.
Sitting beside Mr. Arafat in the Oval Office, Mr. Clinton said it was important for the Israelis and Palestinians "to be building confidence and working together" as the peace talks move forward and then lent his voice to the chorus of international criticism of the new housing.
"I would prefer the decision not have been made, because I don't think it builds confidence," Mr. Clinton said. "I think it builds mistrust, and I wish that it had not been made."
In meetings with Mr. Arafat and in public remarks, the White House seemed eager to lend its support and encouragement to the Palestinian leader -- in part to shore up the peace effort, which has lagged again since the brief burst of enthusiasm after the agreement in January that led to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Hebron.
Mr. Arafat went on to meet separately with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, as well as Secretary of Treasury Robert E. Rubin and the director of the Agency for International Development, Brian Atwood. At lunch at the State Department, the Americans and Mr. Arafat's delegations held lengthy discussions on increasing investments in the Palestinian territories.
The State Department then announced the creation of a joint committee -- like the ones the United States has with Russia, South Africa and Egypt -- that is to meet regularly to discuss diplomatic, economic and cultural concerns.
Neither the President nor his aides discussed what the United States would do -- or could do -- to reverse the decision by the Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Clinton Administration, like those those before it, has opposed Jewish settlements in the territories captured by Israel in 1967. And Administration officials had quietly urged Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet beforehand not to move ahead with the housing project in East Jerusalem, which Israeli seized from Jordan in the 1967 war.
While he delivered a rebuke, Mr. Clinton also made clear that the United States' role was that of mediator, helping but not taking sides. In answering another question -- on whether the United States should, as many in Congress have demanded, recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital -- Mr. Clinton said the United States should avoid staking a position on a matter that will be part of the "final status" talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.
"I think that would be a big mistake," he said.
But officials portrayed Mr. Clinton's remarks on the housing project, which echoed those made by White House and State Department spokesmen last week, as a subtle but significant warning to the Israelis not to take steps to provoke the Palestinians or throw up obstacles to the peace effort.
"We really rolled out the carpet for Arafat," an Administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. At the same time, the official said, the President's remarks were an effort to show "that we're a little frustrated with Netanyahu."
Mr. Arafat, for his part, said the new Israeli construction in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to make the capital of a Palestinian state, was intended "to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem." But he stopped short of warnings by other Palestinian leaders that the housing in East Jerusalem could lead to violent protests.
Today's meeting with Mr. Arafat followed one the President had with Mr. Netanyahu last month. And it precedes a series of meetings with Middle Eastern leaders in which the Administration hopes to restore momentum to the peace effort. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan are scheduled to come for meetings with Mr. Clinton and others later this month.

HEADLINE: 4,100 New Rooms at the Inn? Barely Enough, Some Say

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
As New York continues to bask in a tourism boom, there has been a steady stream of announcements of new hotel projects. With last week's news that a French luxury hotel is planned for midtown, there are now about 4,100 rooms on the drawing board, and that's on top of the more than 500 rooms that were added in recent months with the opening of the SoHo Grand and the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Despite the number of rooms planned, analysts say that New York, which now has the highest occupancy rate and the largest number of visitors in at least 30 years, could easily support an infusion of 5,000 to 10,000. 
 But according to industry officials and analysts, that many rooms will probably not open in New York. Because of the expense of developing hotels, the difficulty of financing, the shortage of sites and, perhaps most importantly, the potential for a quicker return on high-end apartment buildings, hotels are still not the first choice of many developers.
"If there is a land site, I would say people are more prone to do residential than a hotel right now because it's easier to finance," said Howard L. Michaels, chairman of the Carlton Group, a commercial brokerage firm in Manhattan.
The 4,100 rooms that are planned are spread across 10 projects. It will be five years before all are on the market, however, and the gain is diminished by the loss of a few major properties. The 428-room Dorset Hotel closed last summer after being bought by the Museum of Modern Art for its expansion, and the St. Moritz and the Mayfair, with 880 rooms between them, are to become luxury residential buildings. The city is left, then, with about 2,800 rooms in the pipeline.
"We're essentially flat," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, an international hotel and real estate consulting firm. "When you're talking about a city that has 60,000 hotel rooms, that's a drop in the bucket. It won't have a material impact on the city's occupancy rate."
Given current demand, Mr. Fox said, the city could absorb as many as 10,000 new rooms. Such an infusion would depress the average occupancy rate though not to a point where the hotel industry stops turning a profit. But, he acknowledged, the economics of hotel development might not justify that kind of growth.
"Hotel investors were burned in the boom of the late 80's," said Richard M. Kielar, a senior vice president of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company in Manhattan, "and now they look very closely at the exact location and the overall potential for bookings."
Steven C. Witkoff, who is part of a development team converting an office building at 866 Third Avenue, at 52d Street, into a hotel, agreed. "People are a little gun-shy of developing ground-up hotels because of the inherently cyclical nature of the business," Mr. Witkoff said.
The cost of renovating an existing structure, he explained, can be almost half that of building from scratch, but there simply are not many good sites available.
Hotel owners, themselves, do not want a flood of more hotels. They feel they have fought hard to get to this point of profitability -- winning a reduction in both the state and city occupancy tax in 1994 and trumpeting New York City to Americans and foreigners alike. In addition to the average occupancy rate, which hit 81.8 percent last year, the average daily room rate is at an all-time high, having jumped to $175 last year from $135 in 1991, PKF Consulting said.
"New York is filling the rooms it has and does not need an influx of 3,000 or 5,000 more rooms," said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City. "People say you can't get a room before Christmas. But that's a phenomenon going on even in bad years. To add 5,000 more rooms that are going to stay vacant the rest of the year is silly."
The hotel industry's current success came about quite quickly. In 1991, the citywide average occupancy rate sagged to 67.6 percent, the lowest point since 1975. Several major hotel projects conceived in the robust 1980's opened around 1990, just as the recession was bearing down on the New York region.
But at the end of 1993, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau started to notice increases in airport arrivals and hotel occupancy rates. And the numbers kept rising, due to lower hotel taxes, reduced crime, an improving economy and favorable exchange rates, hotel and tourism officials say.
Analysts say it would be almost impossible for today's overall average occupancy rate to go much higher because of the business's seasonal nature.
"There's nothing within the New York lodging industry that's going to cause its demise because new supply is fairly modest," said Arthur Adler, a partner of the hospitality consulting practice at the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand in Manhattan. "So given the demand levels, there would have to be something external, whether it's a recession or a war or crime wave, to burst the bubble."
Some analysts and tourism officials worry that New York is letting business slip away to other cities. Not only is the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center inadequate for the biggest conventions, but during peak months like October "room availability" becomes an oxymoron.
"The question on everyone's mind is, 'How do we keep this going?' " said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "You can be a victim of your own success. If no one can get a hotel room at Christmas, and word gets out, the next time the hotels may be empty."

HEADLINE: Rival Suitors May Split Up Conrail Parts

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Conrail is close to a $10.3 billion agreement with the CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Corporation that would split Conrail's railroad network between the two carriers, bringing to an end a bloody four-month battle for control of rail freight in the East, people familiar with the negotiations said yesterday.
Under the tentative plan, CSX -- possibly with Norfolk Southern -- would buy Conrail for about $115 a share in cash and then sell about half of Conrail's rail lines to rival Norfolk Southern, giving both companies roughly equal freight routes throughout the Northeast and providing them each with access to New York, the largest market in the country. 
 Norfolk Southern would pay CSX about $4.2 billion. CSX, in turn, would be required to sweeten its existing offer for Conrail by almost $1 billion, thereby matching Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion hostile offer for Conrail and allowing both companies to claim victory.
"All three sides came to the conclusion that a settlement was the only way to get this resolved in the near term," said Brian Routledge, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "You'll now have two balanced rail freight systems in the East and the West."
Conrail's directors, who had been meeting all day yesterday, issued a statement last night that stopped short of endorsing the deal, although they appeared to have given up on their longstanding desire to keep the company intact. The statement said the directors had authorized Conrail management to "negotiate an amendment" to the CSX merger agreement "that would assure that the Conrail shareholders receive $115 in cash per share at the earliest possible date."
Investors embraced the proposed agreement, driving shares of Conrail up $7.125 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $111.625, less than the deal price but 57 percent higher than when the battle began last October. Norfolk Southern shares rose $2.75 to close at $93.875 and CSX rose $2.875, to $49. Word of the tentative agreement appeared on Sunday in The Washington Post.
The apparent breakthrough in the railroad war was a victory for Norfolk Southern, which had sought to break up the CSX-Conrail merger, contending that it was anticompetitive in that it would give the combined company virtual control over rail freight in the Northeast.
"We are pleased with today's announcement that CSX and Conrail are negotiating to resolve the issues facing the Eastern railroads," David R. Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern, said in a statement last night.
The battle in the East began in October, when CSX announced a friendly $8.1 billion merger with Conrail, which had a virtual monopoly over freight traffic in the Northeast. Norfolk Southern, which had long sought a combination with Conrail, countered nine days later with a higher, all-cash offer that touched off a bidding war that sent the price up more than $2 billion.
Under the terms of the tentative agreement proposed by Mr. Goode in a letter to the other two companies, CSX would make a tender offer for Conrail, keeping most of the old New York Central line, a valuable track that runs up the Hudson River valley to Albany and then west to Buffalo and Chicago. Norfolk Southern would get the main line of the old Pennsylvania Railroad, which runs through New Jersey and Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh and points west, as well as the "southern tier," a slow-moving track through the less populated cities in upstate New York to Buffalo and beyond.
The proposed split of Conrail bears a remarkable resemblance to a partition of Conrail first proposed by Norfolk Southern to CSX during secret talks last November. The two sides failed to reach an agreement then and the discussions riled Conrail management, which had sought to preserve the integrity of the Conrail system.
But the deal ran into a barrage of criticism from shippers and port officials in New York and Baltimore, who feared that the lack of rail competition would inhibit economic growth. The plan also drew fire from Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of the Burlington Northern railroad, who told securities analysts last November that he would oppose any merger that produced a single, dominant railroad in the East.
Conrail had been able to use Pennsylvania's stiff anti-takeover statutes to protect its deal with CSX from Norfolk's sweeter, hostile offer. But the merger became deadlocked on Jan. 17, when Norfolk Southern persuaded Conrail shareholders to oppose a resolution that would have allowed CSX to complete the deal.
The three companies agreed to hold talks concerning a possible deal in January, after Federal officials signaled their desire to see a settlement that provided a competitive balance between the railroads. But after a brief initial meeting of the companies, nothing happened.
Sensing that CSX was more than willing to come to an accommodation, Mr. Goode in a Feb. 24 letter to Conrail and CSX proposed a deal that essentially carved Conrail in half.
"There weren't any other meetings," said one person involved in the negotiations. David LeVan, the chairman of Conrail, "wouldn't come to the table," the person said. "He went into a bunker. But enough dynamite will blast anybody out of their hole. The letter was the dynamite."
It is unclear what will become of Mr. LeVan, and his management team. Under the old merger agreement, Mr. LeVan was eventually to become the chairman of the combined company. But there may no longer be a place for Mr. LeVan in the new deal, according to people on all sides of the negotiations.
If approved by Conrail and by Federal regulators at the Surface Transportation Board, the deal to carve up Conrail and create two major railroads in the East would set the stage for what many rail experts say is the inevitable establishment of a transcontinental railroad system. With deregulation sweeping the railroad industry, some transportation experts have argued fewer and larger railroad companies would create a faster, cheaper more rational system that would better be able to capture the freight traffic now moving by truck on the nation's highways.
Indeed, railroads' share of freight traffic rose to 40.6 percent in 1995, from 36.4 percent in 1985. After a series of mergers in the West, the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe have come to dominate the region.

HEADLINE: Budget Surplus Gives Albany New Questions

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 3

 BODY:
Legislative leaders agreed with the Governor today that New York State's coffers, swelled by the boom on Wall Street, would be awash in tax money for the next 13 months, although the state's overall economic growth continued to lag behind the nation's.
The forecasts vary only in their degree of optimism. Four days ago, Gov. George E. Pataki predicted that through March 31, 1998, the state would take in $650 million more than his budget office had forecast just six weeks earlier. Today, Senate leaders projected the extra cash at $922 million, and Assembly leaders put the figure at more than $2 billion. Whatever its true size, the bonanza will be added to the $1.3 billion surplus the state had already accumulated last April from higher revenues and lower expenses that had been expected. 
 For years, the Assembly has pushed for more spending than the Governor or the Senate, and it has justified that spending in part with higher revenue projections. In the last two years, its income predictions turned out to be the most accurate of the three.
The release of revenue estimates traditionally serves as the starting gun for serious budget negotiations. Under state law, the government must produce a budget by midnight on March 31, just four weeks away. But the state has not adopted a budget on time since 1984, and last year, the Governor and Legislature set a nationwide record with a budget that was 104 days late. This year, with lawmakers threatening to tie issues like welfare policy and rent regulation to the budget, it could once again go well past the deadline.
But for the first time in years, a different kind of debate is shaping up here, one less about what to cut than about where to spend. Mr. Pataki and the Republicans who control the Senate want more and faster tax cuts, both houses want more school aid, and the Democratic leaders of the Assembly want to rescind the Governor's proposed Medicaid cuts and college tuition increases. Of all the roles in the budget drama, no one in power has volunteered to play the voice of caution.
That there could be such a debate stems from the anomaly of a Wall Street boom's producing a glut of tax money for the state, even as longer-lasting signs of economic strength, like job growth, remain sluggish. In addition, New York struggles under what is by far the largest debt burden of any state and has a credit rating worse than for any other state but Louisiana.
So while the state's elected officials debate what to do with all that money, outside budget analysts warn that the bonanza should be used to fix long-term problems, and that the good times could evaporate in one bad day on Wall Street.
"New York's leaders are about to blow a historic opportunity to position ourselves for the next century," said Cynthia B. Green, vice president for state studies at the Citizens' Budget Commission, a private group that analyzes the city and state budgets. "The fiscally responsible plan would be to use all of this surplus to pay down outstanding debt."
New York owes more than $30 billion, and the debt is climbing rapidly. The state's heavy borrowing is one of the main reasons for its poor credit rating, and for analysts' concerns about the state's long-term financial health. Mr. Pataki's proposed $66.3 billion budget for the fiscal year starting April 1 allocates $3 billion just to making payments on that debt.
The two-year run-up in the stock market has produced profits for traders and investors alike; the brokerage firms are expected to pay out $8.1 billion in bonuses for 1996 performance. As a result, personal income and personal income-tax payments are rising much faster in New York than in the country as a whole, even as job growth lags well behind the national rate. Subtract Wall Street, and the state's economy is slogging along in fairly unimpressive fashion.
The same factors are producing similar effects on New York City's budget, though in exaggerated fashion, since the financial markets account for a much larger part of the city's economy. Last week, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi released a report showing that in 1996, the city's economic performance lagged behind not only the nation's but that of other cities, with areas like manufacturing and health care actually shrinking.
Budget monitors argue that the state is relying more heavily than ever on one volatile industry, the investment business, to balance its books. "Clearly, Wall Street is driving the wage base, and clearly, that's something the state can't depend on in the long run," said Robert Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. Even if there were no recession, fiscal analysts say, a bear market on Wall Street could have nearly the same effect on the state's coffers.
In his first two years as Governor, Mr. Pataki pushed for painful spending cuts, somewhat lowering the state's structural imbalance, the tendency of expenses to rise faster in the long run than income. But by his own estimate, his proposed 1997-98 budget would worsen the imbalance slightly, postponing long-term fiscal discipline until 1998 and beyond.
"The difference between New York and most other states is that most of the states have used this economic recovery to firm up their balance sheets and reduce their structural deficits," Mr. Kurtter said. "They are much better positioned to meet the next downturn than New York."
Mr. Pataki's main bid for austerity this year was in Medicaid, the fastest-growing area of state spending, where he proposed a state reduction of $572 million, or 2.5 percent. But the effect of that cut would be much greater, because medical costs rise faster than inflation, and because the Federal and local governments match state spending. Over all, his budget would mean spending 8 percent, or $2.1 billion, less on Medicaid than if the formulas were unchanged.
The Governor also proposed $400-a-year increases in full-time tuition for the State University and City University systems, and deep cuts in tuition assistance for poor students.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wants Deal With Congress on Cost-of-Living Adjustments

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
President Clinton gave his aides the go-ahead today to try to forge a deal with Congress to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs, White House officials said.
The officials said the Administration had not decided on a specific proposal but would start consulting on Tuesday with members of Congress from both parties, as well as with outside economists, to find a bipartisan way of dealing with the issue, which could determine the success of efforts to balance the budget. 
 The decision is the Administration's response to a call last week from Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, for a commission of experts to make a binding judgment on how big the cost-of-living adjustment should be each year for Social Security and other programs.
Although it does not irrevocably commit the Administration to backing a politically explosive effort to reduce increases in Social Security, the decision is the first overt sign that Mr. Clinton is willing to join Republicans in taking the inevitable heat over the issue from powerful constituencies like the elderly.
The officials said the Administration would float several ideas, including the creation of a commission to make nonbinding recommendations to Congress and the Administration.
They said the emphasis would be on trying to create a panel that would have technical credibility on a subject that is complex even for economists.
The Administration would prefer a panel whose members do not already have strong views on the subject so that their work did not appear rigged to find budget savings at the expense of benefit recipients.
The Government now relies on the Consumer Price Index, which most economists agree overstates inflation to some degree.
The index is used to set increases each year in Social Security and other Government benefit programs, and is also used to adjust tax brackets for the effects of inflation.
A panel of economists appointed by Congress reported last year that the index overstated increases in the cost of living by about 1.1 percentage points a year. By inflating benefit payments and decreasing tax revenue, an overstatement of that size would cost the Government tens of billions of dollars a year, money that could go a long way toward eliminating the Federal deficit.
Administration officials including Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary; Franklin D. Raines, the budget chief; Gene Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council, and Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, will begin sounding out members of Congress about a deal, White House aides said.
Other officials, including Janet Yellen, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, will solicit opinions from economists, they said.

To the Editor:
Joel Popkin (Op-Ed, Feb. 27) argues that Congress is attempting to correct the Consumer Price Index. That is wrong. He confuses the index with cost-of-living adjustments in Federal programs, but, to quote the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the index is not a cost-of-living index, although it is used as such. The purpose of COLA's is to insulate recipients of government programs and taxpayers from changes in the cost of living. 
 Mr. Popkin left the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1973. Since then, there have been breakthroughs in research on index number theory and in methods for estimating the value of quality change and of new products; a third of the Federal budget outlays and part of the tax code have been indexed by the Consumer Price Index. These changes increase the urgency of adopting a more accurate index to adjust benefits and taxes.
It is appropriate for the President and Congress to adjust COLA's. The commission I headed concluded that the change in the index overstates the change in the cost-of-living by a little over one percentage point a year. We agree with Mr. Popkin that the Bureau of Labor Statistics should make the improvements in the nation's price statistics, but the commission also recognizes that this will take many years.
Mr. Popkin impugns the objectivity of commission members. In fact, they are experts in the technical area of economic statistics and index numbers. Professional experts not on the commission have stated publicly that they thought our estimates were, if anything, too low.

Shoddy-Goods Factor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 25 front-page article "Majority Leader Proposes a Panel on Inflation Index" refers to Congressional and Administration moves to "fix" the Consumer Price Index, on the assumption that the adjustment would be downward. 
 Why shouldn't it be upward? For example, some urge a 0.8 percent adjustment to take into account improved products. But what about products that are worse than before -- inedible tomatoes, plastic tricycles, cramped air travel through inconvenient "hubs"? How about the shoddy manufactured items that because of design, materials and method of assembly do not last as long and cannot be repaired?
Or even improved products, like electronic equipment, that are too expensive to repair? Politicians think they have found a quiet way to cut Social Security, but let's not be fooled.

For Different Folks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Majority Leader Proposes a Panel on Inflation Index" (front page, Feb. 25): One aspect of the cost-of-living index I have not seen addressed is the different spending patterns of various income groups. To persons with per capita income under $15,000 or family income under, say, $30,000, increases in the cost of medical care, food and rent are paramount, and these costs are rising more rapidly than the Consumer Price Index. 
 If we are to base various government benefits on the C.P.I., perhaps we need more than a single index to reflect overall individual assets and income.

Cut Corporate Welfare

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Is revising the Consumer Price Index (or "correcting" its impact on Social Security and other payments) a "better way" of balancing the budget ("A Rational Way to Reduce the Deficit," editorial, March 1)? 
 The members of the Boskin commission were selected by Congressional Republicans for previously expressed views that the index is greatly overstated, so their report is suspect. The index may not really be much of a problem. Changing its calculation (or its impact) could be.
A more rational way of appeasing the mania for zero deficits would be to slash corporate welfare, especially the multibillions in unnecessary military expenditures, before asking middle- and lower-income folks to take a hit.

Jobless Rate Dips Below 6%

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate dipped to 5.9 percent in January, the first time in six years that it has fallen below 6 percent, according to statistics released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. Melvin L. Gelade, who was sworn in yesterday as Labor Commissioner, said that 9,600 new jobs were created in January. 
 But the employment picture was not entirely rosy. The state's unemployment rate remained above the national average of 5.4 percent, and 1,800 fewer people were looking for jobs. Some Democratic lawmakers pointed out that more than half of the new jobs were low-paying service jobs.

Keeping Cocaine Resilient: Low Cost and High Profit

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
They have tried to stamp out cocaine for years. Governments have sprayed herbicides on fields of coca leaf. Police have raided the primitive laboratories that refine coca paste. Counternarcotics agents have seized and destroyed hundreds of tons of cocaine powder, arresting or killing thousands of smugglers.
Yet after 20 years and eradication programs totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, cocaine can be bought on every continent, in virtually every major city. The drug has even survived a market decline in which the number of regular cocaine users in the United States dropped, to 1.5 million in 1995 from 5.7 million a decade before. Americans are still snorting, smoking or injecting cocaine at the rate of 240 tons a year, almost all of it produced in Colombia and much of it smuggled through Mexico. 
 The debate that preceded the Clinton Administration's decision on Friday to certify Mexico as an ally in its war against illegal drugs while decertifying Colombia underscored how deeply entrenched the cocaine habit has become, enmeshing South and North America in an intricate web of corruption and violence.
The reasons for cocaine's resilience are a matter of simple economics, as interviews with the people who make, sell, use and try to destroy cocaine confirm. It is a sweatshop industry that taps a limitless supply of cheap labor, generates enormous profits for a few and enjoys a base of addicted customers.
And just as any large and diffuse commercial enterprise is ultimately dependent on the favor or cooperation of officials and regulators, the cocaine trade is well oiled by corruption along the way. A draft analysis by American intelligence officials estimates that Mexican drug traffickers earn up to $10 billion a year and then dole out as much as $6 billion on bribes for Mexican officials and police officers.
The most powerful symbol of cocaine's resilience is the trail that the drug follows from leaf to crack and powder, from farmer to addict, from the Andean jungles to the New York City streets.
"For a narcotics trafficker, the most valuable asset is his route," said Gen. Rosso Juan Serrano, commander of the Colombian National Police, referring not just to the physical trail, but also to the clandestine airstrips, the hidden warehouses and corrupt officials like air controllers and police along the way. And as with an octopus that grows new tentacles when old ones are damaged or cut off, the trail sprouts new paths, means of transport and markets when the old ones are attacked.
Donald Ferrarone, the special agent in charge of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration field office in Houston, has seen cocaine flowing in for years. "The only difference," Mr. Ferrarone said, "is the intensity is more ferocious now."
The trail starts in the Andean jungles, where peasants strip coca bushes of their oval leaves, dump the leaves in a plastic-lined pit, pour in kerosene or gasoline and water, and sometimes sprinkle on cement.
Barefoot, the workers stomp the mixture to press out the psychoactive alkaloids into a paste that resembles grimy snow. Across rural Colombia, thousands of laborers process the paste into a sludge that is dried to form the raw ingredient for powdered cocaine hydrochloride.
Every day, more than two tons of powder flows through Mexico and the Caribbean, with one-third of that ending up in the United States. Once cocaine was ferried by small planes. Now, to evade American radar surveillance, more and more cocaine floats north in the holds of freighters, fishing boats and yachts.
"How are drugs coming across the border?" asked Leon W. Guinn, special agent in charge of the Customs Service field office in Houston. "Probably in every imaginable way you can think of."
 
The Lab Workers
Double the Pay Of Cutting Cane
Altemar Restrepo could not earn enough cutting sugar cane to support his family. So Mr. Restrepo, a slender Colombian, followed other peasants and apprenticed himself to the making of cocaine.
For 4 of his 25 years, Mr. Restrepo said, he has worked in the tangled jungle of southeastern Colombia, fetching the gasoline used to leach coca leaves of their alkaloids. The "cocina," or jungle laboratory where Mr. Restrepo was interviewed, consisted of six wooden maturation pens, in which a ton of leaves soaked in gasoline and water.
Every week, he said, the laboratory produced more than 75 pounds of coca to be refined elsewhere into powdered cocaine.
"We do this because you can't raise cattle or corn in this region," Mr. Restrepo said as he fidgeted, shirtless and sweating, beside a waist-high pile of coca leaves. "There's no water, and transport is too expensive."
As a cane cutter, he said, he was lucky to earn $35 a week. For processing coca leaves he was promised $10 to $15 a day, plus a dormitory cot and food. He has not been paid for three months, he said, and he misses his family several hundred miles to the north. He wants to go home.
Mr. Restrepo gave his account minutes after having been seized by Colombian narcotics police commandos who raided the laboratory, sending co-workers bolting into the jungle. He admitted having been arrested before. "I don't know who owns the patch and I don't ask," Mr. Restrepo said. "When I did ask, they said, 'Just keep working.' "
The police ripped up the pens with a chainsaw and kicked over the metal drums, splattering coca base into the mud. When the officers tried to blow up what was left, the waterlogged leaves refused to ignite. The police retreated under the machine gun of a hovering helicopter, leaving Mr. Restrepo looking unperturbed.
"He said he had a family, so we couldn't leave his wife and children alone," Col. Leonardo Gallego, commander of the police unit, said. "I feel strongly about the plight of young men and children who get into drugs or fall in with drug-trafficking gangs."
Mr. Restrepo's employers got no such sympathy.
"They only commit crimes because of cruelty and personal gain," Colonel Gallego said. "There's no regard for the country or the views of the international community."
 
The Townspeople
Boom, Herbicides And Abandonment
Because coca pays much better than pineapples or bananas and is easier to market, the farmers who grow it express few qualms about working for what they see as, ultimately, the Yankee dollar, though one such "cocalero," Franklin Gonzales, said he would rather sing.
But pop singing pays little. So Mr. Gonzales, a wiry 24-year-old, left his wife and young son and traveled southwest to the river town of Miraflores.
"I left them because of the violence here," he told a reporter.
He was making $30 or $40 a day tending coca fields until the National Police sprayed them with herbicide last summer. Now, Mr. Gonzales said: "It's hard. There is no money. There are people here, but not as many as before."
Coca production in Colombia created boom towns out of many backwaters like Miraflores, a ramshackle settlement of whitewashed houses with metal roofs along the muddy Vaupes River. The drug lords do not bother to visit, sending commercial agents to buy the paste openly from growers.
After coca displaced rubber as the primary crop, Miraflores swelled to 10,000 inhabitants, 600 of them prostitutes, said the Rev. Manuel Mancera, the Roman Catholic priest in the town. Coca money built a new discotheque that glitters with mirrors. Fighting and whoring became nightly diversions.
"There were no values or principles," Father Mancera said. "People were too attached to money."
Since the spraying, Miraflores has shriveled to a few thousand residents. The farmers are hard put to make a living, because they have no roads to carry legal crops to market.
"It's the beginning of the end of Miraflores," the priest said. "Because if it isn't coca, there is just no other produce."
The National Police reported that they sprayed 55,715 acres and destroyed 938 cocaine laboratories last year. But when towns like Miraflores die, traffickers find others, making alliances with leftist guerrillas who charge a tax according to the weight of cocaine passing through their territory.
The Government cut off deliveries of gasoline and cement to the region after discovering that extensive quantities had been diverted to process coca leaves. Now, those materials are smuggled from Venezuela.
"You can't even get gasoline," said Estrela Contreras of Miraflores, who organized demonstrations against spraying. "We're all paying for the sins of a few."
 
The Mansions
Guns and Pools, Narco-Deco Style
The profits of cocaine are manifested in a two-story residence that rises like a fortress above an attractive neighborhood of Cali, a fashionable western city that is the home of the world's most prominent drug cartel.
The house, made of concrete, has no windows facing the street. But inside are marble floors, crystal chandeliers, furniture gilded and tasseled in Narco-Deco style and bowling lanes. The garden has an enormous swimming pool. A police specialist in a search party told an accompanying reporter that the house was worth $15 million.
The police and soldiers raided the house because its owner, Jose Orlando Henao Montoya, is suspected of being a rising drug trafficker. He was not home at the time.
The closets held barely a change of clothes. Family photographs had been stripped from silver frames. The maid said the family had left for its country ranch.
The searches began when the police, with discreet help from American agents, captured six leaders of the Cali cartel in 1995.
"They were very powerful," the commander of the search team, Lieut. Col. Ramiro Villalobos, said. "People were afraid of all the bodyguards, the extravagant cars and the display of guns. This no longer happens. Now we can go out at night without fear."
But with some cartel leaders running the business by telephone from prison and new independent traffickers taking up the slack, has the output of cocaine been stanched?
Colonel Villalobos paused and replied, "We can't say it's less, no."
 
The Transfer Point
Lucrative Fees For the Mexicans
The bulk of the cocaine that enters the United States passes through Mexico, with the help of Mexican crime federations that demand up to half the Colombians' cocaine and heroin in return, the Drug Enforcement Administration said. The Mexicans distribute their share through their own networks.
"The Colombian narcotraffickers have very comfortable relations with the Mexican mafia," General Serrano of the Colombian police said. "It's almost a natural relationship."
The cocaine increasingly arrives in Mexico on vessels like the Don Celso. The rusty fishing boat, flying the Ecuadorean flag, ostensibly carried shrimp and tuna between Buenaventura, Colombia, and Manzanillo, Mexico. But Colombian and American agents who boarded her off Ecuador in October reported finding 12 tons of cocaine.
Once in Mexico, the cocaine is trucked north to the United States border, with the connivance of corrupt Government officials, Federal agents said. One agent said 30 to 40 tons of cocaine were stockpiled in Mexico, awaiting delivery to the United States.
Mexico's economic problems and double-digit unemployment help in recruiting smugglers for a relative pittance. One smuggler was offered $500 to smuggle a load to Los Angeles and promised another $500 if he made it back, an antidrug agent said.
Lose a load, however, and a smuggler can be forced to work for nothing to make it up, or the smuggler can be disfigured or killed.
"The level of violence is like nowhere I've ever seen," said a Federal agent in Texas who insisted on anonymity.
The agent told of a woman who had been caught carrying drug profits back across the border. She agreed to turn informer and asked to go home to Juarez. She turned up garroted.
 
The Portal
Thin Line of Agents Reviews the Flood
J. J. Lopez stood on the concrete Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, watching the flow of automobiles from Ciudad Juarez, a few hundred yards away. More than one million cars, many driven by commuters, cross between El Paso and Juarez each month, giving United States Customs inspectors a scant 10 or 15 seconds to look over each car.
"We have to move the traffic," Mr. Lopez, the chief customs inspector at the bridge, said. "But we also have to address the threat that we have, which is narcotics."
Mr. Lopez was watched by a young man who cradled the receiver of the nearest pay telephone, about 50 yards away. Nearby, his accomplice talked into a two-way radio as he surveyed the heavy traffic.
They were spotters, Mr. Lopez said, hired by the syndicate of Amado Carrillo Fuentes to tell smugglers which lanes to use or avoid. Spotters earn $25 to $50 a day for working the bridge, far more than the $25 to $40 a week that they might earn in a Juarez factory.
Customs inspectors conduct two-minute blitzes in which they stop and check every car in one lane or walk through traffic with dogs trained to sniff out drugs.
"We've had people bail out of their cars and run back" to Mexico, Mr. Lopez said.
To reduce chances of losing a major load, traffickers now move cocaine in quantities of a few hundred pounds. After crossing the border, loads are deposited at stash houses for consolidation.
Mr. Lopez said drugs were concealed deep inside vehicles, often behind electronic trapdoors. Inspectors have found cocaine replacing trailer insulation, inside tire rims and poured in the fuel tank to form a sediment to be scooped out later. Sixty pounds of cocaine can fit behind some dashboards, he said.
Cocaine has even turned up in a baby's diaper.
"Think of the sensitivity of searching an infant," said George A. McNenney, a customs special agent in El Paso.
 
The Landing Zone
Tension Casts Pall Along Rio Grande
Before dusk erased the shadows across the sagebrush, cactus and mesquite outside Eagle Pass, Tex., the rancher coaxed his Jeep to the rim of a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande. Rifle at hand, he watched for the smugglers who walk their loads across the placid river and onto his 165-acre spread.
No fences or barriers define the border here. As a teen-ager nearly 50 years ago, the rancher himself waded into the knee-deep water to play baseball with Mexican youngsters who lived on the other side.
"You can't do that now," he said.
The rancher would not allow his name to be used, fearing smugglers might retaliate.
"They're not looking for trouble," he said. "But if you run into them, they're armed and you don't have a chance."
He used to call Border Patrol agents in nearby Eagle Pass, he said, but before they arrived, the intruders would melt into the darkness. So now, he said, "my neighbors and I watch each other's backs."
A neighbor on the Mexican side, he said, had encountered on his land unmarked vans and an armed stranger who barred the way. A neighbor in Texas found night-vision goggles on a trail that crossed his property.
"My gates have been torn down, knocked up and run over," the rancher said, adding that his wife went to church alone on Sundays, because they dared not leave the ranch unattended. "Our place is valueless now. You can't give it away. You can't rent it."
In fact, ranches along the Rio Grande attract buyers ready to pay -- in cash -- more than the properties are worth. One spread worth barely $300,000 was bought for $850,000 by someone who was later traced to drug smuggling.
"We've had dopers come out and look at this place," the rancher said.
A realty agent asked the owners to leave while the client inspected. They refused.
Even with the billions spent to fight drugs, the rancher said, "it gets worse every year."
"I don't know what to do about it," he said. "But what we're doing doesn't work."
 
The End of the Line
Crack's Losers: Victims and Society
When powdered cocaine began to lose its appeal in the 1980's, distributors in cities like New York created a new market by cooking the powder with baking soda and water to make crack.
"Crack is still out there," said John Galea, who runs the Street Studies Unit of the New York State Office of Addiction and Substance Abuse Services. "We've noticed that 13- and 14-year-olds are not using it anymore. But they're selling it."
Dealers in Brooklyn confirmed that the profits that built expensive houses in Cali did not trickle down to the sidewalks of New York. A teen-ager who was peddling crack said that he could take in $75 to $100 a day, but that he dared work just a few days a week, fearing he would attract the police.
Another seller said he made $25 for selling a bundle of 20 "nickel" bags for $5 each.
Crack's attraction for users lies in its instant high and cheap price. Powdered cocaine sells for $30 to $40 a gram in upper Manhattan. A pebble of crack costs $2 to $5.
Although crack is widely derided as a loser's drug, its customers include people like Thomas DeGrace, 35, who had a restaurant and a music company and whose five-year addiction wiped out all he had achieved.
"Crack is the only drug in the world where the more you take, the more you want," Mr. DeGrace said. "When you take your first hit, you're chasing that hit for the rest of the day."
Eventually, Mr. DeGrace lived on the street, bartering for crack by holding the drugs so the dealer could avoid arrest if the police swooped in.
"I came from a family that taught morals and standards, but that drug just takes them away from you," Mr. DeGrace said. "You see yourself diminish as a man."
He has entered a rehabilitation program run by Phoenix House.
If male addicts perform a dealer's stoop labor, women suffer worse humiliation.
"It degrades you to where you're selling your body," Cynthia McBride said. "That's where it started and ended with me."
Ms. McBride, 25, said she had begun sniffing cocaine as a 10-year-old to overcome stage fright when she sang soul music professionally. By the time she moved to crack, she said, "I was married, cheating on a husband and sleeping with men to get high."
Even after social workers had removed her five children, Ms. McBride said, she continued chasing crack.
"Physically, it shows on you," she said. "You're a walking skeleton if you're a crack head, and you think you look good."
Despite all the lipstick she smeared on, Ms. McBride said, she grew so scrawny that dealers refused to have sex with her. After she had slashed a rival prostitute, she, too, checked into Phoenix House.
"When the drug dealers start dissing you," she said, "when you can't get a $2 hit because they don't want you, that's when it's time to go."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page picture caption on Tuesday with an article about the cocaine business misstated the location of the drug raid and misidentified the participants. The raid was in Colombia, not Peru; it was conducted by members of the Colombian police, not the military.
In some editions, a picture of a Texas rancher, with the article continuation, was misattributed. It was by Jim Wilson of The New York Times.

GRAPHIC: Photos: A rancher along the Rio Grande, top, no longer calls the Border Patrol about smugglers. He says he and neighbors "watch each other's backs." A suspected trafficker in Cali, Colombia, the base of a major cocaine ring, lives in a $15 million house.

As cocaine makes its way to the United States, its value increases, from as little as $200 for 400 pounds of coca leaves (The amount it takes to make one pound of cocaine) to $20,000 for one pound of cocaine sold in street doses, according to estimates by growers, dealers and law-enforcement officials.

HEADLINE: Big Mac's Price Cut Won't Cut the Fat

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
SO the price of a Big Mac is dropping to 55 cents. According to classic economic theory, the steep price cut will draw more customers, who will buy more Big Macs, which will fatten the company's bottom line.
But what of the fattening of American waistlines? What of the thickening of American arteries? 
 As news of McDonald's widely publicized Campaign 55 has spread, the ubiquity of the golden arches upon the landscape and the increasing centrality of burgers and fries in the American diet have led public health experts and even anthropologists to ponder some noncorporate consequences.
A new chapter is being writ for the Big Mac, which in its 30-year history has never been less than a culture-defining sandwich.
Predictably, many nutritionists were alarmed. McDonald's feeds 7 percent of the United States population each day. At company headquarters near Chicago, where the 55-cent offer was conceived to overcome declining sales, the mission is to build a restaurant no farther than a four-minute walk or drive from every man, woman and child.
"Hamburgers are already the worst food in the average American's diet," said Bonnie Liebman, the director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group. "They contribute more artery-clogging fat than any other single food. This could make the problem worse."
Dr. Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University, was blunter. "It's a nutritionist's nightmare," she said of the 55-cent price. "We will continue to see the amount of fat and saturated fat in the American diet go up. We would expect to see the trend of increasing body weights also."
Call it coincidence, but the increase of overweight Americans roughly tracks the era of McDonald's greatest empire building.
The number of overweight people, after holding steady at a quarter of the population in the 1960's and 70's, shot up to 33 percent in the 80's, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. McDonald's growth also went into hyperdrive starting in the 80's, from 5,213 outlets in the United States in 1980 to more than 12,000 today. There are 8,000 or so overseas.
The 55-cent offer, meant to recall the epic year of 1955, when Ray Kroc, the patron saint of franchisers, opened his first McDonald's, is good only when a Big Mac (530 calories and 28 grams of fat) is purchased with french fries (450 calories and 22 grams of fat for a large order) and a soda (310 calories for 32 ounces). The total meal is three-quarters of the Government's recommended daily allowance of 66 grams of fat.
But not all nutritionists expect inexpensive Big Macs to lead to ruin. Dr. Barry M. Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina who also holds a doctorate in economics, said that research shows that people who eat high-fat foods at restaurants also eat high-fat foods at home.
"The total effect on fat will be a slight increase, not a huge increase," he said. "The away-from-home impact is not as major an impact on the diet of an individual as one would think."
Economists who follow the fast-food business say that its customers are highly cost-sensitive. By steeply discounting its flagship sandwich, now around $2, McDonald's is expecting an immediate and sizable increase in foot traffic. Sales at individual McDonald's that have been open more than a year have been falling for the last six quarters. The company is losing market share to other burger chains, and its pioneering Egg McMuffin-based breakfast has suffered the indignity of bagelmania.
McDonald's franchisees voted on Saturday to accept the new pricing, which will begin on April 26. The 55-cent offer will rotate from the Big Mac to the Quarter Pounder to other sandwiches over the next year.
But it is not entirely clear that increased traffic will translate into more people eating more fast food. Some experts said that the price cut could simply siphon off existing customers from other hamburger chains, like Wendy's and Burger King.
"Will we eat more hamburgers because of this?" asked Harry Balzer, a vice president of the NPD Group, a market research company that studies eating trends. "I don't think we know the answer."
Mr. Balzer said the only sure sign that overall burger consumption has gone up will be if rival burger chains do not retaliate with discounts of their own. That will be a sign that their businesses have not suffered because of McDonald's lower prices, he said. In other words, more people will be eating more hamburgers.
The latest edition of Mr. Balzer's annual survey, "Eating Patterns in America," seems to suggest that, indeed, Americans' appetite for takeout junk food is insatiable. Hamburgers, french fries and chicken nuggets were among the five fastest-growing foods ordered in restaurants, according to the study, which was released in October.
Takeout restaurants overtook table-service restaurants last year for the first time, accounting for more than 50 percent of the nation's restaurant business, the National Restaurant Association said.
The trend toward good-for-you foods appears to have hit a wall and may be experiencing a backlash. Restaurants from steakhouses to trattorias are filling plates to the very edge with outsize portions, many of them highly fattening. Last year, McDonald's abandoned its low-fat burger, McLean Deluxe, and now encourages customers to "super-size it" with a voluminous pouch of fries.
"The fat content of fast-food meals has been increasing, not decreasing," Dr. Nestle of N.Y.U. said.
As fast-food prices decline, who will feel the impact the most?
Dr. Nan A. Rothschild, a Barnard College anthropology professor, predicted that immigrant families used to dining cheaply at home on traditional foods would be hastened along the path of acculturation.
"In that segment of the population," Dr. Rothschild said, "the kids are always motivated to eat in American institutions, but up to now their parents may have said, 'We can't afford it.' I would think a price cut would free them to pursue more of the non-ethnic."
Inexpensive junk food, it is sometimes said, is more central to the diet of poor people than the well off.
An unusual study in the New England Journal of Medicine last year found that over the last three decades, poor people have made less progress in moving toward a low-fat, healthy diet than wealthier people.
In 1965, poor blacks, whose diet was rich in traditional foods like sweet potatoes, greens and black-eyed peas, ate the healthiest diet of all socioeconomic groups, the study found. Wealthier whites dined on marbled beef and high-fat cheeses.
But as the rich have gotten leaner, the poor developed a predilection for burgers.
"In the 60's, low-and middle-income America could not afford a rich high-meat diet that at the time was thought to be the good diet," said Dr. Popkin of North Carolina, the lead researcher on the study. "As their incomes went up, they consumed more and more of those high-status preference foods.
"Paradoxically, the rich today are trying to eat the diet the poor did 30 years ago."
Richard Klein, a professor of French at Cornell University and a self-described fat man, advised Americans to loosen up, literally.
In his book "Eat Fat," published last year by Pantheon, Professor Klein argued that America should lose its obsession with thinness and accept a new beauty esthetic based on the population's increasing portliness.
"A Big Mac going down to 55 cents: that's pretty hard to pass up," Professor Klein said last week, noting that he has not had one in years. "I might just try it."

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, March 3) writes that the only legitimacy China's leaders have is their ability to maintain economic growth. But China's leaders have another claim in reserve: they represent Chinese nationalism. Post-Communist nationalism in Eastern Europe is ugly; post-Communist nationalism in China would be more frightening still.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Rallying Dollar Reaches 3-Year High Against the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-year high against the German mark yesterday, rallying broadly on strong United States economic data, new hints of record German unemployment and more uncertainty over Europe's proposed single currency.
The gains bolstered a view that the dollar was likely to move still higher, particularly against the mark, based on the likelihood that interest rates would rise in the United States but remain static or fall in Germany, where the economy continues to languish. Higher rates tend to strengthen a currency. 
 Traders who had been caught unprepared for the dollar's surge past its prior three-year high of 1.7050 marks scrambled to buy dollars as the currency broke the 1.7100 level, heightening the rally's intensity.
"There was obviously a lot of momentum through that psychological barrier of 1.7000 marks," said Susan Stearns, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal's New York branch.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7152 marks, the strongest since April 1994, before settling in New York at 1.7146 marks, up from 1.6980 Monday and up 13 percent so far for the year.
The dollar's gains against the Japanese yen were more muted, partly because the yen also strengthened against the mark. But the dollar still settled at its high for the day at 122.16 yen, up from 121.27 yen on Monday and its first close at more than 122 yen in six sessions. For the year, the dollar is up 5.4 percent against the yen.
The British pound fell to $1.6126 from $1.6176.
Demand for the dollar rose as United States economic reports showing unexpectedly strong housing sales in January and a surprisingly big surge in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the main forecasting gauge. The data further raised expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers who meet March 25 would raise interest rates to help thwart inflationary pressure.
The dollar also derived strength from a leaked report that the number of unemployed German workers hit another postwar high in February. The official figures are not due until tomorrow. February employment data for the United States, due Friday, are expected to be strong.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Fortification for Choosing Chintz

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"Decoration and Design" are what the letters mean. But tenants in the D & D Building, 979 Third Avenue, might reasonably have wondered a few years ago whether the initials really stood for "Default and Disaster."
With its fortunes tied to a single industry -- home furnishings -- the 18-story showroom center at 58th Street in Manhattan was hard hit by the recession in the early 1990's, when the market for luxe momentarily abated. Tenants going out of business left one-third of the building empty. Rents had to be slashed for those who remained. 
 In 1993, the long-term leasehold was declared in default and the Travelers Insurance Company foreclosed on the mortgage. Then, two years ago this month, as the D & D was regaining its equilibrium under the management of Merchandise Mart Properties Inc. of Chicago, an electrical fire broke out. Although no one was injured and damage was minimal, the building had to be closed for a week, greatly disrupting designers and their clients.
Today, Charles Steven Cohen, president and chief executive of both the Decoration and Design Building and of Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, almost cheerfully concedes that D & D was nearly "dead."
He can afford to be cheerful because the building is anything but dead these days. "We have no vacancies" among the 110 showrooms, declared Mr. Cohen, who bought the leasehold from the Travelers last September for $67 million. Rents are running from the high $30's a square foot to about $70, and Mr. Cohen said major tenants have committed themselves to 15-year leases.
Next month, Mr. Cohen plans to introduce a significant new amenity: a 14th-floor restaurant, Astra, that will be a kind of building commissary.
Quel commissary. It will be operated by Charlie Palmer, the chef and owner of Aureole, 34 East 61st Street, on which The New York Times conferred three stars in 1991 for "consistently captivating food." The architect of Astra is Ernesto Buch and the interior designer is J. Paul Terrace, both of New Haven.
"The idea is to keep the customer in the building," Mr. Cohen said, "to take the department store mentality from Bloomingdale's and bring it across the street."
Mr. Palmer said the food at Astra would be "simple and straightforward" and the service "expedited," accounting for the hectic schedules of designers who are between showroom visits. "For them, 30 to 45 minutes is a leisurely lunch," he said.
The developer and chef have entered into what Mr. Cohen calls a "licensing and occupancy arrangement" and what Mr. Palmer says is "in essence a partnership." Neither would elaborate but the point is that Mr. Palmer will pay no rent.
That amounts to a major savings in overhead. And Astra patrons will see the benefit. Soups will be priced at about $5, Mr. Palmer said, salads from $6 to $8, sandwiches from $6 to $8, pasta dishes from $8 to $12 and grilled dishes from $13 to $14.
In theory, Astra -- like the showrooms around it -- is for the trade only; designers and their customers. But the restaurant will not turn away the public.
The main room will seat about 145, and a 40-seat terrace that commands a 180-degree view, from the Sherry-Netherland Hotel to the Queensboro Bridge, will be open in fair weather. The view also takes in the Cohen Brothers' conical-peaked International Plaza at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street. Astra is to be open from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Friday. At night, the space will be available for openings, product launchings and parties.
Jeffrey G. Bonin, manager of the Donghia Showroom, which has expanded to 8,500 square feet from 6,000 square feet, said Astra would not be a "frivolous luxury" but rather a "viable, working, much-needed element."
The Decoration and Design Building was built in 1963 on a site assembled by Henry Hart Rice, chairman of James Felt Realty Services, who died in 1992. (The land is still owned by Mr. Rice's estate, along with others.) The developer was the late Aaron Diamond, whose name is now synonymous with the battle against AIDS because his foundation endows the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan.
Unlike the chintz within, the 570,000-square-foot D & D Building has a stark, industrial look: bands of white brick alternating with bands of metal-framed windows. The architects were David and Earl J. Levy.
Mr. Cohen said he hoped to open Astra with a black-tie dinner for the 25th anniversary of the annual Decorator Show House in 603 Park Avenue, at 64th Street, which benefits the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club.
As it happens, the Park Avenue town house is owned by Mr. Cohen's father, Sherman. "It's on the market," the younger Mr. Cohen said. "That should help sell it. We're doing a little cross-pollination."

HEADLINE: New Life for Lowly Pallets;
South Bronx Company Recycles Overlooked Wood

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
"Just look at that grain," David M. Muchnick said, as he hefted an arm-size plank with the rich, swirly coloring of mocha fudge ice cream.
The board, a hunk of valuable rosewood, had recently arrived in New York with a shipment of imports from South America. But it was not part of the shipment. It was part of the creaky, splintery pallet on which the goods were loaded. 
 Like most of the six million pallets that carry goods in and around New York City every year, this one was slated to be chipped, burned or dumped after only a couple of trips. But Mr. Muchnick's South Bronx company, Big City Forest, salvaged it.
Soon the piece of rosewood -- along with thousands of feet of cherry, oak, mahogany, maple, and other valuable hardwood boards recycled from pallets -- would be turned into furniture, flooring, butcher block or other products by Big City Forest's home-grown work force of artisans.
The company's admirers and customers include Ben Cohen, one of the founders of Ben & Jerry's Homemade, the ice cream maker. Mr. Cohen bought slabs of Bronx-made butcher block for his Vermont home and also had wood panels installed in dozens of the company's shops.
"The idea of having the environmental benefit of keeping this useful wood from going into landfills, and creating jobs and job training for people in the inner city is fantastic," Mr. Cohen said. "It's a win-win-win-win situation. Lots of wins. And the stuff is great to look at. Nothing has the beauty and soul and warmth of wood."
By reclaiming more than 180,000 pallets a year, along with crates and other unwanted wood packaging, Big City Forest has tapped into a vast resource that most American businesses consider a costly liability. In New York City alone, businesses spend $130 million a year to dispose of millions of pallets and other wood waste, Mr. Muchnick said. His company cuts that cost by providing an alternative cheaper than carting pallets to landfills.
Typically, Big City Forest charges 75 cents for each pallet dropped at its doors at 1809 Carter Avenue in the Tremont section, substantially less than the fees of up to $5 each charged by carters, he said. Enjoying a rare luxury in the business world, it thus gets money not only for its products, but also from the companies supplying its raw material.
By transforming lowly pallets into valuable products in a single operation, Big City Forest is also creating dozens of new jobs, Mr. Muchnick said, giving previously unemployed people a marketable skill.
His goal is to franchise the company, setting up licensed copies in other cities where unwanted pallets are plentiful and jobs hard to come by. There is also a long list of environmental benefits, he said. By spreading the practice in the United States and overseas, deforestation could be reduced as more wood is re-used, and the flow of a valuable material to landfills, chippers or furnaces could be stanched, he said.
In the United States, several hundred million pallets go to waste each year, he said. Worse yet, Mr. Muchnick said, even as all that wood is wasted, nearly half of the wood from hardwood trees cut each year in American forests is used to build new pallets. "What a destructive cycle," he said.
Big City Forest is the latest of several recycling businesses spun off from Bronx 2000, a nonprofit economic development group that Mr. Muchnick helped found in 1979 to revive the long-suffering neighborhoods around Tremont Avenue.
In its third year, Big City Forest is preparing to triple its work space and expects to triple its work force of about two dozen people.
There are many larger pallet recycling businesses around the country, but most simply turn the incoming wood into chips, said Resa Dimino, an environmental specialist at Big City Forest. As chips, the wood is worth about $30 a ton. As flooring, the value rises to $1,200 a ton, and as furniture, the wood in pallets is worth $6,000 a ton, she said, with all that added value translating directly into South Bronx jobs.
Big City Forest uses about 60 percent of the wood from pallets flowing into its warehouse to make new pallets, with the best quality planks set aside for the most valuable products. These planks are run through a metal detector, and workers pull stray nails and staples.
The worst wood is used to build new pallets. Odds and ends are chipped and sold to a manufacturer of pressed-wood boards, Ms. Dimino said. The last scraps are burned in two large furnaces to heat the buildings. "All you'll see in our Dumpster is a little sawdust and leftover lunch bags," Ms. Dimino said.
One big potential market for the pallet wood is oak flooring, Mr. Muchnick said. Every year, 1.5 billion board feet of oak is wasted in pallets, he said, while 500 million board feet of lumber from newly cut oaks goes into floors. "If you reclaimed one third of the oak in tossed pallets, you would not have to cut a single growing oak to make flooring," he said.
Last year, the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Maryland, installed oak flooring from Big City Forest in two model town houses built to display materials that saved energy or had environmental benefits. Peter Yost, an economist at the association's research center, said "visitors are amazed" when they hear where the wood came from.
Butcher-block tables and benches with the company's logo are sold to institutional clients like foster-care centers and Cornell University -- "they're frat proof," Ms. Dimino said -- but are also showing up in chic shops like Terra Verde in SoHo.
Customers happily pay $750 for a five-foot table, said the shop's owner, Katherine Tiddens.
"They're like a rock," Ms. Tiddens said, "like a lesson in wood."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Housing Data Help to Push Bonds Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices finished lower in choppy trading yesterday, hurt by a housing report that was stronger than expected.
The market was also weighed down by the prospect of more testimony from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan will speak today before a House banking subcommittee in the second leg of his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins report on the state of the economy. The bond market has been nervous about the Fed's next move on interest rates since Mr. Greenspan said last week that a pre-emptive move might be needed to keep inflation from accelerating. 
 Traders said a strong dollar kept Treasury prices from falling further yesterday, as the dollar touched a three-year high against the German mark. The dollar's rally raised expectations that foreign investors would continue buying Treasury securities because of the potential gains from conversion.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32, to 97. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.86 percent from 6.83 percent on Monday.
Analysts said that traders initially sold after the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes in January rose 8.6 percent to the highest level in 10 years. Expectations had been for a 4 percent decline.
The housing report added to the evidence that economic growth is strong enough to push prices higher. That, in turn, could make it more likely that the Fed will raise short-term rates at its monetary policy meeting on March 25.
The release of the LJR Redbook survey of retail sales, which showed sales rose 2.4 percent in February from January, added to losses.
Individually, yesterday's reports did not affect the market that much, according to Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
But together, he said, they contributed to the view that the economy is stronger than had been expected. And coming before Mr. Greenspan's testimony and Friday's release of February employment data, the reports kept investors anxious.
Bonds were also hurt, traders said, by word that Western Asset Management, a money management company, was selling some corporate bond holdings. "We have been trimming our exposure in corporate bonds and this is another part of that strategy," said Scott F. Grannis, chief economist of Western Asset, which is based in Pasadena, Calif.
About 25 percent of the company's holdings are in corporate bonds. Mr. Grannis said that sale proceeds would be used to buy Treasury securities of about the same maturities.
"I can't see how this would have affected interest rates today," he said. "In the corporate market, this is not a lot of money."
But Treasury prices were bolstered somewhat by purchases in the market by the Federal Reserve, in what is known as a coupon pass. The Fed's purchase of Treasury securities was mostly within a thin two-year range, with maturity dates ranging from 2000 to 2002.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Jumped 8.6% in January

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The Government reported today that sales of new homes had risen 8.6 percent in January, but private analysts reacted with caution, suggesting that several factors might have skewed the figures.
In a second report, the Conference Board said that its index of leading indicators, designed to predict turns in the economy, climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in January, its biggest advance since May. 
 If the report on home sales is accurate, it would imply a renewed boom in housing -- a marked contrast to the prediction of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress last week that home building this year was unlikely to repeat its buoyant 1996 performance.
But private analysts, most of whom had expected a modest decline, were skeptical of the figures, released jointly by the Commerce and Housing and Urban Development Departments.
"We think it's probably too good to be true," said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, defended the agency even as he acknowledged that special factors had played a significant role.
"The magnitude and direction are correct," Mr. Ehrlich insisted.
Two factors were responsible for the private analysts' skepticism about the housing report.
They contended that the seasonal adjustment process had been thrown out of kilter by the January 1996 blizzard and the exceptionally cold weather of January 1995.
Abnormally low sales in those two months may have resulted in an exaggerated increase this year, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh.
In addition, they pointed to a footnote in the Government's release disclosing that its data collection had been computerized, perhaps producing "some upward bias in the estimates."
Mr. Ehrlich said he was uncertain whether the upward bias would prove a one-time phenomenon or would show a permanently higher level of sales.
The long-term result would depend on whether the new process was merely capturing data faster or was picking up data that had previously been missed.
Compounding the uncertainty is the fact that the home sales figures always have a huge margin of error, plus or minus 11 percentage points. This means that the actual result for January, now reported at an annual rate of 870,000, may have ranged anywhere from 20 percent higher than in December to 2 percent lower than in December.
That seasonality was a big factor seemed to be reflected in the regional figures that showed, among other things, that sales in the Northeast -- where the blizzard struck a year earlier -- boomed 63 percent, to an annual rate of 134,000. The South was up 11.9 percent, to a rate of 403,000.
Sales of single-family homes declined in the Midwest and West, by 10.2 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively.
The median sales price climbed $2,000, to $145,000, for the month, which ended with builders holding an inventory of 4.5 months, compared with 5 months in November and December.
Home sales for October, November and December were all revised upward, the department also reported.
The rise in the index of leading indicators was driven mainly by an increase in new factory orders for consumer goods and materials and a decline in first-time claims for unemployment insurance, the Conference Board's report showed. The two main drags were faster deliveries by suppliers and a shortening of the average workweek.
The indexes of coincident and lagging indicators moved up one-tenth of 1 percent and down two-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Renault Layoffs Test French Commitment to European Unity

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 4

 BODY:
Europe, the French kept saying, was not like the United States, and never would be.
Strong social legislation, early retirement plans and consultation between labor and management protected European workers from brutal American-style downsizings and made Europe a more humane place to live than the United States or competition-crazed East Asia -- and a united Europe would make sure things stayed that way. 
 But the push for unity, particularly the plan for a single currency, has required increasing fiscal discipline in Europe's governments and large industries, sometimes making unity and the social safety net seem like conflicting ends. When the French automotive giant Renault S.A., which was nationalized in 1946 and is still 46 percent owned by the French state, decided that slumping car sales and mounting losses necessitated layoffs and dismissals, it picked an assembly plant across the border in Belgium, one that employs 3,100 mostly Flemish-speaking workers, to bear the brunt of them. It announced last Thursday that it would close the plant in July.
The decision has caused a storm of protest in Belgium and has raised questions -- even at home -- about France's commitment to the idea of European unity when its own economic interests are at stake.
"Beyond Renault and its image, it's France and her credibility that are in doubt," the staid Paris daily Le Monde wrote of the rising clamor, as workers occupied the plant at Vilvoorde, near Brussels, and Belgian labor unions called for a boycott and distributed bumper stickers saying, "This is my last Renault, what about you?"
Today, Renault, which has 140,000 workers worldwide, disclosed that it would also eliminate 2,764 jobs in France this year. Though those cuts will be more widely dispersed than in the Belgian move, French unions have reacted angrily, planning a work stoppage for later this week, and the announcement does not appear to have mollified the Belgians.
Renault is not the only European auto maker that has felt the need to improve its productivity and competitiveness. But its attempts to do so seem singularly awkward.
Though the Vilvoorde plant is in the election district of Belgium's Prime Minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Renault apparently did not inform him or his French counterpart, Prime Minister Alain Juppe, that it had decided to close the plant before making the announcement last week.
Taken by surprise, Mr. Dehaene called the closing unacceptable and said on French television that he would insist on an alternative.
"The Government is concerned and stupefied," he said after Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, broke the news to the plant's employees on a visit to Belgium last week.
The Belgian Government and regional Flemish authorities said this week that they would ask the European Union's executive body in Brussels, the European Commission, to rule on whether Renault had violated European labor guidelines.
They also said they would take the company to court, accusing it of violating a Belgian law requiring management to consult labor before major decisions on issues affecting employees. "It is largely symbolic, but at least it's something we could do," a Belgian Labor Ministry spokeswoman said, noting that Renault would face a maximum fine of $850,000 if it was found to have broken the law.
In the face of increasing global economic competition, Europe's highly regulated labor markets are often blamed for the Continent's double-digit unemployment, and nowhere is the competition sharper than in the automotive industry.
"Renault's closure is not against Belgium," the French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Jacques Barrot, said. "Competition is raging. We realize that to be a player in this globalization of the economy we have to fight."
But some of Renault's Belgian workers see a further motivation in the company's plan to close their plant, contending that Renault might have treated them differently if they had been French-speaking Walloons. Workers occupied the plant after the announcement, keeping 4,000 new Clio models under assembly from being shipped out. Those not holding the cars hostage took to the streets of Brussels in protest on Monday.
Others said they had expected better of Mr. Schweitzer, a nephew of Albert Schweitzer, the famous Alsatian physician and missionary, and a member of France's Socialist Party. The party's leader, Lionel Jospin, today called on the French Government to intervene and called the decision to close the plant "financially, industrially and socially aberrant."
"Trying to play off workers from one country against those of another is not worthy of a great French and European enterprise," especially one in which the state owns such a large stake, he said.
Mr. Schweitzer went ahead with the decision to close the plant after the Government turned down a plan proposed by Renault and its main French competitor, PSA Peugeot Citroen, to help the companies retire 40,000 automotive workers early. A leading member of Parliament from President Jacques Chirac's conservative party, Michel Pericard, said today that the Government might reconsider in light of what he called a "sudden and brutal" plant closing decision.
So far, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Juppe have had nothing to say about the controversy. Unions have called a one-hour work stoppage for Friday in the company's 26 plants in France, Belgium and Spain to protest the plant closing. Belgian union leaders have called on Mr. Schweitzer to attend a meeting with them in Vilvoorde and have announced plans to picket a Renault plant in Douai across the border in France.
Renault reportedly expects losses of $700 million for 1996, when it produced 1.57 million passenger cars, 216,000 vans and other commercial vehicles and 63,000 trucks. The company said that switching production from Vilvoorde to other plants in France and Spain would produce yearly savings of $149 million.
Under French and Belgian labor laws, employees cannot be summarily dismissed. Those at Vilvoorde will receive severance pay and some could be eligible for early retirement on the Government-supported pension system. A company spokesman said that discussions with the unions about the cuts in Belgium and France would begin on March 13.

HEADLINE: Seattle Superintendent to Hold Off on Allowing Ads in Schools

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 4

 BODY:
Responding to strong community opposition, the head of the Seattle public schools has proposed that the school board suspend its new policy to seek advertising revenue from corporations, postponing action while the issue is studied.
The district's chief financial officer, Joseph Olchefske, had speculated in January that the policy might result in "the cheerleaders, brought to you by Reebok," or "the McDonald's gym." District officials estimated that the district might have raised $1 million a year from such sponsorships. 
 But some parents and teachers opposed the plan, leading Superintendent John Stanford to ask the board to reconsider it.
"I think Mr. Stanford is sending a strong signal that we may be desperate for money, but the Seattle school district cares more about kids than it does about corporations," said Brita Butler-Wall, a spokeswoman for the newly formed Citizens Campaign for Commercial-Free Schools. "It's bad enough to allow corporations access to a captive audience, let alone get a kickback for it."
The board is expected to suspend the plan at its meeting on Wednesday, and Mr. Stanford is expected to appoint a committee to review the policy.
Lisa Bond, president of the Parent Teacher Student Association, a leading opponent of advertising in the schools, said that group would probably recommend that advertising be banned inside schools. The group may consider allowing advertisements outside school buildings -- with restrictions.
"Any kind of advertising message should be directed to adults and not to the students," Ms. Bond said, "and there should not be materials that try to influence student behavior. It should be clearly separated from what's taught children."
The board decided in November to pursue advertising to make up for a $35 million shortfall projected over the next three years, the result of a shortfall in state financing, caused because the state no longer adjusts the level to account for inflation, and a new cap on property taxes. The system's annual budget is $322 million.
"The traditional funding sources are defunding us," Mr. Olchefske said, "so we have to look to nontraditional sources."
Mr. Stanford has also asked the board to review the advertising already in the schools. Currently, 12 or 13 schools use a commercial television news program called Channel One, said a district spokeswoman, Chris Case.
David Fisher, who teaches math and upper-level marine biology at Cleveland High School, said he welcomed the move by Mr. Stanford.
"It's not education -- it's advertising," he said. "It's psychological warfare. They're trying to basically steal these children's minds and get them to spend their money on these products."
Ms. Butler-Wall said children were sometimes unwittingly bombarded with advertising, something she had seen recently while volunteering in her daughter's third-grade reading class. The teacher had made flashcards to test the children on vowel sounds. One said "Coke," and the teacher remarked that all the children knew that one.
"It showed me that commercialism is so much a part of the white noise of the school that even an absolutely fabulous teacher like this one really didn't hear the words come out of her mouth," Ms. Butler-Wall said.

HEADLINE: Moves Continue on Price Index Changes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and Congress continued today to dance around one of the most sensitive issues they face this year -- whether to reduce cost of living adjustments for Social Security.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urged the House Banking Committee today to tackle the issue head on by appointing a commission that would provide a better estimate of increases in the cost of living than the Consumer Price Index, which most economists believe overstates inflation. 
 The White House began sounding out Congressional Democrats and Republicans about whether there was some middle ground on the issue, including the creation of a commission. But Administration officials confronted divisions within each party as well as between them.
Republicans privately admitted that they are sorely tempted to slow cost of living adjustments to pay for the big tax cuts they have proposed. But, still stinging from the pounding they took over the last two years for proposing reductions in the growth of Medicare, they fear that Democrats will depict them in the next election as taking money from Grandma to give a break to the wealthy. "Accurate statistics should not be demagogued, but they are," said an aide to one top Republican.
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, were torn between their traditional commitment to protecting entitlement programs and the need to come up with money to protect spending priorities.
A group of conservative House Democrats has proposed reducing the Consumer Price Index by 0.8 percentage points in calculating cost of living adjustments as a way of helping to eliminate the Federal deficit. But the House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, said today that such adjustments should be removed completely from the budget process.
"That simply drives a decision to cut, cut, cut, to replace the resolve that some lack in making the tough calls on how to balance the budget," Mr. Gephardt said. "If Alan Greenspan believes there is a 100 percent probability that the C.P.I. is exaggerated, I believe that politicians appointing a commission will lead to a 100 percent probability that the decision will be politicized."
Support for reducing the adjustments is strongest in the Senate, where the leaders of both parties, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, a Republican, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat, both support a commission.
But in the House, Republican leaders including Speaker Newt Gingrich and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, want the White House to settle the issue with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are wary of any commission that would put Republicans on record as having voted for a reduction in the payments. Aides to Mr. Gingrich said he did not want to rush a decision just for the sake of balancing the budget.

HEADLINE: Terse Congressman Questions Greenspan's Market Motives

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
A lot of people on Wall Street have been asking in the last few days why Alan Greenspan thought it was his place to judge that stock prices might be too high, and today a Republican member of the House Budget Committee put that question to him, directly and somewhat testily, suggesting that the Fed chairman should quit meddling when it comes to the financial markets.
"My question to you," Representative Jim Bunning of Kentucky said, "is why have you, on two occasions, taken to jawboning the U.S. stock market and the U.S. bond market with your comments to affect a free and open market as head of the Federal Reserve Board, which is in charge of setting monetary policy?" 
 Mr. Greenspan replied that he had not intended to talk the markets down when he warned last week that investors might have too rosy a view of the risks in the market. Moreover, he said, he never would have succeeded if that were his intent.
"These are very thick, elaborate international markets which are driven by decisions of millions of people," Mr. Greenspan said. "Nobody can affect them in a fundamental way. There is no way you can divert extraordinary forces of supply and demand in those markets."
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that his remarks could move the markets temporarily, but he attributed such moves to a small group of speculators.
"The reason why that happens is that there are numbers of people on the fringes of the markets who move in and out and are very often trading on the basis of information which as best I can judge is rather faulty," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Bunning was clearly not satisfied with Mr. Greenspan's protestations of innocence and impotence. Breaking the established pattern of deference to Mr. Greenspan by members of Congressional committees, Mr. Bunning abruptly cut Mr. Greenspan off several times, saying, at one point, "I've only got five minutes, and I've got some other questions."
Mr. Bunning noted that Mr. Greenspan had declined to answer several questions from other members of the committee about sensitive political topics because they were not directly related to monetary policy.
"Why have you chosen not to stay on the sidelines as far as the open New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq stock exchange and the bond market, and for that matter, other markets around the world?" Mr. Bunning asked.
Mr. Greenspan replied that the markets had a direct influence on monetary policy.
"The fact of the matter is that they do because in order to make the appropriate judgments as to what degree of monetary tightening or loosening in which we engage, it is very important to look not only at the structure of how we produce goods and services but also to have very good insight into the financial markets as they are evolving," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Congress Again Kills Budget-Balancing Proposal

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
For the eighth time in 15 years, Congress has defeated a Constitutional amendment to require the Federal budget to be balanced.
Today, as expected, the Senate buried it in a shallow grave, by just a single vote, as it did two years ago. The vote was 66 in favor and 34 opposed, or one short of the two-thirds requirement for a constitutional amendment. All 55 Republicans voted yes; 34 Democrats voted no and 11 voted yes. 
 Proponents of the amendment insisted they would try again, probably in the next Congress, and blamed political pressure for their defeat.
"Those who have twisted the last arm," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, "are those who are frightened by the concept of less government, rather than more." Mr. Domenici, the Budget Committee chairman, argued that the amendment "is about freedom." He said: "To the extent that government grows and grows, freedom diminishes and diminishes. To the extent that we tax and tax, our freedom diminishes."
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the senior Democrat in the Senate, said the amendment "would rudely disrupt the carefully balanced powers of the three branches, so assiduously planned by the framers. It would, for the first time in our history, write a specific fiscal policy into a Constitution intended to accommodate the ages."
"It would subjugate every endeavor, every need, every aspiration of the people of this nation to one goal -- the goal of perpetually maintaining budget balance," he said.
President Clinton praised the Senate action, issuing a statement saying that the amendment "could have caused or worsened recessions, permitted a minority of legislators to hold the nation's creditworthiness hostage, involved unelected judges in spending and tax policy, and threatened Social Security and other vital benefits."
The amendment would require receipts to equal outlays in every year unless Congress, by a three-fifths majority, voted to suspend the requirement. A major argument against it was that it would threaten Social Security payments.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, complained, "Every time they are losing, they try to bring up the Social Security argument." He added: "I'm tired of it. It's not right for them to continue to hide behind this phony issue. It's about time to get rid of the demagoguery."
But when the votes were cast, the amendment was defeated in the Senate, as it was in 1986, 1994, 1995 and 1996. The Senate passed the amendment on a 69 to 31 vote in 1982, but it was defeated in the House that year, as it was in 1990, 1992 and 1994. The House passed it in 1995, but the Social Security issue has tied it up in committee this year.
Mr. Hatch promised to try again. "It's not over," he said. "I never quit. I'll look for a wishbone in a soft-boiled egg, and there's a lot of soft-boiled eggs out there." He then said, "Maybe I ought to be looking for some backbones instead of wishbones."
The closing debate was arranged in an unusual way, not with speakers alternating in support and opposition, but with sizable chunks of time given first to one side and then the other. That freed senators from the risk of hearing the arguments voiced by the other side.

HEADLINE: Bikini Journal;
An Atomic Age Eden (but Don't Eat the Coconuts)

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: BIKINI, Marshall Islands

 BODY:
After the 23 nuclear explosions that the United States conducted on this remote coral atoll in the 1940's and 50's, one almost expects to visit today and find just a few charred islets surrounded by brackish water emitting an eerie glow.
So the amazing thing about Bikini is how alive it is: a white sand island full of coconut palms swaying over a perfect turquoise sea, fish and sea turtles swimming languorously by the beach. There are also a few tourists, and many more are expected, because Bikini is now once more open to the public. 
 The paradox is that the same atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that once caused immense tragedy to the Bikinians, even vaporizing some of their islets, have now made the island an unusually valuable tourist property.
Aside from its worldwide fame and relics like a bunker that once had a hot line to the White House, Bikini has the appeal of an untouched island and coral reef, as well as a lagoon offering some of the best scuba diving in the world.
Divers often like to explore shipwrecks, and there is no place with wrecks like the lagoon here in Bikini, one of the specks of islands scattered in the Pacific between Hawaii and Japan. Some 19 ships, including the only divable aircraft carrier in the world, lie at the bottom of the lagoon, where they sank after the United States tested what would happen to big ships when an atomic bomb exploded nearby. (They sink.)
Most atolls in the Pacific are barely viable in a modern economy. But Bikini, because of its fame and the bombed-out shipwrecks, might emerge as one of the few that can thrive on tourism. The heartbreak of the Bikinians would become their sustenance.
Six scientific surveys have declared that the island is now basically habitable, so long as residents do not eat too many local coconuts. So the people of Bikini -- who have been wandering about the Marshall Islands as "nuclear nomads" ever since the United States evicted them from their island in 1946 -- are now considering whether to return.
"It's so beautiful here," said Edward Maddison, a Bikinian who is helping to run a new scuba diving program for foreigners on Bikini. "Sometimes I bring my family here, and my kids love to swim in the lagoon because it's so clean.
"Every time I go back, people ask me what it's like, if it's safe to come back to Bikini. If it's safe, we'll be coming back."
The Marshall Islanders were in effect guinea pigs during the nuclear testing, and Western doctors still examine them to determine the delayed effects of radiation. But this time, the Bikini islanders say with a smile, it is they who are conducting the experiment: they stand back and monitor the results as wealthy Western tourists visit the island.
"We're very curious about the effects on those people," said Johnny Johnson, a Bikinian now living in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands.
Bikini became a household name around the world in 1946 when the United States announced that it would test nuclear weapons on the atoll. The countdown for the first explosion was broadcast around the world, vast supplies of film were used to record the mushroom cloud, and Godzilla was said to have risen from Bikini lagoon after being disturbed by the explosions.
A skimpy new bathing suit for women was just coming on the market then in France, and its makers called it the bikini, advertising it as the world's smallest and hoping perhaps to suggest the shocking effect of a nuclear blast.
Over the next 12 years, 22 more atomic or hydrogen bombs were detonated here. One hydrogen bomb dropped over Bikini in 1954 was the most powerful explosion ever detonated by the United States, equivalent to 750 Hiroshima-type bombs. It vaporized one islet and part of two others, and it showered radioactive particles on Marshallese living on other atolls.
So the testing left Bikini deserted.
"It was really bad for the Bikinians, but anything bad can be turned into something good," said Fabio Amaral, a Brazilian who runs the Bikini dive program along with Mr. Maddison and an American, Scott Herman. It is precisely the enforced desertion of Bikini, Mr. Amaral noted, that has made it such a gem today.
"This is a wilderness," he added. "This place hasn't been touched in 40 years."
A large sea turtle made the point a moment later, lazily swimming in shallow water a few feet off the beach. Schools of fish dart about the coral, and Bikinians are also trying to set up a sports fishing program to attract Americans interested in catching bonefish and other game fish.
"I went out with two rods at first, but I had to go down to one because I had double-hookings too often," said Roderick Bourke, 26, an Australian who runs the diving resort and catches the fish that are served to guests.
Despite nervous jokes about how the Bikini landing strip has no need for runway lights, the sea and wind have long since dispersed almost all of the radioactivity, according to extensive testing. Indeed, Bikini now has less background radiation than some American cities. The problem is that the ground still contains cesium-137, a radioactive substance, and this is concentrated in fruits and coconuts grown on Bikini.
A small group of Bikinians sent back to Bikini in the early 1970's had to be evacuated in 1978 because their diet of coconuts resulted in an alarming buildup of cesium in their bodies.
There has been talk of scraping off the entire top layer of earth and sand of Bikini to get rid of the cesium, but the scientific studies agree that the simplest and cheapest way of dealing with this problem would be to spread potassium fertilizer. Plants prefer potassium to cesium, so if potassium were available they apparently would take it and leave the cesium alone.
But the Bikinians are still profoundly wary, and they say they want an assurance from President Clinton that it is safe to go back.
"I see what's going on there on Bikini, and I'm very envious of the people there," said Jason Aitap, the acting mayor on Ejit, a bleak little island accessible only by boat and inhabited by some of the 2,200 Bikinians now living in exile. "I'd love to go back. But you've got to understand that we really want assurances from the U.S. that it's safe."
A few other Bikinians, sitting on the broken white coral outside a home and listening to Mr. Aitap, agreed and nodded their heads. One after another, the Bikinians on Ejit repeated the mantra: the United States has a responsibility, after poisoning their soil, to declare that it is safe for them to return.
The American Ambassador to the Marshall Islands, Joan M. Plaisted, said the United States would look into the possibility of issuing some kind of a statement about whether it is safe to return to Bikini. She added that the United States feels a legal, and perhaps moral, responsibility to the Bikinians because of the nuclear testing.
"The United States Government certainly remains committed to the return of the Bikini people to their original homeland," she said.
The United States seems a bit flummoxed, though, by the way President Clinton has been effectively made the king of Bikinians. There is a long tradition of Marshall Islanders having an outside king, or iroij, and these days many Bikinians say Mr. Clinton is the man.
Traditionally, the king receives fealty from his people but also has a responsibility for them. The Bikinians insist that by moving them off their island and promising to care for them, the United States entered that relationship so that the American President is their king and is responsible for their welfare.
"That's exactly what he is," Mr. Aitap said after being asked if Mr. Clinton was their king. "And we expect him to act like an iroij and look after his people."
One reason the Bikinians want Mr. Clinton as their king is that they are worried by the efforts of Imata Kabua, the President of the Marshall Islands, to declare himself their king -- and claim one-third of their revenues.
Mr. Kabua notes that he comes from a family of chiefs on an atoll near Bikini, and he says he is rightly the king of Bikinians and entitled to the money.
So far, he has not gotten any money from them, but in January he demanded that the Bikinians build him a fine new house in the capital. At a time when many Bikinians themselves are still living in plywood shacks, they saw no reason to use their money to build a mansion for a millionaire like Mr. Kabua.
Asked about the Bikinians' attitude, President Kabua responded with an expletive. His tongue was loosened and he appeared to be drunk (he was interviewed in the hotel bar that he frequents), and he said he would go to court to get access to some of their money. He also said that if they resisted he would expel them from the islands where they have been living, in some cases for decades.
"I'm going to sue them," he said, and then he repeated the expletive.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Buy steel stocks? Which side of the crucible do you stare at?

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch 

 BODY:
PARDON the takeoff on an old cliche, but is the crucible half-full of molten steel or half-empty?
Most steel-industry analysts are high on scrap recyclers who provide the raw material for efficient mini-mills like Nucor, and on the service companies like Olympic Steel or Worthington Industries that turn steel into parts for the eventual user. But when it comes to old-line manufacturers like Bethlehem Steel or National or USX, Wall Street cannot seem to reach a consensus. 
 The naysayers note that old steel mills break down constantly. And they warn of an impending glut of steel, as new plants come on stream, old ones are fixed and labor unrest at Wheeling-Pittsburgh is resolved. They also predict that, even though it costs more than $50 to ship a ton of steel, foreign producers will continue to underprice the Americans.
"I'm just not too keen on this industry right now," said Scott Morrison, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Jordan Estra of Bankers Trust was blunter. "I unabashedly tell investors to sell the steel producers' stocks," he said.
But the cup-half-full contingent is just as vocal in telling its clients to buy big steel stocks. Some note that the industry's productivity has been increasing 7 percent a year, compared with just 2 percent for the overall economy, and that it keeps finding cheaper ways to make steel.
Others just cannot resist a bargain. A few months ago Warren E. Spitz, a portfolio manager at Prudential Investments, bought chunks of USX, which kept its earnings up even during the worst of the recession; LTV, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 with a clean balance sheet and high cash flow, and Bethlehem Steel, which, at $8.375, Mr. Spitz sees as simply undervalued.
"In this market, steel stocks really look inexpensive, and with little downside risk," he said.
Indeed, having risen so little, steel stocks will not have far to fall whenever the bull market turns bearish. "Steel stocks were second only to truckers as the worst-performing group over the last two years," said Richard Aldrich of Lehman Brothers, who, while neutral on most companies, expects LTV and AK Steel, the industry's lowest-cost producer, to outperform the market.
But most of all, steel's new fans cite the law of supply and demand. They note that demand for steel in the United States is at a 25-year high, and that even the influx of foreign steel did not stop prices from rising 15 percent last year. Orders from construction and automotive companies, driven by the strong economy, have been too robust. "There's been a 'temporary' shortage of steel for five years now, and the reason is rising demand," said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, a Salomon Brothers analyst, who has strong buy recommendations on LTV, AK Steel and USX.
Even if supply, not demand, becomes the main factor, steel investors need not prepare to wear mourning threads any time soon. Numerous steel plants, particularly overseas, have been announced and delayed as foreign governments stop subsidizing commodity industries and banks choose not to pick up the slack.
Kenneth W. P. Hoffman, a Prudential research analyst, notes that the Asian nations together have canceled planned capacity for 60 million tons of steel because they could not find financing. "There's a 50 percent likelihood that world steel tightness will send steel prices up 60 percent over the next two years," Mr. Hoffman predicted.
Industry executives readily agree. "Demand for steel is not in question, but supply is," said Keith Busse, president of Steel Dynamics, a mini-mill operator in Butler, Ind., that went public in November.
Prices are creeping up already. In August a ton of steel sold for $274 in the United States; today the price is $315.
But the share prices have been erratic. Steel Dynamics opened at $16, and investors immediately drove the stock to $24. It has since dropped to $19.75.
The stock of Commercial Metals of Dallas, which processes scrap and operates mini-mills, hit a peak of $33.50 twice last year, but now seems stuck around $29. "We have to keep beating the drum about our conservative accounting, and the benefits of processing scrap and steel," said Stanley A. Rabin, its president.
Both those companies are turning up on many Wall Street buy lists primarily because they use new technologies. If there is any pattern to the steel analysts' picks and pans, it is a preference for companies that still view steel as ripe for productivity gains through technology.
Steel Dynamics is adding operations at Butler that can produce processed steel at a fraction of the 3.7 worker-hours a ton that most producers require to make steel. The company is also exploring methods to substitute melted iron ore for more expensive scrap in its mills.
Some of the primary producers are exploring new technologies, often through joint ventures. AK is putting in new finishing plants, and LTV is licensing German technology to reduce iron ore to molten iron, which it can sell to mini-mills as a cheaper substitute for scrap steel.
Some industry pessimists expect that several years down the road, the most modern steel companies will do just fine, particularly if Europe pulls out of recession and demand picks up accordingly. Even Mr. Estra says that "we might see steel stocks go up again a year or two from now."
But on Wall Street, that is a millennium away.

HEADLINE: Town With Bad Luck Waits Out New Flood

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: SHEPHERDSVILLE, Ky., March 4

 BODY:
Good luck seems to trickle into this old river town. Bad luck pours.
In 1854, a cholera epidemic killed 18 people here in Shepherdsville, the Bullitt County seat. In 1862, Confederate cavalry led by Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan burned down the railroad bridge, the town's economic lifeline, in what people here call the "Christmas raid." 
 In 1909 the Salt River overflowed its banks and swallowed the downtown district. In 1917, at Christmastime again, a Cincinnati-to-New Orleans freight train slammed into a passenger train here, killing 49 people. In 1920 it was a fire.
In 1937 it was another flood, and floods again in 1961 and 1964. In 1977 it was a derailment, and in 1989 it was still another flood.
The way Linda Neidlow saw it, as she waited at a shelter here for the flood waters to recede from the living room of her mobile home, "I guess it was just my turn."
"I've been lucky for many years," said Mrs. Neidlow, one of hundreds of Bullitt County residents forced from their homes this week by the Salt River and its tributaries. "The other people haven't."
This town, about 20 miles south of Louisville, is just one of dozens of small towns in Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio that have seen their streets run brown with water that has washed some homes off their foundations and washed away keepsakes and memories from others. More than 3,000 people in the three-state area have been evacuated or are now picking through the damage.
Shepherdsville, born around a salt lick in the late 1700's, is special only in its history and, say the people who live here, in its resilience.
"My trailer isn't insured for floods, just fires," Mrs. Neidlow, a tiny woman in big glasses, said in a worried voice. She paused, then added: "Well, at least I never had a fire. I'm lucky."
Like the rest of mostly rural Bullitt County, Shepherdsville is not a wealthy place. Most people here either earn their living by working with their hands or exist on some kind of government check. It is hard enough to make a life here without having nature sweep in and take what little bit the people have away from them.
"This is a poor county, and poor people," said Charlie Weber, a laid-off masonry worker who has lived here off and on most of his life. "They'll survive because they're used to it."
Mr. Weber stood in front of Bullitt County High School where people were sleeping, eating and worrying about what they will find when the police finally let them back into their homes. Mr. Weber sounded almost angry, but prideful, as he put a face on the people here.
"They'll take their kicking," he said. "They'll come out of it and be thankful for whatever's left. Our Government, they go overseas and rebuild countries that hate us."
He shook his head. "It don't do much for them," he said motioning to where women and children walked through the parking lot with their belongings stuffed into garbage bags.
People here said that a massive backwash from the flooding Ohio River is expected to slow significantly the receding of the flood here.
Mrs. Neidlow does not have a lot, and the flood could take all of that. "I got out in a boat," she said, "so there was not even time to grab, or space to carry, precious keepsakes.
"My photo albums, I remembered to put them way up high," she said, in the hope that the water would not reach her highest shelf.
She is worried about her records. "Hank Williams Sr., Elvis, Johnny Cash," she listed them off.
"They've been playing Johnny Cash a lot" on the radio, said a friend, Dennis Anderson, a union welder before he had open heart surgery. The song the stations play is Mr. Cash's ballad about a flood, in which a small boy asks his father, "How high's the water, Papa?"
"I like him," Mrs. Neidlow said.
But if it is all gone or ruined when she goes home, she will just live with it, she said, adding, "We was brought up to take it."
In the shelter, Betty McGavie sat on a cot and worried about baby pictures. In the hallway of her trailer she has a row of photographs that chronicle the life of her 16-year-old son, Josh, who now lives in Florida with his father. "Every year, I put a new one up there," she said.
Outside Shepherdsville, it was the same story. People waited in the muddy water, and used boats to check on the damage when they could, but the police discouraged it.
People helped one another. They brought food and clothes and something more important, word. That is how Mrs. Neidlow found out that her two dogs were rescued.
No one had to wonder about Elmer Chris Kappell's whereabouts. After enduring major floods in nearby Lebanon Junction, he decided in 1989 to move his house to high ground -- but on the same lot.
Mr. Kappell hired a house mover to jack up the building some three feet. Some people thought he was crazy to spend money just to make it a little safer. But on Tuesday, with hundreds of flooded, abandoned homes all around him, he and his 79-year-old mother, Myrtle, were high and dry.
"I'm real happy," Mr. Kappell said. "We're surrounded by water and I still have a foot to go."
Friends left a small boat tethered to his house, just in case. "If it starts raining again, I'll get the boat and get Mom out of here," he said. "But I think we're going to ride it out."
Back in Shepherdsville, there was nothing to do but wait. A woman in the shelter walked up to Rita Sparks and said, in tears, "My trailer, all my stuff is gone."
"Well, at least you got out," Mrs. Sparks told her.
The flood did close down the KFC, which everyone here still calls the Kentucky Fried Chicken, advertising campaign or no advertising campaign. But the Shoneys was open; so was the White Castle. There was no flood sale on cars at Bullitt Auto Sales. The proprietor was still trying to get $2,100 for a 1964 Ford.
And in the door of the Burger King, a sign announced that, yes, there would be bingo games there Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 10 A.M.
Maybe someone will get lucky.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds More Children Being Offered Marijuana

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
The rising popularity of illegal drugs among teen-agers is trickling down to their younger brothers and sisters, who are becoming more tolerant of drug use and are starting to try marijuana themselves, according to a survey released yesterday by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.
The annual Partnership Tracking Study for 1996, which focuses on children 9 through 12 years of age, found those children to be influenced by teen-agers' use of drugs, primarily marijuana. 
 Nearly one-fourth of the younger children interviewed said they were offered drugs last year, the survey said, an increase of five percentage points from the 19 percent who reported the experience in 1993. Only 7 percent of the parents thought their children were offered drugs.
In the same period, the number of pre-teen-agers who said they had friends using drugs rose to 13 percent from 7 percent. Those who admitted experimenting with drugs themselves rose to 4 percent from 2 percent.
The survey of 2,569 children in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades was interpreted as a worrisome harbinger of even more drug use once they enter high school.
The study is consistent with other reports of drug use among adolescents, especially by the latest Monitoring the Future Survey, released annually by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.
The survey yesterday reported that 8 percent of the sixth-grade students interviewed said they had tried marijuana, while 23 percent of the seventh graders and 33 percent of the eighth graders said they had done so.
"With children less resistant to drugs as they leave the relative safety of elementary school and enter middle school, where their peers are older and drugs are much more a reality, the implications for the future are not encouraging," Richard D. Bonnette, president of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, said in a statement.
Children consider parents a reliable source of drug information, yet parents are less likely to discuss the hazards of drugs with younger children. The survey found that 42 percent of the parents interviewed said they talked regularly with their teen-agers about drugs, but that only 29 percent did so with their younger children.
The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a coalition of advertising and marketing specialists, solicits free television time and print space to run its own advertisements about the hazards of drug use. The Clinton Administration has set aside $175 million in its new Federal drug budget for a mammoth advertising blitz intended to discourage drug use by adolescents and children.
The new study was released at a news conference in Washington.
The latest study was conducted by Audits and Surveys Worldwide Inc., a research group in New York City that used anonymous questionnaires to ask 12,292 children, teen-agers and their parents about drugs.
It reported more tolerance of drugs among white children but less tolerance among black children.

Intrastate Air Fares Are High, Study Says

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Yorkers are being charged prohibitive air fares, especially for travel within the state, according to a report by a member of the State Senate Investigations Committee.
Catherine M. Abate, Democrat of Manhattan, found that, despite recent fare reductions nationally, many New York air fares have remained high or have increased. 
 "An analysis of air fares in the Empire State found that something pricey is in the air," she said.
Among the report's findings were that, on average, airlines charged New Yorkers twice as much per mile for travel within New York than for travel outside the state. New York City travelers are charged three times as much for travel within the state.
It costs an average of $1.19 per mile to fly from one New York city to another, compared with 60 cents to out-of-state destinations. Flights originating from New York City cost $1.35 a mile for in-state flights and 24 cents for out of state.
"If we want to invigorate the economies of our cities, we must insure that the cost of getting to and from them is reasonable," Senator Abate said. The report also found customers flying from Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester paid 366 percent more per ticket than New York City customers for travel to Los Angeles, Orlando, Washington and Boston.
For example, flying from Buffalo to Los Angeles costs $1,691, or 40 cents per mile, while the same flight leaving from New York City costs $877, or 21 cents per mile, the report found. Airlines offer upstate cities little or no competition, the report found. About 77 percent of all upstate markets surveyed offer no competitive pricing. In many cases, different airlines offer identical prices for flights to and from the same major destinations.
The report surveyed American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines, Continental Air Lines and US Air.

HEADLINE: U.N.'s Costs Are Leveling Off, Chief Financial Officer Reports

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 4

 BODY:
The senior financial officer of the United Nations said today that spending for 1998 and 1999 would come in under budget if the dollar remained relatively stable and inflation subdued.
The officer, Joseph E. Connor, a former chief executive at Price Waterhouse who is Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, said the United Nations could spend less than the $2.48 billion it has budgeted for the two years, which is already $123 million below the $2.6 billion the United Nations plans to spend in 1996 and 1997. 
 Because most expenditures are in dollars and member states are assessed in dollars, swings in the dollar's value can increase or reduce the organization's costs outside the United States.
The new Secretary General, Kofi Annan of Ghana, plans additional streamlining this summer.
Such measures are intended to persuade the United States to pay its arrears, which Congress will agree to only if it is satisfied that the United Nations is becoming leaner.
Mr. Connor pointed out that after peaking at more than $3 billion a year in 1994 and 1995, spending for peacekeeping is falling sharply. This year it is likely to total some $1.2 billion, Mr. Connor said at a news conference here.
But he said the finances of the United Nations remain crippled by member states' failure to pay their assessments; the total unpaid at the end of last year was $2.2 billion, slightly less than the record $2.3 billion at the end of 1995.
The United States accounts for an increasing share of those bills. In 1985 the United States was responsible for only 17 percent of arrears, and between 1992 and 1994 its share hovered between 25 and 30 percent. But in 1995 it increased sharply to 54 percent, then reached 61 percent last year.
Of the $1.02 billion the Clinton Administration has asked Congress to appropriate to pay off the American debts to all international organizations, Mr. Connor said, the United Nations' share is $712 million, compared with total unpaid American arrears that he estimates at $1.3 billion.
Washington says the arrears is lower because of a number of financial disagreements with the world body.

HEADLINE: Earnings Outlook for Stocks Gets a Tougher Look

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
While the surprising downgrade in earnings expectations at the AT&T Corporation may be just bad news for the telecommunications giant, it is raising questions about the overall earnings outlook for the stock market.
Moderate earnings growth -- in the 6 to 10 percent range for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks -- is the key to many positive forecasts for the market this year. But if earnings begin to disappoint, it could make it more difficult for the Dow Jones industrial average and other key indexes to push well beyond the record levels they have already reached this year. 
 "AT&T just signals AT&T," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "But I think it's reasonable to expect people may generalize from this circumstance."
Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, a company that tracks earnings estimates, said that analysts' earnings estimates for the stocks in the S.& P. index have already come down about a half of a percentage point from forecasts earlier in the year.
Yesterday, shares of AT&T fell for the second consecutive session -- down 7/8, to 36 -- along with a number of other blue-chip issues. The Dow fell 66.20 points, closing at 6,852.72, down nearly 215 points in just the two weeks since it set its closing high of 7,067.46 on Feb. 18.
Broader market indexes were mixed. The S.& P. 500 lost 4.36 points, to close at 790.95, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 6.19 points, to 1,317.37, as technology issues rebounded.
 As for declining stocks, AT&T -- which said on Monday that earnings for 1997 could fall as much as 30 percent -- is not the only recent indicator that profit expectations might drop.
The McDonald's Corporation said last week that it would slash prices of certain menu items in the face of increasing competition. The drop in its share price as well as those of several of its fast-food competitors indicated that earnings may disappoint. And the General Motors Corporation this week reported declining auto sales.
"To me, it's a warning that Wall Street is too optimistic about earnings in general," said Michael Metz, who is the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company and a longstanding bear. "We can have a very good economy but that doesn't mean it's going to be accompanied by strong earnings."
But Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., said that while investors often react to news like that from AT&T, it is generally not a signal of future earnings disappointments. In other words, the market often over-reacts to news that is particular to one company or industry.
 "The whole idea of individual stocks being proxies for others is one of the mistakes analysts are making," Mr. Birinyi said. "One company comes in early and says we're going to have earnings problems and it's seen as being across the board. It happens every quarter and every quarter we find out that it was a problem that was restricted to company A."
In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned about the impact of disappointing earnings in the current market environment.
"We should keep in mind," he said, "that at these relatively low long-term interest rates, small changes in long-term earnings expectations could have outsized impacts on equity prices."
 Already, estimates for AT&T have been revised downward by more than 20 percent since Monday's announcement, according to First Call.
But some analysts argued that the damage would not spread beyond AT&T. "I wouldn't extrapolate anything from the larger picture from this," said Marshall Acuff, a market analyst at Smith Barney. "This simply means that AT&T is going to have to redirect itself at a time when the competitive environment is going to become more acute."
 Mr. Straszheim at Merrill Lynch, though, warned that the stock market may be facing two difficult prospects this year. If earnings grow by about 6 percent this year, he said, there would probably be many earnings disappointments that would hurt stock prices.
 Nevertheless, he argued, that is preferable to a "red hot" environment of 14 or 15 percent earnings growth in which inflationary pressures and rising bond yields tip the balance away from stocks.
 "If we get that kind of economy, this market's going to fall to pieces," Mr. Straszheim said. "That would be bad news for interest rates and equities. But if there is a moderate growth, low-inflation environment, there will be a whole string of earnings disappointments."

HEADLINE: Raises Tied to Inflation Weighed in Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 4

 BODY:
Without admitting that they were supporting or even seriously negotiating the idea, legislative leaders said today that they have begun discussing a proposal to give legislators, the Governor and other state officials periodic pay increases tied to the rate of inflation -- much the way Social Security recipients get automatic cost-of-living adjustments.
The plan is the latest permutation in the awkward minuet the leaders have been dancing for months, namely how to raise the salaries of the state's 211 legislators for the first time in eight years. In December, a proposal to give the legislators a raise died amid squabbling among the leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki on a variety of other issues. 
 But the disenchantment among the lawmakers about their $57,500 base annual salaries runs so thick that the leaders have reopened discussion of the issue as part of budget negotiations that are just now getting under way, even though no pay increase, even a cost-of-living adjustment, could take effect until 1999. Only California's Legislature is paid better than New York's, with legislators receiving $75,600 a year.
The New York Senate's Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, was the first to float the cost-of-living-increase idea today, saying it would allow legislators' salaries to rise periodically in tandem with the inflation rate. He said many details, like the size and frequency of pay increases, had not been worked out.
But in an indication of just how sensitive the leaders are to openly debating a pay raise, which became an election issue in many legislative races last fall, Mr. Bruno refused to take credit for the idea, did not make a commitment to supporting it and refused to say that he, Mr. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver were actually negotiating it.
"I am not advocating any cost-of-living increase," Mr. Bruno said. "I'm not proposing one. We are not presently discussing one. I am answering a question that if it comes up, there's where I will be."
He insisted that it would not be the same as a raise, saying it would simply allow legislators to "keep even" with their rising expenses.
Asked which of the leaders originally proposed the idea, Mr. Bruno said: "I can't recollect. I'm getting early senility. I can't remember."
He said that in addition to being given to legislators, the cost-of-living increases should be extended to the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state comptroller, some state commissioners and judges.
Asked how he felt about the idea, Mr. Silver said, "Fine with me." But he said he would not accept any pay raise plan if it were offered in exchange for budget proposals that the Assembly Democrats found onerous. Legislative officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have recently said the leaders might approve raises if the Legislature could enact the state budget on time, by April 1, for the first time in 13 years. "I am in favor of anything that is fair and reasonable and is not linked to anyone doing something that they wouldn't normally do," Mr. Silver said.
Like Mr. Bruno, Mr. Silver said the idea was not being seriously discussed but received only "passing mention" in talks among the leaders. "I think the media has given too much attention to it," he said. He added that he supports the idea of naming a commission to study legislative raises, then debating its proposals before voting on the matter.
Mr. Pataki also insisted that there had been little discussion of a pay raise. "To the extent there is any discussion, I think it should be done in the light of day," he said.

From Hip Talk-Show Host to Just a Regular Guy

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR 

 BODY:
Like Bill Cosby, Arsenio Hall uses his own name for the title of a sitcom in which the character he plays has an entirely different name. One problem: Mr. Cosby has solidly established himself in superstardom, while Mr. Hall is still trying, and noticeably struggling.
In "Arsenio," the new ABC series having its premiere tonight, Mr. Hall, once of considerable talk-show fame, plays Michael Atwood, a genial, somewhat square announcer for a sports cable channel in Atlanta. Like Mr. Hall, Michael is youthfully charming and, like a warm puppy, eager to be loved. His wife, Vivian (Viveca A. Fox) is a lawyer with a big firm. She serves as the backboard for Michael's slam-dunk routines. 
 This evening's pilot is a surprisingly listless enterprise. Even the laugh track sounds halfhearted. Vivian fails to get a promotion, and Michael fails to console her properly. That's not so surprising for a man who will take photos of his wife sleeping to prove that she is hogging the covers. As Vivian so aptly puts it, "This is your idea of a mature relationship?" And then for the younger crowd, there is Matthew (Alimi Ballard), Vivian's younger brother, an unemployed Harvard graduate who has moved in with the Atwoods while preaching, "Anyone can take a job but it is only the truly courageous who will not take a job."
In short, "Arsenio" just sits there. There have been widely reported troubles on the set. New writers and producers have been brought in. It's impossible at this point to predict if the series, an expensive one for ABC, can find a truly innovative groove. But don't underestimate the aggressively engaging Mr. Hall.
 
'Temporarily Yours'
CBS, tonight at 8:30
You like Fran Drescher as "The Nanny"? Meet Debi Mazar as Deb DeAngelo in the new CBS series "Temporarily Yours." Irrepressible product of an Irish mother and an Italian father, Debi hails from Brooklyn and, having gone through 27 jobs in two years, is determined to find a "more success-friendly environment" in Manhattan. Her solution: a temporary-employment agency, the kind of place that saves businesses fortunes by evading pension and health-care costs. These days, you take your laughs wherever you can find them.
Debi arrives at "Everything's Temporary," an agency run by Joan Silver, played with raised-eyebrow sleekness by Joanna Gleason ("Into the Woods"). Although appalled by Debi's terminal gregariousness, Joan is persuaded by her flaky son, David (Seth Green), to give her an assignment, which turns out to be applying cosmetics to a corpse in a funeral home. "So cold in here, you could hang meat," observes the unsinkable Debi.
Welcome to the always cute world of New Yawk gumption. Like Ms. Drescher, Ms. Mazar has the neighborhood accent down pat. Viewers will remember her perfect regular-gal turns as Denise Ianello in the series "Civil Wars" and "L.A. Law." Sitcoms thrive on personality. Ms. Mazar has enough to spare.

HEADLINE: ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
With Stars Gone, It's a Free-for-All

BYLINE: By Malcolm Moran 

 BODY:
Steve Lappas needed just two games to know what kind of league the Big East had become this season. After two conference games, those early December meetings made necessary by the 1994 expansion, his Villanova Wildcats had a conference record of 2-0. Lappas looked over his shoulder in search of other successful starts, and he found . . . no one.
No one? 
 When each of the 13 Big East teams had played two games, one team had two losses and 11 teams had one. "That's almost mathematically impossible," Lappas said. "I think it said something right then, in December, that this is unbelievable. But that's the kind of league it is."
Months later, as everyone comes together at Madison Square Garden, little has changed. Villanova and Boston College shared the best record at 12-6, a loss total that tied a Big East record. Eight teams lost six to nine conference games. Last Saturday morning, with six games left in the regular season, there were 56 possibilities for seeding in the Big East tournament; by late Sunday afternoon, Syracuse's 2-point loss to Pittsburgh dropped the Orangemen from No. 4 to No. 8.
But the league is not as weak as computer printouts want us to believe. It is not nearly as awful as the Big East became four years ago, when the failed six-foul experiment permitted players to assume they could clutch and grab, resulting in interminable end-game situations. This transition season became inevitable when six first-round draft choices, including three first-team all-Americans, moved on to the National Basketball Association. The talent pool is young, not depleted. The competition is earnest, not ugly.
But with the N.B.A. rewarding early departures and the National Collegiate Athletic Association doing little to hold on to its most visible players, the league's best teams, the Wildcats, the Eagles and the Georgetown Hoyas, would be fortunate to stay within 15 points of the Georgetown, St. John's and Villanova groups of 1985.
The achievements during the era of Patrick Ewing, Chris Mullin and Ed Pinckney, three four-year players who completed their college-level development while current players were in elementary school, took place in an economic galaxy far, far away. Connecticut's run of five league losses over three seasons, culminated by its 17-1 record a year ago, now appears an impossible achievement. The early-entry temptations of the N.B.A., combined with the archaic amateurism standard perpetuated by N.C.A.A. members, has altered the landscape forever.
A year ago, the Big East's strength came from its ability to keep its marquee players. Kerry Kittles, John Wallace, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson chose to stay -- albeit Iverson only through his sophomore year -- and the Big East had three top-10 schools, plus the Syracuse team that Wallace led to the national championship game. This week, the Atlantic Coast Conference, anchored by Tim Duncan's decision after last season to remain at Wake Forest, has the three top-10 teams. And successful Big East coaches are asked if their achievements this year are less significant.
"You don't appreciate it," Boston College's Jim O'Brien said of Big East basketball, "until you have to play in it or coach in it."
O'Brien very nearly lost his job trying to pull the Eagles upward in an unforgiving conference. Once he reached the top -- this season Boston College shared first place for the first time since 1983 -- the Eagles were considered underachievers. By the old standard, they were. But in this landscape, survival is an achievement.
"I ask this question," O'Brien said. "Would people prefer to have four teams at the top that are in the top 20, and have all the others be also-rans, and have the rest of the conference be less than competitive?"
The answer, unfortunately, is yes. The mismatches that took place often throughout the 1985 season are now remembered as a time of anticipation for the heavyweight championship. The rivalry between the Ewing and the Mullin teams had four years to develop. Now those plot lines can be compressed into four months.
The new standard for a league is its ability to replace lost talent and experience with new stars. The A.C.C. recovered from the premature loss of Joe Smith, Jerry Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace within two years. Even with the expected departure of Villanova's Tim Thomas, seven of the Big East's top 13 players would be back if -- and this is a major if -- Victor Page returns for a junior season at Georgetown.
Without Page, top-15 teams could emerge at Connecticut, Pittsburgh, St. John's and Syracuse. The continued development of new stars -- including Pat Garrity of Notre Dame, Tim James of Miami, Vonteego Cummings of Pitt, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut and Shaheen Holloway of Seton Hall -- would renew an identity that inspires comparisons to the old days.
For now, the once-dreaded 8-versus-9 matchup is worth paying Garden prices for breakfast, and when Syracuse or Notre Dame faces top-seeded Villanova tomorrow afternoon, there are no guarantees.
"We just went to Memphis and beat Memphis," said Georgetown's John Thompson, "and they beat Cincinnati."
Thompson's logic is as sound as his team. If you think the Big East is terrible, go tell him.

HEADLINE: Trade vs. Rights: A U.S. Debate With a Burmese Focus

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Despite pressure on Capitol Hill and a new appeal by a Nobel Prize-winning dissident, senior members of the Clinton Administration are sharply divided over whether a new law requires the United States to impose tougher sanctions on Myanmar, Administration officials say.
The law, signed by President Clinton five months ago, states that the Administration must ban all new American investment in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, if its military steps up repression of the democratic opposition, particularly the dissident Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 The law has forced the Administration to confront the issue of whether concern for human rights is outweighed by economic ties.
If the Administration imposes sanctions, it risks criticism that it is singling out Myanmar while ignoring others, including China.
If the Administration does not impose sanctions, it becomes vulnerable to accusations that its policy of economic engagement supersedes its concern for rights.
One faction -- including the new United States representative to the United Nations, Bill Richardson -- has concluded that the conditions requiring sanctions have been met. But an equally influential group argues that sanctions would have little effect on the military Government.
This latter group -- including the President's economic and trade advisers and the Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen, who as a Senator was one of two sponsors of the law -- has recommended instead that the United States continue to apply diplomatic pressure.
The divisions reflect a larger debate over sanctions as a tool of foreign policy. In the case of China, for example, the Administration has argued that economic engagement will lead to greater political freedom. And just last week, the Administration appeared to sidestep sanctions against Mexico in connection with the drug trade because of its economic importance.
Myanmar, with relatively little American investment, is a more likely place to take a stand in the name of human rights.
The Administration's divisions became clear at a Cabinet-level meeting two weeks ago, according to Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The issue is now expected to be taken up by President Clinton.
A spokesman at the White House, David Johnson, declined to discuss the wrangling, except to say, "We are now considering what course of action supports the law and the purposes of the law."
The military Burmese Government -- the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc -- continues to suppress the political opposition. In the last week, it also intensified its attacks on ethnic Karen rebels and refugees, prompting renewed criticism by the State Department. "The United States is increasingly frustrated by the policies of the Slorc," said the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns.
Rights organizations and members of Congress see the debate as a test of the Administration's willingness to wield sanctions. "The longer they hold off, the more credibility they lose," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the director in Washington for Human Rights Watch Asia.
The Burmese Government, which is dominated by Gen. Khin Nyunt, seized power in 1988. It held elections in 1990 but rejected the results after losing to the National League for Democracy, which is led by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize. While she was released in 1995 from six years under house arrest, the Government has continued to harass supporters.
The United States has already imposed some sanctions against Myanmar, not only for its rights policies but also for its lack of cooperation in fighting drugs. In September Mr. Clinton also barred the military rulers from entering the United States and banned arms sales.
The United States is one of the largest investors in Myanmar, after France, Britain, Singapore and Thailand, with most of the investment coming in the oil and gas sector. But investment has declined since 1991, when it was $80 million, in part because some American companies have responded to rights protests.
But the largest American company operating there, the Unocal Corporation, announced in late January that it had signed an accord to explore and develop offshore gas fields.
A bipartisan group of seven Senators -- led by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky -- has circulated a letter calling on Mr. Clinton to impose the sanctions. The law calls for a ban on new investment if the Burmese Government has "physically harmed, rearrested for political acts or exiled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi or has committed large-scale repression of or violence against the democratic opposition."
The Senators cited instances in which Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had been harrassed and detained in her home as recently as December, while members of the National League for Democracy had been arrested.
"Since the bill was signed into law, the situation has gone from bad to worse," the Senators wrote.
Last month Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi herself appealed for international sanctions, saying there was a "large-scale repression of the democracy movement" under way. In a rare meeting with reporters today, she complained of new arrests and intimidation tactics, saying, "The situation is getting worse all the time."
What has made the Administration's debate more interesting is the fact that members of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy team have been publicly intertwined with Burmese policies.
Mr. Richardson and the new Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, have each met with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. And Mr. Cohen joined Senator Dianne Feinstein of California in drafting the law, which was a compromise that headed off calls last year for immediate sanctions.
Ms. Feinstein's office declined repeated requests for comment, but in an interview last month in The Los Angeles Times, she said the conditions laid out in the law had not been met.
Ms. Albright has indicated a willingness to impose sanctions but has advocated a third option: giving Myanmar 60 days to improve conditions.
Marc A. Phiessen, a spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican from North Carolina, who signed Mr. Moynihan's letter, said the Administration should simply follow the law.
"It's mind-boggling," he said, noting that a State Department report on human rights in January showed that the conditions for sanctions had been met by the continued pressure on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. "Does she have to be assassinated before they will impose sanctions?"

HEADLINE: Music and Meatloaf Served a la Elvis

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD ROTHMAN 

 BODY:
TAKING a cue from the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, the estate of Elvis Presley is packaging the legacy of the rock-and-roll icon as a new restaurant and entertainment complex called Elvis Presley's Memphis. The estate hopes this will be the start of a worldwide chain.
Lansky's, the Memphis department store where Presley spent his early record royalties on fancy clothes like the plaid jacket he wore on the Ed Sullivan show, is being gutted and remade into a 250-seat, two-story restaurant and bar, to open in late May. It will have a stage visible from both floors for multimedia and live entertainment. 
 Jack Soden, the chief executive of Elvis Presley Enterprises, said the $4 million venture would not be a "plastic shrine."
"It's going to be a jumping joint," he said by telephone from his office at Graceland, the Presley mansion-turned-tourist-mecca in Memphis. "Raw, gritty, authentic, like Elvis."
"We're going to showcase musicians Elvis worked with. Like Scotty Moore, the lead guitarist from the Sun Studio days; D. J. Fontana, who played drums, and J. D. Sumner and the Stamps, the gospel group that were part of his concert shows," Mr. Soden added.
The new club may also offer the closest thing to a real Elvis sighting. The developers plan to introduce a three-dimensional virtual Presley. Other high-tech productions will include multimedia fusings of live acts with taped or filmed Presley performances. "The Jordanaires, who backed up Elvis on the Sullivan show, could be singing live on stage, for example, while accompanying Elvis on film," Mr. Soden said.
Keith Youngquist, an interior designer with the Chicago-based Aumiller Youngquist, said the restaurant would reflect Presley's tastes: "We said, 'What would he do if he had built a place on Beale Street, literally within blocks of where he grew up?' "
The memorabilia on the walls will go beyond white jumpsuit and gold records to mine Presley's own memorabilia collection, Mr. Youngquist said, adding, "We have, for example, flatcars he played with as a kid."
The menu will reflect Presley, too, said Michael Graves, chairman of the Dakota Company, which will operate the restaurant. He said the dishes would include meatloaf, "which Elvis loved, a pulled pork shoulder sandwich and an Elvis favorite: fried peanut butter and banana sandwich."
Mr. Soden said sites being considered for branches are 42d Street in Manhattan, Southern California and Orlando, Fla.
Memphis officials hope the flagship complex will continue the revitalization of downtown begun in 1984 and in particular of Beale Street, the home of the jazz trumpeter W. C. Handy. It will join a strip of clubs that includes Rum Boogie Cafe, Alfred's and B. B. King's Blues Club, the recently opened restaurant and club of the legendary jazz singer.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Stocks can't continue marching upward, an economist says.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WITH the stock market outpacing the wildest expectations in the last few years, can the good times roll on much longer? Don't ask the dismal scientists. In what amounts to a rare instance of collective professional humility, economic forecasters are loath to predict changes in equity prices.
That's not quite the end of the story, however. Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based liberal group, claims no special insight into the workings of the equities market. But he does argue that the trend in stocks cannot be sustained. The 7 percent real return enjoyed by investors over the last 70 years, he suggests, is simply incompatible with mainstream forecasts of growth of less than 2 percent in the gross domestic product over the long haul. 
 His analysis, in a report just issued by the Twentieth Century Fund, takes direct aim at pension specialists who have been promoting stocks as a painless fix to Social Security's problems. But it is also relevant to individual investors, who have grown accustomed to thinking of the market as a perpetual motion machine.
Make no mistake: the equities-are-better argument is seductive. Since the mid-1920's, the average annual return on stocks has exceeded the return on Government bonds by more than five percentage points. Of course, stock prices are volatile. But according to the conventional wisdom, anyone socking away assets for the long term would have to be nuts to pass by the rewards from this persistent "equity premium."
Many stock analysts explain the high-flying Dow Jones industrial index as belated recognition that recessions -- and accompanying dips in corporate earnings -- are a thing of the past. But number-crunching types don't bother with the "why." If the equity premium has endured for seven decades, the reasoning goes, the best guess is that it will endure for many more. Hence the enthusiasm for investing retirement money -- public and private -- in stocks.
Mr. Baker's pessimism is not rooted in some esoteric theory of stock pricing. Rather, he argues that optimistic extrapolations of stock prices are inconsistent with modest projections of economic growth. The total value of traded stocks today, he notes, is about 20 times corporate profits. If profits remain a relatively stable share of national output and output per worker continues to grow at about 1 percent a year, the stock market's price-earnings ratio would have to rise to 34 by 2015 to sustain a 7 percent average return.
Conceivable, you say? Perhaps. But this is a Ponzi game: for the assumption to hold, the market's price-earnings ratio would have to reach 485 to 1 by 2070.
Of course, profits might grow more rapidly than G.D.P. if the share of income going to capital grew at the expense of labor. But here, too, the unlikely soon becomes the implausible: to sustain a 7 percent return and a price-earnings ratio of 20, average wages (not labor's share of income) would have to fall by one-third over the next four decades.
There is a way corporate income could rise more rapidly than G.D.P. without exacting a pound of flesh from labor. "The stock market bulls say corporations will earn an increasing share of profits in emerging markets," says Burt Malkiel, an economist at Princeton University. But the numbers would work only if foreign corporate earnings rose into the trillions by the middle of the next century -- a far-fetched prospect.
If standard assumptions about future productivity gains and the division of the pie between capital and labor do hold, Mr. Baker calculates that the return to stocks will average a bit more than 4 percent over the long term. And if capital's share of income should fall, or price-earnings ratios revert to averages of earlier generations, it could be as low as 3 percent. "If I had to bet, I'd guess we'll see a major adjustment in stock prices in the next two years," Mr. Baker concludes.
Perhaps rapid productivity growth, which made 7 percent returns on stocks possible for so long, will reward investors for their giddy optimism. If that is the case, though, there would be no need to look to equity investments as a way to cover generous promises to future retirees. Rapidly rising productivity would almost certainly lead to rapidly rising wages, which in turn would yield a tsunami of revenue from the payroll tax.
Equity investments may still make sense for long-term investors. So may the creation of privately held accounts to supplement Social Security, if only to make higher, mandatory savings more palatable to Americans. But the message in Mr. Baker's calculations is still a slap in the face: no amount of optimism can repeal the laws of arithmetic.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Retreats After Climbing To 3-Year High Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar briefly touched a three-year high against the German mark yesterday but ended slightly lower against it and other currencies, weakened by trade tension between the United States and Japan and the renewed prospect of rising Japanese interest rates.
Traders said the dollar also retreated a bit because of uncertainty over employment reports to be released this week in the United States and Germany. Germany's unemployment rate has surged this winter, while the employment situation has remained solid in the United States, which would be expected to help the dollar, but speculation in the market has gone both ways. 
 "I think we're really in a wait-and-see situation until we get the data," said David Becker, senior dealer at the New York branch of Bank Austria. "Any surprises away from what we're expecting will be important."
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7172 marks, the strongest since April 1994, before falling back to settle in New York at 1.7121 marks, down from 1.7146 on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar settled in New York at 121.21 yen, down from 122.16. The British pound cost $1.6137, up from $1.6126.
Traders sold the dollar against the yen in early Asian dealings after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin suggested that Japan's current economic policies might not be sufficient to stimulate domestic demand.
His remarks were taken to mean that the Clinton Administration was increasingly restive about Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which could increase sharply if the yen's weakness continues. A cheaper Japanese currency makes Japan's exports more affordable abroad.
Mr. Rubin's remarks coincided with Japanese data that showed a 53 percent rise in Japan's trade surplus during the first 20 days of February compared with a year earlier.
Some traders said the dollar's retreat was understandable in view of the run-up over the last few months. Since Dec. 31 the dollar has appreciated about 13 percent vs. the mark and more than 5 percent vs. the yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.4821 Swiss francs, down from 1.4861; 5.7750 French francs, down from 5.7805, and 1,704.75 Italian lire, down from 1,707.35.

Rethinking China, Part II

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Madeleine Albright just visited China. On her next trip, here's what she should say to President Jiang Zemin.
Albright: We usually come to these meetings with a list of dissidents you've imprisoned. If we're lucky you toss us a bone, let someone out of jail and we pretend human rights in China have improved. We tell the U.S. press "We bluntly raised our human rights concerns, but we have other interests and can't hold the U.S.-China relationship hostage to human rights alone. And blah, blah." 
 Let's stop this sham. You know that neither our allies nor our own business community will allow us to impose the sort of biting economic sanctions on you that would really get your attention. We could only muster such sanctions in times of war, and we're not in a war. But we have other tools. We have our own spotlight and we have the pressures building up inside your own country to move toward a more law-based society, and we intend to use both.
We're going to use our spotlight to highlight those areas where you've progressed in implementing rule of law instead of arbitrary Communist party rule, and to highlight those areas where you've not. That is going to be the thrust of our human rights policy from now on -- rule of law. Get used to it. Rule of law. We're no longer going to treat human rights as simply winning the freedom of some dissident, or as an isolated issue that my State Department human rights office deals with and no one else. No, no. The President has directed the State Department, Pentagon, Commerce, Trade Representative and every other U.S. agency dealing with China to formulate all policies vis-a-vis China with the long-term objective of encouraging you to replace arbitrary, unaccountable, opaque operations with rule-of-law procedures.
Now, you deserve recognition for introducing more rule of law in the areas of administrative procedure, copyright, even criminal justice -- though your officials still have too much discretion in whether they implement these new laws. We know you're not making these changes for our sake. You're making them because you've concluded that without a more predictable, accountable rule of law you will never be able to get to that next stage of economic development, and since you have no ideology anymore -- other than "to get rich is glorious" -- if you can't deliver that next stage you're toast.
But we are going to keep pushing you, because there are still too many areas you haven't moved in: You still restrict freedom of association. You still use your laws to criminalize all sorts of peaceful activities, from political dissent to environmental advocacy. You still sentence people to "re-education through labor." We're going to draw attention to these practices in every international forum, with as many allies as we can, so it is clear to your people that this is not the U.S. versus China -- which only brings out a nationalist backlash -- but China versus international norms.
And we are going to look for every vehicle -- whether it's funding legal-education programs, helping to train Chinese criminal defense lawyers or intensifying our demands that you implement real commercial and intellectual property laws -- to promote rule of law within China at large.
Mr. Jiang, when our human rights policy toward China focused on freeing dissidents, we could be 100 percent for it and you could be 100 percent against it. But when our human rights policy still cares about dissidents but makes its primary focus promoting rule of law in China, you can't be 100 percent against it, because you're instituting rule of law for your own reasons and betting that you can do it in some sectors while never letting it apply to you at the top. That's fine. We'll take that bet.
Mao said "We will never accept foreign capital." Then Deng came along and said "We will accept foreign capital, but never foreign norms." Now you come along and say "We will accept foreign capital and some foreign norms, but not others." O.K., we'll wait for the next guy. But in the meantime we'll have a human rights policy toward China that helps make it a better place for the Chinese people and that lays down some rule-of-law foundations for whatever comes after you.
Jiang to Albright: What does it mean to be toast?

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Higher On Hopeful Rate Outlook

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Trading in the bond market turned positive yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated in testimony to Congress that the Fed would not raise interest rates simply to snuff out growth, but only if imbalances appeared in the economy.
Few analysts had expected Mr. Greenspan, in his appearance before the House Banking Committee, to deviate from the speech he delivered to the Senate last week, in which he sounded a cautionary note to the financial markets. 
 But they had been worried about what Mr. Greenspan might say in the question-and-answer period after the speech. Afterward, however, analysts said that Mr. Greenspan appeared to back down slightly from his comments last week, when he warned the financial markets that the chances for a "pre-emptive policy tightening" -- in other words, an increase in interest rates -- should not be dismissed.
Treasury securities prices rose after yesterday's comments, with the 30-year bond rising 16/32, to a price of 97 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.82 percent, from 6.86 percent on Tuesday.
But it is unclear whether the gains will be sustainable. With the Government report on employment for February coming tomorrow, and traders concerned about possible inflationary signs in it, many investors saw yesterday's higher prices as a selling opportunity, traders said.
Furthermore, some of the gains yesterday were enhanced by speculators who were betting on more negative news from Mr. Greenspan. After his comments, they were forced to cover short positions, which occur when market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. If prices begin to rise instead of fall, these participants still have to cover their short positions to limit their losses, which accelerates the upward momentum of the market.
Like other analysts, Scott F. Grannis, a director and chief economist of Western Asset Management, a money management firm in Pasadena, Calif., said it appeared to him that Mr. Greenspan was a little less aggressive this time around in his comments about the economy. But Mr. Grannis said he still thought that the Fed chief, in looking for signs of economic growth as possible signals of inflation, might be sending investors the wrong message.
"Evidence suggests Greenspan has done a terrific job in monetary policy and in fighting inflation, perhaps the best in a long time," Mr. Grannis said. "Recently though, he has placed a huge emphasis on economic growth. He has convinced the markets that growth causes inflation, and it just doesn't. He causes inflation, not wages and not growth, and has really steered the markets in an unfortunate direction."
Similarly, Mr. Grannis said that the markets -- particularly in their anticipation of the monthly employment reports -- were looking at the wrong indicators of inflation. "The economy grows best when inflation is generally low or is falling," he said. "Good indicators are commodity prices, the dollar and gold; these indicators tell you there is a monetary imbalance which could lead to a general rise in all prices."
David Cole, a fixed-income securities analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said he thought there was little news in the Fed chairman's speeches. And while some short-sellers were forced to cover their positions yesterday, "this does not reflect a change in market sentiment, just a realization that new information will be needed before the next leg down can be initiated."

HEADLINE: Government Broke Law in Barring U.S. Jews From Saudi Project

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The Commerce Department has settled a lawsuit in a highly unusual case in which it charged the Justice Department and the Air Force with violating a law that prohibits American companies from respecting an Arab boycott of Israel and Jews.
The settlement papers, filed recently at the Commerce Department, show that officials from the Justice Department and the Air Force ordered a private contractor to exclude Jews and "Jewish-surnamed personnel" from a Government project in Saudi Arabia in deference to the Saudis. 
 The papers said there was no evidence that the Government of Saudi Arabia had played any role in the exclusion. The idea was initiated by an Air Force colonel and approved by a Justice Department official, the papers said.
The Air Force and the Justice Department have apologized and said they would take steps to insure that their behavior would not be repeated.
The Commerce Department, which enforces the anti-boycott law, recently reported that violations had become increasingly rare as companies had come to understand the law. Department officials said they believed that until now no Government agency had been found in violation.
Jess Hordes, the Washington director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, who had asked the Commerce Department to investigate, said today, "It is astounding that two Government agencies were complicit in illegal discriminatory behavior."
Mr. Hordes also noted that there was a written project proposal, explicitly excluding Jews, that apparently was reviewed through several drafts at the Justice Department.
"This seems to underscore a certain systemic blindness in an important Government agency," he said.
The problem began in 1991 when the Air Force and the Justice Department began to work together when Boeing brought a lawsuit against the Government having to do with military sales abroad. In preparation for the lawsuit, the Government needed to copy thousands of microfilmed documents in Saudi Arabia, a job for which it hired an outside contractor, CACI Inc., of Virginia.
As a result of comments made by the Air Force officer, Col. Michael J. Hoover, the proposal included the provision: "No Jews or Jewish-surnamed personnel will be sent as part of the Document Acquisition Team because of cultural differences between Moslems and Jews in the region."
At least one Jewish worker was denied employment on the project and received a cash settlement from CACI, people familiar with the case say.
In the settlement, which was first reported today by The Journal of Commerce, the Commerce Department imposed a fine of $15,000 against CACI, which signed a statement that it was mistaken "to follow orders from two Federal Government agencies" on the assumption that the orders were legal.
A $15,000 fine against a company official was suspended, as were fines of $20,000 against Colonel Hoover and the Justice Department official, Jane Hadden Alperson.
Frank W. Hunger, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the civil division, said in a letter to the Commerce Department that Ms. Alperson had been unaware of the law.
Arab countries cut most economic links with Israel when it gained independence in 1948. In 1954 the Arab League adopted a resolution calling on Arab countries not to trade with Israel. The Arab League drew up regulations in 1972 to administer the boycott, and in 1979, Congress passed legislation that barred compliance.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Calms Market and Stocks Soar

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
After giving Wall Street a bad case of the jitters last week by suggesting that financial markets might be overvalued, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered slightly more soothing comments today, and investors latched onto them to drive stock and bond prices sharply higher.
In a speech to a group of economists this morning and in testimony before the House Banking Committee this afternoon, Mr. Greenspan said he did not know which way stock prices were headed and that the market would be overvalued only if analysts' projections for substantial earnings increases in the next few years proved wrong. 
 "There is a valid argument as to sustaining the level of prices," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to the National Association of Business Economists.
Mr. Greenspan's comments helped push stocks higher. The rally accelerated after his afternoon testimony, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 93.13 points, or 1.36 percent, at 6,945.85.
Although Mr. Greenspan repeated his warning of last week that the Fed might have to undertake a "pre-emptive" tightening of monetary policy to head off inflation before it infected the economy, the bond market appeared relieved that he did not provide any new indications that the Fed would raise rates anytime soon. Rising bond prices drove the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.82 percent from 6.86 percent. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Mr. Greenspan did not back off his comments from last week raising questions about whether the rapid run-up in stock prices over the last two years was sustainable. Indeed, he repeated them, word for word, in his appearance before the banking committee, saying "history counsels caution," especially in looking at "the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years."
But Mr. Greenspan appeared to be going out of his way to make sure that investors heard the main caveat to his message: that if the current mood of economic optimism in the markets proved warranted, then his warning would prove to be nothing more than the musings of someone who, by his own admission, was paid to be a worrywart.
Responding to questions from members of the banking committee, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged knowing that his comments last week and his comment about "irrational exuberance" in the markets several months ago would probably send the market down temporarily. But he continued to insist that not even he could fundamentally alter the direction of stock and bond prices and said that was never his intention anyway.
"I was merely raising a broad question," Mr. Greenspan told the banking committee. "And today in my prepared remarks you will find that I take a look at the various factors affecting the stock market and conclude that if profit margins continue to rise as analysts in Wall Street expect them to, then the market is properly priced as best we can judge on the basis of the level of where interest rates are."
Mr. Greenspan immediately reiterated the other side of that equation, that if profit margins "fail to rise further, then the market will run into some difficulty."
But he said that "in the process of evaluating" which way the market was likely to go, "we don't know what is likely to happen."
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan said, he does not consider monetary policy a tool to "prick the stock market bubble."
Mr. Greenspan's conduct of monetary policy came under intense attack from several Democratic members of the banking committee and from the lone independent in Congress, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is often described as a socialist. They questioned whether he was too quick to raise interest rates, choking off growth along with inflation and creating more unemployment in the process.
Mr. Greenspan repeated that he has many doubts about the widely held academic theory that there was a definable unemployment rate below which wages and inflation inevitably began to accelerate.
In one telling exchange, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts elicited an acknowledgment from Mr. Greenspan that he had been too pessimistic about his outlook for the economy over the last four or five years.
"I think what some of us are worried about when you talk about pre-emptive strikes is that you might be a little too pre-emptive because there has been this historic mis-estimate," Mr. Frank told Mr. Greenspan. "A lot of people missed it, and you did as well as anyone could. But that's part of our problem -- where you have a history of a little bit more pessimism than turned out, we just hope that correction gets factored in" to future monetary policy decisions.
Questioned about his support for reducing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit payments because of problems with the Consumer Price Index, Mr. Greenspan told Democrats on the panel that he had no objection to setting a special cost-of-living index for the elderly. Some economists believe that retirees are subject to greater annual increases in cost of living because of their high levels of medical expenditures, and that any adjustments to benefit payments should reflect that disparity.

HEADLINE: Frustration on All Sides At the Budget Struggle

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Nearly a month after a highly publicized meeting on Capitol Hill between President Clinton and Congressional leaders, negotiations on a balanced budget plan have made virtually no headway, and today growing frustration on both sides broke into the open.
In the last several days, Mr. Clinton's budget has come under a sustained attack from Republican leaders, who demanded that he submit a whole new proposal after the Congressional Budget Office said his budget would not eliminate the deficit by 2002. 
 Today the Democrats responded with a coordinated effort.
Accusing the Republicans of "politicizing" the budget process, the Democratic leaders -- Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri -- demanded that the Republican leadership begin immediate consideration of a budget resolution and offer their own amendments to the Administration's proposals that they find objectionable.
"There appears to be the same sort of political approach now to budget consideration that we saw two years ago," Mr. Daschle, the Senate minority leader, said at a news conference today where he was joined by his counterpart in the House, Mr. Gephardt. "And I believe that, unless something changes, that political approach is going to lead to the same political result, which is a shutdown of Government and complete chaos again, which all of us have pledged to try to avoid that this year."
An equally pointed attack came from the Administration's senior budget negotiator -- Franklin D. Raines, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.
"We think the time for stalling is over," Mr. Raines said in a speech before the National Association of Business Economists. "If they want to cut taxes, let them tell us how they will pay for this."
But the comments angered one of the major Republican negotiators, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
"I don't appreciate insinuations that I am not going to do my job," Mr. Domenici said. Then, referring to the C.B.O. report, he added: "We were asked to work with the President off his budget and we are doing our best. But it is getting progressively difficult when we get reports like this."
Until now, leaders of both parties had mostly avoided public bickering over the budget, worried that protracted fights like the ones of the last two years might cause political damage and a public backlash. Both Democrats and Republicans pledged to work together this year, with Mr. Clinton's budget plan as the basis of negotiations.
But since Mr. Clinton's ceremonial good faith visit to Capitol Hill on Feb. 11, the work on the budget has been limited to low-key meetings between White House negotiators and mainly Senate budget writers, who have focused more on establishing rapport than on budget substance. Now the rapport appears to be unraveling.
Members of Congress from both parties say that the Administration has, on some important proposals, provided little more than a rough sketch of what it wants. But there have been internal party problems, too -- a Republican leadership in the House that is under attack from its members for not charting a clear legislative course and infighting in both parties, especially the Democrats, over the middle ground in which Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders want to anchor the budget.
Leaders moved today to try to resolve both those issues.
Mr. Clinton held a late afternoon meeting at the White House with Democratic budget leaders to try to agree on a common strategy. And House Speaker Newt Gingrich's office said that the Georgian Republican would hold a news conference on Thursday to lay out his agenda.
The building rancor erupted this week when the Congressional Budget Office released on Monday an appraisal of Mr. Clinton's budget that said it would leave the Government with a deficit of $69 billion in 2002 instead of the $17 billion surplus the Administration forecast.
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, demanded that the President submit a new budget, "one that is in balance in 2002."
And on Tuesday, as bitterness between Democrats and Republicans increased over the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, which failed by one vote in the Senate, Mr. Gingrich and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader, fired off their own salvos at the President and his budget.
That has put the Democrats on the offensive.
"The idea that somehow the President should submit a second budget, not only is delaying the process, but is politicizing it way beyond anything we have seen in some time," Mr. Daschle asserted.
A senior Republican aide with the Senate Budget Committee dismissed the flareup as "institutional rhetoric" and said private discussions between White House officials and Senate Republicans are continuing on pace.
Chastened by the previous fights, the Republican leaders have refrained from introducing an alternative to Mr. Clinton's budget, despite the clamoring of some of their members who worry that the Democratic Administration is setting too much of the agenda.
On Tuesday, a White House official expressed irritation that Congressional Republicans had not put forth a detailed budget proposal.

HEADLINE: Auto Retailing's New Behemoth;
Republic's Huizenga Wants to Dominate the Market

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 5

 BODY:
When Republic Industries announced here today that it had bought a dozen New Jersey new car dealerships in one of the automotive retailing business's biggest deals to date, nobody in the auto industry was even remotely surprised.
Led by H. Wayne Huizenga, the billionaire who has already made two fortunes, Republic is in the middle of an extraordinary buying and building binge. The company is following much the same formula that Mr. Huizenga pursued in consolidating first the garbage hauling business as the head of Waste Management Inc. and then the video rental business through the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, which he sold to Viacom in 1994 for more than $7 billion. 
 Mr. Huizenga has snapped up two car rental companies, Alamo and National, and many of the nation's biggest auto dealers. Republic is setting up two chains of used-car superstores: Autonation for recent models and Valu Stop for older models. It is building huge service centers to recondition trade-ins and rental cars for sale and to compete in the car repair market. And Mr. Huizenga is preparing to set up a finance subsidiary for Republic so that it can make its own loans and leases -- and keep track of who might be able to afford another car in two or three years.
In an interview today, Mr. Huizenga said that Republic would cater to anybody who wants to rent, lease or buy a car that is brand new or used. "When they think of transportation," he said, "we want them to think about us."
The question now is: Can Mr. Huizenga hit another home run or will he strike out this time?
"He sees an opportunity to revolutionize automotive retailing, and he's doing it through a consolidation strategy," said J. David Power 3d, the automotive quality consultant.
Republic's strategy carries enormous risks for everyone involved. Auto makers are torn between frustration at the inefficiency of their bloated dealer networks and worry that they may be losing control over distribution. Some consumer advocates see a danger that Republic may monopolize the mostly Southeastern and Southwestern metropolitan markets that it has picked as targets, eventually pushing up prices. And while many dealers are excited that Republic has been using its soaring stock to pay stratospheric prices, others are terrified at having to compete with a rising corporate powerhouse.
Some of the biggest risks, though, are for Republic and its shareholders. Dealerships struggling to survive in one of America's most cutthroat businesses have had mixed success in the past handling the extra expenses needed to offer the touch-screen computers, children's play areas, attentive staffs and no-haggle prices that Republic has adopted. Executives at smaller chains of dealerships question whether the economies of scale from bringing a number of already successful new car dealerships under one umbrella are strong enough to offset the cost of the corporate bureaucracy that Mr. Huizenga needs to oversee his mushrooming empire.
Moreover, financial analysts say, Republic is relying on a controversial accounting practice known as pooling of interests. Without it, some say, its earnings -- already meager -- might shrink.
Mr. Huizenga, who owns a tenth of Republic's stock and is the company's chairman, and Steven R. Berrard, Republic's president, reply that all of these difficulties have parallels in their experience at Blockbuster and will be overcome. Combining late-model used-car superstores and rental car companies under the same corporate roof, for instance, will allow Republic to rent unsold used cars when rental demand is high on weekends and in late summer, Mr. Berrard said.
The sheer size of Republic's operations has already allowed the company to drive down advertising rates by as much as 46 percent, saving $150 a car, while its huge centers for reconditioning used cars so that they look like new should nearly halve the usual $850 expense, he added.
Mr. Huizenga said that Republic was designed to cater to an American public that was becoming less enamored of cars. The answer now in automotive retailing, Mr. Huizenga said, is to let customers buy, lease or rent whatever meets their needs while involving the least expense and difficulty.
"Americans don't have a love affair with cars anymore," Mr. Huizenga said, adding that as a young man, "I waxed my car every Saturday for Pete's sake."
Since late November, Republic has acquired or reached agreements to acquire 52 huge new car dealerships, including the dozen New Jersey dealerships purchased for $55 million in stock. Already, with roughly $3.8 billion in combined annual sales for the acquired dealers, Republic is the nation's largest retailer of new cars and light trucks.
But does Republic, for all its success in building a huge dealer network virtually overnight, represent a more efficient and profitable way to sell, rent and service cars? On the plus side, Mr. Huizenga should be able to combine accounting, legal and advertising staffs, impose a consistent marketing strategy and trade cars among company-owned dealers so they do not all have to maintain huge and costly inventories of every model.
Still, Ramsay H. Gillman, the president of the National Automobile Dealers Association and the owner of 21 Texas dealerships through his family business, said that most of the benefits had already been captured by existing dealer chains. "The economies of scale have kind of already taken place," he said.
To help him in his quest, Mr. Huizenga clearly has a powerful ally in Detroit. Auto executives have fumed for years at the poor service at many dealerships, but have been unable to do much about it because state laws shelter dealer franchises from interference. In Mr. Huizenga, they have finally found someone willing to invest heavily in new showrooms, consistent displays and signs, and other amenities.
Robert Lutz, the Chrysler Corporation's vice chairman, said it was now up to traditional dealers to prove their worth. "I don't believe that there are economies of scale in the automotive retailing business if the dealers do their job well," he said during a recent flight aboard the company's Gulfstream II jet, a martini in his right hand and a cigar in his left. "If they don't do their job well, there are."
Only three important car lines have refused to give Mr. Huizenga permission to buy their dealers: Saturn, Toyota and Lexus. All three already have efficient networks with high customer service ratings.
The unknown equation in Mr. Huizenga's calculated gamble is whether auto makers will ever start selling new cars to him for less than they charge other dealers, much as big retailers like Wal-Mart have been able to demand volume discounts for television sets and other products. While the evidence is mixed on whether Republic's emphasis on premium service actually pushes up prices -- Republic denies it -- discounts on new cars would clearly allow the company to charge less while offering good service, making it a threat to every competitor.
Mr. Huizenga said that his business plan did not depend on such discounts, and auto makers have vowed never to give Republic and other big chains better prices than their existing dealers. "We are not going to treat Autonation any differently," said Ross Roberts, general manager of the Ford Motor Company's Ford division. "There will not be any volume discounts."
But will the Big Three stick to that position in the next economic downturn, when they may be desperately trying to sell large numbers of unwanted cars again? Lawyers for auto dealers insist that volume discounts would violate the Robinson-Patman Act, a Depression-era law that bars price discrimination. But antitrust experts say that it is extremely difficult to make a case under the law.
Auto dealers would have to prove that discounts lessened competition and were not justified by cost savings the auto makers achieved by dealing with a single large customer. A Federal appeals court ruled 15 years ago that Chrysler could offer prices to its dealers that were indirectly linked to volume. Although Chrysler has not tried to make use of that decision, the ruling, said James Rill, a former Justice Department antitrust chief, "is kind of a landmark decision in the Robinson-Patman lore and it's in the automotive industry."
Mr. Power, the quality consultant, said that he thought Mr. Huizenga would inevitably obtain discounts. "You can't tell me if he's buying 50,000 cars a month, he won't get a better price than the guy in Cheyenne, Wyo., ordering five cars a month."
Whatever the future holds, investors are clearly betting that Republic will make Mr. Huizenga -- and them -- another fortune. The stock closed at $35 today, up $1.25, far above its price of $2 less than two years ago. The market's insatiable demand for Republic's stock has allowed Mr. Huizenga to issue more stock to pay for each acquisition. In addition to companies in the auto business, Republic has bought a number of smaller garbage hauling companies, which have provided most of its profits so far, and a few electronic security companies.
Mr. Huizenga has been paying in stock 7 to 10 times the after-tax earnings for his new car dealerships, considerably higher than previous deals. Yet with Republic's stock trading at a lofty multiple of 51 times the 69 cents a share that analysts expect it to earn this year, the acquisitions have increased rather than diluted earnings.
Some experts remain astonished by the performance of Republic's stock. Martin L. Anderson, a specialist in dealer finances at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., said that he believed Republic's business model would ultimately prove successful, particularly in controlling inventory costs. Still, Republic's stock price multiples "are crazy right now," he said. "They're going to come down to something more normal."
Moreover, Republic's multiples would be even more outside the norm if it did not use a somewhat controversial but perfectly legal accounting method known as pooling of interests that helps it report higher earnings. Republic has adopted this approach in half its deals, avoiding accounting for much of the cost of its buying spree as so-called good will. Because good will must be written off over a period of up to 40 years, Republic's earnings appear larger by not including it.
Michael J. Karsner, Republic's chief financial officer, said that it was not possible to calculate how much good will had been avoided because the valuation of physical assets is also different under a pooling of interests than under conventional purchase accounting. Mr. Berrard said that the pooling of interests involved extra legal costs that outweighed, in the short run, the effect on earnings from reduced good will.
Mr. Huizenga's many admirers on Wall Street argue that none of this matters as long as Republic keeps growing. "From a stock market standpoint, you almost discard the normal, almost mathematical calculations," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz. "Right now, we're in the building phase."

Chart/Map: "Building An Empire"
H. Wayne Huizenga's company, Republic Industries, is aggressively moving into the automotive industry. Just yesterday, Republic announced that it was buying a company that owns 12 car and truck dealerships in New Jersey for $55 million. The announcement is the latest in a string of multimillion-dollar deals designed to create a nationwide automotive retail network offering everything from new cars to auto financing.
 
APRIL 1996 -- Republic announces plans to buy Autonation, a used-car superstore partly owned by Mr. Huizenga. The deal, originally announced for $250 million in stock, ends up at over $600 million.
 
AUGUST -- Buys a used-car superstore company, with outlets in Texas and Michigan, for $95 million in stock.
 
NOVEMBER -- Announces plans to buy a company with new-car dealerships in Ohio and Florida for $100 million in stock.
 
JANUARY 1997 -- Buys five new car dealership companies with locations in South Florida; Phoenix; Los Angeles; Midland, Tex., and Buffalo for $365 million in stock and $16 million in cash. Also buys National Rent a Car for $600 million in stock and the assumption of $1.7 billion in debt.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Canadian Split on Cuba Tangles Wal-Mart's Pajamas

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The battle to undermine the only Communist regime in the Western Hemisphere -- Fidel Castro's Cuba -- has spread to the pajama department at the Wal-Mart in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Late last week, a Canadian customer rummaging through the store's racks discovered that the Arkansas-based retailer was trafficking in Cuban-made pj's. A politically alert store manager pulled the pajamas off the shelves, fearful that the chain could find itself in violation of the Helms-Burton Act. That is the American law that tries to force foreign companies and governments to join in the American embargo of Cuban products. 
 Yet no sooner had Wal-Mart announced that it was also clearing the pajama shelves of its 135 other stores around Canada than the Canadian Government opened an inquiry into whether the retailer had violated a Canadian law that bars companies operating in Canada from obeying the American statute or "observing any directive, instruction, intimation of policy, or other communication" from the United States that furthers the Cuba embargo.
In public at least, Canada is taking its Cuban pajamas as seriously as cigar aficionados take their Cohibas. "We expect Canadian companies and the Canadian subsidiaries of American companies to obey Canadian law, full stop," a spokesman for the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade said this afternoon. If prosecuted and found guilty, he added, Wal-Mart could be fined as much as $1.5 million (Canadian), or a bit more than $1 million (United States) at current exchange rates.
No one thinks it will come to that. But if Wal-Mart is the first to be caught in this maw of conflicting laws and contradictory national policies, it is almost certain not to be the last. Mexico and the European Union have recently adopted similar "blocking" legislation, which makes it illegal for companies doing business within their borders to obey the American legislation, which they are challenging at the World Trade Organization.
The United States vowed two weeks ago to block that challenge. In Washington, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of Commerce, declared that rather than allow the organization to judge whether the Helms-Burton Act violated international trade accords, the United States would invoke a "national security exemption," a claim that Helms-Burton is not a trade action but a law to curb the Cuban threat to the United States.
That declaration was sharply criticized in Europe and Canada and came up earlier this week in a meeting here between Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
The Wal-Mart store where this controversy began is in Winnipeg, Mr. Axworthy's political base. It is not clear whether he has ever shopped for pajamas there.
It is also not clear whether the store manager who started it all may have overreacted. Helms-Burton is aimed at foreign companies that traffic in property Mr. Castro seized from Americans and American companies when he took power nearly four decades ago. It applies, for example, to the Mexican and Italian corporations that have a stake in the Cuban phone system, which was built by American companies.
In this case, Wal-Mart bought the pajamas from a Canadian distributor, who in turn had imported them from Cuba. Other American retailers operating in Canada or Mexico could easily run into the same problem. But if Wal-Mart knows anything about the factory that produced the Cuban-made pajamas, it was not saying yesterday.
"We were concerned that the sale of these goods might violate the Helms-Burton Act," Edward Gould, a spokesman for the company, said today, explaining why store managers from Nova Scotia to British Columbia were told to remove the Cuban jammies. "We're still not sure. Counsel is looking into it."
The diplomatic no-man's land in which Wal-Mart now finds itself was created by two differences between the United States and Canada. One is an honest difference of strategy. The other is a dispute over America's effort to use its economic power to achieve its foreign policy goals.
The question of strategy is this: Do you bring down Mr. Castro faster by preventing him from exporting pajamas, and almost everything else, around the world, or by flooding Cuba with trade, investments and capitalism? The Canadian position is that a 30-year American embargo has failed and that economic engagement -- the phrase Washington uses to defend its policies toward China -- is the only strategy that makes sense. Many in the Clinton Administration say privately that they agree.
But at this point the White House is so committed to Helms-Burton, which was signed in the heat of the Presidential campaign after a Cuban attack on two planes piloted by Cuban exiles, that dissidents in the Administration dare not utter their view in public.
The second issue, which really riles Canada, Mexico and Europe, is more politically charged: Does Congress have a right to extend the reach of American law beyond the borders of the United States? European officials have called the measure "arrogant" and "bullying." At the heart of the European case in front of the World Trade Organization is the argument that the United States is free to impose an economic embargo on a foreign nation but not to force foreign companies, operating outside United States territory, to join that embargo.
That has been a particularly sensitive issue in Canada, which is always touchy about any suggestion that is policies or culture are being dominated by the United States, its biggest trading partner. That was captured this morning in a political cartoon in The Financial Post, a major Canadian newspaper. An overweight Wal-Mart was shown disrobing from its striped Cuban pajamas, in response to the demands of an Uncle Sam character who was yelling, "Take 'Em Off."
But then a burly Canadian intercedes and growls, "Not in my house, you don't."

HEADLINE: Two Koreas and the U.S. Talk About Talks on Declaring Peace

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
A delegation from North Korea met yesterday with American and South Korean officials in New York to discuss the possibility of negotiating a formal end to the Korean War.
The meeting stopped short of full negotiations but offered the chance to lay out details of the proposal made last April by President Clinton and President Kim Young Sam of South Korea to hold peace talks involving the two Koreas, the United States and China. 
 Although officials from North and South Korea have met before, the meeting yesterday was the first to address directly the idea of replacing the armistice of 1953 that ended the fighting with a formal peace.
There were no breakthroughs. And afterward, the leader of North Korea's delegation, a Deputy Foreign Minister, Kim Gye Gwan, remained noncommittal about his Government's willingness to talk. "We need further study of the proposal," he said, echoing the position Pyongyang has held since the proposal was put forward.
The Administration nonetheless declared it significant that North Korea, one of the world's most isolated governments, had agreed to attend a meeting at all, particularly with its reviled enemy to the south.
As a nod to that, the United States announced at the start of the meeting that it would not conduct its periodic military exercises with the South this year, an Administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The exercises have long antagonized the North. And although the United States has postponed them in the past, the timing of the announcement yesterday was deliberate, the official said.
The meeting came after fits and starts caused by the grounding of a North Korean spy submarine full of commandos off the coast of South Korea, a food crisis in the North and the defection of a prominent North Korean official.
In recent weeks North Korea has been rocked by the defection of one senior minister, Hwang Jang Yop, and the deaths of two others. It has also faced a food shortage that prompted an emergency appeal for aid from the World Food Program, which the United States answered by pledging $10 million in relief.
A senior State Department official said those issues were not the focus of the meeting. But he said the delegations from the United States and South Korea had made clear that a move toward peace would include economic cooperation.
It is unclear when North Korea might respond or how, but in Washington the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, described the meeting as "quite serious and sincere."
North Korea agreed to attend after expressing "deep regret" for the incursion of the spy submarine into South Korean waters. But it twice postponed the meeting.
In a sign of the sensitivities of the North Koreans, as well as the desire of the United States not to alienate the South, almost every detail of the meeting was subject to intense negotiation -- from finding a neutral location (the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan) to arranging the tables and chairs: first a circle, then a triangle and finally a circle again.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	South Cancels War Games
SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, March 6 (Reuters) -- South Korea and the United States have cancelled joint war games this year in a gesture to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, the Defence Ministry confirmed today.
The cancellation "is part of efforts by our two governments to build confidence and to create an atmosphere conducive to the reduction of tensions," the Defence Ministry said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
New Models Of Growth On a Hot, Hot Stock Index

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Growth stocks -- the shares of companies whose profits Wall Street expects to rise rapidly -- have been the darlings of the stock market during the 1990's. But they lagged late in 1996, and have recently been downright poor performers.
The best measure of the performance of the stocks that analysts love is a new index, the Montgomery Securities Growth Stock Index, which is based on the 500 stocks for which Wall Street expects the greatest profit growth in the coming five years or so. 
The index is new, but Montgomery, a San Francisco-based brokerage firm that specializes in growth stocks, traced it back to the beginning of the 1990's, and found phenomenal performance. Had you invested $100 in index stocks at the beginning of 1990, it would have risen to $310 at the end of January. In contrast, a similar investment in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks would have been worth $222, and one in the Russell 2000, the best-known index of small stocks, would have risen to just $220. All figures ignore dividends and transaction costs.
But since then, things have not been as friendly for many growth stocks. The index is down 11.7 percent since the end of January, a period in which the S.& P. 500 is up 2 percent and the Russell 2000 is down 1.5 percent.
The search for growth has been a staple for many investors. Finding the next Xerox or Microsoft -- companies that rose from tiny to supreme in an important business -- is a dream, and finding one can provide gains to offset a multitude of failures.
But many companies that are expected to grow instead run into problems, whether from competition or changing technology. And such stocks can be vulnerable to concern that the economic environment is turning less friendly.
"Growth investors are looking to the future and paying for future earnings," said Michael Moe, Montgomery Securities' director of growth stock research. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, discussed the possibility of "irrational exuberance" in the stock market and, some think, sent out warning signals that he might feel required to push up interest rates.
"When you are discounting future earnings, people have a greater fear of interest rates going up," Mr. Moe said.
Perhaps, but it may also be that as stock prices have been bid up, so too have analysts' expectations. A review of the Montgomery index, and where it stood at the end of each year, shows just how much more pricey growth stocks have become. It also shows that the nature of what Wall Street means by growth has changed. A few years ago, many investors looked for companies that would grow consistently, whatever the economy, such as Coca-Cola. Now they are often looking for the next Microsoft.
The recent slipping of stocks in the index matches recent performance problems of some mutual funds that have done well in the past by picking growth stocks. The American Century 20th Vista Fund, once a star, has lost more than 8 percent of its value so far in 1997.
The inclusion of companies in the Montgomery growth index is based on the forecasts of analysts collected by IBES, the firm formerly known as Institutional Brokers Estimate Service. While it asks for earnings-per-share figures for coming quarters and years, it also asks for longer-term profit forecasts.
That way, Mr. Moe said, Montgomery hopes to capture in its index "not only yesterday's heroes," whose earnings have risen, "but also tomorrow's stars," which may or may not be making money now but are expected to see profits zoom.
To compile the index, Montgomery each year takes the 500 stocks with the highest anticipated long-term growth rates, though it includes only companies with a market capitalization of at least $200 million. By focusing on long-term expectations, it can include stocks that are now losing money, or whose growth is not robust now but is expected to become so.
How much more optimistic have analysts become than they were? At the end of 1990, a company with expected long-term annual earnings growth of 11.6 percent could get into the index.
Now, after several years of economic recovery, joining the select 500 requires that analysts expect earnings to rise 24.2 percent, more than double the rate required six years ago. The figure has risen in every year since 1990.
In the early part of the decade, the list of the 500 stocks for which Wall Street expected the most growth was filled with reliable consumer goods companies that had performed well year after year. At the beginning of 1991, it included venerable names like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kellogg, Borden and Campbell Soup.
Now, such companies are largely passe to the growth investor, although some have done very well in the stock market. Consumer goods companies make up a dwindling portion of the current list of hot stocks, replaced by a large number of technology companies, and none of the stocks named above is on the 1997 list. Technology companies now make up 40 percent of the 500 stocks, and account for 46 percent of the market value of stocks in the index.
The technology portion would be even greater but for the fact that for the first time, Microsoft no longer makes the cut. Analysts project its long-term growth rate as 23 percent. Not bad, but not enough now to make the top 500.
What companies do make the list? Among the technology names are Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Iomega and Pixar. And while Coca-Cola may no longer be deemed a fast grower, Boston Beer is on the list.
Another way to measure just how speculative the index has become is to see how many companies on it are expected to lose money in the next year, or to make so little that their current price-earnings ratios are more than 60 to 1.
Back in 1990, there were 33 such companies. The next year, scared by the recession, analysts saw hot growth prospects in just 30 companies. The number rose over time, but at the beginning of 1995, it was still just 56, or a bit more than 1 in 10 of the 500 companies about which analysts were the most optimistic.
But at the beginning of 1996, that figure was up to 123, and at the beginning of this year, to 173 companies -- or more than one in three. That included 72 that are expected to lose money this year, and 101 that are trading at more than 60 times the consensus earnings forecast for 1997.
More than half the companies now on the index are losing money or trading at price-earnings multiples above 40. At the beginning of 1991, that figure was less than one in 12.
Such companies have room for thrilling moves if things go right. They also have a lot of room for disappointment. Consider the following two lists, each of stocks currently in the index. The first is Yahoo, Optical Data Systems, Target Therapeutics, Vivus, E-Trade and Playboy Enterprises. The second consists of Citrix SystemsXL Connect Solutions, RTW, Atlas Air, Clintrials Research, Jayhawk Acceptance and Chicago Miniature Lamp.
All the stocks in the first list are up at least 50 percent so far this year. The others are down by at least that much.
The first list shows that, even in an environment that has turned at least a bit hostile, there is money to be made in growth stocks. The second one, alas, shows that picking the wrong ones can be disastrous. And so far in 1997, the bad performers have outmatched the good ones.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Growing, Growing, Gone"
The Montgomery Securities Growth Stock Index compiles the performance of the 500 stocks for which Wall Street analysts foresee the fastest growth, with the components of the index changed at the beginning of each year. It was a star performer for much of the 1990's, but has faltered since the end of January.
 Graph tracks the Growth stock index, the Russell 2000 index, and the S. & P. 500 index, since 1990. Also tracked is the minimum growth needed to qualify for inclusion in the Growth stock index, the percentage of companies from previous year's index roster that failed to qualify for inclusion again the the current year, the percentage of index companies in various industry categories, and the percentage of index companies expected to lose money in the current year, or traded at a high multiple of anticipated profits. These graphs also run from 1990. (Source: Montgomery Securities) (pg. D6)

HEADLINE: New York City Has Sharp Rise In Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate shot up in January to 9.9 percent, the highest monthly level in nearly three years, the State Department of Labor reported yesterday. More New Yorkers were unsuccessfully looking for work, the agency said, than at any time since early 1994, when the city was still slowly climbing out of a deep recession.
The new rate, which rose more than a full percentage point, from an adjusted level of 8.8 percent in December, does not in itself signal another economic downturn, economists said. Indeed, the Labor Department also said in a separate report that New York City created about 13,000 more jobs in 1996 than preliminary counts had indicated. 
 What makes the January development more significant is partly the sudden acceleration, a full percentage point above the rate in January 1996, and what it says about the level of economic frustration in the city. The New York economy is slowly growing, economists said, but expectations are rising even faster as people enter the labor market.
The high unemployment rate during the recession, by contrast, which peaked at 11.9 percent in January 1993, was caused largely by job losses in New York. The new higher number is caused largely by thousands of people entering the job market and failing to find employment.
"The economy doesn't have enough steam in it to accommodate all the job seekers," said John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "People perceive the job market as being very strong, and they're out there testing the waters."
New York City's Deputy Mayor for Operations, Randy M. Mastro, said he believed that the average unemployment rate for the city in 1996, at 8.6 percent, provides a better measure of the city's economic condition than any one-month total.
But he added that having a higher number of job seekers was also in itself a measure of growing strength.
"It's a reflection of an improving local economy that not only private-sector jobs increased, but more people want to enter the job market," he said.
New York State's unemployment rate also rose, the Labor Department said, to 6.9 percent in January from 5.9 percent in December. But on a year-to-year basis, the state rate remained unchanged.
The United States unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was also up, from 5 percent in December, as measured by the snapshot monthly numbers, which are not seasonally adjusted, but was down from the previous January, when it stood at 6.3 percent.
The state report also highlighted the sharp variations in job hunting success within the New York region. Nassau County, for example, had an unemployment rate of only 3.5 percent in January -- tied with Monroe County for the second-lowest rate in the state, and beaten only by Putnam County, at 3.4 percent.
New York City, by contrast, had two of the three highest unemployment rates, by county, in New York: the Bronx, at 12 percent, and Brooklyn, at 11.4 percent. Manhattan had the lowest unemployment rate of the city's five boroughs, at 8.2 percent. Hamilton County in the Adirondacks had the single highest in the state, at 16.2 percent.
Economists caution that monthly numbers fluctuate and that they often rise in January, as seasonal workers in the retail industry are dismissed after the holidays. But they also said the unemployment totals could be aggravated through this year as the welfare overhaul takes effect.
Under the new welfare laws, 25 percent of the city's welfare caseload must be involved in a job or related activity by Sept. 30. That labor participation rate is to climb by 5 percent ever year after that, to 50 percent of the welfare population by 2002.
State economists said that the higher number of people looking for work -- a number that includes people who said in state telephone surveys that they were looking for jobs or who had applied for benefits -- might be partly explained by the long shadow of the city's recession.
From 1989 to 1992, the city lost about 300,000 jobs, as real estate, financial services and construction and other areas contracted. Many of the people who lost those jobs disappeared from the economic periscope when they gave up and stopped looking.
That, in addition to the city's gradual recovery and growth of new jobs since then, helped the employment rate go down beginning in 1993.
The return of at least some of those people to the labor market is believed by economists to be what is fueling the unemployment increases that began last year.

HEADLINE: Trade Membership for China

 BODY:
If China is prepared to honor international fair-trade rules, it should be admitted to the World Trade Organization. It makes no practical sense to complicate this issue with other considerations about China, including its poor record on human rights. Those important questions can be better handled in other ways.
China wants membership in the new trade organization to establish its place in the international community even though it will win few tangible economic benefits. Countries like the United States have already extended low tariffs and other trade privileges to China. But membership can force the Chinese to take steps toward a fully functioning market economy. Trade organization rules require that foreign investment and trade be conducted on commercial terms, with no subsidies for exports or restrictions on imports. 
 Washington demands, for instance, that China make explicit any subsidies the Government provides state-owned factories that allow them to sell goods below cost. Membership would also require China to drop restrictions that force foreign investors there to export products they make in China. China will have to honor patents and copyrights.
Membership, then, can be useful to the West as a catalyst for reform in China. It would give leverage to Chinese officials who are pushing for political and market reforms. Policies that put more power in impersonal markets remove power from government bureaucrats. Membership will also ease needless tension between China and the United States. Rather than clashing directly over trade disputes, the two countries could turn to an impartial international jury to resolve commercial tensions.
Technically, the United States cannot block China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. But some members of Congress want to force the Administration to get its approval before coming to agreement with the Chinese, fearing China will win favorable terms. Such an intrusion is unnecessary. The Administration has no reason to go easy on China, knowing Congress already has the authority to prevent the Administration from extending trade privileges to China even if it gains membership in the World Trade Organization.
Others in Congress recoil at inviting China into the trade organization because of its human rights abuses and contempt for democracy. Those concerns are warranted, but Chinese membership in the trade organization will not preclude America from pressuring China on these issues. The World Trade Organization, which Washington worked hard to establish, should not be used for political and diplomatic ends, however worthy they may be.
The important task for the Administration is to negotiate commercially fair terms, phased in quickly enough that China must initiate reform immediately. Congressional interference serves no good purpose.

HEADLINE: Colombia, in Rebuff to the U.S., Halts Drug Eradication Program

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 5

 BODY:
Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine, today suspended all aerial eradication of drug-producing crops in a sharp rebuff to the United States.
The move was an unexpectedly swift and forceful reaction to the Clinton Administration's decision to include Colombia on a list of nations that are not fully cooperating with the United States in the fight against drugs. In suspending the flights, Colombia shelved what American officials viewed as a cornerstone of its anti-drug programs. 
 Joaquin Polo, Colombia's anti-drug czar, announced the decision in a radio interview this afternoon in which he said Colombia was reviewing any further cooperation with Washington on the programs.
"The work of fumigation is temporarily suspended while, as the Government announced, the entire subject of international cooperation with the Government of the United States is reviewed," Mr. Polo said.
In a television interview tonight the American Ambassador, Myles Frechette, said he was "really surprised" by the suspension. He described it as a temporary "interruption" rather than an end to joint eradication, which he said "would have been a disaster" for Colombia.
United States Government figures showing an increase in coca cultivation "were not the fault of the police," Mr. Frechette said. "The drug dealers are planting more."
Tension is mounting over Washington's decision last week to "decertify" Colombia in the war against drugs.
Earlier in the day, unions workers staged a protest at the United States Embassy and the Interior Minister, Horacio Serpa, said the American decision had "poisoned the atmosphere" for a bill that would allow the extradition of drug traffickers to the United States.
But the suspension of aerial eradication of drugs also drew protests here. Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, a former Ambassador to Washington, said the decision by President Ernesto Samper was a gift to drug traffickers, and Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso, who sits on the National Council on Narcotics, said he had not been consulted.
Clinton Administration officials have said the decision to label Colombia uncooperative was largely a repudiation of President Samper, who has been linked to drug traffickers. For his part, Mr. Samper has consistently framed the American rebuke as a national insult.
The aerial spraying of fields growing coca and poppies is a risky tactic in which helicopters escorting the planes must sometimes fire at the ground to deter attack from the growers. The United States has continued to finance virtually the entire fumigation effort, even though it also decertified Colombia last year. Washington supplies all of the planes and helicopters and pilot training.
When a country is denied certification as the United States' ally in fighting drugs, it loses access to most American military and economic aid and may face trade sanctions. But the law exempts humanitarian and anti-drug aid.
Some pilots and gunners in Colombia's last eradication flight today in the mountains of southern Colombia appeared discouraged by the poor marks the United States had given their country.
"We're out here every day, fumigating and putting our lives at risk, and the U.S. says we're not doing enough," said one pilot.
In its report, the United States criticized both Mr. Samper and the Colombian Congress, which cleared the President of charges he took $6 million in campaign contributions from Cali drug lords. The report said coca crops last year had increased by 32 percent, despite fumigation efforts. The United States also estimated that Colombia had fumigated 40,000 acres, rather than the 47,000 acres Colombia claimed.
While the disparity seemed minor, Mr. Polo said this afternoon that it was the main reason for breaking off all eradication efforts. "They work with our police hand in hand all year long, and then when it comes time for an evaluation, there's a total ignorance of what we've done," he said in a telephone interview.
"I honestly hope that all of these difficulties between our Governments can be overcome," Mr. Polo said. "The only ones who this benefits are the drug dealers."
According to State Department figures, more than half the cocaine-processing laboratories and 90 percent of the coca eradicated in Colombia since 1990 were destroyed during the adminisration of Mr. Samper, who took office in August 1994. But experts described the suspension of aerial spraying as a thinly veiled retaliation for Washington's decertification and a way to divert attention from criticism of Mr. Samper.
"Suspending fumigation is mainly a way to turn what is really just a problem of Samper into a problem of the country," said Fabio Castillo, a Colombian drug expert and author of "The New Horsemen of Cocaine." He said the President's gesture confused Colombians by giving them the message that the way to confront the United States was to adopt a measure that benefited the drug cartel.
While Colombia had warned that it would review the terms of its anti-drug cooperation with the United States, few here expect a decision so quickly. A spokesman said President Samper and a close circle of his associates had decided to suspend the flights at a meeting earlier today.

FINK, STANLEY

 BODY:
FINK-Stanley. In Memory of the Hon. Stanley Fink, Esq. The faculty, staff, administration and students of Kingsborough Community College join all residents of the City and State of New York in mourning the untimely passing of the Honorable Stanley Fink, Esq., former State Assembly Speaker and City University of New York Trustee. Speaker Fink retired as New York State Assembly Speaker in 1986 after a distinguished record of service to the people of the Borough of Brooklyn, the City of New York and the State of New York. Stanley Fink, a longtime resident of Brooklyn, earned his baccalaureate degree from Brooklyn College in 1956 and his law degree from New York University Law School in 1959. After serving in the Judge Advocate General's Office of the United States Air Force, he returned to Brooklyn to practice law & began what would become a distinguished career in civic and public affairs. In 1968, he ran for the State Assembly & was elected to represent the Canarsie Assembly District. He became Assembly majority leader in 1977 and, in 1979, he was elected Speaker of the Assembly, a position in which he served with distinction until his retirement in 1986. In 1989 he was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York by Governor Cuomo. As a trustee he continued his commitment to the students of the City of New York. He championed the cause of access to higher education for all New Yorkers and was a strong advocate of Kingsborough Community College's emergence as an educational force in the Brooklyn community. Speaker Fink's contributions to the College were recognized when he was awarded the Kingsborough President's Medal for his devotion to the cause of higher education, in general, and open admissions specifically. Known as a forceful leader capable of fostering bi-partisanship in the legislature, Stanley Fink leaves a record of legislative innovation in the areas of criminal justice reform, highway safety, school aid & primary, secondary, and higher education. Both as Speaker of the New York State Assembly and as a Trustee of the City University of New York, he was a strong voice for the educationally and economically disadvantaged, women returning to the workforce, and education for new immigrants. He took particular pride in the development of new programs at Kingsborough Community College to serve these populations. His commitment to access through open-enrollment became the public policy of New York State and, for this, he will be long remembered and held in the highest regard. Stanley Fink's contributions in government, in the business sector and in higher education are many. He will always be remembered, however, for his extraordinary intelligence, his great sense of humor and his innate ability to cut through rhetoric and get to the heart of the matter. His energy and magnetic personality merged to form a commanding presence wherever people gathered. Stanley Fink was a loving husband to his wife, Judith, a devoted father to his son, Marc and daughter-in-law, Laura Kirschstein, his son, Keith and daughter-in-law, Caryn, and an adoring grandfather to his granddaughter, Alexandra. His legacy of excellence as a public servant, his passion for justice, his devotion to his family and the joy he derived from their love, serve to help us remember Stanley Fink as a man who made a difference. Leon M. Goldstein, President Kingsborough Community College
FINK-Stanley. With profound sorrow and an indelible sense of loss, the John Jay College community mourns the death of Stanley Fink.

As a member of the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York, he was dedicated to increasing opportunity for a quality education to all New Yorkers and made a lasting contribution to public higher education. On behalf of the faculty, staff, students and alumni of John Jay College, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife Judy and his family. Gerald W. Lynch, President John Jay College of Criminal Justice The City University of New York
FINK-Stanley. The Board of Trustees, the Central Administration, the College Presidents, the faculty, students and staff of The City University of New York deeply mourn the passing of beloved friend, colleague, Brooklyn College Alumnus and former Trustee, Stanley Fink.

His outstanding service to the University as a member of the Board of Trustee for seven years will have an everlasting impact. His loss truly diminishes all of us. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Judith, and sons, Marc and Keith, and their families. Anne A. Paolucci, Chairwoman Board of Trustees W. Ann Reynolds, Chancellor

What's the Meaning of Life? You Can Ask the Tea Leaves

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
How much fun can a madcap urban comedy be when there's no humor or buoyancy behind the crazy antics? Adrienne Shelly's absurdist romp "Sudden Manhattan" is crammed with zany characters colliding giddily on the streets of lower Manhattan in their search for meaning in life. But acting frantically offbeat isn't the same thing as being funny.
Donna (Ms. Shelly), the film's narrator and central character, is an aimless, unemployed 20-something woman who moans about having no job, no love, no reason to get up in the morning. Her life isn't really so horrible. She is fortunate enough to live rent free in a building owned by her writing teacher, Murphy (Roger Rees), an eccentric Englishman who is so smitten with her that he leaves a bouquet of red roses on her doorstep each morning. 
 While staring into her breakfast eggs at a neighborhood diner one day, Donna hears ominous rumbling noises that no one else notices. Minutes later, while wandering the streets of Greenwich Village, she witnesses a murder. Or thinks she does. The police laugh off her story. Almost simultaneously, she strikes up a friendship with Adam (Tim Guinee), an unemployed actor, who prefers reading Russian literature out loud in bed to making love.
Donna attends a birthday luau for her mopey best friend, Georgie (Hynden Walch), who has just been jilted. She also begins consulting Dominga (Louise Lasser), the most pessimistic psychic ever to hang out a fortunetelling shingle. Staring into her clients' tea leaves, Dominga informs them that the only things awaiting them are misery, pain and death. Nobody plays neurotic nags with more intensity than Ms. Lasser, who gives her character a nasty edge that cuts through the film's airy surrealism like a bad smell.
The hysteria escalates once Georgie recovers her spirits and introduces her two new beaus to Donna. Together with Adam, they all repair to Dominga's parlor, where the men put on Indian war paint and feathered headdresses and parade around goofily. Eventually, Donna and Adam visit the lair of the supposed murderer, who may or may not be suffering from a multiple-personality disorder. "Sudden Manhattan," which opens today at Sony Theaters 19th Street East, aspires to be a downtown answer to a Woody Allen comedy, with dashes of "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "After Hours" thrown into the mix. But Ms. Shelly's screenplay doesn't contain a single pithy apercu. As the actors breeze through their parts, they appear unaware of the fact that their characters' situations and daffy behavior might be anything but the last word in hip, uproarious whimsy.
This feels like a movie trying to work its way out of a chronic depression by snapping its fingers and pretending to be having fun. Few in the audience are likely to be fooled.
"Sudden Manhattan" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual situations.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Discovering the Real Americas

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
ONE of the frontier areas of study in art history is the interaction between Europe and the Americas five centuries ago at the beginning of the colonialist period.
Museum shows devoted to the subject have been few but notable. "Converging Cultures: Art and Identity in Spanish America" at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last spring, despite its dry-as-dust title, was one of the finest American exhibitions on any subject in recent years. Visually exhilarating, intellectually stimulating, it changed forever the way an epoch will be viewed. 
 Among the dazzling objects included, one in particular stood out: a 16th-century Roman Catholic priest's vestment made by native Mexican artisans and embroidered with hummingbird feathers, a decorative medium traditionally reserved for the robes of Aztec kings. Materially gorgeous, symbolically ambiguous, it stood as a symbol of cross-cultural tensions that marked the colonial encounter.
That marvelous garment was on loan to the Brooklyn show from the Hispanic Society of America, one of New York City's great underknown institutions. And now the society is adding its own contribution to the critical mass of information on New World culture with a small exhibition of prints, rare books and maps drawn from its own collection.
Here again, a ponderous title -- "Defining the Americas: Accounts and Images of Latin America From the European Encounter Through Independence" -- could keep attendance low. And the show itself, which demands almost as much reading as looking, isn't exactly user-friendly. But a little hard work is a small price to pay in exchange for the story it tells of how impressions of a culture were shaped by art, both from inside and out.
One of the oldest objects on view, an edition of Columbus's account of his trans-Atlantic voyage, probably published in Basel in 1494, gives a sense of how the Americas were first imagined in Europe. The explorer writes of a fabulous tropical Wonderland, but the book's illustrator, who presumably didn't make the trip, doggedly sticks to the everyday world he knows, turning the distant Caribbean into an alpine landscape replete with a walled and turreted town.
Gradually, however, more accurate information filtered in. It is true that fantasy still ran high: a book printed in Amsterdam as late as 1682 carried pictures of Brazilian insects that bizarrely resemble dinosaurs. But scientific accounts published in Spain include closely observed depictions of iguanas and armadillos, for which imported taxidermic specimens may have served as models.
It is in the portrayal of the people of the New World, though, that fact and fiction most tellingly, and often disturbingly, blend. For some Europeans, "Indians" were savages, plain and simple (in one engraving they are shown torturing a Spanish soldier). But for many, they were something else, a bright antediluvian remnant, the last inhabitants of a Paradise on earth.
Depictions of this state of innocence recur. In one late 16th-century engraving from Nuremberg, a statuesque, near-naked Indian couple are fitted out with plumed headdresses like actors in a court masque. In another, titled "Allegory of America" (1581), the continent is symbolized as a languorous classical nude reclining by a riverbank.
Such emblems were ways for Western illustrators to deal with cultures they didn't know first hand. But eventually other artists, American-born, provided an insider view of colonial life.
Some of their images are promotional, like Francisco Saverio Clavijero's depiction of slender Indian women baking bread. Others, which detail a colonial pecking order based on permutations of racial and cultural blending, are documentary in nature, and perhaps even discreetly critical.
Cultural blending can certainly be found outside the perimeters of the exhibition itself. It is there, for example, in the fascinating objects crowding the Hispanic Society galleries: an earthenware fountain, Spanish in style but Mexican-made, a genealogical chart tracing the economic rise of a family from Indian roots to colonial artistocracy. (Alas, the feathered robe seen in Brooklyn is deemed too fragile to be kept on view.)
And the mix is vibrantly alive in the predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhood just outside the society's doors on West 155th Street. That neighborhood didn't exist when the impressive classical facade, engraved with the names of Cortez, Pizarro and Ponce de Leon, was built at the turn of the century. But it does now, and its presence gives an immediate pertinence to the new world of historical research that "Defining the Americas," in its modest way, represents.
"Defining the Americas: Accounts and Images of Latin America From the European Encounters Through Independence," organized by Mitchell A. Codding and Patrick Lenaghan, remains at the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, Washington Heights, through May 30.

A Bloomsbury Founder, Always With an Idea

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL 

 BODY:
In one way or another, this looks like a landmark year for Stanley Spencer (1891-1959), an English artist not previously much talked of in this country. Thanks to a hallucinatory performance by Antony Sher, Spencer the matrimonial misfit is reborn in "Stanley," the play now running at Circle in the Square in Manhattan. As for Spencer the painter, he will have a substantial retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington beginning on Oct. 9.
And he deserves it. Spencer in his art was both a wondering child and a grown man of vast and all-embracing fancy. There was nothing, from the resurrection of all humankind to the darker side of the Macedonian front in World War I, that he did not aspire to set down on canvas on the scale of epic. Domesticities were also his dish, and he knew how to make a meal of them. 
 Coincidentally, at the Davis & Langdale Gallery there is a small but evocative show of work from the estate of the British painter Duncan Grant (1885-1978). In the England of the 1920's and 30's, even to mention Grant's name was to think oneself in the thick of things. Thanks to wholehearted support from the accepted taste-makers of the day, he stood way above Spencer in the canons of cultivated opinion.
Something in this was owed to his personality. Men and women alike found in Grant an irresistible companion. (Even in his late 80's, he was constantly creating what he called "havoc.") As a founding member of the Bloomsbury group, he had enjoyed a long lifetime of very good conversation in which there was nothing that could not be said.
Though drawn without ever a second thought to attractive young men, he fathered a daughter, in 1919, with Vanessa Bell, the sister of Virginia Woolf. He and Bell were inseparable friends until her death in 1961. His work was admired by Roger Fry, the foremost English critic of the day; by Maynard Keynes, the economist, who doubled as a connoisseur, and by Kenneth Clark, who in the 1920's and 30's was the taste-maker of first choice in Britain.
But Grant was neither vain nor stupid. No one was ever less of a careerist. If he had dreams of pre-eminence, he never spoke of them. When he was described in print as "the greatest English artist since Constable," his head was not turned. He made art because he could not imagine himself doing anything else -- and also, perhaps, because he knew that as an artist he could do almost anything, up to a point.
An accomplished easel painter, he excelled with portraits of people he knew well. In the Davis & Langdale show, there is an early (1910-11) and unfinished oil sketch of Vanessa Bell. Dating to an early state in their relationship, it is not so much a likeness as a blaze of yellow and orange that makes it quite clear that something important will one day come of their association.
In total contrast is his full-size pencil drawing of the fiancee of the writer David Garnett. (Though now largely forgotten, Garnett had a brief return to favor not long ago when his novel "Aspects of Love" was set to music by Andrew Lloyd Webber.) Grant did not care for the chosen young woman, Ray Marshall, and in fact he would have preferred Garnett not to have married at all. He applied himself to the portrait, but the sitter sat, as he said later, "like cream cheese on a plate," with results that are clearly foreshadowed in the drawing now on view.
But anywhere and at any time, Grant could bring a light and convivial touch to every kind of auxiliary artistic activity. He could go through a house like a benevolent invader and leave behind him designs for a bookmark, a piece of wallpaper, a buckle, a bell pull, a dinner plate or a candlestick. He could design rugs, screens, tables, book jackets and teapots that were the handmaidens of happiness.
He loved the theater, and the show includes a proscenium design for a small theater in London that would have filled the house by reason of its own sole festive self. In the early days (1912-14) of English modernism, Grant made frontier raids upon pure abstraction that can still startle. An example now on view is the design for a rug he made in 1913-14. It was done for the Omega Workshop, which was founded by Fry to encourage painters to bring their ideas down off the wall and put them to practical use. Made up of long rectangular slabs of pure color, it has never dated.
Later in life, in partnership with Bell, he was in over his head with some monumental commissions for a new trans-Atlantic liner. (The shipowners rejected them.) But he was not so much a decorator, in the usual sense of that word, as a decorationist -- someone who could make minor magic with every least thing that came into his head.
Aromatic scraps resulted, and two things are made clear at Davis & Langdale. One is that no one ever threw those scraps away. The other is that they have a large and eager public that in many cases snapped them up even before the show opened.
Someone, for instance, had put down good money for a very small handwritten envelope, postmarked in June 1911, that was addressed and mailed to Grant by Woolf in her own hand. It was readdressed and forwarded (again by hand) by Keynes, and later embellished on the back by a little drawing by Grant. Is it a trifle? Yes, but it is also a hallowed souvenir of three key figures in the England of their day.
The public in question began to form at the end of World War II. By the time it had grown to its present size, the Bloomsbury group and its derivatives had begun to function almost as a second family for readers, who by now could follow their doings almost day by day. This familiarity was fostered initially by the publication of the diaries and letters of Woolf; the memoirs of her husband, Leonard Woolf, and the quiet good sense of her nephew Quentin Bell's biography of her. Since then, a mass of auxiliary material has been published. (Its latest and most honorable annex can be found in the many-volumed diaries of Frances Partridge.)
The Bells' house in Sussex, England, has now been refurbished and opened to a public that cannot wait to see where and how they lived. (Maps are available to those who wish to walk their walks beneath the Sussex Downs.) The members of the Bloomsbury group were very clever people who liked nothing better than to talk about themselves and about one another. And they never ran out of something to say.
It is in the context of their long-running sociabilities that this little show should be seen. It is not "great art," but it is art that it would be a pleasure to come home to.
Works by Duncan Grant remain at the Davis & Langdale Gallery, 231 East 60th Street, Manhattan, through March 15.

HEADLINE: Species That Teeter On Oblivion's Brink

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
IN 1732, so the fable goes, a fellow named Edwin Meeps "spyed this day a tiny kroaker, not a bugg, flying most ably amongst the trees." But the Meeps Island flying frog, as the creature became known, was so modest that it mated only in dense clumps of poison ivy.
Ivy itch and fly bites drove Meeps away from the frog's island habitat, and it was two centuries before the flying frog was rediscovered. This time the creature's rudderlike tail, webbed wings and ability to take off from lily pads ignited a sensation. People captured the frogs and kept them on strings. Developers bought Meeps Island and built an amusement park with a roller coaster called the Flying Frog. The frog's swampy home, which also harbored a number of other species found nowhere else, all but disappeared. The amphibian itself was declared endangered. 
 This whimsical ecological fiction has both a happy ending (as will be seen) and a serious purpose: illustrating how wild species and their habitats are threatened today by human activity. The star of the fable -- "he's aerodynamically not very sound, but the forces of gravity can't keep him down," says a catchy folk tune about the flying frog -- is one of the most engaging entries in an ingenious and illuminating new collection of multimedia presentations, photographs, paintings, dioramas and animals both live and mounted that opens tomorrow at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.
The title of the exhibition conveys bluntly both its subject and its point of view: "Endangered! Exploring a World at Risk."
Pressed hard, biologists who study the problem of endangered species have a difficult time documenting just how serious it is. Many suspect that human activity is precipitating a wave of mass extinctions to rival the five great extinction episodes of the remote past, when large swatches of life's tapestry were destroyed by natural causes like climatic change or the impact of comets and asteroids. No one can confidently put any precise numbers to this suspected new biological crisis, although a relatively conservative estimate says that in some parts of the world, extinctions caused by humans are now taking place at 100 to 1,000 times nature's normal rate between big catastrophes.
Despite the uncertainty, few biologists who grapple with the question doubt that humanity is driving other species toward extinction at an accelerating pace. The new exhibition takes that as its premise, and it makes for sobering though fascinating, sometimes beautiful and occasionally droll viewing.
To whatever extent humans are endangering the natural world, they are doing it primarily in three ways: destruction of habitat, overexploitation of plants and animals for economic gain, and the widespread transplantation of innumerable species from one part of the world to another, where they often outcompete or prey on defenseless native species. The exhibition is arranged according to these three themes.
Both of the exhibition's entrances greet the visitor with powerful symbolic evidence of overexploitation. Ghostly behind scrims -- sheer theater drops -- are an endangered northern right whale's gigantic skull, with its long, feathery baleen plates that trap plankton for food, and a pair of Siberian tigers in all their taxidermic magnificence. The enormous word "Endangered!" plays constantly across both scrims.
The tigers, in cold storage since 1963, were killed and mounted decades ago, before endangerment became a concern. Their kind are the biggest cats in the world; the male of the pair on display weighed about 600 pounds in life and could have eaten a human like a mouse. But in the end, Homo sapiens is the harsher predator: hunting has reduced the Siberian's numbers in the wild to about 200.
Near the whale's skull, mock-ups of a 19th-century parlor along with a fashion boutique of the early 20th century and a present-day apothecary shop constitute a sort of "exploitation avenue." On display here are objects like a zebra's-head bowling bag, a rhinoceros-foot ashtray, an elephant-hide basket and packages of medicines made from tiger bones and rhino horns confiscated as contraband by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service at Newark International Airport.
The boutique features gorgeous but deadly clothes. One mannequin, for instance, is a cowboy described as "a statement in snakeskin." Another mannequin wears a black flapper-style dress trimmed in monkey fur, a black-and-white stole made from the skin of a colobus monkey and a chic hat decorated by the iridescent green head and wings of a bird of paradise.
The heads of all the mannequins are giant, cruel-looking, sharp-toothed metal traps.
 
Seeking the Big Picture
Today, habitat destruction and invasions by exotic life forms are believed to be the biggest threats to native species. One diorama attempts to convey the effect of habitat loss by examining the familiar plight of the giant panda, whose bamboo forests in China are being destroyed. Another portrays an Everglades "gator hole." This is a water-filled depression, ruled over by an alligator, in which innumerable other creatures take refuge in the dry season. The diorama strongly makes the point that diversion of water for human use and flood control has helped put many Everglades species on the endangered list by reducing the number of these refuges.
The point is also made that endangerment is not just a question of individual species but also of the larger natural realm in which they live. In fact, said Dr. Ross D. E. MacPhee, the curator of the exhibition, one of its purposes is to focus "less on individual species and more on the big picture." The Everglades display illustrates one aspect of the larger picture by showing how the entire South Florida landscape has been threatened. This broader perspective is generally what drives conservation efforts today. That said, the exhibition as a whole still seems species-dominated, perhaps necessarily so given the need to dramatize.
The show weighs in especially effectively on the threat posed by invasive species. One display, "Invasion of the Lake Snatchers," features the shell of a 1969 Volkswagen Beetle that was submerged for 118 days in Lake Erie. It is encrusted with tiny zebra mussels, the Eurasian mollusks that arrived in ships' bilges and that have invaded fresh waters across the United States. So voraciously does it compete with native mollusks for food that the natives are disappearing. Why this is so is made abundantly clear by the chockablock density of mussels on the Volkswagen.
Even more dire is the plight of several species of small striped and barred fish called cichlids. Resembling sunfish, they formerly abounded in Lake Victoria, in East Africa, where they were a food staple for local people. Well-meaning humans introduced huge Nile perch to the lake, where they promptly started eating the cichlids, which rapidly dwindled. An exhibition highlight is a tank full of cichlid species, many of which are now extinct in the wild; viewers will literally see the last of their kind. Two other live but endangered creatures, Japanese alligators and radiated tortoises, have joined the cichlids as exhibition objects.
 
A Dirge, and Hope
Where rising endangerment may be leading is chillingly suggested in "The Tomb of the Lost Species." Here are the skin, bones, feathers and shells of species already consigned to oblivion. Among them are, for instance, the great auk, the Tasmanian wolf, the Steller's sea cow, the heath hen, the Toolache wallaby and the Xerces blue butterfly.
What especially sends shivers down the spine is a nearby repeating video that flashes images of species that have gone extinct since 1500. Created by Geralyn Abinader of the museum's staff, the parade of the extinct is accompanied by a synthesizer dirge that rises in pitch and tempo as the pace of extinctions accelerates. When it switches to species that have become endangered in recent decades, the images come so fast that they almost blur and the synthesizer sounds frantic. A caveat, however: Given the uncertainty about actual extinction rates, one should not let the heart's response overrule the head's.
 
Frogs vs. Jobs
Is there any hope? By tracing a long series of conservation achievements from the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 to the re-introduction of the gray wolf into the park in 1995, the exhibition suggests that not all is lost.
But its most winning offering of hope is the story of the fictitious flying frog. Presented in a small theater as a narrated series of color drawings with sound effects, the idea of a fictional story was conceived by Dr. MacPhee as a way to show how species and habitats become endangered and then can recover under the Endangered Species Act. The idea, he said, was to create a representative case that would avoid the muddy misunderstanding that might result if an actual, highly politicized case like that of the Pacific Northwest's spotted owl excited viewers' prejudices.
And so, in the fictitious presentation created by Jesse Boggs of Shiloh Media in Los Angeles and Brian Morrissey of the museum, a group called Friends of the Flying Frog petitions the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the frog as endangered. The amusement park's owners say that protecting the swamp will force them to close the park. Protests erupt. "Jobs not frogs!" chants one group. "The frogs were here first!" chants another. Ultimately, the frog is declared endangered, and a recovery plan is devised.
The amusement park owners and environmentalists join forces to restore the frog's habitat; in return, the owners are allowed to build a series of transparent tubes that allow tourists to walk through the swamp and see the frogs. Swamp World, as it is called, is a rousing success. More swamp is restored. The flying frog recovers and is removed from the endangered list. Environmentalists and park owners form a joint venture to market Flying Frog products ranging from coffee mugs to light aircraft.
Laugh if you will, but just such a centrist, cooperative strategy -- stripped of such touches as the light aircraft, perhaps -- is becoming a favored way to go about protecting nature.
The message of the overall exhibition, said Dr. MacPhee, "is not that you have to go out and spray paint on a fur coat or stop development." The show's purpose, he said, is rather to provide "a nutshell view of why endangerment is a problem, what causes it and what you can do about it."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark After German Jobless Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-year high against the mark for the third consecutive day yesterday after Germany reported record unemployment, but the dollar later retreated to end mostly lower.
Profit taking on the dollar's gains and uncertainty about the impact of United States employment data due today all weighed on the dollar as the day progressed. 
 The employment report is expected to disclose more evidence of a healthy economy and raise the likelihood of higher United States interest rates, which should help the dollar. But an excessively strong report could aggravate concern about inflation, unnerve the stock and bond markets and push the currency lower.
"The dollar may just have run out of steam for the time being," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "People are going to wait for that unemployment data."
In European dealings, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7208 marks, the strongest since April 1994, before falling back to settle in New York at 1.7155 marks, up from 1.7121 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar settled at 121.13 yen in New York, down from 121.21 yen. The pound rose to $1.6155 from $1.6137.
Speculation that Germany would report a postwar unemployment record for February had pushed the dollar higher against the mark for most of this week. Although the report released yesterday showed 4.672 million jobless, less than the most pessimistic projections, the dollar still advanced.
"This is a classic bandwagon for the upside on the dollar," said Earl I. Johnson, foreign-exchange economist at the Bank of Montreal's New York branch. "Sentiment is still bullish for the dollar."
Against the yen, the dollar remained weak throughout the trading day, first falling in early Asian dealings after the Japanese Finance Ministry reported its broadest measure of trade for January showed a 362.3 percent increase in the surplus compared with the year earlier.
The dollar also fell after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told Congress that "a sustained increase in the Japanese surplus isn't in anybody's interest."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Apartments Rising on Site Of Fillmore East and Saint

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
A seven-story brick rental apartment building is rising on part of the site at Second Avenue and Sixth Street in the East Village that was once home to the fabled rock concert hall the Fillmore East and later to the Saint, an elaborate disco that was a center of gay night life in the 1980's.
With 86 studio to three-bedroom apartments, including some duplex units, the structure rising at 225 East Sixth Street underscores Manhattan's strong rental market and the changing character of the area, which brokers say is in the throes of becoming an appealing address for young renters who have been priced out of such neighborhoods as SoHo and the West Village. The $14 million Hudson East project is being developed by the Hudson Companies Inc., based in Brooklyn. 
 Eighty percent of the 438- to 1,556-square-foot apartments will be rented at market value. The remaining 20 percent will be leased at reduced prices to tenants whose annual incomes are $13,700 to $22,050, depending on family size.
The new rental is the latest in a spate of so-called 80-20 projects just finished, under way or planned in Manhattan. In return for having 20 percent of the apartments reserved for low-income tenants, the city or state issues tax-exempt bonds to provide permanent financing to the builders, who are also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city.
To protect bondholders, developers must also obtain what is called a credit enhancement -- mortgage insurance from a state or Federal agency or a letter of credit from a bank or pension fund.
Beyond the 80-20 projects, more than 2,600 rental units are in various stages of development and planning in downtown Manhattan, where office buildings are being converted to apartments with the aid of city-sponsored tax incentives. Among the larger conversions, 45 Wall Street, with 441 apartments, is expected to open for leasing next month.
Both programs are helping to increase rental production in the city. They also reflect the reliance of new residential construction on public benefits.
Alan R. Bell, a principal of the Hudson Companies, said the East Village project would not have been economically feasible without the tax incentives. It received $11.75 million in bond financing from the New York State Housing Finance Agency and mortgage insurance from the State of New York Mortgage Agency. Construction financing is coming from Chase Manhattan Bank and equity from the company.
The production of apartments is rising at a time when some brokers say rents in Manhattan are flattening after three years of increases, which pushed many tenants to buy.
With the new supply, "rents will soften in 1997," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage. But as rents ease, so will demand in the sale market, causing people to rent again and limiting the rental price decline, she said.
Hudson East is distinct because of its site's history, which dates from the late 1920's. Over time, the building was the Loew's Commodore movie palace, a Yiddish theater and a concert hall. In 1968, Bill Graham, the rock music impresario, turned the theater into the Fillmore East, which became a mecca for music fans. Among the acts that played at the Fillmore East before it closed in 1971 were B. B. King, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and the Allman Brothers.
During the 1980's, the building was refurbished as the Saint, which for eight years drew crowds of several thousand gay dancers a night. And earlier this decade, there were plans to turn the empty structure into a six-screen movie theater. But that project went into bankruptcy.
The Hudson Companies bought the property for $1.6 million in 1995 from its mortgage holder, the National Bank of Canada. "We believed the East Village was turning around," resulting in a demand for more rentals, said Mr. Bell, who recalled attending a concert at the Fillmore.
A few groups rallied unsuccessfully to save the building for conversion to a recording studio or other performance use. Now, only the theater's Second Avenue entrance has been retained as part of a four-story commercial building that the Hudson Companies sold to Emigrant Savings Bank. A bank branch occupies the one-time theater lobby. The rest of the theater was razed to make way for the new apartment building.
It joins a few rental projects, including the 30-unit Information Building at 42-46 Avenue A at East Third Street, that have sprung up in recent years in the East Village. And the old Anderson Theater, at 66 Second Avenue between Third and Fourth Streets, is being developed into 98 apartments.
Mr. Bell said monthly rents at Hudson East are expected to be $1,400 to $2,500 for the market-rate apartments. Rents for the low-income units will be $332 to $510. Leasing is to start in July.
A plaque will be placed at the building's entrance telling passers-by of the storied night spots that once occupied the site -- despite the fact, Mr. Bell said, that the people who will rent apartments here will probably be too young to remember them.

HEADLINE: Cheddi Jagan, Guyana's Founder, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Cheddi B. Jagan, the firebrand who led Guyana to independence and was one of the Caribbean's most contentious political leaders for half a century, died yesterday in Washington, where he had been hospitalized after a heart attack. He was 78.
Dr. Jagan had undergone heart surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital after being flown to the United States on Feb. 15. 
 A dentist by training, Dr. Jagan rode the aspirations of Guyana's downtrodden Indian majority to power at a young age. But he was also a Marxist-Leninist of the pro-Soviet mold, which led to clashes with Churchill, who thought him a Communist puppet, and John F. Kennedy, who feared he aspired to install a "second Cuba" on the northern coast of South America.
Both those confrontations ended badly, with Dr. Jagan losing the post of Prime Minister to which he had been elected. But his popularity in his small country never faded, and he returned to power in 1992, nearly three decades after Washington engineered his ouster, with a softened outlook of his own and, ironically, the support of the United States.
Prime Minister Samuel Hinds, 53, was sworn in to succeed Mr. Jagan until elections can be held, probably this year. Mr. Hinds proclaimed six days of official mourning for "the greatest son and patriot that has ever walked this land."
Cheddi Jagan was born on March 22, 1918, on a sugar plantation near Port Mourant, in the eastern part of what was then British Guiana. His grandparents had migrated there from India as indentured laborers, and his father worked as the foreman of a work crew on the estate, giving the boy early exposure to poverty and exploitation.
The eldest of 11 children, he studied first at his village school, which was the extent of the education available to most young Indians at that time. But his parents made considerable financial sacrifices in order to send him to secondary school in the capital, Georgetown, where he excelled as a student, debater and cricket batsman.
At the age of 18, armed with his family's $500 life savings, he enrolled at Howard University in Washington, and entered the pre-medical program, majoring in dentistry. To help meet expenses, he worked as an elevator operator and, during the summers, as a patent medicine salesman in Harlem, experiences he would later say taught him bitter lessons about racism and inequality in capitalist societies.
By 1943, he had graduated from the Northwestern University Dental School in Chicago, where he met the American woman who became his wife and chief political partner and adviser. Janet Rosenberg was a student nurse active in left-wing causes, and she encouraged his interest in political science, economics, sociology and philosophy.
The couple returned to Georgetown, with Dr. Jagan dividing his energies between his dental practice and labor organizing, becoming a leader of the sugar, rice and wood workers' unions. In 1947, he was elected to the British Guiana assembly, and in 1950 he and his wife founded the People's Progressive Party, the first modern political organization in the colony.
Elections held under a new constitution providing for universal suffrage and increased home rule resulted in Dr. Jagan being elected chief minister in April 1953, at the age of 35. But his fondness for Marxist oratory and a program that called for sweeping social and economic reforms quickly aroused the suspicion of Churchill, who was serving his last term as Prime Minister, and six months later London sent troops and warships to depose him, charging that Dr. Jagan and his party "were completely under the control of a Communist clique."
Dr. Jagan responded with a civil disobedience campaign modeled on the one led by Mohandas K. Gandhi against British rule in India, but he was quickly arrested and jailed for six months. Nonetheless, his party again emerged triumphant in elections 1957, and both Dr. Jagan and his wife won Cabinet posts.
In 1961, the party fared even better, and Dr. Jagan (pronounced to rhyme with pagan) was sworn in as Prime Minister, vowing to achieve independence from Britain and install a socialist economy. That platform had the unwavering support of the colony's long-suffering Indian majority, but at the height of the cold war, Dr. Jagan's enthusiasm for the Cuban revolution of Fidel Castro and his threats to turn to the Soviet Union for aid immediately made him suspect to the United States.
"Events had convinced us that Jagan, though perhaps not a disciplined Communist, had that kind of deep, pro-Communist emotion which only sustained experience with Communism could cure," Arthur M. Schlesinger, the historian who was a special assistant for Latin American affairs to President Kennedy, wrote in his 1965 book "A Thousand Days." Dr. Jagan "was unquestionably some sort of a Marxist," he added, but also was "plainly the most popular leader in British Guiana."
Soon after Dr. Jagan's return to Georgetown, the Central Intelligence Agency undertook a destabilization campaign against him. United States Government documents that only came to light in the 1990's indicate that Washington was behind much of the Guyanese labor unrest, sabotage and disinformation efforts that led to race riots between East Indians and blacks that left nearly 100 dead.
The United States also pressured Britain to delay Guyana's independence until constitutional changes could be carried out to make it more difficult for Dr. Jagan to retain power. Although Dr. Jagan's party led the voting in elections in 1964, two opposition parties formed a coalition government that was headed by Forbes Burnham, a black lawyer who had once been an ally of Dr. Jagan but who split with him. Mr. Burnham later proved to be, as described by Mr. Schlesinger, "an opportunist, racist and demagogue intent only on personal power."
For nearly 30 years, Dr. Jagan led the oppositon. But once Mr. Burnham was in power, he installed what the State Department later described as a system of "wiretaps, mail interceptions and physical surveillance" designed to "monitor and intimidate political opponents," and won one rigged election after another until he died in office in 1985.
It was only in 1992, with Guyana near economic collapse as a result of years of misrule and corruption, that Dr. Jagan's years in the political wilderness ended. He won 54 percent of the vote, and once sworn in as President proved to be more mellow and less ideological than in the past.
Though Dr. Jagan said he had not abandoned his commitment to Marxism, he sought to attract foreign investors and embraced some free market policies. "I was a Gorbachev even before Gorbachev, in the sense of what we were doing and not adopting the traditional dogmas of Marxist parties," he said.
With the cold war over, Washington's attitude by then had also changed, and Dr. Jagan's relations with the Clinton Administration were cordial.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Jagan is survived by two children, Cheddi Jr. and Nadira, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Ruth Clark, 80, Pollster Who Changed an Industry

BYLINE: By KAREN FREEMAN

 BODY:
Ruth Clark, a pollster who left her mark on the newspaper industry with a landmark newspaper study that encouraged editors to offer more information that readers could use in their daily lives and who helped define changing American attitudes on issues from the political to the personal, died on Feb. 20 in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 80.
The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Andrew. 
 The newspaper study "Changing Needs of Changing Readers," published in 1979, had "an electrifying effect on the news business," said Lee Stinnett, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which commissioned it in an effort to assess why circulation was declining.
The concept, which came to be called "news you can use," appealed to editors nationwide as they experimented with reports on family issues and other articles of a type that they began to refer to as soft news.
Mrs. Clark was also widely known for directing many of the surveys that defined American public opinion during a time of great social and political turmoil in the 1970's, and she was part of the team that introduced exit polls into American politics and journalism.
She had no formal training in marketing or polling. She learned the business on her own, starting as a door-to-door questioner and gradually rising as a survey designer for marketing companies and eventually to prominent positions in the industry. She was a vice president at Louis Harris & Associates in the 1960's, and she was a senior vice president at Yankelovich, Skelly & White until 1983, when she left to start her own firm, Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo.
Arthur H. White, vice chairman of Yankelovich Partners, said that in her surveys Mrs. Clark always made sure she included the opinions of all segments of American society, not just those of the economically comfortable or affluent, because of her concerns for the downtrodden.
Born Ruth Fine in New York City, Mrs. Clark graduated from Hunter College in 1936. The following year, she married Joseph Clark, who later became the foreign editor of The Daily Worker.
The Clarks moved to the Soviet Union in 1950 but became disillusioned with what they saw there, returning to the United States in 1953, Andrew Clark said. Mr. Clark publicly renounced the Soviet system and left The Daily Worker in 1957.
Mrs. Clark entered the field of market research as an interviewer, going door to door and asking opinions about commercial products, often accompanied by her infant son.
But in 1960, she was ready to move up. She obtained a job with Lou Harris that kept her in the marketing survey segment of the business at first. In 1964, she was part of the Harris team that conducted an exit poll for CBS News in the tightly contested California Republican primary between Nelson A. Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater.
On the basis of the poll's results, Mr. Harris called the race for Mr. Goldwater. He said the two next weeks until the official vote tallies were complete was "the loneliest time of my entire political career." But the official results proved the Harris team right.
Mrs. Clark got a chance to address political issues more broadly when she moved to Yankelovich, Skelly & White around 1970. She was in charge of the firm's public opinion research, and she proved to be adept at turning out high-quality surveys that newspapers and magazines could get into print quickly, Mr. White said.
A survey for the American Cancer Society helped persuade the organization to focus on encouraging nonsmokers to stand up for their rights, said John H. Bartolomeo, a partner in her firm, who also worked with her in the 1970's.
"She told them that she had picked up an undercurrent of militancy among nonsmokers," Mr. Bartolomeo said, "and she told them that the most important thing they could do would be to encourage that militancy."
He said that Mrs. Clark, who did not smoke, "told me once that she considered that the most important thing she had ever done."
In 1983, Mrs. Clark's daughter Judith, who was in the radical Weather Underground, was convicted of helping to rob a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y. In that incident in 1981 two police officers and a guard were killed. Judith Clark was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.
At Yankelovich and at Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo, Mrs. Clark conducted market surveys for many media companies, including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune.
"Changing Needs of Changing Readers," which Mrs. Clark updated in 1984, was a small study but it helped to change an industry, Mr. Stinnett said. Her influence on newspapers can be seen today in the creation of life style sections, consumer news and entertainment guides published by many newspapers as well as lists of resources for readers that often accompany feature articles.
Besides her son, of Portland, Ore., and her daughter, Mrs. Clark is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1988.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Rise 2.5%, and Joblessness Gauge Falls

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Orders placed with American factories rose 2.5 percent in January, the Commerce Department said today, while a Labor Department report showed more strength than expected in the labor market.
The rise in factory orders brought them to a record $323.2 billion and was the first increase in three months. December's decline was revised to 1.5 percent, from 1.3 percent. Analysts had expected the January report to show a 2.1 percent gain. 
 January's manufacturing strength was driven by the largest increase in orders for big-ticket goods since September. Factory inventories, meantime, increased one-tenth of a percent after having decreased three-tenths of a percent in December.
"The bottom line is the manufacturing sector still has plenty of momentum," Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said before the report was issued today.
In its report the Labor Department said the number of workers applying for the first time for state unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 6,000, to a seasonally adjusted 310,000. The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, declined to 310,000 -- the lowest level in almost eight years -- from 313,500 the previous week.
"These tight conditions in labor markets are going to finally start feeding into the wage pressures," said Richard Koss, an economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a New York investment advisory firm. That in turn could push the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned Congress again Wednesday that a pre-emptive rate increase might be needed to forestall accelerating inflation.
On Friday the Government is expected to report growth in February's payrolls.
"Today's report is mildly bearish," Douglas Porter, senior economist at the investment firm Nesbitt Burns Inc., said of the jobless claims statistics. "This type of low level of claims is consistent with quite strong job growth."
As for factory orders, the overall 2.5 percent increase was unchanged when even the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment was included. Excluding the defense industry, orders climbed 3.1 percent.
By category, orders for durable goods, big-ticket items made to last three or more years, advanced 4 percent after having decreased 1.7 percent in December. In an advance report on Feb. 27, the Commerce Department said durable goods orders increased 3.6 percent in January. Orders for nondurable goods like food and clothing increased seven-tenths of a percent after falling 1.2 percent in December.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Decline as Investors Await Data on Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, with investors showing clear anxiety ahead of today's report on employment figures.
Economic statistics released earlier this week have all been on a one- way street heading higher, and yesterday's data were no exception. 
 Factory orders during January rose 2.5 percent -- somewhat higher than expected-- led by new orders for durable goods, which jumped 4 percent, an upward revision.
"Furthermore," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "the backlog of unfilled orders continues to climb, providing a base for future production."
Initial claims for state unemployment fell unexpectedly in the latest reporting week, and chain store sales were stronger than analysts had expected.
All eyes, of course, are now focused on today's labor market statistics, with traders worried that if those figures, too, show a robust economy, it could tip the scales toward a Fed rate increase on March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets.
The 30-year bond dropped 20/32 , to a price of 9627/32 to yield 6.88 percent, up from 6.82 percent on Wednesday.
Mr. Fine said that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had made it clear during the second round of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the House on Wednesday "that risks, not forecasts, will drive monetary policy, and that the F.O.M.C. would tighten pre-emptively to prevent the economy from overheating and causing an acceleration in inflation conditions."
The recent downward trend in initial unemployment claims suggests the unemployment rate will drop to 5.3 percent or even 5.2 percent, Mr. Fine said, while the index of aggregate hours worked should bounce back quite noticeably following its surprising plunge in January.
But the market's attention will be centered on the payroll number. Although the range of projections for the change in nonfarm payrolls is wide, extending from a modest gain of 125,000 to a robust surge of 350,000, the consensus view is for an increase of 225,000.
"If market projections are close to reality," Mr. Fine said, "the upside risk that Greenspan alluded to will certainly have increased, and the bond market will become even more wary of a Fed tightening at the next F.O.M.C. meeting."
Volume was thin as many buyers, having already positioned themselves, moved to the sidelines. One reason was the decline in the unemployment claims, which drew attention to the tightness of the labor market. Initial claims decreased 6,000, to 310,000 last week, with the four-week moving average dropping to an eight-year low of 310,000, from 313,500 a week earlier.
David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: "The market is trying to get in front of the Fed at this point. The lows did not bring out more sellers."
In the corporate market, the Hershey Foods Corporation led a number of companies that sold $1.2 billion of debt yesterday, locking in rates in case yields move higher after the employment report.
Hershey priced $150 million of 10-year notes through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company at a price to yield 6.992 percent.
The notes are noncallable by the company, and are rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's, with a yield spread over a comparable Treasury of about 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Leads, but New York's Economy Doesn't Follow

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
Over the last year, New York City's unemployment rate has climbed even as Wall Street was cheering repeated record highs. Brokers earning seven-figure bonuses shopped for summer homes while about one in 11 people looked for jobs.
Through much of New York's history, those kinds of contradictions did not occur. The economic rule of thumb was that when Wall Street celebrated, New York celebrated. But there has been a fundamental shift in that chemistry in the 1990's. Because the city, the state and the securities industry are not producing jobs in ways that they used to, the good news of Wall Street has not been enough to bring overall prosperity. 
 Economists say that this new and still evolving pattern is more volatile, is less equitable in the distribution of wealth, and may be unable over the long term to produce the kinds of entry-level jobs on which New York has historically depended.
That represents a major change. Since the days of the trusts and the railroad barons, Wall Street has been both a barometer of New York's economic health and a powerful job engine. What has happened in the 1990's, economists say, is that those two historical roles largely fell away. Despite the blizzard of bonuses and profits and taxes, the fortunes of the industry and the fortunes of New York diverged.
Through most of the 1980's in particular, securities industry profits acted like a lever on the economy: in most years when profits were up, the rate of growth of personal income in New York State surpassed the national average, and in years when profits declined, New York was dragged down and trailed the nation. It was a calculus that echoed the industry's roots in lower Manhattan and its power as an employer.
Since the 1987 market crash, and particularly in the last few years, however, the lever has simply not worked. Securities industry profits reached record levels, but state growth in personal income still lagged.
In short, Wall Street's health is no longer enough to compensate for erosion in other areas. The windfall of tax revenues that washed through the city and state budgets made politicians smile, but was inadequate to the task of uplifting the overall economy.
"When I look at Wall Street, I don't think of it as a major growth sector for employment," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "I look at high-paying jobs, and income, but not so much employment. We're going to want to look elsewhere for a job engine."
Another result of changes in the city and in the securities industry is a heightened disparity of wealth. Between 1989 and 1995, according to the State Comptroller's office, total real wages for New York City's 3.2 million workers went up 8.4 percent when adjusted for inflation. But the majority of those gains came from one place: Wall Street.
With the securities-industry contribution stripped out, wages in New York rose a paltry 3.8 percent in those six years. If the securities industry and banking are both removed, wages rose only 2.5 percent after inflation.
In this new economic mix, contrary indicators have become common. Just this week, the state reported that in January, New York City's unemployment rate reached its highest level in three years. The following day, the City Comptroller's office said that the city had created more jobs in January than in any month for a decade.
H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, said his central worry was that New York's fortunes rest on a narrower and narrower economic base that does not, in the end, provide for all New Yorkers.
"New York's economic problem is the creation of a wide variety of jobs," he said. "We have to look to other sectors where we will get a wider job penetration."
The forces that underlie these changes are complex and still evolving. Certainly, the health of the securities industry as a whole is not in question. What has changed is the mix of jobs, and New York's greater dependence on them.
In the 1990's, perhaps more than at any other time in its history, Wall Street work means white-collar work. Ten years after the 1987 market crash, there are fewer midlevel, entry-level and union jobs, and more salaried workers eligible for bonuses. Some firms have changed nearly everything about whom they employ in the city, what kind of work they do, and what they're paid.
At the same time, continued declines in manufacturing, government and banking have left the city with a smaller work force, which is ever more reliant on Wall Street.
In 1987, for example, the nearly 163,000 people employed in New York City securities firms made up a total of 5.1 percent of the private sector work force and earned 12.6 percent of the total private sector wages, according to state figures. By 1996, industry employment had fallen to 150,000, but that accounted for 5.3 percent of a smaller work force and 16.9 percent of the wages.
Certainly, some elements of the new dynamic are unequivocally good for New York. Stock trading volume is higher than ever. The city has solidified its place as a center of global finance. Soaring stock prices have created wealth and willingness to spend money that has spilled over into retailing and real estate.
After shedding more than 30,000 jobs in the city between 1987 and 1991, the securities industry has rebuilt itself: hiring about 20,000 people in the years since. New York State received $1 billion in taxes from the industry last year.
And some of the changes could be positive in the long term. More high-end jobs means that New York is headquarters for the industry's glamour and brain power. Economists say upper-level jobs may be more stable, too: Wall Street usually cuts from the bottom in bad times.
But the sunny headlines about the Dow Jones average or budget-saving tax infusions have also obscured the less visible changes that leave the future of the regional economy and the industry much less certain.
Between 1987 and 1995, for example, New York State lost more than 13,000 securities industry jobs, while other states gained 85,000 jobs. In that same period the state's national share of securities jobs fell from 38 percent to 30 percent, as New York became less and less the center of the universe for the business.
Three major forces were at work, the first being that this decade is the era of the mutual fund investor, and the mutual fund companies are mostly not in New York. New technologies, partly driven by higher stock-trading volumes, have also kept labor needs down, while cost control pressures have pushed firms to relocate workers.
Entry-level industry jobs familiar since the days of Rockefeller and Morgan have disappeared. When the $10.2 billion merger between Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Discover was announced last month, for example, some of the first people to hear about it were the messengers and runners who shuttle documents through the organizations.
But those workers are not employees of either firm. They work for Choice Courier Systems, a contractor that does in-house delivery and mailroom services. Morgan Stanley got rid of its 60 in-house messengers two years ago. Dean Witter signed on with Choice in January.
Those kinds of outside arrangements -- common across corporate America -- clearly create new opportunities, but they also eliminate entry-level spots from which people might once have been promoted. Choice's founder, president and chief executive officer, Edward Katz, conceded that the health benefits for his employees were probably less generous than a giant Wall Street firm might offer. But the lower cost is also largely why he is doing well, he said.
For New York politicians the implications are delicate. The city and state have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years wooing and subsidizing Wall Street firms that threatened to leave the city. The apparently growing gap between rich and poor has become, at the same time, a centerpiece of the debate about government's role. In the adminstration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, caution reigns.
"I don't think you can define it either as a positive or a negative," said Fran Reiter, the city's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning, of the changes in the securities industry. "It just is."
Ms. Reiter said that specific efforts were under way to try to bring back some lower-wage securities jobs, but that it was also important for the city to wean itself away from dependence on one industry.
Some securities companies are also nervous. A spokesman at one large investment firm in New York, declining to comment on the record, said that the firm did not want to alienate New Yorkers by admitting that the growth of jobs was faster in areas of the firm outside New York.
He also did not want to alienate people in those other places by giving the impression that New York gets only the highest-paying jobs. But as a generalization, the spokesman said, both trends are true.
At Smith Barney, the transformation of jobs has occurred entirely within the city. In two years, the firm has created about 150 new technical jobs in computer programming, technical support and communications. It also eliminated about the same number of "mundane clerical functions," said Melvin Taub, a senior executive vice president.
Mr. Taub said that some of the displaced clerks got training and made the transition or found other jobs, so that no layoffs resulted. The new jobs are more highly paid than the old ones, he said, and are all eligible for bonuses as well.
At Bowne & Company, a 222-year-old financial printing company, the changes are even more stark. Ten years ago, the firm's offices on Hudson Street had clattering presses and lots of union jobs. It was a place where prospectuses and legal filings got printed.
That's all gone now. During the recession, when many of the company's competitors went out of business, Bowne retooled. Its printing is now done in Secaucus; the staff has been upgraded. The Federal Securities and Exchange Commission changed to electronic filing.
Between 1987 and 1996, the number of white-collar occupations at Bowne's New York office went up 127 percent while blue-collar positions fell by 69 percent. The company used to recruit at the New York High School of Graphic Communication Arts. That just won't do now, said David L. Rosenstein, a company spokesman.
"They couldn't do this kind of work," Mr. Rosenstein said. "Our trainees are college graduates."

HEADLINE: Retailers' Sales Gained at High And Low Ends In February

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
If there was ever a month that told the story of Americans' divergent shopping habits, February was it.
Retail same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, were strong last month, particularly among two sectors of the industry: the extremely expensive and the rock-bottom priced. 
 General merchandise stores like Dollar General and Family Dollar, which cater to low-income shoppers, and high-end shops like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, stood out along with retailers like Ross Stores, which offer clothing bargains for anyone willing to hunt for them.
Retailers in the middle of the market, with the greatest number of stores serving the most overwhelmed consumers, continue to struggle, as they have for several quarters.
While most retail experts agree that there are still far too many stores for far too few shoppers, economists and analysts also say that the thrill of a bargain hunt has become a deep-seated part of the American shopping culture, even as wealthy people drop thousands of dollars on imported cigars and Armani dresses.
According to the Goldman, Sachs & Company same-store sales index, which compares stores open at least a year, retail sales in February were up 3.8 percent compared with figures from a year earlier. In February 1996, they had risen 4.9 percent.
Same-store sales gains had been strong in February 1996 for many retailers largely because of huge sales for unsold Christmas merchandise and because many shoppers had been snowed in during January. Still, stores that enjoyed healthy same-store sales gains this year stood out as particularly successful because of the comparison with a strong month a year earlier.
Among discounters, the Consolidated Stores Corporation, which is based in Wilmington, Del., reported same-store sales increases of 9.1 percent, compared with a 10.6 percent gain in February 1996. The Dollar General Corporation gained 11.1 percent, compared with last year's 14.1 percent gain. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gained 6.7 percent in sales, and the Kmart Corporation gained 3.9 percent.
Wal-Mart also said yesterday that it would buy back an additional $2 billion of stock over the next 12 to 18 months and increase its quarterly dividend 29 percent.
Off-price stores that sell designer goods at a discount continue to do well. Ross Stores reported a 14 percent gain, and the TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, reported a 5 percent gain.
The strong sales among discount stores show that American shoppers will go out of their way for a deal, some analysts said. "Value consciousness first became apparent in the late 80's and is not going away," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "There is enough wealth being created to drive high-end retailing, but Joe Six-Pack is still shopping for value. He would rather buy low and put some money in a mutual fund or something."
If the results at department and specialty stores were any indication, Americans have satisfied their desire for full-price clothing after a quarter of restocking their closets last year. Federated Department Stores reported a mere 2.2 percent gain in same-store sales for February, and the Dayton Hudson Corporation squeaked in with a 1.2 percent gain, though its Target discount division gained 6 percent in sales. Ann Taylor lost 1.2 percent, the Limited sales were down 2 percent, and sales at the Gap Inc. and Talbots Inc. were flat.
The exceptions among department stores were the J. C. Penney Company, which gained 11.4 percent, largely because of huge promotions, and luxury retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, a unit of Saks Holdings Inc., which gained 6.4 percent, and Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General, which reported a 4.5 percent gain.
"In terms of apparel," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, "we are coming off of four straight quarters of accelerating sales. So the apparel cycle may have peaked or may be peaking and the rest of the year may be only so-so."
Sales of consumer electronics continue to be weak: The Best Buy Company lost 3 percent in same-store sales, and Circuit City Stores reported a 4 percent loss.
Good sales last month were not generally a result of drastic markdowns, some analysts said, because retailers have generally kept their inventories tight for the last six months. As a result, the earnings outlook for the first quarter may be good.
"This was not a promotional month," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "This gives us a good lead-in for the first quarter."
Other analysts and economists were less enthusiastic, largely because the issues that have dogged the industry, namely oversupply, continue.
"We anticipate that investors may jump on the sector based on the same-store sales, only to be disappointed in the second quarter when the underlying weakness is more evident," wrote Peter N. Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon, Read & Company. "As we have said many times before, the basic economic scenario and secular changes which have stymied retail growth for several years remain."

HEADLINE: It's Showdown Time on Wall St.;
For Brokerage Houses, a New Class of Suitor Rides In

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
When executives from Citicorp and American Express met secretly late last year to discuss merging their businesses, it sent a strong message to the investment bankers at Morgan Stanley that the financial world's heavies were about to descend on Wall Street.
Citicorp, which was advised by Morgan Stanley in its exploratory discussions with the American Express Company, pulled back from the deal, at least for the moment. But even though those merger discussions did not go anywhere, executives say, they spurred Morgan Stanley Group and Dean Witter, Discover & Company to move quickly to forge their own $10.5 billion merger, which they announced last month. The two are not alone. Rather than leave themselves vulnerable to the big American and foreign banks on the prowl or one of the large corporations that want a piece of the action, a number of Wall Street firms are circling the wagons, too. 
 Paine Webber has stepped up its search for an asset management firm, in part because size may help it evade some hungry predator. Salomon Brothers signed an innovative marketing deal with Fidelity Investments, the FMR unit, intended to broaden its equity franchise through better access to private investors. Most Wall Street firms are also zealously encouraging their employees to buy their own shares, hoping that a lot of insider ownership will increase employee motivation and also give their firms more protection from unwanted would-be acquirers on the prowl. And some executives at Dean Witter and Morgan Stanley are still jumpy, fearing that another party, perhaps even American Express, might try to derail the union with a more lucrative offer.
If Wall Streeters are going to make any deals for their own firms, says Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company who covers the brokerage industry, their first choice is one of their own. "These targets," he said, "would much more prefer to be matched up with a like company in a like culture."
There also is a palpable concern about the damage that unwanted gunslingers from outside the tight-knit world of Wall Street may do if they come blundering into the securities business.
"The history of acquisitions in the brokerage industry by outsiders has been so bad," said Regina Dolan, Paine Webber's chief financial officer. The General Electric Company, for example, had an awful experience with Kidder, Peabody & Company, the Wall Street firm it sold to Paine Webber in late 1994.
As the barriers that once kept banks, insurance and the brokerage business apart crumble, the bankers and insurers are riding into town. the BankAmerica Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Nationsbank Corporation, American Insurance Group, Travelers Group and foreign behemoths like Dresdner Bank, the Swiss Bank Corporation and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, a unit of HSBC Holdings, are already scouting around.
Their prime targets are likely to be attractive smaller firms on Wall Street. Among them are Alex. Brown & Sons; Bear, Stearns & Company; Oppenheimer Group; Legg Mason Inc. and Lehman Brothers.
But other firms could also fall victim, including some that already have ties to outsiders. These include Prudential Securities, Salomon Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. At the very least, big financial institutions want to cherry-pick Wall Street's best talent to build up their own investment banking and brokerage operations.
Some past Wall Street alliances have not worked well, leaving a cautionary legacy for those now contemplating defensive maneuvers. Shearson-Lehman, a brokerage combination tried by American Express fell short of expectations and ended with Lehman being spun off in 1993 and Shearson being acquired by Travelers.
But while "there won't be an avalanche" of mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street, says Milton R. Berlinski, a partner at Goldman, Sachs who advises big financial firms, he sees another round of deals -- perhaps half a dozen in the next year or two -- as all but inevitable. Several are likely to be mergers aimed, in part, at building up enough critical mass to avoid unwanted takeovers.
What has made Wall Street particularly vulnerable to commercial banks that are eager to expand their reach is that the Federal Reserve has relaxed its rules governing what they can own. Banks can now own securities operations that account for up to 25 percent of their revenues, up from 10 percent last year.
For the first time since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act separated the banking and securities businesses, big banks can, in theory, buy virtually all but the largest Wall Street brokerage houses. Some banks, eager to recapture a portion of the funds that have leaked from low-interest savings accounts into more attractive mutual funds and brokerage accounts, would clearly like to.
At Chase Manhattan, for example, a recent management shuffle gave James B. Lee Jr. and Donald H. Layton joint responsibility for running its investment bank. That left William B. Harrison Jr., a vice chairman and director, free to focus on potential acquisitions in the brokerage business, executives at that bank say. In some crystal ball gazing research published last month, Dean P. Eberling, an analyst at Prudential Securities, speculated that Chase might eventually acquire the merged Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter.
In recent months, Chase has also hired several senior executives from Salomon, including Mark C. Davis, a takeover specialist, and John P. Lipsky, who is now Chase's chief economist. From Donaldson, Lufkin, the bank also picked up Wilfred A. Finnegan, who heads Chase's high-yield bond business, and from Furman, Selz, John Steinhardt, who leads its American securities business.
This kind of interest in the brokerage business has investors hopping. The share price of Donaldson, Lufkin, for example, rose more than 7 percent on Feb. 10 on speculation that it might be sold. The firm, which is 73 percent owned by the Equitable Companies and Axa, its French parent, said it was happy with its current ownership.
"I think people are rotating among the securities stocks," said Sam G. Liss, a managing director and analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, "trying to speculate about where the action is coming next."
Many potential takeover targets, though, remain deeply suspicious of the outsiders that are eying them so covetously. Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, cautioned in an interview that Wall Street is a business that is largely foreign to commercial banks. Compensation in the securities business, he said, is higher and much more erratic. And talented traders, brokers and investment bankers, by far the most valuable asset in most brokerage firms, can readily walk out the door and find jobs elsewhere if they are unhappy.
Something like that happened, for instance, after Credit Suisse began acquiring First Boston in the late 1980's. Its record is at best mixed, as the firm has been beset by defections and considerable in-fighting.
Everyone involved is aware that several past commercial banking forays into the securities business have failed miserably. When Britain deregulated its securities industry in 1986, American banking companies like Chase and Citicorp ambitiously gobbled up local firms, buying some of the best-known names in the London brokerage business.
Citicorp acquired both Scrimgeour Kemp Gee and Vickers da Costa, two established London brokerage houses, which it combined in hopes of bringing together a strong corporate finance business with an envied Asian equities franchise. But much of the talent was offended at Citicorp's commercial banking culture and its rough attempts to build an international securities business virtually overnight. Several longtime employees of Vickers da Costa later gathered to establish Peregrine, an investment bank based in Hong Kong.
Some foreign banks, now trying to build investment banks of their own on Wall Street, are already discovering just how protean Wall Street can be. Deutsche Bank A.G., the German banking giant, for example, has been trying to construct an investment bank in the Morgan Stanley mold, hiring whole teams of bankers from that firm, as well as from Merrill Lynch & Company and Goldman, Sachs. As soon as Deutsche Bank had spent billions on the project, Morgan Stanley itself started to metamorphose, first by buying the Van Kampen/American Capital mutual fund family, then by merging with Dean Witter.
In this fast-changing milieu, it is not clear which strategies are likely to prove most successful. But Wall Street firms like Salomon and Donaldson, Lufkin, which deal mostly with institutional customers, are clearly interested in building better access to the private investor. That strategy was advanced by some influential recent research from Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, showing the profit margins in traditional investment banking and securities trading businesses are declining, while returns on the dwindling number of Main Street businesses with nationwide branch networks remained strong.
"The institutional firms are walking around playing musical chairs, eyeing the chairs carefully, so if the music stops there'll be a chair for them," said Paul V. Scura, the head of investment banking at Prudential Securities.
The brokerage firms may not have a lot of time to make their choices. Their potential suitors at the big banks and insurance companies have fat wallets these days, and some are prepared to dip deeply into their capital to offer prices that may be hard to refuse. And if the stock market drops significantly, pulling down the market values of securities firms, that could be just the opening many banks are waiting for.
Even the biggest firms on Wall Street could be vulnerable. Merrill Lynch, the largest American brokerage firm in terms of capital until the Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter deal is completed and still the firm with the most extensive branch network and the broadest business, has about $16 billion in market capital. That is not much compared with Chase's $46 billion or the $58 billion at American Insurance Group, which has reportedly been sniffing around Merrill Lynch.
David K. Schafer, president of Schafer & Cullen, a New York investment adviser and mutual fund company, argues that the recent Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter merger "may be the trigger to a number of other moves." Mr. Schafer, whose funds have invested in Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, says that for bigger Wall Street firms, like Merrill and Goldman, Sachs, it is now a matter of "keeping up with the Morgan Stanleys."
Even Goldman, the only major private partnership and perhaps the most prized jewel in the Wall Street crown, may have to act. It lacks the Main Street distribution that Merrill has had for decades and that Morgan is about to obtain. Goldman's leaders, who declined to comment publicly on the matter, agreed privately that they might have to change but said no immediate decisions were necessary.
As for Merrill, it maintains that it has already built the Wall Street model for the 21st century, in part through its successful acquisitions years ago of White Weld and A. G. Becker. But many analysts expect that David H. Komanksy, its new chief executive, will want to make a big acquisition to secure once again his firm's claim to being No. 1 in the American and overseas securities business.
Mr. Komansky, of course, is mum about his specific plans. But he said that Merrill's "strategy is to be the leading financial management and advisory company for a broadly diverse global client base."
That will be achieved, he added, through "superior service, internal expansion and selective acquisitions."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Riding Into Town"
On Wall Street, many firms are worried about the threat of takeover by gunslingers from banking, insurance, and other outside financial institutions. Here are several, with their stock price as of Jan. 31, shortly before the Dean Witter/Morgan Stanley deal was announced, and yesterday's close. The chart lists various firms mentioned in the text with information about the firm and stock prices as of Jan. 31 and March 6.
 
LEHMAN BROTHERS -- Midsize investment bank spun off by American Express in 1993. Once paired with Shearson, Lehman might eventually be snapped up by an ambitious commercial bank.
 
Jan 31: $31.625
March 6: $33.25
 
OPPENHEIMER -- Privately held investment bank. Has already negotiated to sell itself to peotential buyers, including foreign banks. No public shares.
 
DONALDSON, LUFKIN & JENRETTE -- Midsize institutional broker and merchant bank largely owned by an insurance company. Might be a perfect fit for a money-center bank like Bankers Trust.
Jan 31: $37.875
March 6: $43.75
 
BEAR, STEARNS -- High-paying trading firm with a sizable clearing operation for small brokers. Likely to sell if the price is right.
Jan 31: $30
March 6: $30.125
 
DEAN WITTER, DISCOVER -- Main Street broker, with highly profitable credit card operation. Merger agreement with Morgan Stanley kicked off wave of speculation about other potential Wall Street deals. After merger, the combined firm will, in capital, be the nation's largest broker, but it might still be vulnerable to future takeover.
Jan 31: $38.125
March 6: $40.625
 
MORGAN STANLEY -- Blueblood Wall Street investment house seeking to build global business. Plans to merge with Dean Witter but conflicts over cultural differences are likely.
Jan. 31: $57.125
March 6: $66.375
 
PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES -- Midsize retail broker owned by Prudential Insurance. Still tarnished by scandal over limited partnerships, Prudential may decide to unload its securities operation. No stock price.
 
PAINE WEBBER -- Midsize retail broker. Attractive target for bank or financial institution like GE Capital or American Express. Wants to but asset manager to make itself less vulnerable to takeover.
Jan. 31: $36
March 6: $34.50

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides and a Proposal to Build a Chinese Power Plant

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
For American companies eager to crack the vast but frustrating Chinese market, it was a big deal when Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown announced on a trade mission to China in 1994 that he had secured an agreement for the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans to help build a $1 billion power plant 250 miles north of Beijing.
"The public sector-private sector partnership envisioned by President Clinton is working well," Mr. Brown said at the time, hailing his department's willingness to use its muscle to pry open opportunities for American business abroad. 
 The deal collapsed, unheralded, six months after Mr. Brown's announcement, yet another victim of the political, economic and cultural difficulties that plague foreign companies trying to obtain a toehold in China.
China never bought the $450 million worth of parts and supplies from the United States that the deal called for, and Entergy never received its 20 percent, or $37.5 million stake, in the power plant, in Datong.
The project has another legacy. Entergy's partner in the project was the Lippo Group, the company controlled by the Riady family of Indonesia, which has been at the center of questions about whether the Clinton Administration traded access and influence over policy for campaign contributions.
Around the time that the Commerce Department was working to win agreement on the deal from the Chinese Government, businesses controlled by the Riadys employed Webster L. Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General and a close friend of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Hubbell had left office to face criminal charges that stemmed from the Whitewater investigation. The Whitewater independent counsel is now examining Mr. Hubbell's 1994 income to determine whether his employment by the Riadys and others with ties to Mr. Clinton were intended to discourage him from cooperating with investigators looking into the Clintons' finances.
Mr. Hubbell, who recently completed an 18-month prison sentence, has denied that his employment after leaving the Administration played any role in his dealings with prosecutors during the case. And Mr. Clinton has said he does not think that there was any improper influence on Mr. Hubbell or the White House from the Riadys.
Entergy, which also owns the electric utility that serves Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas, has been among the most active American companies in China. It is involved in another power plant in Taishan, in Guangdong Province in southern China, and it is considering other investments.
A spokesman for Entergy, Patrick Sweeney, said the Commerce Department's involvement in the deal had been minimal. He said the company had been ready to sign the formal memorandum of understanding before the trade mission led by Mr. Brown in August 1994, but held the signing ceremony with Chinese officials during the mission because the chairman of Entergy, Edwin A. Lupberger, had signed up to travel with Mr. Brown.
"The trade mission was coincidental," Mr. Sweeney said. "There was nothing that happened because of the trade mission that would not have happened anyway."
Commerce Department officials said the Entergy project had not been high on Mr. Brown's priority list on the trip, which centered on trying to help bigger companies like the Chrysler Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Entergy's involvement in the failed Datong project dates from well before Mr. Hubbell announced his resignation from the Justice Department on March 14, 1994.
Entergy said it signed a nonbinding agreement to work on the project that month, and Commerce Department officials said the nonbinding pact was reached a month earlier.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department, Jim Desler, said the American Embassy in Beijing had provided some help to Entergy before Mr. Brown's trip. But Mr. Desler said he did not know whether the assistance began before the signing of the nonbinding accord in March 1994.
Mr. Brown died in a plane crash in Bosnia a year ago.
Within months of the signing, the deal went awry. Mr. Sweeney said the main problem was that not enough water was available to cool the plant, causing the project to collapse for engineering reasons. Commerce Department officials said their understanding was that the Chinese authorities did not feel that the deal would be profitable.
"The project is dead," Mr. Sweeney said, "and as far as Entergy is concerned it's dead for good."

HEADLINE: 2 Newspapers Each Are Winners Of 2 Polk Awards for Journalism

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Two newspapers, The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, each won 2 of the 11 George Polk awards for journalism announced yesterday by Long Island University.
The New York Times won an award for economics reporting for its series "The Downsizing of America." And one of its correspondents, John F. Burns, won the foreign reporting award for his articles on the takeover of Kabul, Afghanistan, by Taliban, the militant Islamic group. 
 The Los Angeles Times won the prize for political reporting for "Money From Asia," about suspect contributions from Asian sources to the Democratic National Committee. The paper also won the cultural reporting award, for Chuck Philips's articles about the inner workings of America's $12 billion music industry.
A reporter for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Elizabeth Marchak, won the award for national reporting for her articles raising questions about the Federal Government's handling of air safety violations. Her series of articles, "The F.A.A. and Valujet Airlines," focused on the Federal Aviation Administration's weak response to its inspectors' reports on unsafe aircraft, improper maintenance and inadequate training at Valujet and other cut-rate airlines.
The awards, which are administered by Long Island University, were established in 1949 in memory of George W. Polk, a CBS correspondent who was killed in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece.
Yesterday, Bryan Acohido of The Seattle Times won a Polk award for transportation reporting for "Safety at Issue: the 737," a series linking questions about the rudder controls of Boeing 737 planes to several deadly crashes and the F.A.A.'s resistance to acknowledging the problem.
Honors for local reporting went to Kevin Collison of The Buffalo News, who linked the death of a teen-ager, run over on a highway while on her way to work at a shopping mall, to a policy denying access to city buses to discourage minority customers.
The prize for magazine reporting went to Anne-Marie Cusac of The Progressive for "Stunning Technology," which exposed the life-threatening dangers of security devices used in American prisons and exported to repressive foreign regimes.
These were other prizes:
 FOREIGN TELEVISION REPORTING: Christiane Amanpour and Anita Pratap of CNN for "Battle for Afghanistan," an examination of the armed struggle for control of the country, with revealing interviews of key figures in opposing camps.
NATIONAL TELEVISION REPORTING: Matt Meagher and Tim Peek of "Inside Edition" for "Door to Door Insurance," an undercover investigation of the exploitation of poor Americans by some insurers.
CRITICISM: Blair Kamin of The Chicago Tribune for an examination of issues in Chicago architecture that encouraged public debate and influenced its outcome.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark After German Jobless Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-year high against the mark for the third consecutive day yesterday after Germany reported record unemployment, but the dollar later retreated to end mostly lower.
Profit taking on the dollar's gains and uncertainty about the impact of United States employment data due today all weighed on the dollar as the day progressed. 
 The employment report is expected to disclose more evidence of a healthy economy and raise the likelihood of higher United States interest rates, which should help the dollar. But an excessively strong report could aggravate concern about inflation, unnerve the stock and bond markets and push the currency lower.
"The dollar may just have run out of steam for the time being," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "People are going to wait for that unemployment data."
In European dealings, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7208 marks, the strongest since April 1994, before falling back to settle in New York at 1.7155 marks, up from 1.7121 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar settled at 121.13 yen in New York, down from 121.21 yen. The pound rose to $1.6155 from $1.6137.
Speculation that Germany would report a postwar unemployment record for February had pushed the dollar higher against the mark for most of this week. Although the report released yesterday showed 4.672 million jobless, less than the most pessimistic projections, the dollar still advanced.
"This is a classic bandwagon for the upside on the dollar," said Earl I. Johnson, foreign-exchange economist at the Bank of Montreal's New York branch. "Sentiment is still bullish for the dollar."
Against the yen, the dollar remained weak throughout the trading day, first falling in early Asian dealings after the Japanese Finance Ministry reported its broadest measure of trade for January showed a 362.3 percent increase in the surplus compared with the year earlier.
The dollar also fell after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told Congress that "a sustained increase in the Japanese surplus isn't in anybody's interest."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Apartments Rising on Site Of Fillmore East and Saint

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
A seven-story brick rental apartment building is rising on part of the site at Second Avenue and Sixth Street in the East Village that was once home to the fabled rock concert hall the Fillmore East and later to the Saint, an elaborate disco that was a center of gay night life in the 1980's.
With 86 studio to three-bedroom apartments, including some duplex units, the structure rising at 225 East Sixth Street underscores Manhattan's strong rental market and the changing character of the area, which brokers say is in the throes of becoming an appealing address for young renters who have been priced out of such neighborhoods as SoHo and the West Village. The $14 million Hudson East project is being developed by the Hudson Companies Inc., based in Brooklyn. 
 Eighty percent of the 438- to 1,556-square-foot apartments will be rented at market value. The remaining 20 percent will be leased at reduced prices to tenants whose annual incomes are $13,700 to $22,050, depending on family size.
The new rental is the latest in a spate of so-called 80-20 projects just finished, under way or planned in Manhattan. In return for having 20 percent of the apartments reserved for low-income tenants, the city or state issues tax-exempt bonds to provide permanent financing to the builders, who are also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city.
To protect bondholders, developers must also obtain what is called a credit enhancement -- mortgage insurance from a state or Federal agency or a letter of credit from a bank or pension fund.
Beyond the 80-20 projects, more than 2,600 rental units are in various stages of development and planning in downtown Manhattan, where office buildings are being converted to apartments with the aid of city-sponsored tax incentives. Among the larger conversions, 45 Wall Street, with 441 apartments, is expected to open for leasing next month.
Both programs are helping to increase rental production in the city. They also reflect the reliance of new residential construction on public benefits.
Alan R. Bell, a principal of the Hudson Companies, said the East Village project would not have been economically feasible without the tax incentives. It received $11.75 million in bond financing from the New York State Housing Finance Agency and mortgage insurance from the State of New York Mortgage Agency. Construction financing is coming from Chase Manhattan Bank and equity from the company.
The production of apartments is rising at a time when some brokers say rents in Manhattan are flattening after three years of increases, which pushed many tenants to buy.
With the new supply, "rents will soften in 1997," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage. But as rents ease, so will demand in the sale market, causing people to rent again and limiting the rental price decline, she said.
Hudson East is distinct because of its site's history, which dates from the late 1920's. Over time, the building was the Loew's Commodore movie palace, a Yiddish theater and a concert hall. In 1968, Bill Graham, the rock music impresario, turned the theater into the Fillmore East, which became a mecca for music fans. Among the acts that played at the Fillmore East before it closed in 1971 were B. B. King, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and the Allman Brothers.
During the 1980's, the building was refurbished as the Saint, which for eight years drew crowds of several thousand gay dancers a night. And earlier this decade, there were plans to turn the empty structure into a six-screen movie theater. But that project went into bankruptcy.
The Hudson Companies bought the property for $1.6 million in 1995 from its mortgage holder, the National Bank of Canada. "We believed the East Village was turning around," resulting in a demand for more rentals, said Mr. Bell, who recalled attending a concert at the Fillmore.
A few groups rallied unsuccessfully to save the building for conversion to a recording studio or other performance use. Now, only the theater's Second Avenue entrance has been retained as part of a four-story commercial building that the Hudson Companies sold to Emigrant Savings Bank. A bank branch occupies the one-time theater lobby. The rest of the theater was razed to make way for the new apartment building.
It joins a few rental projects, including the 30-unit Information Building at 42-46 Avenue A at East Third Street, that have sprung up in recent years in the East Village. And the old Anderson Theater, at 66 Second Avenue between Third and Fourth Streets, is being developed into 98 apartments.
Mr. Bell said monthly rents at Hudson East are expected to be $1,400 to $2,500 for the market-rate apartments. Rents for the low-income units will be $332 to $510. Leasing is to start in July.
A plaque will be placed at the building's entrance telling passers-by of the storied night spots that once occupied the site -- despite the fact, Mr. Bell said, that the people who will rent apartments here will probably be too young to remember them.

HEADLINE: Cheddi Jagan, Guyana's Founder, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Cheddi B. Jagan, the firebrand who led Guyana to independence and was one of the Caribbean's most contentious political leaders for half a century, died yesterday in Washington, where he had been hospitalized after a heart attack. He was 78.
Dr. Jagan had undergone heart surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital after being flown to the United States on Feb. 15. 
 A dentist by training, Dr. Jagan rode the aspirations of Guyana's downtrodden Indian majority to power at a young age. But he was also a Marxist-Leninist of the pro-Soviet mold, which led to clashes with Churchill, who thought him a Communist puppet, and John F. Kennedy, who feared he aspired to install a "second Cuba" on the northern coast of South America.
Both those confrontations ended badly, with Dr. Jagan losing the post of Prime Minister to which he had been elected. But his popularity in his small country never faded, and he returned to power in 1992, nearly three decades after Washington engineered his ouster, with a softened outlook of his own and, ironically, the support of the United States.
Prime Minister Samuel Hinds, 53, was sworn in to succeed Mr. Jagan until elections can be held, probably this year. Mr. Hinds proclaimed six days of official mourning for "the greatest son and patriot that has ever walked this land."
Cheddi Jagan was born on March 22, 1918, on a sugar plantation near Port Mourant, in the eastern part of what was then British Guiana. His grandparents had migrated there from India as indentured laborers, and his father worked as the foreman of a work crew on the estate, giving the boy early exposure to poverty and exploitation.
The eldest of 11 children, he studied first at his village school, which was the extent of the education available to most young Indians at that time. But his parents made considerable financial sacrifices in order to send him to secondary school in the capital, Georgetown, where he excelled as a student, debater and cricket batsman.
At the age of 18, armed with his family's $500 life savings, he enrolled at Howard University in Washington, and entered the pre-medical program, majoring in dentistry. To help meet expenses, he worked as an elevator operator and, during the summers, as a patent medicine salesman in Harlem, experiences he would later say taught him bitter lessons about racism and inequality in capitalist societies.
By 1943, he had graduated from the Northwestern University Dental School in Chicago, where he met the American woman who became his wife and chief political partner and adviser. Janet Rosenberg was a student nurse active in left-wing causes, and she encouraged his interest in political science, economics, sociology and philosophy.
The couple returned to Georgetown, with Dr. Jagan dividing his energies between his dental practice and labor organizing, becoming a leader of the sugar, rice and wood workers' unions. In 1947, he was elected to the British Guiana assembly, and in 1950 he and his wife founded the People's Progressive Party, the first modern political organization in the colony.
Elections held under a new constitution providing for universal suffrage and increased home rule resulted in Dr. Jagan being elected chief minister in April 1953, at the age of 35. But his fondness for Marxist oratory and a program that called for sweeping social and economic reforms quickly aroused the suspicion of Churchill, who was serving his last term as Prime Minister, and six months later London sent troops and warships to depose him, charging that Dr. Jagan and his party "were completely under the control of a Communist clique."
Dr. Jagan responded with a civil disobedience campaign modeled on the one led by Mohandas K. Gandhi against British rule in India, but he was quickly arrested and jailed for six months. Nonetheless, his party again emerged triumphant in elections 1957, and both Dr. Jagan and his wife won Cabinet posts.
In 1961, the party fared even better, and Dr. Jagan (pronounced to rhyme with pagan) was sworn in as Prime Minister, vowing to achieve independence from Britain and install a socialist economy. That platform had the unwavering support of the colony's long-suffering Indian majority, but at the height of the cold war, Dr. Jagan's enthusiasm for the Cuban revolution of Fidel Castro and his threats to turn to the Soviet Union for aid immediately made him suspect to the United States.
"Events had convinced us that Jagan, though perhaps not a disciplined Communist, had that kind of deep, pro-Communist emotion which only sustained experience with Communism could cure," Arthur M. Schlesinger, the historian who was a special assistant for Latin American affairs to President Kennedy, wrote in his 1965 book "A Thousand Days." Dr. Jagan "was unquestionably some sort of a Marxist," he added, but also was "plainly the most popular leader in British Guiana."
Soon after Dr. Jagan's return to Georgetown, the Central Intelligence Agency undertook a destabilization campaign against him. United States Government documents that only came to light in the 1990's indicate that Washington was behind much of the Guyanese labor unrest, sabotage and disinformation efforts that led to race riots between East Indians and blacks that left nearly 100 dead.
The United States also pressured Britain to delay Guyana's independence until constitutional changes could be carried out to make it more difficult for Dr. Jagan to retain power. Although Dr. Jagan's party led the voting in elections in 1964, two opposition parties formed a coalition government that was headed by Forbes Burnham, a black lawyer who had once been an ally of Dr. Jagan but who split with him. Mr. Burnham later proved to be, as described by Mr. Schlesinger, "an opportunist, racist and demagogue intent only on personal power."
For nearly 30 years, Dr. Jagan led the oppositon. But once Mr. Burnham was in power, he installed what the State Department later described as a system of "wiretaps, mail interceptions and physical surveillance" designed to "monitor and intimidate political opponents," and won one rigged election after another until he died in office in 1985.
It was only in 1992, with Guyana near economic collapse as a result of years of misrule and corruption, that Dr. Jagan's years in the political wilderness ended. He won 54 percent of the vote, and once sworn in as President proved to be more mellow and less ideological than in the past.
Though Dr. Jagan said he had not abandoned his commitment to Marxism, he sought to attract foreign investors and embraced some free market policies. "I was a Gorbachev even before Gorbachev, in the sense of what we were doing and not adopting the traditional dogmas of Marxist parties," he said.
With the cold war over, Washington's attitude by then had also changed, and Dr. Jagan's relations with the Clinton Administration were cordial.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Jagan is survived by two children, Cheddi Jr. and Nadira, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Ruth Clark, 80, Pollster Who Changed an Industry

BYLINE: By KAREN FREEMAN By KAREN FREEMAN

 BODY:
Ruth Clark, a pollster who left her mark on the newspaper industry with a landmark newspaper study that encouraged editors to offer more information that readers could use in their daily lives and who helped define changing American attitudes on issues from the political to the personal, died on Feb. 20 in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 80.
The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Andrew. 
 The newspaper study "Changing Needs of Changing Readers," published in 1979, had "an electrifying effect on the news business," said Lee Stinnett, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which commissioned it in an effort to assess why circulation was declining.
The concept, which came to be called "news you can use," appealed to editors nationwide as they experimented with reports on family issues and other articles of a type that they began to refer to as soft news.
Mrs. Clark was also widely known for directing many of the surveys that defined American public opinion during a time of great social and political turmoil in the 1970's, and she was part of the team that introduced exit polls into American politics and journalism.
She had no formal training in marketing or polling. She learned the business on her own, starting as a door-to-door questioner and gradually rising as a survey designer for marketing companies and eventually to prominent positions in the industry. She was a vice president at Louis Harris & Associates in the 1960's, and she was a senior vice president at Yankelovich, Skelly & White until 1983, when she left to start her own firm, Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo.
Arthur H. White, vice chairman of Yankelovich Partners, said that in her surveys Mrs. Clark always made sure she included the opinions of all segments of American society, not just those of the economically comfortable or affluent, because of her concerns for the downtrodden.
Born Ruth Fine in New York City, Mrs. Clark graduated from Hunter College in 1936. The following year, she married Joseph Clark, who later became the foreign editor of The Daily Worker.
The Clarks moved to the Soviet Union in 1950 but became disillusioned with what they saw there, returning to the United States in 1953, Andrew Clark said. Mr. Clark publicly renounced the Soviet system and left The Daily Worker in 1957.
Mrs. Clark entered the field of market research as an interviewer, going door to door and asking opinions about commercial products, often accompanied by her infant son.
But in 1960, she was ready to move up. She obtained a job with Lou Harris that kept her in the marketing survey segment of the business at first. In 1964, she was part of the Harris team that conducted an exit poll for CBS News in the tightly contested California Republican primary between Nelson A. Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater.
On the basis of the poll's results, Mr. Harris called the race for Mr. Goldwater. He said the two next weeks until the official vote tallies were complete was "the loneliest time of my entire political career." But the official results proved the Harris team right.
Mrs. Clark got a chance to address political issues more broadly when she moved to Yankelovich, Skelly & White around 1970. She was in charge of the firm's public opinion research, and she proved to be adept at turning out high-quality surveys that newspapers and magazines could get into print quickly, Mr. White said.
A survey for the American Cancer Society helped persuade the organization to focus on encouraging nonsmokers to stand up for their rights, said John H. Bartolomeo, a partner in her firm, who also worked with her in the 1970's.
"She told them that she had picked up an undercurrent of militancy among nonsmokers," Mr. Bartolomeo said, "and she told them that the most important thing they could do would be to encourage that militancy."
He said that Mrs. Clark, who did not smoke, "told me once that she considered that the most important thing she had ever done."
In 1983, Mrs. Clark's daughter Judith, who was in the radical Weather Underground, was convicted of helping to rob a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y. In that incident in 1981 two police officers and a guard were killed. Judith Clark was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.
At Yankelovich and at Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo, Mrs. Clark conducted market surveys for many media companies, including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune.
"Changing Needs of Changing Readers," which Mrs. Clark updated in 1984, was a small study but it helped to change an industry, Mr. Stinnett said. Her influence on newspapers can be seen today in the creation of life style sections, consumer news and entertainment guides published by many newspapers as well as lists of resources for readers that often accompany feature articles.
Besides her son, of Portland, Ore., and her daughter, Mrs. Clark is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1988.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Rise 2.5%, and Joblessness Gauge Falls

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Orders placed with American factories rose 2.5 percent in January, the Commerce Department said today, while a Labor Department report showed more strength than expected in the labor market.
The rise in factory orders brought them to a record $323.2 billion and was the first increase in three months. December's decline was revised to 1.5 percent, from 1.3 percent. Analysts had expected the January report to show a 2.1 percent gain. 
 January's manufacturing strength was driven by the largest increase in orders for big-ticket goods since September. Factory inventories, meantime, increased one-tenth of a percent after having decreased three-tenths of a percent in December.
"The bottom line is the manufacturing sector still has plenty of momentum," Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said before the report was issued today.
In its report the Labor Department said the number of workers applying for the first time for state unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 6,000, to a seasonally adjusted 310,000. The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, declined to 310,000 -- the lowest level in almost eight years -- from 313,500 the previous week.
"These tight conditions in labor markets are going to finally start feeding into the wage pressures," said Richard Koss, an economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a New York investment advisory firm. That in turn could push the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned Congress again Wednesday that a pre-emptive rate increase might be needed to forestall accelerating inflation.
On Friday the Government is expected to report growth in February's payrolls.
"Today's report is mildly bearish," Douglas Porter, senior economist at the investment firm Nesbitt Burns Inc., said of the jobless claims statistics. "This type of low level of claims is consistent with quite strong job growth."
As for factory orders, the overall 2.5 percent increase was unchanged when even the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment was included. Excluding the defense industry, orders climbed 3.1 percent.
By category, orders for durable goods, big-ticket items made to last three or more years, advanced 4 percent after having decreased 1.7 percent in December. In an advance report on Feb. 27, the Commerce Department said durable goods orders increased 3.6 percent in January. Orders for nondurable goods like food and clothing increased seven-tenths of a percent after falling 1.2 percent in December.

Treasury Prices Decline as Investors Await Data on Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, with investors showing clear anxiety ahead of today's report on employment figures.
Economic statistics released earlier this week have all been on a one- way street heading higher, and yesterday's data were no exception. 
 Factory orders during January rose 2.5 percent -- somewhat higher than expected-- led by new orders for durable goods, which jumped 4 percent, an upward revision.
"Furthermore," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "the backlog of unfilled orders continues to climb, providing a base for future production."
Initial claims for state unemployment fell unexpectedly in the latest reporting week, and chain store sales were stronger than analysts had expected.
All eyes, of course, are now focused on today's labor market statistics, with traders worried that if those figures, too, show a robust economy, it could tip the scales toward a Fed rate increase on March 25, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets.
The 30-year bond dropped 20/32 , to a price of 9627/32 to yield 6.88 percent, up from 6.82 percent on Wednesday.
Mr. Fine said that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had made it clear during the second round of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the House on Wednesday "that risks, not forecasts, will drive monetary policy, and that the F.O.M.C. would tighten pre-emptively to prevent the economy from overheating and causing an acceleration in inflation conditions."
The recent downward trend in initial unemployment claims suggests the unemployment rate will drop to 5.3 percent or even 5.2 percent, Mr. Fine said, while the index of aggregate hours worked should bounce back quite noticeably following its surprising plunge in January.
But the market's attention will be centered on the payroll number. Although the range of projections for the change in nonfarm payrolls is wide, extending from a modest gain of 125,000 to a robust surge of 350,000, the consensus view is for an increase of 225,000.
"If market projections are close to reality," Mr. Fine said, "the upside risk that Greenspan alluded to will certainly have increased, and the bond market will become even more wary of a Fed tightening at the next F.O.M.C. meeting."
Volume was thin as many buyers, having already positioned themselves, moved to the sidelines. One reason was the decline in the unemployment claims, which drew attention to the tightness of the labor market. Initial claims decreased 6,000, to 310,000 last week, with the four-week moving average dropping to an eight-year low of 310,000, from 313,500 a week earlier.
David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: "The market is trying to get in front of the Fed at this point. The lows did not bring out more sellers."
In the corporate market, the Hershey Foods Corporation led a number of companies that sold $1.2 billion of debt yesterday, locking in rates in case yields move higher after the employment report.
Hershey priced $150 million of 10-year notes through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company at a price to yield 6.992 percent.
The notes are noncallable by the company, and are rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's, with a yield spread over a comparable Treasury of about 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Leads, but New York's Economy Doesn't Follow

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
Over the last year, New York City's unemployment rate has climbed even as Wall Street was cheering repeated record highs. Brokers earning seven-figure bonuses shopped for summer homes while about one in 11 people looked for jobs.
Through much of New York's history, those kinds of contradictions did not occur. The economic rule of thumb was that when Wall Street celebrated, New York celebrated. But there has been a fundamental shift in that chemistry in the 1990's. Because the city, the state and the securities industry are not producing jobs in ways that they used to, the good news of Wall Street has not been enough to bring overall prosperity. 
 Economists say that this new and still evolving pattern is more volatile, is less equitable in the distribution of wealth, and may be unable over the long term to produce the kinds of entry-level jobs on which New York has historically depended.
That represents a major change. Since the days of the trusts and the railroad barons, Wall Street has been both a barometer of New York's economic health and a powerful job engine. What has happened in the 1990's, economists say, is that those two historical roles largely fell away. Despite the blizzard of bonuses and profits and taxes, the fortunes of the industry and the fortunes of New York diverged.
Through most of the 1980's in particular, securities industry profits acted like a lever on the economy: in most years when profits were up, the rate of growth of personal income in New York State surpassed the national average, and in years when profits declined, New York was dragged down and trailed the nation. It was a calculus that echoed the industry's roots in lower Manhattan and its power as an employer.
Since the 1987 market crash, and particularly in the last few years, however, the lever has simply not worked. Securities industry profits reached record levels, but state growth in personal income still lagged.
In short, Wall Street's health is no longer enough to compensate for erosion in other areas. The windfall of tax revenues that washed through the city and state budgets made politicians smile, but was inadequate to the task of uplifting the overall economy.
"When I look at Wall Street, I don't think of it as a major growth sector for employment," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "I look at high-paying jobs, and income, but not so much employment. We're going to want to look elsewhere for a job engine."
Another result of changes in the city and in the securities industry is a heightened disparity of wealth. Between 1989 and 1995, according to the State Comptroller's office, total real wages for New York City's 3.2 million workers went up 8.4 percent when adjusted for inflation. But the majority of those gains came from one place: Wall Street.
With the securities-industry contribution stripped out, wages in New York rose a paltry 3.8 percent in those six years. If the securities industry and banking are both removed, wages rose only 2.5 percent after inflation.
In this new economic mix, contrary indicators have become common. Just this week, the state reported that in January, New York City's unemployment rate reached its highest level in three years. The following day, the City Comptroller's office said that the city had created more jobs in January than in any month for a decade.
H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, said his central worry was that New York's fortunes rest on a narrower and narrower economic base that does not, in the end, provide for all New Yorkers.
"New York's economic problem is the creation of a wide variety of jobs," he said. "We have to look to other sectors where we will get a wider job penetration."
The forces that underlie these changes are complex and still evolving. Certainly, the health of the securities industry as a whole is not in question. What has changed is the mix of jobs, and New York's greater dependence on them.
In the 1990's, perhaps more than at any other time in its history, Wall Street work means white-collar work. Ten years after the 1987 market crash, there are fewer midlevel, entry-level and union jobs, and more salaried workers eligible for bonuses. Some firms have changed nearly everything about whom they employ in the city, what kind of work they do, and what they're paid.
At the same time, continued declines in manufacturing, government and banking have left the city with a smaller work force, which is ever more reliant on Wall Street.
In 1987, for example, the nearly 163,000 people employed in New York City securities firms made up a total of 5.1 percent of the private sector work force and earned 12.6 percent of the total private sector wages, according to state figures. By 1996, industry employment had fallen to 150,000, but that accounted for 5.3 percent of a smaller work force and 16.9 percent of the wages.
Certainly, some elements of the new dynamic are unequivocally good for New York. Stock trading volume is higher than ever. The city has solidified its place as a center of global finance. Soaring stock prices have created wealth and willingness to spend money that has spilled over into retailing and real estate.
After shedding more than 30,000 jobs in the city between 1987 and 1991, the securities industry has rebuilt itself: hiring about 20,000 people in the years since. New York State received $1 billion in taxes from the industry last year.
And some of the changes could be positive in the long term. More high-end jobs means that New York is headquarters for the industry's glamour and brain power. Economists say upper-level jobs may be more stable, too: Wall Street usually cuts from the bottom in bad times.
But the sunny headlines about the Dow Jones average or budget-saving tax infusions have also obscured the less visible changes that leave the future of the regional economy and the industry much less certain.
Between 1987 and 1995, for example, New York State lost more than 13,000 securities industry jobs, while other states gained 85,000 jobs. In that same period the state's national share of securities jobs fell from 38 percent to 30 percent, as New York became less and less the center of the universe for the business.
Three major forces were at work, the first being that this decade is the era of the mutual fund investor, and the mutual fund companies are mostly not in New York. New technologies, partly driven by higher stock-trading volumes, have also kept labor needs down, while cost control pressures have pushed firms to relocate workers.
Entry-level industry jobs familiar since the days of Rockefeller and Morgan have disappeared. When the $10.2 billion merger between Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Discover was announced last month, for example, some of the first people to hear about it were the messengers and runners who shuttle documents through the organizations.
But those workers are not employees of either firm. They work for Choice Courier Systems, a contractor that does in-house delivery and mailroom services. Morgan Stanley got rid of its 60 in-house messengers two years ago. Dean Witter signed on with Choice in January.
Those kinds of outside arrangements -- common across corporate America -- clearly create new opportunities, but they also eliminate entry-level spots from which people might once have been promoted. Choice's founder, president and chief executive officer, Edward Katz, conceded that the health benefits for his employees were probably less generous than a giant Wall Street firm might offer. But the lower cost is also largely why he is doing well, he said.
For New York politicians the implications are delicate. The city and state have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years wooing and subsidizing Wall Street firms that threatened to leave the city. The apparently growing gap between rich and poor has become, at the same time, a centerpiece of the debate about government's role. In the adminstration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, caution reigns.
"I don't think you can define it either as a positive or a negative," said Fran Reiter, the city's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning, of the changes in the securities industry. "It just is."
Ms. Reiter said that specific efforts were under way to try to bring back some lower-wage securities jobs, but that it was also important for the city to wean itself away from dependence on one industry.
Some securities companies are also nervous. A spokesman at one large investment firm in New York, declining to comment on the record, said that the firm did not want to alienate New Yorkers by admitting that the growth of jobs was faster in areas of the firm outside New York.
He also did not want to alienate people in those other places by giving the impression that New York gets only the highest-paying jobs. But as a generalization, the spokesman said, both trends are true.
At Smith Barney, the transformation of jobs has occurred entirely within the city. In two years, the firm has created about 150 new technical jobs in computer programming, technical support and communications. It also eliminated about the same number of "mundane clerical functions," said Melvin Taub, a senior executive vice president.
Mr. Taub said that some of the displaced clerks got training and made the transition or found other jobs, so that no layoffs resulted. The new jobs are more highly paid than the old ones, he said, and are all eligible for bonuses as well.
At Bowne & Company, a 222-year-old financial printing company, the changes are even more stark. Ten years ago, the firm's offices on Hudson Street had clattering presses and lots of union jobs. It was a place where prospectuses and legal filings got printed.
That's all gone now. During the recession, when many of the company's competitors went out of business, Bowne retooled. Its printing is now done in Secaucus; the staff has been upgraded. The Federal Securities and Exchange Commission changed to electronic filing.
Between 1987 and 1996, the number of white-collar occupations at Bowne's New York office went up 127 percent while blue-collar positions fell by 69 percent. The company used to recruit at the New York High School of Graphic Communication Arts. That just won't do now, said David L. Rosenstein, a company spokesman.
"They couldn't do this kind of work," Mr. Rosenstein said. "Our trainees are college graduates."

HEADLINE: Retailers' Sales Gained at High And Low Ends In February

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
If there was ever a month that told the story of Americans' divergent shopping habits, February was it.
Retail same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, were strong last month, particularly among two sectors of the industry: the extremely expensive and the rock-bottom priced. 
 General merchandise stores like Dollar General and Family Dollar, which cater to low-income shoppers, and high-end shops like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, stood out along with retailers like Ross Stores, which offer clothing bargains for anyone willing to hunt for them.
Retailers in the middle of the market, with the greatest number of stores serving the most overwhelmed consumers, continue to struggle, as they have for several quarters.
While most retail experts agree that there are still far too many stores for far too few shoppers, economists and analysts also say that the thrill of a bargain hunt has become a deep-seated part of the American shopping culture, even as wealthy people drop thousands of dollars on imported cigars and Armani dresses.
According to the Goldman, Sachs & Company same-store sales index, which compares stores open at least a year, retail sales in February were up 3.8 percent compared with figures from a year earlier. In February 1996, they had risen 4.9 percent.
Same-store sales gains had been strong in February 1996 for many retailers largely because of huge sales for unsold Christmas merchandise and because many shoppers had been snowed in during January. Still, stores that enjoyed healthy same-store sales gains this year stood out as particularly successful because of the comparison with a strong month a year earlier.
Among discounters, the Consolidated Stores Corporation, which is based in Wilmington, Del., reported same-store sales increases of 9.1 percent, compared with a 10.6 percent gain in February 1996. The Dollar General Corporation gained 11.1 percent, compared with last year's 14.1 percent gain. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gained 6.7 percent in sales, and the Kmart Corporation gained 3.9 percent.
Wal-Mart also said yesterday that it would buy back an additional $2 billion of stock over the next 12 to 18 months and increase its quarterly dividend 29 percent.
Off-price stores that sell designer goods at a discount continue to do well. Ross Stores reported a 14 percent gain, and the TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, reported a 5 percent gain.
The strong sales among discount stores show that American shoppers will go out of their way for a deal, some analysts said. "Value consciousness first became apparent in the late 80's and is not going away," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "There is enough wealth being created to drive high-end retailing, but Joe Six-Pack is still shopping for value. He would rather buy low and put some money in a mutual fund or something."
If the results at department and specialty stores were any indication, Americans have satisfied their desire for full-price clothing after a quarter of restocking their closets last year. Federated Department Stores reported a mere 2.2 percent gain in same-store sales for February, and the Dayton Hudson Corporation squeaked in with a 1.2 percent gain, though its Target discount division gained 6 percent in sales. Ann Taylor lost 1.2 percent, the Limited sales were down 2 percent, and sales at the Gap Inc. and Talbots Inc. were flat.
The exceptions among department stores were the J. C. Penney Company, which gained 11.4 percent, largely because of huge promotions, and luxury retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, a unit of Saks Holdings Inc., which gained 6.4 percent, and Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General, which reported a 4.5 percent gain.
"In terms of apparel," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, "we are coming off of four straight quarters of accelerating sales. So the apparel cycle may have peaked or may be peaking and the rest of the year may be only so-so."
Sales of consumer electronics continue to be weak: The Best Buy Company lost 3 percent in same-store sales, and Circuit City Stores reported a 4 percent loss.
Good sales last month were not generally a result of drastic markdowns, some analysts said, because retailers have generally kept their inventories tight for the last six months. As a result, the earnings outlook for the first quarter may be good.
"This was not a promotional month," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "This gives us a good lead-in for the first quarter."
Other analysts and economists were less enthusiastic, largely because the issues that have dogged the industry, namely oversupply, continue.
"We anticipate that investors may jump on the sector based on the same-store sales, only to be disappointed in the second quarter when the underlying weakness is more evident," wrote Peter N. Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon, Read & Company. "As we have said many times before, the basic economic scenario and secular changes which have stymied retail growth for several years remain."

HEADLINE: It's Showdown Time on Wall St.;
For Brokerage Houses, a New Class of Suitor Rides In

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
When executives from Citicorp and American Express met secretly late last year to discuss merging their businesses, it sent a strong message to the investment bankers at Morgan Stanley that the financial world's heavies were about to descend on Wall Street.
Citicorp, which was advised by Morgan Stanley in its exploratory discussions with the American Express Company, pulled back from the deal, at least for the moment. But even though those merger discussions did not go anywhere, executives say, they spurred Morgan Stanley Group and Dean Witter, Discover & Company to move quickly to forge their own $10.5 billion merger, which they announced last month. The two are not alone. Rather than leave themselves vulnerable to the big American and foreign banks on the prowl or one of the large corporations that want a piece of the action, a number of Wall Street firms are circling the wagons, too. 
 Paine Webber has stepped up its search for an asset management firm, in part because size may help it evade some hungry predator. Salomon Brothers signed an innovative marketing deal with Fidelity Investments, the FMR unit, intended to broaden its equity franchise through better access to private investors. Most Wall Street firms are also zealously encouraging their employees to buy their own shares, hoping that a lot of insider ownership will increase employee motivation and also give their firms more protection from unwanted would-be acquirers on the prowl. And some executives at Dean Witter and Morgan Stanley are still jumpy, fearing that another party, perhaps even American Express, might try to derail the union with a more lucrative offer.
If Wall Streeters are going to make any deals for their own firms, says Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company who covers the brokerage industry, their first choice is one of their own. "These targets," he said, "would much more prefer to be matched up with a like company in a like culture."
There also is a palpable concern about the damage that unwanted gunslingers from outside the tight-knit world of Wall Street may do if they come blundering into the securities business.
"The history of acquisitions in the brokerage industry by outsiders has been so bad," said Regina Dolan, Paine Webber's chief financial officer. The General Electric Company, for example, had an awful experience with Kidder, Peabody & Company, the Wall Street firm it sold to Paine Webber in late 1994.
As the barriers that once kept banks, insurance and the brokerage business apart crumble, the bankers and insurers are riding into town. the BankAmerica Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Nationsbank Corporation, American Insurance Group, Travelers Group and foreign behemoths like Dresdner Bank, the Swiss Bank Corporation and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, a unit of HSBC Holdings, are already scouting around.
Their prime targets are likely to be attractive smaller firms on Wall Street. Among them are Alex. Brown & Sons; Bear, Stearns & Company; Oppenheimer Group; Legg Mason Inc. and Lehman Brothers.
But other firms could also fall victim, including some that already have ties to outsiders. These include Prudential Securities, Salomon Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. At the very least, big financial institutions want to cherry-pick Wall Street's best talent to build up their own investment banking and brokerage operations.
Some past Wall Street alliances have not worked well, leaving a cautionary legacy for those now contemplating defensive maneuvers. Shearson-Lehman, a brokerage combination tried by American Express fell short of expectations and ended with Lehman being spun off in 1993 and Shearson being acquired by Travelers.
But while "there won't be an avalanche" of mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street, says Milton R. Berlinski, a partner at Goldman, Sachs who advises big financial firms, he sees another round of deals -- perhaps half a dozen in the next year or two -- as all but inevitable. Several are likely to be mergers aimed, in part, at building up enough critical mass to avoid unwanted takeovers.
What has made Wall Street particularly vulnerable to commercial banks that are eager to expand their reach is that the Federal Reserve has relaxed its rules governing what they can own. Banks can now own securities operations that account for up to 25 percent of their revenues, up from 10 percent last year.
For the first time since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act separated the banking and securities businesses, big banks can, in theory, buy virtually all but the largest Wall Street brokerage houses. Some banks, eager to recapture a portion of the funds that have leaked from low-interest savings accounts into more attractive mutual funds and brokerage accounts, would clearly like to.
At Chase Manhattan, for example, a recent management shuffle gave James B. Lee Jr. and Donald H. Layton joint responsibility for running its investment bank. That left William B. Harrison Jr., a vice chairman and director, free to focus on potential acquisitions in the brokerage business, executives at that bank say. In some crystal ball gazing research published last month, Dean P. Eberling, an analyst at Prudential Securities, speculated that Chase might eventually acquire the merged Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter.
In recent months, Chase has also hired several senior executives from Salomon, including Mark C. Davis, a takeover specialist, and John P. Lipsky, who is now Chase's chief economist. From Donaldson, Lufkin, the bank also picked up Wilfred A. Finnegan, who heads Chase's high-yield bond business, and from Furman, Selz, John Steinhardt, who leads its American securities business.
This kind of interest in the brokerage business has investors hopping. The share price of Donaldson, Lufkin, for example, rose more than 7 percent on Feb. 10 on speculation that it might be sold. The firm, which is 73 percent owned by the Equitable Companies and Axa, its French parent, said it was happy with its current ownership.
"I think people are rotating among the securities stocks," said Sam G. Liss, a managing director and analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, "trying to speculate about where the action is coming next."
Many potential takeover targets, though, remain deeply suspicious of the outsiders that are eying them so covetously. Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, cautioned in an interview that Wall Street is a business that is largely foreign to commercial banks. Compensation in the securities business, he said, is higher and much more erratic. And talented traders, brokers and investment bankers, by far the most valuable asset in most brokerage firms, can readily walk out the door and find jobs elsewhere if they are unhappy.
Something like that happened, for instance, after Credit Suisse began acquiring First Boston in the late 1980's. Its record is at best mixed, as the firm has been beset by defections and considerable in-fighting.
Everyone involved is aware that several past commercial banking forays into the securities business have failed miserably. When Britain deregulated its securities industry in 1986, American banking companies like Chase and Citicorp ambitiously gobbled up local firms, buying some of the best-known names in the London brokerage business.
Citicorp acquired both Scrimgeour Kemp Gee and Vickers da Costa, two established London brokerage houses, which it combined in hopes of bringing together a strong corporate finance business with an envied Asian equities franchise. But much of the talent was offended at Citicorp's commercial banking culture and its rough attempts to build an international securities business virtually overnight. Several longtime employees of Vickers da Costa later gathered to establish Peregrine, an investment bank based in Hong Kong.
Some foreign banks, now trying to build investment banks of their own on Wall Street, are already discovering just how protean Wall Street can be. Deutsche Bank A.G., the German banking giant, for example, has been trying to construct an investment bank in the Morgan Stanley mold, hiring whole teams of bankers from that firm, as well as from Merrill Lynch & Company and Goldman, Sachs. As soon as Deutsche Bank had spent billions on the project, Morgan Stanley itself started to metamorphose, first by buying the Van Kampen/American Capital mutual fund family, then by merging with Dean Witter.
In this fast-changing milieu, it is not clear which strategies are likely to prove most successful. But Wall Street firms like Salomon and Donaldson, Lufkin, which deal mostly with institutional customers, are clearly interested in building better access to the private investor. That strategy was advanced by some influential recent research from Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, showing the profit margins in traditional investment banking and securities trading businesses are declining, while returns on the dwindling number of Main Street businesses with nationwide branch networks remained strong.
"The institutional firms are walking around playing musical chairs, eyeing the chairs carefully, so if the music stops there'll be a chair for them," said Paul V. Scura, the head of investment banking at Prudential Securities.
The brokerage firms may not have a lot of time to make their choices. Their potential suitors at the big banks and insurance companies have fat wallets these days, and some are prepared to dip deeply into their capital to offer prices that may be hard to refuse. And if the stock market drops significantly, pulling down the market values of securities firms, that could be just the opening many banks are waiting for.
Even the biggest firms on Wall Street could be vulnerable. Merrill Lynch, the largest American brokerage firm in terms of capital until the Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter deal is completed and still the firm with the most extensive branch network and the broadest business, has about $16 billion in market capital. That is not much compared with Chase's $46 billion or the $58 billion at American Insurance Group, which has reportedly been sniffing around Merrill Lynch.
David K. Schafer, president of Schafer & Cullen, a New York investment adviser and mutual fund company, argues that the recent Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter merger "may be the trigger to a number of other moves." Mr. Schafer, whose funds have invested in Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, says that for bigger Wall Street firms, like Merrill and Goldman, Sachs, it is now a matter of "keeping up with the Morgan Stanleys."
Even Goldman, the only major private partnership and perhaps the most prized jewel in the Wall Street crown, may have to act. It lacks the Main Street distribution that Merrill has had for decades and that Morgan is about to obtain. Goldman's leaders, who declined to comment publicly on the matter, agreed privately that they might have to change but said no immediate decisions were necessary.
As for Merrill, it maintains that it has already built the Wall Street model for the 21st century, in part through its successful acquisitions years ago of White Weld and A. G. Becker. But many analysts expect that David H. Komanksy, its new chief executive, will want to make a big acquisition to secure once again his firm's claim to being No. 1 in the American and overseas securities business.
Mr. Komansky, of course, is mum about his specific plans. But he said that Merrill's "strategy is to be the leading financial management and advisory company for a broadly diverse global client base."
That will be achieved, he added, through "superior service, internal expansion and selective acquisitions."

On Wall Street, many firms are worried about the threat of takeover by gunslingers from banking, insurance, and other outside financial institutions. Here are several, with their stock price as of Jan. 31, shortly before the Dean Witter/Morgan Stanley deal was announced, and yesterday's close. The chart lists various firms mentioned in the text with information about the firm and stock prices as of Jan. 31 and March 6.
 
LEHMAN BROTHERS -- Midsize investment bank spun off by American Express in 1993. Once paired with Shearson, Lehman might eventually be snapped up by an ambitious commercial bank.
 
Jan 31: $31.625
March 6: $33.25
 
OPPENHEIMER -- Privately held investment bank. Has already negotiated to sell itself to peotential buyers, including foreign banks. No public shares.
 
DONALDSON, LUFKIN & JENRETTE -- Midsize institutional broker and merchant bank largely owned by an insurance company. Might be a perfect fit for a money-center bank like Bankers Trust.
Jan 31: $37.875
March 6: $43.75
 
BEAR, STEARNS -- High-paying trading firm with a sizable clearing operation for small brokers. Likely to sell if the price is right.
Jan 31: $30
March 6: $30.125
 
DEAN WITTER, DISCOVER -- Main Street broker, with highly profitable credit card operation. Merger agreement with Morgan Stanley kicked off wave of speculation about other potential Wall Street deals. After merger, the combined firm will, in capital, be the nation's largest broker, but it might still be vulnerable to future takeover.
Jan 31: $38.125
March 6: $40.625
 
MORGAN STANLEY -- Blueblood Wall Street investment house seeking to build global business. Plans to merge with Dean Witter but conflicts over cultural differences are likely.
Jan. 31: $57.125
March 6: $66.375
 
PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES -- Midsize retail broker owned by Prudential Insurance. Still tarnished by scandal over limited partnerships, Prudential may decide to unload its securities operation. No stock price.
 
PAINE WEBBER -- Midsize retail broker. Attractive target for bank or financial institution like GE Capital or American Express. Wants to but asset manager to make itself less vulnerable to takeover.
Jan. 31: $36
March 6: $34.50

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides and a Proposal to Build a Chinese Power Plant

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
For American companies eager to crack the vast but frustrating Chinese market, it was a big deal when Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown announced on a trade mission to China in 1994 that he had secured an agreement for the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans to help build a $1 billion power plant 250 miles north of Beijing.
"The public sector-private sector partnership envisioned by President Clinton is working well," Mr. Brown said at the time, hailing his department's willingness to use its muscle to pry open opportunities for American business abroad. 
 The deal collapsed, unheralded, six months after Mr. Brown's announcement, yet another victim of the political, economic and cultural difficulties that plague foreign companies trying to obtain a toehold in China.
China never bought the $450 million worth of parts and supplies from the United States that the deal called for, and Entergy never received its 20 percent, or $37.5 million stake, in the power plant, in Datong.
The project has another legacy. Entergy's partner in the project was the Lippo Group, the company controlled by the Riady family of Indonesia, which has been at the center of questions about whether the Clinton Administration traded access and influence over policy for campaign contributions.
Around the time that the Commerce Department was working to win agreement on the deal from the Chinese Government, businesses controlled by the Riadys employed Webster L. Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General and a close friend of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Hubbell had left office to face criminal charges that stemmed from the Whitewater investigation. The Whitewater independent counsel is now examining Mr. Hubbell's 1994 income to determine whether his employment by the Riadys and others with ties to Mr. Clinton were intended to discourage him from cooperating with investigators looking into the Clintons' finances.
Mr. Hubbell, who recently completed an 18-month prison sentence, has denied that his employment after leaving the Administration played any role in his dealings with prosecutors during the case. And Mr. Clinton has said he does not think that there was any improper influence on Mr. Hubbell or the White House from the Riadys.
Entergy, which also owns the electric utility that serves Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas, has been among the most active American companies in China. It is involved in another power plant in Taishan, in Guangdong Province in southern China, and it is considering other investments.
A spokesman for Entergy, Patrick Sweeney, said the Commerce Department's involvement in the deal had been minimal. He said the company had been ready to sign the formal memorandum of understanding before the trade mission led by Mr. Brown in August 1994, but held the signing ceremony with Chinese officials during the mission because the chairman of Entergy, Edwin A. Lupberger, had signed up to travel with Mr. Brown.
"The trade mission was coincidental," Mr. Sweeney said. "There was nothing that happened because of the trade mission that would not have happened anyway."
Commerce Department officials said the Entergy project had not been high on Mr. Brown's priority list on the trip, which centered on trying to help bigger companies like the Chrysler Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Entergy's involvement in the failed Datong project dates from well before Mr. Hubbell announced his resignation from the Justice Department on March 14, 1994.
Entergy said it signed a nonbinding agreement to work on the project that month, and Commerce Department officials said the nonbinding pact was reached a month earlier.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department, Jim Desler, said the American Embassy in Beijing had provided some help to Entergy before Mr. Brown's trip. But Mr. Desler said he did not know whether the assistance began before the signing of the nonbinding accord in March 1994.
Mr. Brown died in a plane crash in Bosnia a year ago.
Within months of the signing, the deal went awry. Mr. Sweeney said the main problem was that not enough water was available to cool the plant, causing the project to collapse for engineering reasons. Commerce Department officials said their understanding was that the Chinese authorities did not feel that the deal would be profitable.
"The project is dead," Mr. Sweeney said, "and as far as Entergy is concerned it's dead for good."

HEADLINE: 2 Newspapers Each Are Winners Of 2 Polk Awards for Journalism

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Two newspapers, The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, each won 2 of the 11 George Polk awards for journalism announced yesterday by Long Island University.
The New York Times won an award for economics reporting for its series "The Downsizing of America." And one of its correspondents, John F. Burns, won the foreign reporting award for his articles on the takeover of Kabul, Afghanistan, by Taliban, the militant Islamic group. 
 The Los Angeles Times won the prize for political reporting for "Money From Asia," about suspect contributions from Asian sources to the Democratic National Committee. The paper also won the cultural reporting award, for Chuck Philips's articles about the inner workings of America's $12 billion music industry.
A reporter for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Elizabeth Marchak, won the award for national reporting for her articles raising questions about the Federal Government's handling of air safety violations. Her series of articles, "The F.A.A. and Valujet Airlines," focused on the Federal Aviation Administration's weak response to its inspectors' reports on unsafe aircraft, improper maintenance and inadequate training at Valujet and other cut-rate airlines.
The awards, which are administered by Long Island University, were established in 1949 in memory of George W. Polk, a CBS correspondent who was killed in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece.
Yesterday, Bryan Acohido of The Seattle Times won a Polk award for transportation reporting for "Safety at Issue: the 737," a series linking questions about the rudder controls of Boeing 737 planes to several deadly crashes and the F.A.A.'s resistance to acknowledging the problem.
Honors for local reporting went to Kevin Collison of The Buffalo News, who linked the death of a teen-ager, run over on a highway while on her way to work at a shopping mall, to a policy denying access to city buses to discourage minority customers.
The prize for magazine reporting went to Anne-Marie Cusac of The Progressive for "Stunning Technology," which exposed the life-threatening dangers of security devices used in American prisons and exported to repressive foreign regimes.
These were other prizes:
 FOREIGN TELEVISION REPORTING: Christiane Amanpour and Anita Pratap of CNN for "Battle for Afghanistan," an examination of the armed struggle for control of the country, with revealing interviews of key figures in opposing camps.
NATIONAL TELEVISION REPORTING: Matt Meagher and Tim Peek of "Inside Edition" for "Door to Door Insurance," an undercover investigation of the exploitation of poor Americans by some insurers.
CRITICISM: Blair Kamin of The Chicago Tribune for an examination of issues in Chicago architecture that encouraged public debate and influenced its outcome.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen But Closes Lower vs. the Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday after a report on United States employment pointed to strong economic growth with little inflation.
"The strong employment report is buoying the dollar," said John Trammell, who helps manage a $100 million portfolio of global securities for A. Gary Shilling & Company, a money management firm. "The numbers mean continued strength in the economy, and that in turn should lead to a higher dollar." 
 The report showed that the economy added 339,000 jobs last month, more than most analysts expected. But the report also said that average hourly earnings rose just 3 cents, indicating little inflationary pressure. Stocks and bonds rallied on the report, helping to bolster the dollar.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 121.82 yen, up from 121.13 yen on Thursday. The dollar rose as high as 1.7210 German marks -- its fourth consecutive three-year high -- but retreated to 1.7145 marks, down from 1.7155 marks.
The dollar's weakness against the the mark came after a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, Ernst Welteke, said the dollar had risen far enough.
The dollar has gained 28 percent since bottoming out in March 1996 at 1.3455 marks, a postwar low.
"I would not be pleased if the dollar continued to rise at the same pace," Mr. Welteke said in an interview with the German news agency VWD. "We see the correction process as over."
The remarks led to speculation that the German central bank did not want the dollar to surpass 1.72 marks, said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Baring Capital Markets. "That's holding the dollar back a bit."
The dollar was also restrained against the mark by the mark's rise against the yen. Transactions involving marks and yen are typically executed using dollars.
The pound fell on speculation that Britain would refrain from raising interest rates. Talk of higher rates -- which would make pound-denominated deposits more attractive -- has bolstered the pound recently. In New York trading, the pound dropped to $1.6013, from $1.6155 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Take Hospitals Off the Dole

BYLINE: By Lloyd M. Krieger; Lloyd M. Krieger is a resident physician at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
I am a resident physician. My job is exciting and challenging. But it could be much improved with one simple change: Take me off the Government dole.
Through Medicare, hospitals receive about $100,000 each year for every resident they employ -- about $7 billion nationwide. As a resident, this subsidy pays my salary and defrays the costs of my training. But it also has bizarre effects that undermine my education, my ability to eventually find a good job, even my quality of life. 
 Many hospitals receive more money from the program than they actually need to cover the training. So residents are the cheapest possible hospital labor, and are asked to perform many non-medical tasks that ordinarily would be done by other personnel that the hospital must pay out of its own pocket.
As hospitals cut back in this age of cutthroat competition, these chores increase. That means residents work ever longer days but spend less of their time treating patients and learning skills from experienced doctors.
Residents are often asked to do paperwork for hospital bureaucracies and to fill out insurance forms. We transport patients to the radiology lab for studies or to the operating room. If nurses are busy, we turn patients in their beds to prevent bed sores. We are frequently asked to draw blood samples.
Such tasks -- which at non-teaching hospitals are usually done by clerks, nurses and orderlies -- do more than put a drain on our time. As residents have become a cash cow for hospitals, there has been incentive to bring in more and more of them. The result is that we are training too many young doctors, meaning that it will be much tougher for us to find work when we finish our residencies.
In New York State, Federal regulators have come up with a novel solution to ease the glut of new doctors: Pay hospitals not to train residents, just as those much-maligned agriculture subsidies pay farmers not to grow wheat. This is an interesting proposal, but it does not go far enough. Patients and the residents themselves would be better served by ending all Federal subsidies for training doctors.
If the Government stopped subsidizing residents, we could focus our energies solely on learning to be good doctors and on giving patients better care. Taxpayers would save billions of dollars. And, after some initial struggle, hospitals would be stronger for their independence from Federal handouts.
Who, then, would pay for resident training? The costs should be borne by insurers and managed-care programs whose patients benefit from the advanced care provided by teaching hospitals. Nearly 20 percent of hospital patients are treated with the latest and most sophisticated techniques and equipment, and almost all such work is done at teaching centers. These hospitals will simply have to charge more for their specialized services, either through a standard daily surcharge or through additional hourly billing for the specific services of resident doctors.
Yes, insurers and managed-care plans would balk at first. But they would have little choice but to pay up. As competition in the managed-care industry matures, health maintenance organizations are finding that they have to provide coverage for the newest and best treatments if their customers demand it.
Hospitals would probably struggle at first without subsidized cheap labor. Managed-care plans and insurers might see their short-term profits fall. My salary would undoubtedly go down.
But in the long run medical centers would be stronger, doctors would be better trained, and patients would receive higher quality care.

HEADLINE: Credit Unions' Outdated Tax Breaks

 BODY:
A relic of legislation from the 1930's makes the nation's credit unions, which started out as mutual societies among members who shared a common employer or neighborhood, exempt from Federal taxes. The idea behind the tax break was to give a boost to working folks who wanted to escape the clutches of their local bankers by forming their own savings and lending groups.
For the credit unions that have remained relatively small, the tax break can be justified as a reasonable way to help a group of closely affiliated, perhaps low-income people provide themselves financial support through cooperation. Indeed, the tax break offsets part of the financial disadvantage of small size. 
 But many credit unions have expanded well beyond the 1930's notion of a "common bond." Some include more than 100,000 members and control billions of dollars in assets. They offer a full range of financial products, including mortgage loans, insurance and savings accounts. Their members earn above-average incomes. These large credit unions are just like banks.
That is the rub. Bankers are crying foul because the credit unions use the tax break to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates. The bankers demand an end to the tax break. For the large credit unions, the bankers' case is compelling. Competition, not a tax break, ought to decide where Americans want to bank.

HEADLINE: Vero Beach Journal;
For the Dodgers, a Fit as Tight as a Ball and Glove

BYLINE: By KEVIN McKENNA 

DATELINE: VERO BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
The navel oranges have been shipped; the Valencias and the Ruby Red grapefruit are making their way from grove to market. But here in Indian River County, the real season has now begun, and the crop, as it has been for half a century, is baseball players.
Of the 18 Florida cities that play host to spring camps, no other town has an identity and an economy so intertwined with a baseball team as Vero Beach has with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
 This is the Dodgers' 50th season here, an association that began a decade before Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles from Brooklyn. His predecessor, Branch Rickey, set up camp here in 1948 on the site of an abandoned naval training station in the days of Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese. Whatever the upheaval since then, including the recent announcement that the Dodgers are for sale, Vero Beach has been a symbol of continuity.
"I don't believe Vero Beach would be known anywhere outside of Vero Beach except for the presence of the Dodgers," said Vin Scully, the Dodgers broadcaster, who has been coming here since 1950. "When I first arrived, we stepped off the train and, my gosh, it was a tiny, tiny, somewhat dusty little Southern town. But as the Dodgers settled in, as the word went out, the Dodgers truly put Vero Beach on the map."
Indeed, it is difficult to separate Vero Beach from baseball, and not just in the spring. The Dodgers maintain their 468-acre camp year round, with a Class A minor-league team, fantasy camps, training for football teams and foreign baseball clubs, two golf courses and a commercial citrus grove. After spring training, a 90-room inn for players serves as an executive conference center. All that activity makes the Dodgertown complex one of Indian River County's biggest private employers, with an annual payroll of $4 million and a work force reaching 450 in the spring. It is the only camp where a ball club is the owner, not a tenant.
"We're not just a baseball team that flies in Feb. 1 and leaves on opening day," said Craig Callan, a Brooklyn native who has spent 19 years at Dodgertown, nine as director. "We're year-round, tax-paying members of the community."
The team has left its mark on the city's 18,000 residents.
When Tommy Lasorda, the motivational former Dodger manager, spoke at a Little League opening day last year, "some of the mothers were in tears," said Chuck Sultzman, a local biologist for the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the father of a 13-year-old center fielder for the Seald-Sweet Growers team. "The Dodgers' being here has a profound effect on these kids."
Local teen-agers serve as bat boys; families house minor-league players during the season. And it is a rite of spring to happen upon stars like Mike Piazza and Eric Karros at the next table at a pizza parlor.
At the local newspaper, The Press Journal, deadlines are pushed back during the season to include West Coast scores because "so many people follow the Dodgers," said John Schumann, whose family published the paper for 70 years. At Hyatt Fruits, the owner, Tom Jones, draws in customers for his gift boxes by giving away two tickets a day to spring training games.
When Dodgers players talk about training here -- on fields bordered by streets like Don Drysdale Drive and Sandy Koufax Lane -- the word "mystique" is often invoked.
"There's something definitely unique about it," said Todd Zeile, a third baseman spending his first spring as a Dodger after eight major league seasons. "You get to talk to fans up close."
Chip Hale, an infielder joining the Dodgers this year from Minnesota, said, "It's almost like the Dodgers own the whole town." (He conceded that players sometimes called it Zero Beach, but affectionately. Lacking big-city distractions, it offers "more of a chance to concentrate on baseball," he said.)
This spring, however, a cloud hovers over Vero Beach. Since the O'Malley family's announcement in January that the Dodgers are for sale, there has been anxious speculation here that a new owner might be wooed to more lucrative spring pastures. And Vero Beach is determined not to become another Brooklyn.
"If the Dodgers were to leave, it would be a calamity, a catastrophe -- economically, socially and psychologically," said Mayor Jack Grossett, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan before moving here 10 years ago. "People are saying they wouldn't leave Vero Beach, couldn't leave Vero Beach, but you and I know they could."
Maurice McEvoy, a 72-year-old fan from Quincy, Mass., with a winter home in Vero Beach ("baseball is the reason we came"), recoiled at the prospect. "People think about Vero Beach with the Dodgers like Kleenex with a tissue," he said. "This place will always be Dodgertown, no matter who buys it."

HEADLINE: NEW JOBS SURGE, BUT GAINS IN PAY ARE ONLY MODEST

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The job market grew at an unexpectedly brisk pace in February, buoyed by unusually favorable weather for construction, as the unemployment rate slipped a tenth of a point, to 5.3 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
While payrolls expanded by 339,000, much more than was generally expected, many economists described the overall job market as only modestly tighter than in January. They said it probably still did not pose a big enough risk of wage inflation to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates at its next policy meeting scheduled for March 25. 
 "I think it's still a close call on the Fed," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. She said the central bank faced the issue of an economy that continued to expand at an unsustainable clip while inflation, on the other hand, remained essentially in check.
Reaction in the financial markets reflected that view. After an early fall, bond prices rose on the report and stocks surged. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.19 points at 7,000.89. Investors focused on figures in the employment report showing a modest rise in hourly earnings. [Page 39.]
But a growing number of experts, while still in the minority, now argue that the economy's continued strength may well persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, perhaps as early as March 25 or at its next meeting in May. "The countdown to Fed tightening continued this week," economists for Salomon Brothers told their clients today. "Fed officials will be hard pressed to postpone action any longer when they meet again in two weeks."
President Clinton hailed the job growth, which he said reflected the priority he had given to deficit reduction, and took the occasion to ask for an agreement with Congress that could bring a balanced budget, albeit temporary, in 2002.
"We must cut the deficit to zero while investing in our people," he said in a statement. "I look forward to working with the Congress to get the job done by passing a balanced budget plan."
Besides the modest rise of 3 cents an hour in average hourly earnings, signs that the labor market is not yet overheating included a decline in the number of people who quit their jobs to look for other employment. This indicator, which had shown increases in the last few months, was cited by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in recent Congressional testimony in which he warned that a "pre-emptive" strike against inflation may be necessary.
Other evidence of presumed comfort to the Federal Reserve was a downward revision in payroll growth for January, a lack of growth in factory jobs and quirks of statistics and weather that exaggerated employment in department stores and in construction.
Much of a 46,000 rise in retail trade jobs reflected the fact that department stores laid off workers hired for the holiday shopping season earlier than usual, confounding the process by which the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusted for recurring seasonal variation.
And although officials could not quantify the effect, a large portion of a 109,000 surge in construction jobs, nearly one-third of total payroll growth, was a result of mild weather last month. The advance, concentrated in such outdoors work as heavy construction, masonry, concrete and roofing, was the biggest in a year.
"It's not as strong as it looks," said Irwin L. Kellner of Kellner Economic Advisers, a consultant in Port Washington, L.I. "Today's numbers will not cause the Fed to raise interest rates come March 25."
Still, James F. O'Sullivan, an economist with Morgan Guaranty, said the report provided further evidence of a situation that the Federal Reserve could not allow to continue: the economy growing for years above its long-term trend. He said the unemployment rate, which has been essentially steady since summer, would likely drop to a new level should solid job growth persist and predicted the Federal Reserve would this month raise rates by a quarter-point.
The so-called quit rate, cited by Mr. Greenspan, drew particular scrutiny today as it retreated to 10.9 percent after climbing to 12.3 percent in January. A decline is taken as reflecting less confidence that a better job will be available but officials warned against overinterpretation.
"This is a very volatile series," said Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve governor who recently became head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. She described the job market as "extremely strong" but without "any evidence of inflationary pressures."
This sanguine view was disputed, however, by Cathy E. Minehan, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston participates in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee even though she does not have a vote this year. "These signals of labor market tightness in the face of above-trend growth clearly sound inflation alarm bells," Ms. Minehan said at a forum on the economy at Middlebury College in Vermont.
The department's survey on households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed a decline of 150,000 jobs in February that followed a 725,000 leap in January. But the labor force contracted a bit more, enough to trim a statistically insignificant one-tenth of a point off the jobless rate.
There was a sizable 210,000 decline in workers idled for less than five weeks, a confirmation of figures showing that first-time claims for jobless benefits had reached their lowest level in eight years.
By region, unemployment in the Northeast eased two-tenths of a point last month, to 5.6 percent, the department also reported. The Midwest improved to 4.3 from 4.4 percent while the West improved to 5.7 from 6 percent. The South's jobless rate, however, climbed five-tenths of a point, to 5.5 percent.
The Federal Reserve said today that consumer credit grew at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, or $8.4 billion, in January. The increase was greater than analysts' expectatations of a rise of about $5.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Sobering News for Bacchus;
Europe's Wine Industry Is Facing Serious Challenges

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, March 7

 BODY:
It's not that Paola Nuvola doesn't like wine. She simply enjoys Coke more.
"It's just tasty, and I like it," said Ms. Nuvola, who works with a publishing company in Rome. While her parents, like most older Italians, are big wine drinkers, and a bottle stands on the table at the evening meal, she and her brother, Daniele, don't share the enthusiasm. In fact, she says, he prefers milk, soft drinks, mineral water -- almost everything except wine. 
 While Europe still is to wine what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil, the drinking habits of Europeans in their 20's, like Ms. Nuvola and her brother, are causing wine makers in big wine-producing nations like Italy, France, and Spain to sober up.
In recent years, per capita consumption plummeted, as younger people hooked on Coke and beer deserted wine in droves. By 1995, the average Italian drank only 16 gallons a year. True, that is a lot more than the 1.8 gallons consumed by Americans, yet it is well below the 19 gallons, on average, Italians drank in 1989. In France, average consumption dropped to 16.8 gallons, from 19.4; in Spain, to 9.6 from 12.4.
With too much wine chasing too few drinkers, prices for rieslings and Riojas, Chiantis and cabernets are often well below what it costs to produce them.
This spells long-term trouble for Europe's wine industry, with the only bright spots being upscale wines and some cheaper ones. And while some wineries are adjusting, many others are not.
 Exports do take up some of the slack, and in recent years Europe's wines have traveled to markets as far-flung as Japan, India and Russia.
More recently, though, countries not traditionally associated with wine, like Australia, South Africa, and Chile, are crowding in, transforming the trade from a largely European monopoly into a global business. In Europe, the strain is beginning to be felt.
Europe's traditional recipe is to prop up prices by paying wineries to destroy vineyards and to distill excess wine into industrial alcohol. Each year, the European Commission spends about $1.6 billion to keep supplies down.
But as global competition mounts, so does resistance to such profligacy. "Instead of spending for price supports," said Achim Blau, an economist at the German Federation of Wine Growers, a trade group in Bonn, "we should be investing in the promotion of European wines."
And Franco Zuffellato, director of marketing at Zonin, Italy's largest privately owned winery, fears that while Europe bulldozes vineyards, "in Australia, Chile, Argentina, California's Napa Valley, they're planting."
"I ask myself if it's right," he added.
Not that the picture is totally bleak. Consumers in Asian countries are discovering wine, and in the United States and Germany, always big customers for southern European wines, recent revelations about the positive health effects of moderate wine drinking are lifting sales, particularly of red wine.
Last year, the wineries of France, the world's No. 2 wine-producing nation after Italy, lifted global exports by 13 percent; Spanish wineries, using aggressive marketing and pricing, elbowed their way into lucrative markets with cava, a sparkling wine. And French and Italian wineries are buying vineyards in Eastern Europe and the United States.
In dollar terms, in fact, exports rose 7 percent as buyers shifted to higher-priced wines, and some industry officials found consolation in that. "For us, the export challenge has only been good," said Allegra Antinori of Marchesi Antinori, one of Italy's leading Chianti producers. "Wine today is quality wine."
Yet the more closely watched numbers are those for volume, and those do not look good. Italy, at 1.5 billion gallons a year, is the world's largest wine producer. But in 1996 the volume of Italian wine exports plummeted by 25 percent.
So the storm warning is clear: For every thriving European winery that is able to build on a quality image, thousands of mom-and-pop operations survive only thanks to subsidies. In Spain's Castile-La Mancha region, south of Madrid, where roughly half of Spanish wine is produced, vineyards yield only about 288 gallons an acre, compared with about 1,390 in the vineyards of Germany and Luxembourg. In Apulia and Sicily, in southern Italy, tens of thousands of unproductive two- to three-acre vineyards only cost the Government money. Last year, part of the problem became evident when Spanish wine merchants, forced by a poor harvest to import wine, snubbed Europe's expensive wines in favor of Argentina's.
"Europe doesn't have a recipe," complained Pietro Caviglia, director of the Italian Union of Wines. "In the coming years, this will explode."
What aggravates the problem, experts like Mr. Caviglia say, is that many regions heavily dependent on wine growing are among those hardest hit by high unemployment. In Spain's Castile-La Mancha, for instance, unemployment is 24 percent, double the European average.
In February, evidence of the tension appeared when wineries in Spain and France pressured the European Commission to earmark fresh funds for the distillation of wine to alcohol. Their action was prompted by large surpluses in France's Charentes region, where sales of wine to local cognac distilleries are hurting because of flagging liquor sales, and in Spain's La Mancha region, where good weather last year produced a bumper grape crop. So in the next several months, almost 63 million gallons of wine will be converted to alcohol, with the wineries paid up to 80 percent of the wine's market price.
In 1994, Rene Steichen, then the European Commission's senior agriculture official, sought to put an end to such market manipulation by proposing that Europe's wineries eliminate almost 20 percent of their production -- roughly 4.1 billion gallons -- by accepting payments to bulldoze thousands of acres of vineyards. When angry Spanish wine-growers took to the streets of Madrid to protest, the commission dropped the plan. Gerard Kiely, the commission's agriculture spokesman in Brussels, said there is "no enthusiasm around at the moment" to revive it, since several thin harvests and some notable export successes have recently helped buoy prices.
Yet some industry officials say the day of reckoning has not been avoided, only postponed. Wine-drinking trends, they say, tend not to favor European producers of inexpensive table wines, which increasingly dominate the global market.
In Italy, while roughly a third of all wines are sold in supermarkets, many wineries go after only the elite drinkers. "There's a snobbism among the producers," says Claudio De Viti, who follows wine-drinking habits at A. C. Nielsen in Milan. "They spend to bring people to their castles in Tuscany, and prefer to invest in journalists who write for wine magazines, rather than buyers for the half-dozen supermarket chains that sell the volume." That formula promises success for those with strong name recognition, but does little to help the vast bulk of European wine producers.
Last year, a string of poor harvests in California reduced wine output there just as reports of red wine's possible health benefits caused consumption to rise. Imports to the United States rose sharply, but the main beneficiaries were Europe's competitors.
Thus, while imports of French wine rose 31 percent, Italian wines 13 percent, and Spanish wines 2 percent, imports from Australia jumped 33 percent. Brazilian wine imports soared 45 percent, and imports from Chile jumped 60 percent.
Market experts say that as wine drinking trickled down from the elite to a broader public, successful wineries reacted by redesigning labels to stress the grapes that go into the wines, like chardonnay, merlot, or pinot noir, rather than fanciful pedigrees. "This is an American look, as opposed to a European look," said Eileen Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, a San Francisco-based company that tracks the wine market.
European wineries are adjusting to these new realities in a variety of ways. Earlier this year, the producers of Chianti, the traditional red wine of Tuscany, agreed to alter the complex blend that was codified in the 19th century and changed only a few times since. Now it no longer contains both red and white grapes, but only one red variety, the sangiovese. "It reflects the growing need for quality," said Ms. Antinori, whose family has produced wine since the late 1300's. "Some of our newer wines are 100 percent red."
Such innovations are helping a handful of wineries like Antinori stay ahead of the market. In 1991, Antinori widened its global reach by joining several European partners to make wine in Hungary; two years later, it acquired Atlas Peak Vineyards, a 460-acre winery in California's Napa Valley.
French wineries and wine merchants have also engaged in national export campaigns recently. Last year, French exports to Germany, whose wine-producing regions suffered several weak harvests, rose almost 50 percent.
"We've had good results in virtually all categories," exulted Christian Melani, a spokesman for Onivins, a wine industry group in Paris.
Some of Italy's best wineries are seeking to imitate the French success. Zonin, for example, has dropped the Italian custom of local denominations on its labels and emphasized grape varieties. Zonin also sought to meet increased demand by aggressively enlarging its domains, buying up aging vineyards in premier Italian locations, then sinking large sums into replanting to increase yield and permit less expensive mechanical harvesting. In the last five years, Zonin doubled the size of its vineyards under cultivation to 47,000 acres.
But the gains do not come easily. Sales rose only 5 percent last year, to $71 million, about 30 percent through exports. Gianni Zonin, the group's owner and president, likes to count Europe's fresh competitors on his fingers. "Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Eastern Europe," he says, "they're all exporting now, and last year Spain even imported wine from Argentina." Still, he added, "I'm an optimist."
Mr. Zuffellato, Zonin's marketing director and Mr. Zonin's brother-in-law, explains why: "The old producing countries are learning how to compete. The newcomers are forcing us to get better."

HEADLINE: Colombia Says It Will Resume Aerial Spraying to Destroy Coca

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 7

 BODY:
Colombia, which surprised the United States by suspending the aerial spraying of its coca crops, will resume eradication of the plants, which are used to make cocaine, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said today.
The aerial spraying program was suspended Wednesday, apparently in reprisal for Washington's decision to "decertify" Colombia for a second year as an ally in the drug war. Mr. Medellin said the program would resume next week. 
 "Aerial coca eradication operations in Colombia will restart as of next Wednesday," he said after a meeting of the national antidrug council. He added that the operation had been suspended only temporarily while the police and Government officials review its effectiveness in light of what the United States has described as a 32 percent increase in the cultivation of coca last year.
That jump made Colombia the world's second-largest grower of the raw material for cocaine. It was one of the reasons Washington cited last week in deciding to leave Colombia on a list of countries that are failing to cooperate fully with the United States in antidrug efforts.
The suspension of aerial spraying caught American officials off guard and drew a rebuke from a State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, who said Washington reserved the right to levy economic sanctions on Colombia.
The American Ambassador, Myles R. Frechette, urged a quick resumption of the operations, warning Colombia that the suspension could spell disaster for Colombian-American relations.
Colombian officials have questioned the United States figures on coca production. They have argued that the numbers do not take into account areas sprayed as part of an American-backed program that has taken the lives of 35 pilots and anti-drug fighters since 1995.
To insure that no such disputes will occur in the future, Mr. Medellin said, he and the head of the anti-narcotics division of the National Police are to ask the French Government this month for assistance in monitoring Colombia's illicit drug crops with a spy satellite.
In clear criticism of the United States, he said it was very important to obtain independent verification of Washington's crop estimates. He also said no decision had been made on efforts backed by the United States to replace the liquid herbicide currently in use in Colombia with a more effective granular variety.
American contract pilots began working with the Colombian police in the drug fumigation program last year. One was killed in January when his crop-duster aircraft crashed in a guerrilla-controlled area in southeast Colombia.
Colombia's leading leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, obtains much of its funds through protection of rural drug farms and laboratories.
Colombia also accounts for 1.5 percent of the world's opium production. Mr. Medellin said aerial spraying of opium poppies had not been halted when spraying of coca was stopped this week.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Move Up Amid Mixed Views on Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday despite the release of February employment figures that were much stronger than expected. While 339,000 jobs were created last month -- exceeding analysts' forecast of 231,000 -- the report offered a mixed picture.
The 30-year bond rose 25/32, to a price of 97 19/32 to yield 6.81 percent, down from 6.88 percent on Thursday. 
 The jobs data showed an economy that was still strong, but with inflation pressures remaining in check. Even so, the question on everyone's mind is what will happen at the March 25 meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel.
While there are those who say that yesterday's data will bring a response from the Fed this month, the prevailing opinion in the market seems to be that the policy panel will not act until its May meeting.
"We think it's quite simple," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The economy is continuing to grow above trend and showing no signs of faltering and Greenspan has said in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that he's going to be pre-emptive."
"Put the two together and it implies a March tightening; otherwise Greenspan runs the risk of losing credibility," Mr. Dudley said of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. "I don't think he wants that."
Another view came from Anthony Chan, a vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. He said that though the employment report "revealed continuing firm labor cost pressures, it failed to produce additional wage pressures that were above and beyond those that have been seen over the last two months."
"We shouldn't forget that the nonfarm payroll numbers were revised downward by a total of 54,000 during December 1996 and January 1997," Mr. Chan said, "which means that after adjusting for these factors, the 339,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls really becomes a less menacing net increase of only 285,000."

HEADLINE: State Nears Agreement On Lilco Debt

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration and the Long Island Lighting Company are close to completing a complex $5 billion deal for the state to take over debt from the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant, an agreement that would address some of Gov. George E. Pataki's thorniest political problems as he looks to the 1998 campaign, according to people close to the talks.
The state and the utility have apparently resolved one of the last major impediments to the agreement, a billion-dollar property tax dispute that threatens to bankrupt local governments on Long Island's East End, though one state official said no final commitment had been made. The pact would relieve Lilco, once and for all, of its remaining Shoreham debt and lower the island's electric rates, the highest in the continental United States, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 They said a few remaining issues should be settled fairly readily, and the deal could be announced in the next two weeks.
State officials refused to comment for the record on any potential accord. "It's speculation at this point," said Zenia Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman.
A state official said that just one important obstacle remains: the utility's capital gains tax liability arising from such a state bailout, which it has been estimated could reach $2 billion. Lilco, which has a merger with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company pending, and state officials have petitioned the Internal Revenue Service to forgive the liability, or at least postpone it for many years, and the I.R.S. has not ruled on the matter. Some people close to the talks said there had been hints of accommodation from the I.R.S., but others said there had been no such indications.
Lilco officials have said that no state takeover of the Shoreham debt was feasible without that tax relief, and Wall Street analysts said that the tax liability threatened to kill the merger with Brooklyn Union.
Under the proposed agreement, as described by state officials and business leaders close to the talks, the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, would pay Lilco a little more than $5 billion to buy the utility's electric transmission and distribution system and settle the property tax case. The authority would then hire Lilco to operate the system for six years. Lilco, which is awaiting a merger with Brooklyn Union Gas Company, would lower its electric rates by 10 to 15 percent.
That would allow Mr. Pataki to claim victory after two years of promising "double digit" rate relief to a region that will be key to his re-election hopes, and to take credit for the resolution of the Shoreham quagmire, which long eluded his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo. Long Island's electric rates -- nearly double the national average, with the average household paying about $100 a month -- are a perennial source of fury from residents and businesses and, officials say, a damper on the local economy.
The Power Authority would pay for the transaction by selling $5 billion in tax-exempt bonds -- the largest municipal bond issue in history -- that would be repaid through a surcharge on ratepayers' bills for the next 20 to 30 years. Business and consumer groups charged that the state should have forced Lilco to swallow some of the cost.
As part of the deal, officials said, the Long Island Power Authority will pay Lilco to settle the utility's lawsuit against Suffolk County, the town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham Wading River School District. That lawsuit charges that the untility was overcharged on property taxes since the early 1980's. Last year, the utility won a judgment against the governments that is potentially worth $1.1 billion, raising the prospect of bankruptcy if they were forced to accept even a large fraction of the judgment.
A state official close to the talks and business executives said the settlement would be more than $500 million, but another state official said there was no agreement yet. The settlement would be paid not by the local governments, but by the Power Authority, to be repaid by the businesses and the 2.7 million residents of Long Island and the Rockaways through higher rates for many years.
The agreement amounts to a bailout of the local governments, which derived the benefits of overcharging Lilco for more than a decade but will not be obliged to repay the debt.
Politically, this feature of the deal is crucial to Mr. Pataki. The Governor gained much of his narrow 1994 victory margin with an unusually strong showing in Suffolk County, and John Powell, the Suffolk Republican leader and an important ally of Mr. Pataki, has insisted that settlement of the property tax dispute be a part of any state deal with Lilco.
"What is really the catalytic agent in this deal is the concern on the part of the Governor that he can't get re-elected without Suffolk County," said Jack Kulka, a construction company owner and a prominent critic of the plans to relieve Lilco of the Shoreham debt.
To settle complaints from Nassau County officials that residents there should not have to help repay Lilco for Suffolk's good fortune, the agreement provides for either slightly lower electric rates in Nassau than in Suffolk for the next generation, or for Suffolk to make cash payments to the neighboring county.
Lilco and its shareholders also have reason to be pleased, because the agreement indirectly relieves the utility of its $4.5 billion Shoreham debt. The merger with Brooklyn Union provides a higher price per share for Lilco with a state takeover of the debt. The debt is already being paid off by ratepayers, not the company, but the state could theoretically change that arrangement. Transferring it to the Power Authority makes it permanently the ratepayers' obligation.
Consumer and business groups contend that the company should be held liable for a large portion of the debt. "There's no way customers should be held responsible for all, or even most, of this," said Larry Shapiro, an attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group.
In addition to Lilco's power lines, the Power Authority would buy Lilco's minority stake in the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear plant upstate. The merged Brooklyn Union-Lilco would retain ownership of the rest of Lilco's generating plants, and its natural gas system. The price paid for the utility's assets would be about $4.5 billion.
The Power Authority can pay off the debt more cheaply than Lilco because it can borrow money at lower interest rates. That translates to lower rates for consumers.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM;
Clinton's Opening Statement and Responses at His News Conference

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Following are opening remarks by President Clinton at his news conference today followed by questions and answers:
 
OPENING REMARKS
 Today we learned some very good news about the American economy. Our nation has created almost 600,000 new jobs in the first two months of 1997, almost 12 million since January of 1992. At the same time, the deficit has been reduced by 63 percent. Investment in our people has increased. Inflation remains low. Our economy is on the right track. But to stay on that right track, we have to balance the budget while we go forward with the work that leads to continued growth and low inflation. That's what our balanced budget will do, eliminating the deficit in five years and strengthening critical investments for the future of all of our people. 
 Last week the Congressional Budget Office certified that even under its assumptions, because of the protections we built into the budget, it would be balanced by 2002. So I am hopeful, and I want to say again, that the talks that we have been continually having with Congressional leaders in both parties will produce a balanced budget agreement this year and in the not-too-distant future.
I also want to talk a moment about our commitments to our gulf war veterans. And I thank Secretary Brown and the other veterans' leaders who are here, including Elaine Larson from the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses, the leadership of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other veterans' organizations and the Persian Gulf veterans who join with us here today.
Two months ago, when I accepted the final report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses, I pledged to the committee and to all America's veterans that we would match their efforts with action. Today I am announcing three important steps to meet that pledge and our debt to our veterans.
First, I have approved Secretary Brown's recommendation for the new regulations to extend the eligibility period for compensation for Persian Gulf veterans with undiagnosed illnesses. We aim to raise significantly the window for gulf veterans to claim the compensation they have earned. Under current regulations, veterans with undiagnosed illnesses must prove their disabilities emerged within two years of their return from the gulf, in order to be eligible for benefits. Experience has shown that many disabled veterans have had their claims denied because they fall outside that two-year time frame.
The proposed new regulations would extend the time frame through the year 2001. That is 10 years after the cessation of hostilities in the gulf war. Gulf war veterans who became ill as a result of their service should receive the compensation they deserve, even if science cannot yet pinpoint the cause of their illnesses.
Second, I have accepted from the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Veteran Affairs a comprehensive action plan to implement the recommendations of the Presidential advisory committee's final report. I asked for this plan within 60 days, and they delivered. The plan addresses outreach, medical and clinical issues, research, coordination, investigations, and chemical and biological weapons. It will help us to do an even better job of caring for gulf war veterans and finding out why they're sick.
Third and finally, as the committee recommended, I have initiated a Presidential review directive process to make sure that in any future troop deployments we act on lessons learned in the gulf to better protect the health of our service men and women and their families. We need to focus on better communication, better data and better service. The committee's work in a massive, intensive, ongoing review of millions of pages of documents by the Department of Defense and the C.I.A. continues to bring new information to light, including recently released documents about possible exposure by our troops to chemical agents. The scope of the efforts is substantial, and if there is additional information it will be found and released.
We will be asking two very important questions about any such new information. First, should it change the research or health care programs we have in place to care for our veterans? And second, how will it help us to make the policy changes we need to better protect our forces in future deployments?
What is most important is that we remain relentless in our search for the facts and that as we do get new information we share it with our veterans, with Congress and with the American people and that we act on any information we uncover. That is what we have done and what we must continue to do. I will not stop until we've done everything we can to provide the care and to find the answers for gulf war veterans that they need and deserve.
And again let me say I thank all of you for your work and for being with us here today.
Now, I'll be glad to take your questions. And I think, Terry, you're the first.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Yes, sir. Mr. President, we learned this week that the Vice President solicited campaign contributions in the White House and that the First Lady's chief of staff accepted a $50,000 campaign contribution in the White House. This comes on the heels of news about White House sleepovers and White House coffees for big-money donors. You, sir, promised to have the most ethical Administration in history. How does all of this square with that?
A. Well, first of all, let's take them one by one. I don't believe you've -- that they undermine the case, but let me begin by saying there were problems in the fund-raising in 1996, which have been well-identified, and the Democratic Party commissioned its own audit, did a review, made the results public and took appropriate action. I think that is very important, and I'm proud of that.
The second thing I want to say is I thought the Vice President did a good job of explaining what he did and why, and explaining exactly what he intended to do in the future.
With regard to Maggie Williams, I'd like to make a comment about that. She is an honorable person. She was put in a rather unusual circumstance, and as a courtesy, she agreed to do what the relevant regulation plainly provides for, which is to forward the check on to the Democratic National Committee.
Now, in retrospect, with all the publicity that's attended the whole contribution issue, would it have been better if Maggie Williams had said, "Look, I can do this under the regulations, but I've decided I shouldn't do it, and I want you to go mail it in yourself or take it over there yourself"? That would have been a better thing to do.
And in the future, I -- I expect that the White House will follow that course, should such an occasion ever arise again.
But finally, I want to make the point I have been trying to make to the American people. We had to work hard, within the law, to raise a lot of money to be competitive. We did work hard, and I'm glad we did, because the stakes were high and the divisions between us in Washington at that time were very great. We still fell over $200 million short of the money raised by the committees of the Republican Party.
The real problem -- and the reason you have some of the questions you have, I think, unless you just believe that all transactions between contributors and politicians are inherently suspect, which I don't believe and I think is wrong, for either party -- the real problem is that these campaigns cost too much money, they take too much time and they will continue to do so until we pass campaign finance reform. If we pass campaign finance reform, as I've asked, by July 4th, then the situation will get better. If we don't, we will still be raising too much money, and it will take too much time and effort on the part of everyone involved. So I'm hopeful that we can.
But I believe that both the Vice President and Maggie Williams are highly ethical people. And I do not believe that either one would ever knowingly do anything wrong.
This business of raising money takes a lot of time, and if you have to do too much of it, it will take too much time and raise too many questions.
But I do not agree with the inherent premise that some have advanced that there's somehow something intrinsically wrong with a person that wants to give money to a person running for office, and that if you accept it, that something bad has happened. I don't agree with that. I don't think there's something intrinsically bad, but the system is out of whack. And I think we all know it, and we all know it's not going to get better until and unless we pass a reasonable campaign finance reform law.
Helen?
Q. Mr. President, Governor Romer said that Maggie Williams was wrong to accept the check, and you obviously seem to agree in retrospect. But in your ----
A. No, no. I'm not going to say Maggie Williams did anything wrong.
Q. O.K.
A. And I don't want to be -- I don't -- you know, you all will have to deal with this as best you can, but I want to be clear. She is an honorable person. There is a regulation that deals with this which explicitly says that when something -- if you receive a contribution and all you do is just pass it on, and you've been involved in no way in any solicitation on public property and you're just passing it through, that that is what the regulation provides for. It is explicit and clear.
What I said was I think that she would say in retrospect, and I would say, given the extreme sensitivity now everyone has to all these contribution issues, that she should have said to the gentleman in question, "Look, I can do this legally, but I don't want to do it because I think we should remove all question, all doubt; I think you ought to go mail it yourself, go take it down there yourself." And that's what I think the White House should do in the future if someone physically is present in the White House and attempts to do that.
 
Pressure to Raise Money
 Q. Well, Mr. President, in your zeal for funds during the last campaign, didn't you put the Vice President and Maggie and all the others in your Administration topside, in a very vulnerable position?
A. I disagree with that.
How are we vulnerable? because -- only vulnerable if you think it is inherently bad to raise funds and you believe that these transactions are between people who are almost craven. I mean, that's how Maggie Williams, in this case, was completely passive. She didn't ask someone to come in and give her a check. And she had no reason to believe there was anything wrong with it, with the check involved. She just simply did what the regulation explicitly provides for, which is to pass it on.
Now, in the case of the Vice President, he can speak for himself. But I have to tell you we knew what we were facing. We knew, no matter what happened, we would be badly outspent. We believed in what we stood for, and we were frankly -- from time to time, we were surprised we had as many folks who were willing to stick with us, as they were.
But we are proud of the fact that, within the limits of the law, we worked hard to raise money so that we could get our message out there and we would not be buried -- literally buried by the amount of money that the other side had at their disposal.
There were the problems that we identified, which we have been very forthright about. We've got an external auditor coming to the Democratic Party. They have taken the steps to correct them.
But it was -- we had never faced anything like that before in American politics. And we did the very best we could with it. And I don't think we were compromised by fighting for what we believed in, within the limits of the law.
I do believe that this system is not good now. It is so expensive. It requires too much time, too much energy. And the more effort you put into it, the more opportunity you have for some sort of -- something going wrong.
So what I think has to be done is we have to reform the law. But until we get some energy behind an effort to reform the law -- you know, if it's just me and Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and a few others who support us for it, we can't pass it, and you will be left with the same system next time and the time after that and the time after that. And because of the exponential rise in the cost of buying air time and other means of communication, we'll have all these questions all over again, time and time and time again.
Go ahead -- well, Rita first, and then Wolf. Let's just do it that way.
 
Access to White House
 Q. I'm going your forbearance, because this question is a little bit long, but this is about Johnny Chung, the person who gave the check to Maggie Williams. In April of '95, about a month after he gave that check, he came in here to the White House. He brought in five Chinese officials. Someone on your staff sent a memo to the National Security Council, saying that you were not certain you'd want photos of you with these people floating around. I wanted to ask you why you were worried about that and also why, after a highly knowledgeable N.S.C. official wrote back that "he was a hustler who will continue to make efforts to bring in his friends into contact with the President and First Lady, and whose clients might not always be in favor of business ventures the President would support," why did he keep getting back in here?
What was your relationship to him? And he now says that it was at least implicit, if not explicit, that he would get this access for the money he gave.
A. Well, first of all, you asked me two questions, really.
Q. Four.
A. Why did I -- well, I'll answer the two I can remember. Then if I don't suit you, you can ask again.
I just had -- as I have said before on this question of White House access, we did not have adequate -- an adequate system here. I assumed, wrongly, as it turned out, that there were kind of established procedures which were sort of handed on from administration to administration, that had nothing to do with whoever happened to be here, about -- that controlled and -- access. And I was wrong about that. So that's what I assumed generally was in place until we became aware that they weren't.
But on this particular day I just had an instinct that maybe whatever the rules were that -- you know, that we didn't maybe know enough about these folks to know whether there should be a picture there. I didn't assume anything negative about them. I just thought that we just didn't know.
Now, with regard to the memo about Mr. Chung, I can't answer that question because I never saw it, and no one ever told me it had been written, and I don't know who did see it. So I really can't answer that whole cluster of questions because the first I ever knew such a memo had been written was when it was discussed in the public domain. I did not know that. I had no reason to believe that there was any problem there.
Q. And what is your relationship with Mr. Chung? How did you come to know him? How did he get into your office and write you letters that you replied to? There's lots of record of that.
A. Well, I like to think we're pretty good about replying to our letters, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
I don't remember how I met him, but I think I met him at some Democratic Party event. I'm sure that's where I met him. I didn't have a relationship with him prior to my becoming President, to the best of my knowledge.
Wolf?
 
Stance on Prosecutor
 Q. Mr. President, early in your Administration when you were faced with a similar round of pressure for a special prosecutor to investigate Whitewater you made it easy on Janet Reno by pre-empting her and saying yes, it's time for a special prosecutor -- Robert Fiske, in that particular case -- to go forward, and ever since, you know, the history of Whitewater.
Why not make it easy for Janet Reno this time and similarly pre-empt her and say yes, there's enough of a threshold, enough of the law has been met to go forward and to get to the bottom of this?
A. Because there was -- for one thing, there was no law at the time. And I might point out that if there had been a law, either the previous law or this law, there would have been no special prosecutor, because the threshold of the law was not met. And you know, the American people will have to make a judgment about whether all this has been worth it when the facts come out. But the threshold of the law was not met, and I doubt very seriously if one ever would have been called if any law had been in place.
Now there is a law in place. It is a legal question. I do not think it should become a political question, and I have been very rigorous in dealing with this, in saying it in just that way. And I'm going to stick with my position.
 
Questions of Propriety
 Q. Mr. President, you again today, Vice President Gore the other day, and your staffs have repeatedly told us that no laws were broken in the Lincoln Bedroom issue, in the phone calls for donations, in Maggie Williams's accepting and then passing along the donation to the D.N.C. But cumulatively, Mr. President, what are your thoughts on the propriety and the appearance of all of these various actions?
A. Well, let's take them one at a time.
The Vice President has said that he believes he should -- if he makes further fund-raising calls, as opposed to attending fund-raising events, he should not make them from his office, even if -- if it is paid for with a political credit card.
I have said that I believe Maggie Williams thinks, in view of the environment in which we now are, that even though there is an explicit regulation on this, right on point on this -- that, you know, what she probably wishes she had said and what I expect future employees to say is: "Look, I can take this. It is legal. But we're not going to do it this way. You have to mail it in, or you have to take it in yourself."
On the third thing, you know, I just have a different view of this than you do. We have -- I have done something no President has ever done; I have -- I mean, I gave you a list of the people that spent the night in the White House. And it shows that a relatively small percentage of them -- about one in nine -- were people that I met, in the course of running for President, who supported me for President, who either gave me contributions or also helped to raise money for me.
You know, the people that did that, I am grateful to them for doing that. I appreciate the fact that they helped me in that campaign in '92. And the document, which was released, which most of you reported on, which showed the note I had sent back to Nancy Hernreich, makes it clear that I wanted to get back in touch with those people. I appreciated what they had done. I didn't want them to feel estranged from me. And I don't think there's anything wrong with a President -- me or anyone else -- reaching out to his supporters.
And some of them, including -- let me just give you -- I mean, I could give you lots of examples, but there have been a lot of different kinds of people who spent the night here. But one of the newspapers made an issue of Lee Rapoport from Texas. Well, he was my friend 25 years ago. When I was a defeated candidate for Congress with a campaign debt that was almost twice my annual salary, he was my friend. When I was the youngest former Governor in the history of the Republic and nobody thought I had any political future, he was my personal friend. I don't think there's anything wrong with having people like that spend the night with you.
So, you know, you'll -- you can make your own judgments about this. But I have tried to be very forthright with you about this. I've given you all this information, and you can make your own judgments. But I just simply disagree that it is wrong for a President to ask his friends and supporters to spend time with him.
And let me remind you of one problem. And a lot of you who have to travel around with me are acutely aware of this. This job, even when you're traveling, can be a very isolating job. Usually when you travel someplace, you go someplace, you stay a little while, you turn around and leave.
If you go to these fund-raisers, they're -- on the coffees, for example, I'm the one that's most responsible, or for the dinners out -- you know, the fund-raising dinners -- I get frustrated going to meetings and goings where all you do is shake hands with somebody or you take a picture, no words ever change -- you never know what somebody's got on their mind, or they never get a chance to talk to you, you never have any real contact. I look for ways to have genuine conversations with people. I learn things when I listen to people.
But I can tell you this: I don't believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution. It's just that I don't think I should refuse to listen to people who supported me or refuse to be around them or tell people, "Well, you contributed to the campaign; therefore, even though I'd love to have you come see me at the White House, I can't do it anymore."
And you'll just have to sort through that and evaluate whether you agree with that or not, but that's how I feel.
Q. Are those who question the propriety off base? Is that what you're saying?
A. I'm -- well, no. I'm saying that I do not believe that inviting people to spend the night with me in the White House, the overwhelming majority of whom were personal friends of mine of long standing -- family members, friends of family members, friends of my daughter's, dignitaries, public officials, former public officials -- but some of whose connection with me really did begin in 1991 when I started running for President, and that involved their willingness to give me money or to raise money to me, I don't think that that is a bad thing.
What I think is a bad thing is to say -- and again, this may not be illegal either, and you know the documents also showed that I stopped this -- I don't think a political party should say, "If you give this amount of money, we'll guarantee you this specific access; if you give that amount of money, we'll guarantee you that specific access." I don't think that a political party should say, or the President should say, "If you want access to us, you have to contribute, and if you want access to us, you not only have to contribute to us, you can't contribute to them." I never did any of that.
You know, as I've said before, one of the most important meetings I had about China policy was one organized by Republicans. As far as I know, none of them had ever done anything in my behalf before. But it was important.
I just don't think you should eliminate contacts with your supporters. And I don't think that anyone else who -- if you really think about it, I don't think you'll think that, either.
 
Setting a Higher Standard
 John, and then Bob.
Q. Mr. President, in listening to many of your supporters and aides respond to these questions over the last several weeks, one note that I think I hear is one of frustration, a sense that these questions are unfair and the focus on the Democrats is unfair. But I also find something unsatisfactory in that response. And my question to you as somebody who has enormous power to lead by example, is it good enough to say that everybody else does it?
A. No. No. And I'm not trying to say that. I'm going to try to get through this whole press conference and never talk about the practices of the Republicans. I'm going to do my best to get all -- I don't think that's a good example.
And I also don't think it's good enough to say "it is legal." I think we should be held to a higher standard than just "it is legal." But what I do want you to know is, when it is obvious that we have a disagreement, when I read reports or see them on television and I think you see this in a certain way and I just honestly see it in a different way, I think it's helpful to the American people and to you and to me for me to tell how I see it. That's all. But I think there are things that when we see them in the light of day, even if we've been given guidance about what the limits of the law are, it seems that it's not a prudent thing to do. I thought the Vice President gave a very up-front and forthright statement about that the other day. And so I don't believe it's enough to say "Everybody does it."
On the other hand, I don't believe either that we can afford to run the risk of having one party just kind of disappear from the scene because they don't do what -- they're unwilling to do what is necessary to be competitive in raising funds in the system that exists, which is why I say to you, in the end, we should set a high standard.
But I -- but if I honestly disagree with you about what's right and wrong, I should be free to say that. But in the end, the answer to this is to pass a reasonable campaign finance reform bill this year. That's what I really believe.
Yes, go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, you have -- you and your officials have given us a number of explanations over the past several months about what you thought was legal. You said you got clear legal advice and gave us the impression that the dividing line on solicitations for contributions -- that the dividing line between right and wrong was whether or not that solicitation took place at the White House. But when we learned that the Vice President did just that, then we were told that that wasn't the standard after all. Which is right?
A. Well, let me just say, on the -- I think that's why the Vice President -- first of all, I think they're both right, and let me explain why. Because it's clear that what the law is on this -- going back a long time -- is that it's as if he'd written a letter to somebody from the White House. Does solicitation occur when he wrote the letter or when the letter is received? And the law is clearly that the solicitation is consummated, if you will, when the person is solicited and where the person is solicited. But the -- and the Vice President thought that as long as he was not using taxpayer money to make the call, that it was legal. I think he was right about that.
He also thought about it and said, "If I ever do this again, in terms of calls, I'm not going to do it in my office because it doesn't look right; we ought to have a higher standard." And I was proud of him for saying that.
But I think that's what -- that goes back to the question that John said. There is a difference between -- sometimes there is a difference between what is legal and what ought to be done. And this is a place where I think there is a difference, and I think we've made that clear. And I was proud of the statement that he made.
Yes, go ahead.
 
Calls From White House
 Q. Mr. President, your press secretary this week left open the possibility that you, too, had made calls like the Vice President did. Did you ever make those calls?
A. I told him to leave that possibility open because I'm not sure, frankly. I -- I don't like to raise funds in that way. I never have liked it very much. I prefer to meet with people face to face, talk to them, deal with them in that way. And I also, frankly, was very busy most of the times that it's been raised with me. But I can't say, over all the hundreds and hundreds and maybe thousands of phone calls I've made in the last four years, that I never said to anybody while I was talking to them, "Well, we need your help," or "I hope you'll help us."
So I told him not to flat-out say that I had never done it, because I simply can't say that I've never done it. But it's not what I like to do, and it wasn't a practice of mine. And once I remember in particular I was asked to do it and I just never got around to doing it.
But I don't believe the Vice President did anything wrong in making the calls. I know some people have advanced the proposition that the Vice President should not ever ask anybody for funds, at least unless he's looking at them face to face as opposed to on the telephone.
I just disagree with that. I do think he made the right decision about not doing it in the office.
I -- so I asked that that be -- that Mike McCurry do it in that way not to mislead you or to be cute, but just simply because I don't want to flat out say I never did something that I might in fact have done just because I don't remember it.
Susan.
Q. You've said that you've operated within the parameter of the laws, but in retrospect, do you have any regret about the quantity of campaign activity that happened in the White House?
A. You mean -- I do not regret the friends that I have asked to come and stay with me here. And in terms of the coffees, I can -- based on what I knew the facts to be and what I still believe they were, that no one was going to be solicited and that no -- at the meeting -- and that there was no specific price tag on coming to the coffees, which is what my understanding was, I don't regret doing that.
As I said, again, this is a matter of perception, you know. I really was -- see, I mean, I think I was more upset maybe than some of you were when I found out that my party was not checking the checks that were coming in. I was livid. I am stunned that in 1996, after all we'd been through in the last 20 years, that could have happened. It took my breath away.
I was upset when I saw a proposed brochure that says "This is the access you get to the President and the White House if you give this amount of money, and if you give that amount of money you get guaranteed a certain amount of other access." I thought that was wrong. But on the other hand, I have a different take on some of this than you do. And I am
As I said, I want to take personal responsibility for this. If you find the coffees offensive -- and I can't say if somebody did something around the coffees they shouldn't have done. But if you find the fact of the President having coffee at the White House with people who either have supported him in the past or who he hopes will support him in the future, I am personally responsible for that and I take full responsibility for it because I enjoyed them enormously. I found them interesting, I found them valuable, I found that all these people who -- many of whom had been active in public -- in elections for years and they'd done all kinds of different things with their lives, were given the first chance they'd ever had to just sort of say "Here's my idea, and I hope you'll consider it," or "Here's what I think you should to," or "Here's where I think you're wrong." And I genuinely enjoyed them. And I did not believe they were improper. And I still believe as long as there was no specific price tag put on those coffees, just the fact that they would later be asked to help the President or the party does not render them improper. That what I believe.
Mara?
 
Reassessing Actions
 Q. My question really was if you had it to do all over again, would you have moved these things outside of the White House or had stricter standards about what political things would be done in the White House?
A. Well, if I had it to do all again, I -- we would fix what we have now fixed, and we'd have stricter standards about admission to the White House. And I -- the answer to your other question, I hesitate to give you a general answer because there may be some facts about a particular coffee or another that I don't know.
All I am saying is that, based on what I thought the facts were -- which is these were people that we hoped would help us, some of whom had helped us in the past, some of whom had never helped us; and they were going to be invited here, and I was going to have coffee with them, and we're going to talk about things, after which some or all of them -- not all of them, as it turned out, but many of them would be solicited to help in the campaign -- I do not believe that was wrong. And I feel comfortable about what I did there.
I wish -- I've said this a million times -- I almost wish that one of you had been in all these coffees because they were, frankly, fairly pedestrian events in the sense that nothing very juicy was discussed. But people got to come out with their ideas, state their convictions. And maybe there ought to be some way of dealing with that. Maybe, at least, you ought to at least have some assurance that if these sort of things like this are done on a regular basis at least, that you ought to have some knowledge of what goes on in them, and that might make you feel better about it.
 
Gifts and U.S. Policy
 Q. Mr. President, you said a moment ago that no decision or policy made here was solely because of a contributor. But should that be a factor, at all, in decision -- U.S. foreign policy and who gets Government contracts and who goes on trade missions? Should that even be considered at all?
A. Well, what I think should -- well, let me just say this. This is the nub; this is the difficulty.
Every public official -- this is a problem or an issue that the President, the members of Congress, governors, mayors, all face.
The people who help you, people who try to help you put your program in, you try to stay in touch with them. So you're more likely to know if they want to do something than you are people who didn't help you and people who weren't involved in it.
The instructions I gave were if someone who helped us wants to be considered for an appointment, they ought to be considered for the appointment, but they shouldn't get it unless they're qualified for it. They shouldn't be disqualified because they had been a supporter of ours. That's the way I felt about the trade missions. If someone wanted to go on a trade mission and was qualified and could make a contribution, then they ought to get to go, but if they would never get to go in a thousand years, no one would think they should have any business on a trade mission and the only reason they were going to get to go was because they contributed to us, I didn't think they should go.
And I think -- but I think it's disingenuous for anybody in public life to say that it doesn't help you to be considered for these things if you help the person who happens to win an election, because you have to stay in touch with the people that helped you. And it is a good thing to do. That's the way -- that's the way the political system works. That's the way -- I would expect that of a Republican or a Democrat or independent who got elected to any office, that people that helped you and people that you know, people you have confidence in, you ought to listen to them; but you should never make a decision and do something solely because they have helped you before or solely in anticipation of something they might do for you in the future.
And what we have to do is to have our decisions open enough and transparent enough that the American people can see that that is being done.
And I can tell you, people come to you in all different kinds of ways. For example -- let me just give you one example. It's not a -- well, I'll just give you one example. There was a huge amount of money at stake in the private sector in the legislation involving the telecommunications reform. It's the first time we'd reformed telecommunications in 60 years. You all are in it. You know better than I do how much it's changing, all the competition issues. Massive amounts of money.
The Vice President has been interested in this issue forever. We spent, in our weekly lunches, we spent endless amounts of time talking about the Telecommunications Act, what it should look like. And we took a position. We then found we had all these people who came to us and supported us, many of whom had been Republicans their whole lives, who were independent long-distance telephone operators. And they came to us because the majority party had decided to take a position favored by the larger telephone companies.
We had a clear public position beforehand. Should we not have accepted their contributions? Should we not have accepted their support and help? I think we did the right thing.
Now, flip it around. If they had been helping us all along, but we agreed with them, should we have weakened in our advocacy just because they were supporting us?
In other words, I think the whole reason for the first round of campaign reform, let's go back to that, is that all these contributions should be made public. And you should be free to evaluate them. And you should be free to determine and to speculate and to probe about whether the money we received from such-and-such a group has affected a decision we make and does it undermine or support the public interest.
You should be free to do that. That's why full disclosure's important.
But I think that as long -- unless we're going to a completely publicly financed system, contributors will always have access to public officials. Then, other kinds of people will know who helped them. It just -- that's the way it is.
Mara, go ahead.
 
Access as a Commodity
 Q. Yeah, you say that -- Mr. President, you say that there's no evidence that you've ever changed a policy because of someone you've met with. But what does appear to have occurred is that certain people traded on their access. In other words, access to you became a valuable business commodity, to get new clients or impress their current clients. Do you think that that meets the higher standards that you want the White House to adhere to?
A. Well, what I think about that is that we need to evaluate whether we did anything which would give the impression that we were trying to help someone get business. In other words, I can't say who, beyond the reach of our personal contacts, would be impressed with people who had their picture taken with me. After today, it may be that everybody will go broke unless they take the pictures off the wall. I don't know. But I can't say that. What I can say is that the White House should not knowingly permit the White House or the Presidency or the Vice Presidency to be used to advance some private economic interest.
I can -- and that -- you put your finger on something that is troubling to me, and we have to evaluate that more. And it's one of the reasons that I wanted to make sure that we had a system in place on access and on all these things that will meet that standard in the future, and I believe we've done that. But I think that's a legitimate problem.
Q. Mr. President --
A. Jim and then Elizabeth.
Q. Mr. President --
A. Just a minute. I'll come back to you. We've got to --
 
 Ban on Abortion Procedure
 Q. Mr. President, when you vetoed the ban on partial-birth abortions, you said you did so to protect the lives of the mothers and because they were fairly rare. Well, it's since been revealed that there are approximately 5,000 of these so-called partial birth abortions performed every year, 90 percent of them in the fifth and sixth month. Would you now support a ban if it included provisions to protect the mother but would ban the procedure also in the fifth and sixth month?
And one second, unrelated question: Did the White House discover if there were any other checks or money passed besides the $50,000 to Maggie ----
A. That's fair.
Q. to Maggie Williams?
A. No, that's a fair question. As far as I know, that did not happen. As far as I know, any other checks that came in we really didn't -- were things that came in the mail and were just routinely referred -- and I don't even know if -- if there were any of those or how many there were. But as far as I know, there was no other instance like the one involving Maggie.
Now let me answer the other question as clearly as I can.
This -- the admission by the gentleman in question that, you know, he -- that he thought he was misrepresenting the facts to the Congress in the last debate has caused a lot of stir here. But I believe that the -- I believe -- and I tried to be clear about this at the time -- I was under the impression that the facts are just as we all said they were -- more or less what you said. I don't know that we have exact numbers.
What I said before was -- and let me restate it -- I sought to get a bill I could sign that would ban this procedure when it was inappropriate, because there would be other avenues available if an abortion was otherwise legal.
What I was concerned about, again -- and you said 500, I think, so let's just take your number; we don't really know --
Q. Actually, I think it's 5,000, Mr. President.
A. You have 5,000 total, of whom a small proportion, maybe 10 percent or so, are like those five women that I had in the White House. I will say again, they are my concern. They are my only concern. And I would remind you that three of those five women identified themselves to me as pro-life voters. And they were told that unless they had a procedure which would be banned under the law that I vetoed, after it was over, the babies they were carrying would be dead and their bodies would never be able to have another baby. That is my only concern.
I have made that as clear as I can. So I can't answer the question that you asked me any clearer than that because I want to see the language of any proposed bill.
I think you can make a very compelling case that for the small number of people I'm trying to protect this is the biggest issue in their entire lives and that for them my position is the pro-life position. And I believe that it would be a mistake for us to pass this bill one more time without taking care of those folks when -- because, as you just pointed out, Mr. Mikloshevsky, because anybody that's in the first two trimesters that has an elective procedure will still have access to another one in a different way after the bill passes.
So in a funny way this might not work to reduce the overall number of abortions at all. But in the end what it could do is every year to take a few hundred women and wreck their lives and wreck the possibility that they could have further children. That's why I was working on this. And if we can solve that problem, I will happily sign this bill.
This thing is a real -- it has hurt the American people, dealing with this. And I don't mean this harmed physically. I mean, this has been a great emotional trauma for the American people, trying to come to grips with this issue and deal with it. It's a deep thing out there around the country, and it goes way beyond the traditional pro-life/pro-choice fight or disagreement. I would like to see us bring some harmony to this and put it behind us.
But every time anybody mentions this, I remember so vividly the faces of those five women and their life stories and what happened to them afterward.
And, you know, a few hundred people a year, they don't have much votes or influence, but I -- they're the people I'm concerned about and they're the people I'm going to try to protect right down to the end.
Q. Mr. President?
A. Let's take one from Sarah, and then I've got to take one from Jill Dougherty because she's about to go to Moscow and she needs to have her parting shot.
Go ahead.
Q. This is on another subject. We have a very great problem in this country today, and I would wish you -- I wonder if you will use your leadership to counteract the rumors, the rumor-mongers that are abroad in the land who are spreading all these rumors and scaring people to death. Large segments of our citizens believe that the United Nations is taking over whole blocks of -- counties in Kentucky and Tennessee.
A. Yeah.
Q. And some of them, they believe that ----
A. Now, you all are laughing, but -- --
Q. We are -- concentration camp and you're going to give our army to Russia and all that baloney. Can you do something about this, because it's hurting the unity of the United States?
A. I don't know, because the people who believe that think I'm the problem. But -- we're all laughing about it, but there is a not insubstantial number of people who believe that there's a plan out there for world domination and I'm trying to give American sovereignty over to the U.N. There was a -- I read in the -- our local Arkansas newspapers, one of them, the other day a letter to the editor saying that there I go again, I'm -- there's Clinton out there trying to give American sovereignty over to the United Nations.
Let me just say this: For those that are worried about it, I would say there is a serious issue here that every American has to come to grips with, including Americans that don't much think about foreign policy until some great problem occurs, and that is how can we be an independent, sovereign nation leading the world in a world that is increasingly interdependent that requires us to cooperate with other people and then to deal with very difficult circumstances in trying to determine how best to cooperate.
That's the issue that you will all be reporting on for the next week in the Mexico certification issue. Did I do the right thing to certify Mexico? Or are the members of Congress who disagree with me right when they say we should have decertified Mexico and then given a national interest waiver so we could continue to cooperate economically and in other ways?
I strongly believe I was right, but don't -- you know, if you want to go into that, we can later, but the issue is we live in an interdependent world.
We have to cooperate with people. We're better off when we do. We're better off with NATO, we're better off with the United Nations, we're better off when these countries can work together.
So I just think, for folks that are worried about this out in the country, they need to be thinking about how -- we're not going to give up our freedom, our independence. But we're not going to go it alone into the 21st century, either. We're going to work together, and we have to.
Jill?
 
Russia and NATO
 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Speaking of Russia and NATO, yesterday we heard President Boris Yeltsin saying that the purpose or the motivation by the West for NATO expansion is to squeeze Russia out of Europe and politically marginalize it. And in a couple of weeks, you'll be sitting down with Mr. Yeltsin again. We've heard similar things from the Russians many times.
Are you making any progress in changing the Russians' position on this?
A. Well, I hope so. But let me answer the -- let me -- I'd like to make two points about it.
First of all, in this meeting that we're going to have in Helsinki, President Yeltsin and I -- it'll be very important; and yet it's important to recognize that it's part of a regular pattern of meetings, over the last several years, which have changed the nature of U.S.-Russian relations -- forever, I hope -- so that it'll be a meeting that'll be extremely candid, extremely self -- straightforward.
And I hope it will deal with, not only the question of Russia's relationship to Europe, but also what we can do with the Russians to continue to reduce the nuclear threat, and what we can do with the Russians to help them to build their economy because I am convinced that they have the capacity, if they can make certain changes, to enjoy a phenomenal amount of economic growth in a relatively short time, which I think would help a lot of things in their country.
Now on the merits, I have said since 1993 that one of my dreams for the 21st century world is a Europe that for the first time is united, democratic and free. Since the dawn of nation states, about the beginning of the last millennium in Europe, it has never been so. There has never been a single time when Europe was united, democratic and free. The final capstone of that, I think, is working out a security relationship with NATO, a European Union that is expanding and still tied -- a Europe still tied to the United States and to Canada, to North America, not only economically and politically, but also in terms of our security alliance.
But also it has a special relationship with Russia and does not rule out even Russian membership in a common security alliance.
The best answer I can give to President Yeltsin is what are we doing with NATO today and with whom are we doing it? What we are doing today is Bosnia. We together ended the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II, and we are doing it with Russia. And there are lots of other things we can do with Russia.
And the final point I want to make is among the great questions -- there are five or six great questions which will determine what the world will look like 30 or 40 years from now. One of those great questions is how will Russia and China, the two great former Communist powers, define their greatness in the next century? Will they define their greatness as we try to do, in terms of the achievements of our people, our ability to protect ourselves, and our ability to relate to other people, or will they define their -- and I think that's a more modern definition, if you will. Or will they define their greatness in terms of their ability to influence if not outright dominate the people that live around them as well as to control the political debate of people who live within their borders to a degree that I think is not helpful?
If that debate is resolved in the proper way, the 21st century is going to be a very good time for the American people.
So -- and I think you -- when you hear all this stuff about NATO, you have to understand that there's -- so there's two things going on: The Russians want to know, are we aggressive in NATO expansion, or defensive and looking at other targets, like Bosnia? Then they're having to define, in themselves, "Where do we want to be 25 or 30 years from now?"
And when they say things that we find offensive, I would ask the American people to understand their sensitivities. After -- we were never invaded by Napoleon or Hitler, and they were. So they're a little sensitive about the prospects of their borders.
And we're trying to work together for a better, brighter world. I think we're going to get there. I expect that the Helsinki meeting will be positive. But you should understand this is a tough debate and that they have reasons in their own psyche and circumstances that make it a difficult one.
Thank you.

Look at That! TV's a Window on Japan's Silly Side

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 7

 BODY:
On one channel, two men race around an obstacle course, clumps of slippery vanilla pudding swishing around on plates on their heads.
On another, dozens of chefs are cooking up mayonnaise masterpieces: mayonnaise cream puffs, mayonnaise ramen noodles, mayonnaise-and-meat hot pot, mayonnaise-cream pancakes, mayonnaise stir-fry. 
 And on another, two women are trying to crush soda cans by putting them in their cleavages and squeezing their bikini-clad breasts together.
So much for the image of serious Japan.
Anyone who turns on a television at night in Japan finds a succession of variety shows that are crazy, zany and absolutely inane. If a Western stereotype of Japanese is of painfully serious people who relax by taking off their dark jackets and listening to a Mozart CD, then a night watching Japanese television will disprove it.
"I really like what you call silly programs," said Kenichiro Horii, 39, a television columnist who has six televisions in his home office, three of which are on virtually all his waking hours. "I like programs that make no sense, that have no point. The more nonsensical they are, the more interesting I find them."
To be sure, every country has its share of inanity on the airwaves, and Japan does produce many sober television programs about domestic and international affairs. There may be more nudity on Japanese television than on American screens, but there is also sophisticated discussion of economics and ample cultural programming.
Moreover, a few variety programs have won thousands of fans for their inventiveness, and some Japanese television programming is broadcast elsewhere in Asia. Japan also produces engaging video games that sell well around the world.
But when it comes to creating television programs and movies, few people seem impressed. The pudding race program, for instance, was pulled off the air because its ratings were too low.
And these days, as the battle for Japan's airwaves heats up in anticipation of more cable channels and satellite TV programs, more and more Japanese are voicing frustration with their television programs.
"You can't be serious about what's going on the TV screen, it's such nonsense," said Hidetoshi Kato, a prominent sociologist. "It's not intellectual. It's not educational."
A typical Japanese viewer over 7 years old watched 3 hours and 47 minutes of television each day last year, down six minutes from the year before, according to the Broadcasting Culture Research Institute of NHK. In the United States, according to Nielsen Media Research, the television set in an average home is on for 7 hours and 48 minutes a day.
Prime time television is not focused on cops-and-robbers shows, sitcoms or family dramas. Instead, it is chock-full of low-budget game shows and variety programs in which TV personalities do things like engage 4-year-olds in tricycle courses during which they take bites from hanging doughnuts.
One program brought out a young child, told him that his mother had been shot to death and timed him to see how long it would take before he started crying. Other television hosts learn how to firm up their buttock muscles from exercise gurus like
Atsuo Doi, 52, who has written a book and formed his own Institute of the Healthy Method of Butt Exercising.
"The audience is becoming more easily bored and the younger they are, the more bored they become," said Hiroshi Watanabe, who directs a popular quiz show. "But TV programs these days just do the same thing over and over."
Repetition is not what inspired Mariko Toyota's recent angry letter to the Asahi Shimbun, a national daily. It was the increasingly absurd raciness on television.
"There are too many stupid TV programs," said Mrs. Toyota, 35. "TV stars go beyond common sense to take off their trousers. Sometimes they even take off their underwear to get a laugh."
"If this is the present status of Japanese comedy," she added, "it is pitiful."
On Saturday nights, for instance, one variety program offers viewers a strange mix of silliness and nudity.
In one episode, the program began with the introduction of a giant purple robot. The character, played by a contestant who had spent 150 hours to make this cardboard and plastic costume, shyly chatted with the show's hosts and hostesses before he and his escorts stumbled off stage.
Then the stage set changed and a middle-aged man dressed in a kimono described the personalities of three women by reading the lipstick prints they left on a glass window after kissing it in front of the audience. After a few skits featuring women in lingerie and another woman receiving a full body massage, the program moved on to scenes of a female photographer taking pictures of a woman stripping before the camera.
The program, which is supposed to help ease stress in both men and women, is aimed at Japan's best and brightest: college students.
"Students don't want to watch programs about social problems or politics when they come home, and would rather watch girls with nice bodies or girls in lingerie," said Kenichiro Ono, the program's producer. "They want to recover their energy through watching such programs. If it's after midnight, or 1 A.M., they just want to watch a program where they don't have to use their brain."
Mr. Ono seems to have reached an even younger audience. Irate mothers have sent in letters asking to move the show later because their grade-school sons were secretly waking up late at night to watch the show. Mr. Ono's two children, a son in seventh grade and a daughter in third grade, do not seem to have that problem. They go to sleep obediently at 9:30 P.M. and do not know what their father actually does at work every day.
"When my son becomes a high school student," Mr. Ono said, a bit embarrassed, "maybe he'll come to know exactly what kind of program his father is making."

HEADLINE: Mexico and Drugs

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 7

 BODY:
The furor over Mexico's troubled anti-drug efforts and President Clinton's endorsement of them has driven a wedge between the two countries, forcing Mr. Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo to balance their quest for cordial relations against the need to satisfy disgruntled domestic backers.
The abrasive debate is grinding down the two leaders' freedom to maneuver. Mr. Clinton, who faces a rebellion in Congress, has been compelled to press Mexico to step up its drug war and allow a heightened American involvement in it. But President Zedillo cannot sign off on the Administration's requests without incurring the wrath of increasingly assertive Mexican nationalists. 
 This excruciating dynamic became clear after a House committee voted by a wide margin on Thursday to override Mr. Clinton's full certification of Mexico's drug efforts.
The vote came after a tumultuous debate in which lawmakers attacked Mexico's drug program and even Mr. Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and set the stage for more fireworks next week.
Mr. Zedillo, visibly irritated, responded hours later with an unusually stern speech, vowing to "act with all necessary energy to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the Mexicans."
Mr. Zedillo was not specific about how Mexico might react if Congress makes good on its threat to reverse the certification. But Mr. Zedillo's tough statement, and the heated Congressional language in Washington, underlined the explosive tensions that are developing between the two countries five weeks before President Clinton is to make his first state visit to Mexico.
Mr. Clinton obviously would like that trip to be a triumphant parade focused on Mexico's newly robust economy, partly because of the $20 billion bailout loan he arranged in 1995, which Mexico has repaid.
Instead, the narcotics threat is threatening to dominate the two-day visit. And after the stunning arrest of Mexico's top drug official last month for collaboration with traffickers, White House aides have got to be concerned about the trip's potential for unpleasant surprises.
On Wednesday senior White House advisers, including Samuel Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, visited Mr. Zedillo here. Both Governments have insisted that their agenda focused on logistical details of the President's tour.
But Mr. Berger's visit was seen here as a new attempt to squeeze concessions from Mr. Zedillo, concessions that are viewed in dramatically different ways north and south of the border.
For instance, United States officials want Mexico to extradite Mexican citizens indicted on trafficking charges in the United States. Americans view Mexican resistance as little more than protecting criminals by subterfuge. But Mexican law prohibits the extradition of citizens except in "special circumstances."
The Clinton Administration has also pressed Mexico to permit American drug agents here to carry guns for protection. Mexicans view the request as an attempt to turn the agents, whose role here is limited to information gathering, into an elite foreign police force.
Perhaps most of all, American officials have pressed the Zedillo Government to arrest the country's major traffickers. On Thursday, more than 200 soldiers invaded a Guadalajara hotel, apparently in hopes of seizing Amado Carrillo Fuentes, perhaps the most powerful trafficker. Five unidentified men were detained, but not Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.
That makes it appear that Mr. Clinton has been unable to win any clear concessions, and Congress is accusing him of being soft on Mexico.
During the debate Thursday in Congress, one Administration official warned lawmakers that the threat to reverse the Administration's full certification could backfire by cutting off the possibility of "working with our friends in Mexico."
"You have the wrong friends down there," shot back Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat. "The only way that I know of having the correct friends is to provoke a crisis there, because until you get rid of the PRI, until you get democracy, you'll never get rid of the corruption."
Those and statements by other lawmakers greatly inflamed passions here. Today, Humberto Roque Villanueva, the PRI's president, called the certification debate in the United States "a frontal aggression against Mexican sovereignty."
If PRI allies have been vocal in expressing their outrage, they have been goaded into an increasingly militant stance by opposition leaders on the left and right.
Ricardo Garcia Cervantes of the conservative National Action Party, for example, accused PRI leaders today of acting with "timidity and defeatism" out of fear of provoking American anger.
Nationalist sentiments, building for two weeks, are cornering Mr. Zedillo. A Yale-trained economist, he has prefered to remain aloof from law enforcement issues like narcotics and organized crime. But when news of the congressional debate in Washington reached him on Thursday he immediately delivered what was, for him, an almost fiery speech.
Mexico's cooperation with the United States is "based on the principle of respect for our sovereignty," Mr. Zedillo said, his jaw clenched. "This principle is not negotiable." The minute that the United States passes any legislation "that can have consequences for Mexico's dignity and sovereignty, as well as material consequences for our cooperation with the United States, the Government of the republic will act with total energy to defend the dignity and the sovereignty of the Mexicans," he said.

HEADLINE: Michael Manley, Ex-Premier of Jamaica, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
Michael Manley, who dominated Jamaican politics for a generation and became one of the most eloquent spokesmen for third-world causes, died Thursday night at his home outside Kingston. He was 72 and had long suffered from prostate cancer.
In a political career that began under British colonial rule in the 1950's and ended only when declining health forced him to step down as Prime Minister in 1992, Mr. Manley championed issues ranging from Caribbean solidarity to the reordering of the global economy. 
 He was born to wealth and privilege but made his mark as an advocate for the impoverished and underprivileged, in Jamaica and throughout the developing world.
"Gross maldistribution of the world's wealth and food is no longer a moral offense only," Mr. Manley wrote in an article for The New York Times in 1975 that was a typical expression of his political views. "It now represents the greatest practical threat to peace and to any desirable development of mankind."
Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, Mr. Manley's protege, described his predecessor as a "colossal figure," and Jamaicans began lining up before dawn yesterday outside the Prime Minister's official residence to offer their condolences.
Michael Norman Manley was born in Kingston on Dec. 10, 1924, into one of the island's most notable families. His father, Norman Washington Manley, was an Oxford-trained lawyer and orator who was to lead Jamaica to independence as Prime Minister from 1955 to 1962. His English-born mother, Edna Swithenbank Manley, was a prominent sculptor.
From birth, Mr. Manley was raised in an atmosphere that combined political and artistic ferment. Norman Manley founded the People's National Party, which would eventually serve as the vehicle to power for both father and son, in 1938, while Edna Manley became the focal point of a lively circle of artists, poets and musicians who made the Manley estate, Drumblair, their second home.
Though Mr. Manley later said he considered himself "the most privileged man in Jamaica" because of that upbringing, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force as an 18-year-old, in part to establish an identity independent of his glittering parents. He served a year and a half but did not see combat.
Once World War II ended, he enrolled at the London School of Economics, where he was exposed to the democratic brand of socialism espoused by Harold Laski, who became his intellectual mentor.
After his return to Jamaica in December 1951, Mr. Manley quickly became involved in the trade union movement, focusing his efforts on improving salaries and living conditions for the island's sugar and bauxite workers. In 1962, when Jamaica achieved independence from Britain, he was appointed to the Senate; five years later, he was elected to Parliament and became vice president of the party his father was still leading.
In 1969, Norman Manley died, and Michael Manley succeeded him as president of the People's National Party. Tall, handsome, charismatic and a spellbinding orator who enthralled large crowds on the campaign trail, Mr. Manley won a landslide victory in the general election that followed in 1972, becoming Jamaica's fourth Prime Minister.
Once in office, Mr. Manley set out to reduce what he called the "irrational and dangerous" economic inequalities and class divisions that defined Jamaican society. He expanded the health and education systems, organized job training programs for the young and the unemployed, fostered racial pride and tried to encourage agricultural self-sufficiency through state farms.
That same year, Mr. Manley addressed the United Nations and chastised what he called "the misplaced priorities" of its members, "especially the most powerful and wealthy ones." Along with Prime Minister Indira Ghandi of India and President Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania, Mr. Manley became one of the most outspoken advocates of what he called a new international economic order for developing nations.
"The point is that now some two-thirds of mankind have been reduced to a peripheral status in political, economic and even social terms," he wrote. The solution, he argued, was a redistribution of the world's wealth, with the poor countries that "own the resources and provide the essential infrastructure and the labor force" getting a larger share. To do that, he argued in one memorable phrase, capitalism should be demolished "brick by brick."
At home, he tried to put theory into practice by raising royalties on exports of bauxite, the ore from which aluminum is made, and acquiring a controlling share of American and Canadian bauxite companies. He was successful on both counts, but in doing so antagonized the Nixon and Ford Administrations.
Mr. Manley also sought a much closer relationship with Cuba, which further strained his ties with the United States. He imported hundreds of Cuban doctors, teachers and construction workers and invited Fidel Castro, whom he described as "a man of extraordinary political sophistication," to visit Jamaica.
Later, Mr. Manley said that even though the United States "overreacted" to his friendship with Mr. Castro, he too bore part of the blame for the deterioration of Jamaica's relationship with Washington. "We became defiant about it, and that was a mistake," he said in 1988.
Though of mixed racial background, Mr. Manley also became one of most forceful boosters and benefactors of the Black Power movement that swept the Caribbean.
"An epoch of brainwashing in white-oriented society has left scars which, however unconscious, mar the inner assurance with which black people accept their own forms of beauty and excellence," he proclaimed in 1969.
In his 1972 election campaign, Mr. Manley often wore African garb and carried the "Rod of Joshua," an ebony-and-ivory staff said to have been given to him by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, as a symbol of moral authority and black pride. That helped win him the support of the Rastafarian movement and other black nationalists initially suspicious of his cosmopolitan, mulatto background.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Manley encouraged and subsidized Afro-Caribbean forms of cultural expression like reggae music, which became a global phenomenon during his tenure, persisting even when the lyrics of some songs criticized his policies. "If anybody is going to protest against me, at least I want them to do so with style," he once said, with characteristic good humor.
After more than 100 people were killed in outbreaks of gang and political violence in 1976, Mr. Manley, attributing the clashes to right-wing opponents, imposed a state of emergency. He won another resounding victory at the polls that year, but his second term was marked by increasing polarization and a sharp economic decline, which forced him to seek loans from his ideological adversaries at the International Monetary Fund.
In 1980 he was decisively defeated by a conservative, Edward P. G. Seaga of the Jamaica Labor Party, after a campaign in which an estimated 700 people were killed. His party boycotted the election called in 1983, complaining that promised electoral reforms had not been carried out, and it was not represented in Parliament for the next six years. Mr. Manley spent much of that time working on behalf of the Socialist International.
But he was returned to power early in 1989, after promising not to repeat the errors of his first period in office. He patched up his ties with the private sector and with the United States, saying at a news conference just after he was elected that "to allow ourselves to slide into an unnecessary state of tension" with Washington was a blunder "that can never happen again."
"I kept thinking that you could make the world economy submit to a system of political management to safeguard against injustice and inequity," Mr. Manley said in another interview that year, analyzing his earlier outlook. "I didn't realize the forces of production are too powerful, and their inherent logic too irresistible, to be made subservient to political barriers on a permanent basis."
As a result of his change of heart, Mr. Manley largely pursued orthodox free-market economic policies during his second stint in office. He let the Jamaican dollar float, removed price controls and subsidies, sped up the privatization of state-owned enterprises and relaxed restrictions on foreign investment, all of which won him praise from the United States.
"He has set a great example, and I admire his stance," President George Bush said. Nevertheless, Mr. Manley continued to assert that he was a socialist, arguing that "socialism is about equality" and vowing never to give up his commitment to economic and racial justice.
In 1992 he announced that he would step down for health reasons. He had undergone five operations for prostate cancer, diverticulitis and pneumonia, in which part of his lung and colon had been removed. In retirement he spent most of his time growing coffee and flowers on his farm outside Kingston or following sports, especially cricket, which he deeply loved.
Mr. Manley, who began his career as a journalist, first with the BBC and The Observer in London and later with newspapers in Kingston, was also the author of seven books and many essays and articles. His books ranged from a collection of his speeches and political volumes like "Poverty of the Nations: Reflections on Underdevelopment and the World Economy" to "A History of West Indies Cricket."
His body is to lie in state at the National Arena in Kingston next Friday and Saturday, the Government announced yesterday, and after a state funeral on March 16 will be buried at National Heroes' Park.
Mr. Manley is survived by his fifth wife, Glynne Ewert, and five children: Rachel, Joseph, Sarah, Natasha and David.

HEADLINE: Robert Lampman, 76, Economist Who Helped in War on Poverty

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Robert J. Lampman, a leading researcher on poverty, died on Tuesday at his home in Madison, Wis. He was 76.
The cause of death was lung cancer, his family said.
As an economist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Mr. Lampman pioneered efforts to measure income distribution. He is probably best known for his work on the staff of President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers. "He was the intellectual architect of the war on poverty," said James Tobin, the Nobel economist at Yale who was a member of the council at the time.
Mr. Lampman was born in Plover, Wis., where his father was a high school teacher. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin in 1942, he served as a naval air navigator in the Pacific during World War II, and then returned to Madison for graduate training. He earned a doctorate in labor economics under the tutelage of Edwin Witte, the New Deal activist who drafted the Social Security Act.
For a decade, Mr. Lampman taught at the University of Washington and researched income distribution. In 1958, he was appointed professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin, which remained his academic base thereafter.
Walter Heller, a colleague of Mr. Lampman's in graduate school and chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, brought him to Washington in 1962. While on the staff of the council, Mr. Lampman warned the White House that rapid economic growth alone would not eliminate poverty. Mr. Heller's liberal activism and Mr. Lampman's knowledge of the issues proved a good fit: the chapter on poverty in the 1964 Economic Report of the President, which was written by Mr. Lampman, provided the blueprint for the Johnson Administration's antipoverty initiative.
When he returned to the University of Wisconsin in the mid-1960's, he brought with him Federal financing for a permanent center to monitor the antipoverty effort. But he remained politically active, pressing for a "negative income tax" or guaranteed annual income for the poor. That movement eventually bore fruit in the earned-income tax credit.
Mr. Lampman was also a popular educator, quick to share credit with students and colleagues.
Mr. Lampman is survived by his wife, JoAnn; three sons, Jonathan, of Nanaimo, British Columbia, James, of Bismarck, N.D., and Thomas, of Anchorage; a daughter, Rebecca, of Olympia, Wash.; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

Joblessness Slips to 5.3%; Little Inflation Risk Seen
The job market grew at an unexpectedly brisk pace in February as the unemployment rate slipped a tenth of a point, to 5.3 percent, the Labor Department reported. 
 Payrolls expanded by 339,000, much more than was generally expected. Still, many economists described the overall job market as only modestly tighter than in January, noting the February numbers had been buoyed by weather that was unusually favorable for construction, and said there probably was not a big enough risk of wage inflation to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates at its March policy meeting. [Page 1.]
 
Dow Rallies, Closing Above 7,000
Technology stocks fell sharply, sending the Nasdaq 100 index tumbling 10.48 points, or 1.23 percent, to 841.03. But the Dow Jones industrial average, responding to the report that showed strong employment but few signs of inflation, rallied to gain 56.19 points, closing at 7,000.89. [39.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities surged, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 6.81 percent from 6.88 percent. [39.]
 
RJR Raises Cigarette Prices
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation raised the wholesale prices of its cigarettes an average of 4.7 percent, or 4 cents a pack. Analysts expect the rest of America's tobacco makers to follow suit quickly. [38.]
 
Conrail Agrees to $10.3 Billion Sale
Conrail formally agreed to sell the railroad to CSX for $10.3 billion, and Conrail's chairman, David M. LeVan, was negotiating severance packages, bonuses and contract dates. CSX is to buy Conrail for $115 a share by June 2 and negotiate with Norfolk Southern to split Conrail's freight network. [50.]
 
Hilton Expected to Raise ITT Bid
Hilton Hotels is expected to increase its $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT, analysts said, because of ITT's decision to sell its half interest in Madison Square Garden to Cablevision Systems for $650 million. But the sale does not derail Hilton's offer, now worth $55 a share in cash and stock, they said. [38.]
 
Changes Planned in Cable Sports
Now that Cablevision Systems is taking control of Madison Square Garden, Charles F. Dolan, Cablevision's chairman, is planning to overhaul the way local cable television subscribers pay for and choose sports programming, raising concerns about how much it will cost viewers. At issue are Yankees, Mets, Rangers, Knicks, Nets, Islanders and Devils games. [38.]
 
Yeltsin Names Economic Chief
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia named his most effective yet despised aide to a position that will essentially give him control of the economy. The appointment of the aide, Anatoly B. Chubais, as First Deputy Prime Minister had been expected and it was welcomed by Western investors who see the President's canny 41-year-old chief of staff as the only man capable of keeping the nation on the troublesome road to economic reform. [2.]
 
Hoffenberg Given 20 Years
Despite protestations by Steven Hoffenberg, left, that he did not deserve such a harsh punishment, Judge Robert W. Sweet carried out his announced plan and sentenced Mr. Hoffenberg to 20 years in prison for defrauding thousands of investors in his company, the Towers Financial Corporation. Judge Sweet said Mr. Hoffenberg had not accepted responsibility for the fraud and cited the effects of the loss of millions of dollars on victims' lives. [38.]
 
New York Near Lilco Debt Deal
The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki and the Long Island Lighting Company are close to completing a complex, $5 billion deal for the state to take over debt from the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant. [25.]
Dollar Rises Against the Yen
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, settling at 121.82 yen, up from 121.13 yen on Thursday, after the jobless report pointed to strong growth with little inflation. [40.]

Tunnels Are Reported Under Lima Residence
The Peruvian police dismissed allegations that they were burrowing a tunnel to the Japanese Ambassador's residence where 72 hostages are being held. But foreign officials and local journalists confirmed that one or more tunnels had been dug beneath the residence. News of the excavation irritated Japanese officials, who had been promised that they would be consulted before any police intervention. 1
 
U.S. Blocks U.N. on Jerusalem
The United States used its Security Council veto to block a resolution that strongly criticized the Israeli Government's plan to build a new Jewish settlement in mainly Arab East Jerusalem. But all 14 other Council members voted for the measure, which portrayed the Israeli plan as a threat to peace in the Middle East. 3
 
U.S.-Mexico Drug Turmoil
The furor in the United States over Mexico's troubled anti-drug efforts has driven a wedge between the two countries, forcing President Clinton and the Mexican President, Ernesto Zedillo, to balance their quest for cordial relations against the need to satisfy disgruntled domestic backers. 6

Yeltsin Chooses Unpopular Aide
President Boris N. Yeltsin has named Anatoly B. Chubais first deputy prime minister, a position that will give him control of the Russian economy. Russians greeted the appointment with skepticism, as Mr. Chubais, though effective, is hated for his effort to introduce privatization. The Communist Party said it would carry out any of Mr. Chubais's proposals. 2
 
10 Hurt in Beijing Blast
An explosion on a crowded Beijing street during rush hour wounded at least 10 people on a public bus, alerting the police to the possibility that recent bombings and unrest among Muslims in Western China had spread to the capital. The authorities were silent, refusing to confirm the number of casualties or whether the explosion had been caused by a bomb. 1
 
Haitian Indicted in Drug Case
Joseph Michel Francois, once Haiti's most powerful police commander, was indicted in Miami on Federal charges of helping to smuggle 33 tons of cocaine and heroin into the United States. A former colonel trained by the United States Army, Mr. Francois was an architect of the 1991 overthrow of President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Mr. Francois was arrested in Honduras and is being flown to Miami. 6
 
Bogota Resumes Coca Spraying
Colombia, which shocked the United States by suspending aerial eradication of coca crops, will resume the spraying. The program was suspended after Washington decertified Colombia as an ally in the drug war. Colombia has questioned American figures on coca production. 6

Clinton Says He, Too, May Have Sought Funds
President Clinton said he might have asked supporters for money during telephone conversations from the White House, as Vice President Gore did. In an unapologetic defense of fund-raising for his re-election, Mr. Clinton said that he had disliked making such calls but that he could have placed them legally. 1
 
The President sounded convinced that the uproar over his Administration's fund-raising tactics was not a national preoccupation, and that he needed only to stay cool and let it peter out. 1
 
Veterans' Deadline Extended
President Clinton said he would extend to 2001 the deadline that veterans of the war in the Persian Gulf must meet in filing claims for illnesses linked to their service. The change, which ended a requirement that ailment be reported within two years of a person's return from service, could affect as many as 5,000 veterans whose claims had been disallowed. 8
 
Ex-Soldier Isolated in Prison
The former paratrooper sentenced to life in prison for the racially motivated murder of a black couple is in protective isolation at his own request, the warden of North Carolina's Central Prison said. The former soldier, James N. Burmeister 2d, 21, was a member of a white supremacist group at Fort Bragg. Central Prison's inmate population is 67 percent black. (AP)
 
Flood Crest Reaches Louisville
The Ohio River crested at Louisville, bringing water into a few low-lying areas but leaving most of the city safely ensconced behind a 30-mile floodwall that was begun in the late 1940's. The city has closed 24 of the 45 floodgates across roads leading to the river as it faces the highest water in 33 years. 7

Woman Gets Life in Baby Theft
A Keokuk, Iowa, woman was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing an acquaintance so she could claim the woman's 6-week-old infant as her own. A jury on Thursday found Kimmi Hardy, 36, guilty of murder, kidnapping and child-stealing. The authorities said Mrs. Hardy fooled her husband, Robert, by faking a pregnancy and, on Aug. 28, lured Theresa Lynn Lund, 34, to her home and killed her. She then passed off Mrs. Lund's son, Paul, as her own. (AP)
 
Miami Street Fair Dispute
The Cuban-American organizers of a large Miami street fair have banned a Puerto Rican singer because of a gesture considered too friendly toward the Cuban Government. His exclusion has angered Puerto Ricans here, some of whom are threatening a protest at the festival this weekend. The singer, Andy Montanez, was barred for hugging Silvio Rodriguez, a Cuban folk singer who is considered a supporter of Fidel Castro, at a news conference in Puerto Rico on Monday. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Don't Aim for Balanced Budget at Working Class Expense

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your March 1 editorial advocates lowering the Consumer Price Index because adjusting it "is a better way to balance the budget than big cuts to public investments and other valuable Federal programs." This would provide a convenient hiding place for officials who want to avoid the tough choices we elected them to make. 
 Is the Consumer Price Index an accurate measure of the cost of living? The truth is we don't know. The politically appointed Boskin commission has said that the index overstates consumer costs. But other economists believe that the index understates costs in ways the Boskin commission didn't consider.
If cost-of-living adjustments are arbitrarily reduced, every Social Security recipient and every person receiving a Federal pension or disability benefit will suffer. Because the index serves as a benchmark for guiding wage increases, employers will justify giving smaller pay raises to working families. And because of the change in tax-bracket indexation, every working family will be forced to pay higher taxes.
Reducing Social Security COLA's on the basis of conjecture that the index overstates the cost of living is a shameful way to balance the budget, just as it was two years ago when the Democrats denounced it. That shame is compounded when the savings is used to pay for a capital gains tax cut for wealthy taxpayers.

HEADLINE: The Sword of Democracy

BYLINE: By Gary J. Bass; Gary J. Bass writes for The Economist and is a fellow at Harvard's Center for European Studies.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Still searching for a new strategic vision after the collapse of Soviet Communism, some of the West's brighter lights have seized on a theory hugely popular among political scientists: that democracies do not go to war against one another.
As Professor Jack Levy of Rutgers University has put it, the so-called democratic peace is "the closest thing we have to an empirical law in the study of international relations." But when diplomats and leaders of democratic countries open their mouths on the subject, they have an unsettling way of turning a peaceful idea into a veiled threat. 
 The most recent offender is Michael Portillo, the British Defense Minister. Mr. Portillo, after meeting on Monday with the American Defense Secretary, William Cohen, explained why Russia should learn to stop worrying and love NATO expansion: "Perhaps the most important element of all in the new security architecture is the existence of so many new democratic countries, because democratic countries do not go to war with each other. Democratic countries do not invade one another. We must convince Russia that the very undertaking of expanding NATO is one of the things that helps to underpin security and democracy in those newly democratic countries."
But if democracies pose no threat to one another, and Russia is a democracy, what's the point of bringing the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland into NATO? Maybe we should instead be concentrating on insuring that Russia remains democratic. Or if Mr. Portillo reckons that Russia is not really a democracy and therefore might be a threat to the fledgling democracies in Central Europe, mentioning the democratic peace serves only as a slap to the Russians rather than as a reassurance.
In his 1994 State of the Union Message, President Clinton declared: "Ultimately the best strategy to insure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other." And at the height of the crisis in Haiti in 1994, he argued for military intervention, saying, "Democracies here are more likely to keep the peace."
Mr. Clinton had many good reasons for intervention: to protect Haitians from the brutality of the junta, to stop the rush of refugees and to honor his own campaign oratory. But it is hard to believe he was acting because he feared that Haiti would become a military threat to the region.
In the Mideast, the democratic peace argument has been used as an ad hominem insult of Israel's undemocratic neighbors. In March 1995, when President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was complaining about Israel's atomic arsenal, Shimon Peres, then Israel's Foreign Minister, responded, "The solution to the nuclear problem is democratization, since democratic countries do not use nuclear weapons against their neighbors." Mr. Peres may be right, but he was really avoiding the issue. He implied that Egypt had no right to criticize Israel because Egypt was an authoritarian country.
The thought of a world where democracy brings peace is compelling. But the idea should not be used to hide other political motivations, to antagonize undemocratic regimes for the mere sake of doing so, or simply as an all-purpose buzzword. And it should not become an excuse for belligerence.

HEADLINE: Nenad Dusan Popovic, 87, Aide To Tito Who Defected to West

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Nenad Dusan Popovic, a leading economic expert in Tito's Communist Yugoslavia who defected in 1961 to teach and write in exile at Syracuse University, died on Feb. 25 of bone cancer at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 87.
Professor Popovic was chief of economic affairs in the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry when he took refuge, making him one of the highest-ranking Yugoslav officials to defect to the West. Part of his mission was to negotiate loans and credits for the Yugoslav Government. 
 By his own account he had become thoroughly disillusioned with the Communist system and had planned a getaway with his family for some years. Once securely in this country, he accepted a professorship at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse.
He taught comparative socialist and Western economics and the economics of less-developed countries. He received emeritus status as professor of international political economy in 1975 but continued to teach until about 10 years ago.
He wrote in Serbo-Croatian and English, translating the authors Louis Bromfield and Somerset Maugham into his native tongue.
In 1968 he published "Yugoslavia: The New Class in Crisis," an echo of Milovan Djilas's caustic analysis of a self-perpetuating upper crust in an ostensibly classless system. In Mr. Popovic's version, power began to shift from clique to Communist clique with the entire system bound to crumble.
Nenad Popovic was born in Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He received a law degree from Belgrade University in 1932 and started a career as a banker and banking writer during the period of political turmoil between the world wars.
The experience, he said later, left him dazzled by the social revolution in the Soviet Union. He joined the Communist Party, sub rosa, before World War II and spent most of the war as a German prisoner, only to be shunned by the Communists because of his bourgeois upbringing.
Among other sins, he was a godson of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, whose assassination in 1914 in Sarajevo touched off World War I.
Though he was banished from the Communist Party, connections nonetheless allowed Mr. Popovic to write under a pseudonym for the party newspaper Borba until his column's popularity brought him official rehabilitation.
He served as an economic planner and vice president of the State Economic Council of Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, before being detached in 1950 to the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He was also among the experts at the United Nations and in Paris who set up the International Development Agency and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Tatyana; two daughters, Gina Goldhammer and Sanya Popovic-Bogdanich, both of Manhattan, and a grandson.

HEADLINE: William Joseph Cahill Jr., 73, Nuclear Plant Executive for Power Authority

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
William Joseph Cahill Jr., the nuclear engineering executive whom the New York Power Authority brought back in 1994 to fix the trouble-prone generators he had helped build for Con Edison decades earlier, died Feb. 26 at a Dallas hospital. He was 73 and lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and St. Francisville, La.
He apparently suffered a heart attack while riding to a hotel from Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, the Power Authority reported. He was in Texas as a consultant for Texas Utilities, a former employer. 
 The New York Power Authority announced a month ago that Mr. Cahill, a 40-year veteran of the industry, was stepping down as its chief nuclear officer while remaining available as a consultant to the authority and others in the industry. The agency put him in charge of its nuclear-power program in April 1994 when it was having difficulties with its generating plants, Indian Point 3 in Westchester County and James A. FitzPatrick in Oswego County.
At the time Federal regulators listed the two plants among the worst-run in the country in 1993. The problem, they said, was bad management, not the age of the equipment.
FitzPatrick, in Scriba, N.Y., came off the list in 1994. Indian Point 3 at Buchanan, N.Y., emerged from a six-month shutdown a year ago, when it was reported on the mend after a three-year rebuilding.
Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the New York Power Authority, said recently that FitzPatrick was taken out of service for refueling in 1966 for 47 days, the shortest and most effective such down-time in its history. Both FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 are currently performing at about 100 percent of their capacity, he said.
The agency credited Mr. Cahill with the substantial progress shown at both plants.
He was born in Stony Point, N.Y., and graduated in mechanical engineering from Polytechnic University (then Institute) of Brooklyn in 1949. He started his career that year with the Consolidated Edison Company.
He held various engineering posts and took part in the licensing, design, construction and operation of the nuclear generating plants at Indian Point. He helped design Indian Point 1 at Buchanan, the nation's first civilian nuclear power plant.
It began operation in 1962 but became an economic liability in the mid-1970's for want of up-to-date safety equipment and was decommissioned in 1980. Gazing at its low, rounded dome that snowy February day, Mr. Cahill commented, "It's the end of the beginning."
He left in 1980 as a vice president and became a senior vice president for the Gulf State Utilities Company of St. Francisville, La. In 1988 he joined Texas Utilities as group vice president for nuclear production and oversaw the commissioning of its two-unit Comanche Peak Nuclear Project in 1990 and 1993.
Mr. Cahill is survived by his wife of 43 years, Edna Kiernan Cahill; a son, William E., of Deer Park, L.I.; two daughters, Kathleen, of Catskill, N.Y., and Madeleine, of Hadley, Mass.; a sister, Gloria Fetterhoff of Harrisburg, Pa., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Vacuum of Power Pulling Neighbors Into Zaire Conflict

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, March 8

 BODY:
With a rebel force that invaded Zaire advancing through the countryside, new participants who want to secure vital interests here or settle old scores are being drawn into the conflict.
From the outset last October, the rebellion sweeping eastern Zaire has been an affair of outsiders. The rebels, supplied by the Tutsi-led Government of neighboring Rwanda, have been chasing remnants of Zaire's army and its Hutu allies through thick Central African forests. 
 Now the fall of the longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, is appearing ever more likely. So governments of neighboring countries and insurgent groups from throughout Central Africa are scrambling to get involved on one side or the other of the conflict, diplomats, Zairian officials and regional military experts say.
A growing coalition of forces is contributing to the fight against Mr. Mobutu, in what can be seen as a form of revenge for the decades during which Zaire, a major cold war ally of the West, was used as a staging point for covert actions against neighbors.
The most dramatic case of new activity from outside involves Zaire's southern neighbor, Angola. Throughout two decades of civil war in that country and now under an uneasy peace there, Zaire has played a critical role in support of the Unita rebel movement of Jonas Savimbi, once with the heavy covert assistance of the United States.
In recent weeks, the experts and officials say, Angola has been flying Zairian rebels, long exiled after an unsuccessful revolt, along with military supplies, into eastern Zaire to join the burgeoning insurgency of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo-Zaire. Angola's formerly Marxist Government apparently is anxious to cut Mr. Savimbi off from gun-running and diamond-trading networks in Zaire.
Most exiles are sons of the so-called Katanga Gendarmes, who repeatedly fought secessionist wars for control of Zaire's copper-rich Shaba province beginning shortly after independence from Belgium in 1960.
Zairian officials and diplomats say that there is increasingly strong evidence of flights from Angola into the rebel-held cities of Kalemie, Uvira and Bukavu in Zaire.
They say that in recent battles, Zairian Government forces were routed in the cities of Bunia and Bafwasende by Portuguese-speaking African troops, apparently from Angola.
Angola has denied any involvement in the Zairian war. But in a diplomatic note sent to Mr. Mobutu's Government last month, Angola, which now enjoys good ties with the United States, reportedly warned that it would attack Zaire if it did not end its support for Mr. Savimbi.
Last week, the United States publicly called upon Angola to stay out of the Zairian war.
In an assertion that Western diplomats said they could not confirm, advisers to Mr. Mobutu said on Friday that Angola has begun massing Swahili-speaking rebels, apparently from eastern Zaire, in Angola's oil-rich coastal enclave of Cabinda in preparation for an attack on Kinshasa, a mere 200 miles away.
The Zairian officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that that intelligence had come from another Angolan rebel group, the Cabinda-based insurgency known by its acronym as FLEC.
"FLEC attacked the Angolans recently and were pursued by them all the way into Zairian territory," said an associate of Mr. Mobutu. "When they reached here they informed us that they had encountered Swahili speakers in their retreat." Swahili, a lingua franca of East Africa, is not spoken in southwestern Zaire or Angola.
For its part, the Zairian Government, unable to rely upon its own woeful army or a few hundred Serbian mercenaries to stop the rebels' advance on the important eastern city of Kisangani, has reportedly obtained battle-hardened troops on loan from Mr. Savimbi's Unita movement.
Asked to confirm those reports, the associate of Mr. Mobutu said: "We have looked to friends in Africa to help us. Even if we end up losing Kisangani, we must make the rebels pay a high enough price so that they will sit down and talk seriously."
Diplomats here say they have been unable to explain how the Zairian rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, has been able to clothe, arm and supply his fast-growing movement, keeping its units supplied with radios, for example, down to the squad level.
Much, but not all, of Mr. Kabila's support has come from Rwanda and Uganda. Although the evidence is less certain, military experts say they suspect that other Governments in the region, along with sympathetic rebel movements like the southern Sudan guerrillas led by John Garang, may also be aiding Mr. Kabila, or simply cutting deals with him.
International relief officials say there is clear evidence that Zaire tolerated the arming of Hutu militia members who once attacked Rwanda and Burundi from refugee camps near the borders with those countries. Similarly, diplomats say that in addition to supporting Mr. Savimbi, who reportedly maintains a residence here, Zaire has allowed its territory to be used to supply anti-Government guerrillas in Uganda, and Sudanese Government troops fighting Mr. Garang's forces in the southern Sudan.
The Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, has longstanding ties to the Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame, as well as to Mr. Kabila, and to leaders in Tanzania and Angola. And for all of those countries, establishing a sympathetic Government in Zaire could end years of destabilization and disorder coming from a decaying and corrupt neighbor.
Because of the United States' warm relations with Rwanda and Uganda, and condemnation of the Government in Sudan, both Zairian officials and news reports here routinely accuse the United States -- long Mr. Mobutu's closest ally -- of masterminding the the onslaught against the Government here.
Western diplomats deny any American involvement, and say that what is happening is the consequence of years of mischief and drift in Zaire.
"All of these years, Zaire has been playing with fire, and now it looks like it is finally getting burned," said one Western military expert. "The Angolan Government, for one, has every reason to be fed up with Kinshasa, and may have figured that this was the right occasion to make them pay."
With the situation in Zaire becoming increasingly confused and as the number of players grows, however, many say there is a risk that the help that Zaire's neighbors have been providing to the rebels could in the end increase instability, with overcrowded neighbors like Rwanda coveting croplands and others seeking to control Zaire's vast mineral wealth.
Officials in Rwanda and Uganda have, for example, spoken with increasing enthusiasm in recent days about the economic benefits of a rebel victory for their country.
"If Zaire is ripped apart by all of the hands that are getting involved in the game here, it will be a long time before anyone is able to speak of synergies," said one African diplomat here. "The dismemberment of Central Africa's largest country, if it were to happen, would be the ugliest disaster we have seen yet."

Rebel Rejects Immediate Truce
 GOMA, Zaire, March 8 (Reuters) -- The Zaire rebel leader said today that rebels could accept a five-point United Nations plan as a basis for more discussions but that a cease-fire could only come after talks.
Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader, said his forces were within 30 miles of Kisangani, the biggest city in northeast Zaire, and advancing from several directions. But he said at a news conference in the eastern Zairian border city of Goma that his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire was meeting heavy resistance from former Rwandan troops.
Mr. Kabila said the rebels could accept the peace plan, which the Government had accepted under the pressure of rebel advances, but only as the basis for talks before any cease-fire.
An immediate cease-fire is the first point of the peace plan, which the United Nations Security Council adopted on Feb. 18. On Friday, the United Nations urged Mr. Kabila's rebels to accept the plan and stop fighting.
Mr. Kabila has said in the past that he would negotiate with Mr. Mobutu only over how he will step down.

HEADLINE: Bonn Said to Expel U.S. Diplomat for Spying

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BONN, March 8

 BODY:
Germany has expelled a United States diplomat for spying, the magazine Spiegel reported today, adding that the incident between the two close allies was unprecedented.
In a report released ahead of publication on Monday, Spiegel said the diplomat had been caught trying to recruit senior officials from the German Economics Ministry and to obtain information on what it called "high-tech projects." 
 He had been uncovered by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, it said. Officials there and at the United States Embassy in Bonn were not available for comment.
Spiegel said that because of the good relations between the two NATO allies, the affair was discreetly settled by the United States and German intelligence agencies without a formal summons for the United States Ambassador and without declaring the man persona non grata. A spokeswoman for the State Department declined comment.
Citing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's security coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, Spiegel said Bonn had asked Washington to "drastically reduce" the number of C.I.A. officials it had operating in Germany.

HEADLINE: Science, Not Cost, Guides G.E. Policy on Hudson River Cleanup

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As you note (editorial, March 2), the issue of what, if anything, to do about the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, bound up in sediments of the upper Hudson River is again at center stage. In 1984 the Environmental Protection Agency said those sediments, which resulted from General Electric's legal discharge of PCB's decades before, posed a "decreasing threat to public health and the environment." The agency rejected dredging as unreliable and potentially catastrophic to the environment. 
 Now you and the public are struggling to understand what the E.P.A.'s most recent report about the river means. What is needed is more light on the science and the ramifications of potential solutions.
For example, you point to a key scientific and technical issue that must be resolved before a solution is picked: Do PCB's flowing out of a six-mile stretch called the Thompson Island Pool come from old, deeply buried sediments, or are they seeping from sources upstream that G.E. is committed to finding and fixing?
While cost is important, making the wrong choice has broad implications. If the mud at the bottom isn't causing the problem, moving it will not reduce risk. If the mud isn't causing the problem, the disruption of any dredging and landfilling program will be cruel to the agricultural and tourism economy of the upper Hudson.
The E.P.A. has misread science that points to the mud as not being the problem. The agency has discounted measurements that show our remediation of upstream sources is having beneficial effects. We have launched a thorough investigation of the Thompson Island Pool, which the E.P.A. has declined to join.
The E.P.A. seems to have set a course toward the riskiest, least effective and most disruptive solution, not the one that serves the broadest interest.

Less Medicare, More Magic

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
The serious journals are full of alarms about a budgetary crisis that threatens to sink America in perhaps 20, maybe 30, surely 50 years. They say that I, as one of the elderly, am a major cause of the impending catastrophe. I am accused of bleeding the Government by claiming a richer pension and health insurance than my contributions would have earned from an insurance company. And I am accused of producing so many boomer children that *their* retirement with similar benefits will surely deplete the Treasury.
Duly shamed, I am struggling to help shape a remedy. I have absorbed Peter Peterson's "Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old?" in hardcover and newsprint and scores of reactions: Paul Krugman's rave (and recantation) on the Web; critiques by John Judis in The New Republic and John Cassidy in The New Yorker; caveats from Herbert Stein in The Wall Street Journal and a ream of Op-Ed essays in The Washington Post and The New York Times. I've come through a dense semantic fog. 
 Plainly, the Social Security payroll taxes exacted from me and my boss by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act of 1935 (F.I.C.A.) were never handled as "insurance contributions" to any "trust fund." The taxes were simply mingled with Treasury revenues and spent not only for pension and Medicare payments to my parents but also on highways, moon shots, drug busts and jungle wars. Similarly, the retirement benefits now owed to me are being paid, along with all other Government expenses, with all the taxes drawn from the working population.
So while Social Security and Medicare masquerade as capitalistic insurance schemes, they serve the socialistic function of redistributing wealth, from the energetic young to the retired old. And the popularity of those programs, I am convinced, is sustained by this duplicity. By covering almost all the elderly, irrespective of need, they have avoided the stigma that attaches to other redistributions, like welfare and Medicaid. The young have borne a growing burden because they were assured their turn to benefit would come. The old have cashed their checks with no trace of guilt because they've been led to believe they are only drawing down their own investments.
"The resulting consensus about the system is its magic," said the late Arthur Okun, a Great Society economist; the fiction of earmarked contributions "serves mainly to preserve pride" while actually fulfilling a "right to survival." But he wrote 20 years ago. Now Peterson and other hardheaded analysts condemn Okun's consensus as a cruel Ponzi scheme, a promise of entitlements that threaten to bankrupt the nation. Whereas every person over 65 is currently supported by the taxes of five working people, the rapid aging of the population, they warn, means that every retiree in 2030 can expect support from only three.
That bleak prospect assumes that Medicare outlays will continue to grow much faster than the general cost of living and go on claiming two of every three Government dollars paid to the elderly. Yet though we old folks run up huge hospital and nursing bills in the last years of life, Americans have only begun to discover how to reduce medical costs. I don't think we should bet against our learning to live more healthily and to age less expensively.
Still, the number of the aged will soon explode, and they will live longer than ever before. The sooner we cover their deficits the less painful the retrenchment. All the available remedies involve some increase in payroll deductions -- either modest tax increases or genuine contributions to annuity schemes. And all the experts urge assorted caps and cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare allowances, with new efforts to steer benefits away from the affluent toward the needy. There are suggestions to raise the retirement age past the already scheduled increase from 65 to 67. There are responsible plans to reduce the cost-of-living increases in Social Security pensions and to withhold benefits from retirees with sizable earnings or investments. And there are many ideas for making most of the elderly pay a larger share of their medical expenses.
My greatest concern, however, is not for the economics of the remedy, but for the ecumenism of its design. I want to preserve Arthur Okun's magical consensus -- and the psychic income that the liberated young have derived for half a century from the independence of the old.
"My mother thanks you," I said to Lyndon Johnson after he signed Medicare into law in 1965.
"No," he replied, "It's *you* who should be thanking me."
As Peterson and other conservatives urge, Congress could invoke the specter of bankruptcy to impose forced savings on future generations and to ration payments to the elderly with a means test that would eventually pay benefits only to the "truly needy." But as we know from Medicaid, a means test will have two deplorable consequences. It will tempt the non-needy to shed their assets to qualify for benefits, as many have done to get Medicaid coverage in nursing homes. And it will stigmatize all aid to the elderly poor as "welfare," depriving them of significant political support.
The only effective way to favor the poor without robbing them of dignity and public favor is to preserve the universality of Social Security -- and to quietly reclaim moneys from the affluent by progressively taxing their medical and pension benefits.
One other image in this discussion urgently needs repair. It is destructive to stir up intergenerational warfare. That would occur if a powerful voting bloc of the elderly were pitted against an angry younger population. But there is no profit for either side in such a war. If the elderly emerged with wildly excessive benefits, they would only succeed in devaluing the currency in which they are ultimately paid. And if the young reneged on too many promised benefits, they would only inherit the burden of their parents' distress and feel compelled to support them in other ways.
Cut back on Medicare. But keep the magic.

 BODY:
Back in the early 1980's, before most of us had ever heard of the Internet, science-fiction writers like Bruce Sterling invented a genre that came to be known as cyberpunk. Its protagonists were usually outlaw computer hackers, battling sinister multinational corporations for control of cyberspace (a term coined by another sci-fi novelist, William Gibson). But in his 1996 novel, "Holy Fire," Sterling imagines a rather different future: a world ruled by an all-powerful gerontocracy, which appropriates most of the world's wealth to pay for ever more costly life-extension techniques. And his heroine is, believe it or not, a 94-year-old medical economist.
When the novel first came out, it seemed that Sterling was behind the curve. Public concern over medical costs peaked about four years ago, then dropped off sharply. Not only did the Clinton health care plan crash and burn, but the long-term upward trend in private medical costs also flattened, as corporations shifted many of their employees into cost-conscious H.M.O.'s. Even as debates over how to save Social Security make headlines, few question budget plans by both Congress and the Administration, which assume, while being systematically vague about the details, that the growth of Medicare can be sharply slowed with few ill effects. With remarkable speed, in other words, we have gone from a sense of crisis to a general belief that the problem of health costs will more or less take care of itself. 
 But in recent months, there has been a flurry of stories with the ominous news that medical costs are on the rise again. Suddenly, our recent complacency about health care costs looks as unjustified as our previous panic. In fact, both the panic and the complacency seem to stem from -- what else? -- a misdiagnosis of the nature of the problem.
Over the last generation, the U.S. economy has been digitized; it has been globalized; but just as important, it has become medicalized. In 1970 we spent 7 percent of our gross domestic product on medical care; today the number is twice that. Almost 1 worker in 10 is employed in the health care service industry; if this trend continues, in a few years there will be more people working in doctors' offices and hospitals than in factories.
So what? As Joseph Newhouse, a Harvard health economist, put it, "Neither citizens nor economists . . . are especially concerned about rapid growth in most sectors of the economy, like the personal computer industry, the fax machine industry or the cellular phone industry." Yet where the growth of other industries is usually regarded as a cause for celebration, the growth of the medical sector is generally regarded as a bad thing. (Not long ago, an article in The Atlantic Monthly even proposed a measure of economic growth that deducts health care from the G.D.P., on the grounds that medical expenditures are a cost, not a benefit.) Indeed, the very phrase "medical costs" seems to have the word "bloated" attached to it as a permanent modifier: we are not, everyone agrees, getting much for all that money.
Or are we? There is, of course, some truth to what Newhouse calls the "cocktail party story of excessive medical spending." Traditional medical insurance gives neither physicians nor their patients an incentive to think about costs; the result can be what Alain Enthoven, a health care reform advocate, calls "flat of the curve" medicine, in which doctors order any procedure that might possibly be of medical value, no matter how expensive. Reintroducing some incentives can produce important savings.
In 1983, for example, Medicare replaced its previous policy of paying all hospital costs with a new policy of paying hospitals a lump sum for any given procedure. The result was an immediate sharp drop in the average number of days in the hospital, with no apparent adverse medical effects. But after that one-time saving, the cost of hospitalization began rising again. There is, in fact, a clear rhythm in the health care industry. Every once in a while, there is a wave of cost-cutting moves -- fixed fees for Medicare, replacing traditional insurance with H.M.O.'s -- that slows the growth of medical expenses for a few years. But then the growth resumes.
Why can't we seem to keep the lid on medical costs, for older adults and for everyone else as well? The answer -- the clean little secret of health care -- is simple: we actually do get something for our money. In fact, there is a consensus among health care experts that the main driving force behind rising costs is neither greed nor inefficiency nor even the aging of our population but technological progress.
Medical expenditures used to be small, not because doctors were cheap or hospitals were well managed but because there was only so much that medicine had to offer, no matter how much you were willing to spend. Since the 1940's, however, every year has brought new medical advances: new diagnostic techniques that can (at great expense) identify problems that could previously only be guessed at; new surgical procedures that can (at great expense) correct problems that could previously only be allowed to take their course; new therapies that can (at great expense) cure or at least alleviate conditions that could previously only be endured. We spend ever more on medicine mainly because we keep on finding good new things that (a lot of) money can buy.
It is often argued that the share of our national income that we devote to health care cannot continue to rise in the future as it has in the past. But why not? An old advertising slogan asserted that "when you've got your health, you've got just about everything." Sterling's protagonist goes through an implausible procedure (albeit one based on an extrapolation of some real medical research) that restores her youth; who would not give most of their worldy goods for that? Even barring such medical miracles, it is not hard to imagine that some day we might be willing to spend, say, 30 percent of our income on treatments that prolong our lives and improve their quality.
Some economists therefore argue that we should stop worrying about the rise in medical costs. By all means, they say, let us encourage some economic rationality in the system -- for example, by eliminating the bias created by the fact that wages are taxed but medical benefits are not -- but if people still want to spend an ever-growing fraction of their income on health, whether for older adults or for all Americans, so be it.
But matters are not quite that simple, for medicine is not just like other goods.
The most direct difference between medicine and other things is that so much of it is paid for by the Government. In most advanced countries, the government pays for most medical care; even in free-market, anti-government America, the public sector pays for more than 40 percent of medical expenditures. This in itself creates a special problem. It is not at all hard to see how the American economy could support a much larger medical sector; it is, however, very hard to see how the U.S. Government will manage to pay for its share of that sector's costs.
When Cassandras like Pete Peterson, the former Commerce Secretary, present alarming numbers about the future burden of baby boomers on the budget, it turns out that only part of that prospective burden represents the sheer demographic effects of an aging population: forecasts of rising medical costs account for the rest. Despite the aging of our population, the Congressional Budget Office projects that in 2030, Social Security payments will rise only from their current 5 percent of G.D.P. to about 7 percent -- but it projects that Medicare and Medicaid will rise from 4 percent to more than 10 percent of G.D.P. (Some people dismiss such forecasts: they point out that if medical costs were to rise to that extent, by the time baby boomers become a problem, health care would be a much larger share of G.D.P. than it is today -- and that, they insist, is just not going to happen. But why not?)
Some might then say that the answer is obvious: we must abandon the idea that everyone is entitled to state-of-the-art medical care. (That is the hidden subtext of politicians who insist that Medicare is not being cut -- that all that they are doing is slowing its growth.) But are we really prepared to face up to the implications of such an abandonment?
We have come to take it for granted that in advanced nations almost everyone can at least afford the essentials of life. Ordinary people may not dine in three-star restaurants, but they have enough to eat; they may not wear Bruno Maglis, but they do not go barefoot; they may not live in Malibu, but they have a roof over their head. Yet it was not always thus. In the past, the elite were physically superior to the masses, because only they had adequate nutrition: in the England of Charles Dickens, the adolescent sons of the upper class towered an average of four inches above their working-class contemporaries. What has happened since represents a literal leveling of the human condition, in a way that mere comparisons of the distribution of money income cannot capture.
There is really only one essential that is not within easy reach of the ordinary American family, and that is medical care. But the rising cost of that essential -- that is, the rising cost of buying the ever-growing list of useful things that doctors can now do for us -- threatens to restore that ancient inequality with a vengeance.
Suppose that Lyndon Johnson had not signed Medicare into law in 1965. Even now there would be a radical inequality in the prospects of the elderly rich and the ordinary older citizen; the affluent would receive artificial hip replacements and coronary bypasses, while the rest would (like the elderly poor in less fortunate nations) limp along painfully -- or die.
The current conventional wisdom is that the budget burden of health care will be cured with rationing -- the Federal Government will simply decline to pay for many of the expensive procedures that medical science makes available. But what if, as seems likely, those procedures really work -- if there comes a time when those who can afford it can expect to be vigorous centenarians, and perhaps even buy themselves smarter children, while those who cannot can look forward only to the biblical threescore and ten. Is this really a tolerable prospect?
There is, some might say, no alternative. But of course there is. It is possible to imagine a society that taxes itself heavily to provide advanced medical care to everyone and that rations that care not by wealth but by other criteria. (Bruce Sterling's imaginary future is ruled by "the polity," a nanny state that rewards not wealth but personal hygiene: society takes care of those who take care of themselves.)
Such an outcome sounds unthinkable in the current political climate, which is dominated by a low-tax, anti-government ideology. But history is not over; ideologies may change. For all we know, the future may belong to the medical welfare state, a state whose slogan might be "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

 WHITTAKER CHAMBERS
 A Biography.
 By Sam Tanenhaus.
 Illustrated. 638 pp. New York:
 Random House. $35. 
 The 20th century has seen some famous trials in America -- Tom Mooney, John T. Scopes, Sacco and Vanzetti, Leopold and Loeb, Bruno Richard Hauptmann and, one must add (I reluctantly suppose), O. J. Simpson -- but for people of a certain age and political concern the trial of Alger Hiss remains paramount. The death of Alger Hiss last November, and now, four months later, the appearance of "Whittaker Chambers," a copious biography of his accuser, renew memories of the case that electrified, divided and tormented the republic nearly half a century ago.
Chambers has always been an enigmatic figure. Worshiped by his friends, despised by his foes, ponderous, cryptic, opaque, secretive, he seemed at once to enjoy and to resent the burdens of history. His biographer, Sam Tanenhaus, a freelance journalist, has done a careful and exhaustive job of research. His approach to his protagonist is sympathetic but not hagiographic, and his prose is clear, trenchant and well paced. His book will not please all readers, but even remaining defenders of Alger Hiss must acknowledge it, I believe, as a serious and absorbing work.
Chambers, born Jay Vivian Chambers in Brooklyn on April Fool's Day in 1901, grew up in what would be called today a dysfunctional family. His bisexual father periodically disappeared and returned. His mother, Laha Whittaker, as romantic as her first name, was artistic, aspiring, hopeful and doomed to disappointment. His grandmother went mad. His brother committed suicide.
Young Chambers, who did not like "Jay Vivian" and replaced it with his mother's maiden name, entered Columbia University as a member of the class of '24. Among his student contemporaries were Lionel Trilling, Clifton Fadiman, Meyer Schapiro and Mortimer J. Adler. He took to writing, and his poems and stories won him a local literary reputation. But he was restless and questing, seeking always, as he wrote, "some meaning to the life we live."
This he thought he found when he came upon Lenin's "Soviets at Work" in 1924. At once all was clear. He now saw the disintegration of his family as "in miniature the whole crisis of the middle class." Dysfunctionality was the consequence of a larger capitalist trap from which Communism promised liberation. He was not worried by the prospect of dictatorship. "Lenin's authoritarianism," Mr. Tanenhaus shrewdly writes, "is precisely what attracts Chambers. . . . He had at last found his church."
For the next half-dozen years, Chambers was an open Communist. He had his troubles with the party, even withdrawing at one point after the purge of the dissident Lovestone faction, but, Mr. Tanenhaus writes, "he needed to belong to a movement, to subordinate himself to an organization, even one whose methods appalled him," and he soon came back. When the Great Depression seemed to vindicate Marxist prophecies, Chambers, now an editor of The New Masses, addressed an exhortation "To All Intellectuals": "You are either pioneers and builders of civilization, or you are nothing." If you resist history, "you will be indescribably crushed. . . . History is not a blind goddess, and does not pardon the blindness of others." He rejoiced in the implacability of history and the tyranny of absolutes.
Such dedication impressed the party. In 1932 Chambers was recruited for the illegal underground and began his career as a spy. Here Mr. Tanenhaus must have encountered a structural dilemma: whether to discuss the relationship with Alger Hiss in the chronological narrative, or to defer the discussion until the trial years later. He chose the second course, which entangles him in repetitions and flashbacks. Meanwhile, the reader goes on, without much benefit of Hiss, to Chambers's break with Communism, his emergence from the underground and his new life on Henry Luce's Time.
I met Chambers there in 1946. I was writing a piece on the American Communist Party for Life magazine, and someone told me I should talk with Whit Chambers. I found a squat, lugubrious, unprepossessing, taciturn man initially resistant to my questions and studiously uninformative in his answers. When I finally mentioned a couple of names of possible Communists in the Government, he opened up a bit. Later he told me that when I had first called him, he had checked with someone who told him that I was probably a Communist and that he should be on his guard. There was, said T. S. Matthews, Time's urbane managing editor, "a suppressed air of melodrama about him."
I generally accepted Chambers's view of Alger Hiss, less because of his own testimony than because of doubts about Hiss expressed by New Dealers like Judge Jerome Frank and Gardner Jackson, who had known him in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Mr. Tanenhaus's account of the trials is a bravura piece, effectively dramatizing and summarizing the case against Hiss and adding interesting new detail about the young California Congressman who pressed the case, Richard M. Nixon.
Then came Chambers's best-selling memoir of 1952, "Witness," a powerful book, but a powerfully overwrought and wrongheaded one too. As Mr. Tanenhaus writes, "In Chambers's world, only the Communist and the ex-Communist speak with full authority, and no one else can be taken seriously. Chambers's greatest contempt is reserved -- as always -- for liberalism." Social reform in the New Deal manner, he argued, put a country on the slippery slope toward totalitarianism. As absolutist on the right as he had been on the left, he was an ideologue with no mercy for the pragmatisms of democracy.
In a characteristically apocalyptic mood, Chambers saw the final conflict as "between the two great camps of men -- those who reject and those who worship God," forgetting Mr. Dooley's definition of a fanatic -- one who "does what he thinks th' Lord wud do if He knew th' facts iv th' case." And he was dramatically pessimistic about the outcome. As he had told his wife when he broke with the party, "I know that I am leaving the winning side for the losing side."
What is most novel about Mr. Tanenhaus's book is his account of Chambers's existence after Hiss. One might have supposed, for example, that Chambers would become a cheerleader for Joe McCarthy. In fact, Chambers detested McCarthy and, though he adored William F. Buckley Jr., declined to endorse Mr. Buckley's eulogistic "McCarthy and His Enemies." "For the Right to tie itself in any way to Senator McCarthy is suicide," Chambers said. "He is a raven of disaster." But the "awful fact," observes Mr. Tanenhaus, "which Chambers could not admit -- and never did -- was that his own worldview, stripped of its lyrical refinements and humanist vibrato, had helped bring McCarthyism into existence."
Fearing the "crackpotism" of the right, Chambers now retreated from the apocalyptic absolutes of "Witness." "A conservatism that cannot face the facts of the machine and mass production, and its consequences in government and politics," he wrote, "is foredoomed to futility and petulance." The New Deal was here to stay. He rejected Ludwig von Mises, denounced Ayn Rand and praised John Kenneth Galbraith. In 1959 he defended the issuance of passports to Paul Robeson -- and to Alger Hiss. He welcomed Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the United States, opposed the nuclear arms race and, wondering whether Mr. Buckley's National Review looked forward to World War III, stopped writing for it.
Chambers died in 1961 and remained a puzzle to the end. Except in these last years, he showed an inordinate taste for self-dramatization. "Typically," Mr. Tanenhaus comments on one episode, "he overdid his role." He generally did. He saw himself as a character out of Dostoyevsky, whom he read diligently and compulsively. But he was more convincingly a character out of Dreiser. His account in "Witness" of a middle-class American family, broken on the shoals of economic existence, is Dreiserian in its precision and poignancy, and Chambers, in his cosmic fatalism, his autodidacticism, his contradictions, his paranoia, his assumption of the burdens of history and the universe, reminds one of Dreiser himself. He was thoroughly American in the desperation of his eternal quest for the meaning of life. Mr. Tanenhaus's admirable biography goes as far as one can reasonably expect in unraveling the puzzle.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Bernard Seltzer;
Riding Waves in Generic Drug Industry

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
AT 73, Bernard Seltzer, president and chief executive officer of the Hi-Tech Pharmacal Company in Amityville, is catching his second wind with a plan to capitalize on the boom in generic drugs.
Thirty major drugs will lose their patent protection in the next few years, a fact that Mr. Seltzer said should be a bonanza for the generics industry, which duplicates the products and sells them, usually at lower prices. Hi-Tech manufactures more than 100 drugs in liquid and ointment forms, mostly for private labels. It also sells under the H-T and Sooth-It brand names. 
 Mr. Seltzer, who is diabetic, has developed a line for the 20 million Americans with the disease, including sugar-free cough and cold remedies, as well as Diabetisweet, an artificial sweetener sold in supermarkets, pharmacies and commercial bakeries. Hi-Tech is awaiting F.D.A approval on 16 drugs. Nearly all the manufacturing is done at a 135,000-square-foot plant in Amityville.The company recorded net sales of more than $19 million last year.
Mr. Seltzer graduated from Yeshiva University with a degree in economics and did postgraduate work at New York University. He began working in 1947 at the Success Chemical Company in a Brooklyn, a pharmaceutical business that his father founded in 1930. After Ketchum Labs bought Success 1967, Mr. Seltzer remained with the company until 1981, when he bought back the liquid and semiliquid drug divisions, moved them to Amityville, and renamed the company Hi-Tech Pharmacal.
 Mr. Seltzer and his wife, Miriam, live in Lawrence. They have three children and eight grandchildren.
Q. How did you start in the business?
A. My father started Success Chemical, which was just a tiny business in the back of my uncle's drugstore, in the 1930's. He sold a few generic over-the-counter items like cold-sore lotion and gray hair coloring, which really weren't national products at that time. There were roughly a dozen categories of generic products in those days, both prescription and over-the-counter, and there was nothing really secretive about developing them. It didn't require the kind of research it does today. You'd simply go to the library, look up a couple of items and see what they were supposed to do. Then you'd incorporate them into an ointment, for example.
Q. Why was "generic" a bad word?
A. Generics were actually called "substitutes," even though anyone putting them out had to meet the same standards as the brand-name product. It's simply that there was no one officially saying, "O.K., your product is identical to the brand." So people may have had misconceptions about these products.
Today the F.D.A. gives you permission to call a product a generic only if -- after rigorous testing -- they've identified it as being identical in form to the branded product. Still, the big drug companies try to tell people that generics aren't as good as their own brand, which is kind of funny, since once their patent is up they'll put out their own generic to compete with the others and try and keep their market share.
Q.How long can drug companies hold a patent on a product?
A. It used to be that if you wanted to break a patent, make a generic product and sell it to the Government, the Department of Defense would defend you if the manufacturer wanted to sue. Needless to say, things were easier for generic makers back then. But today the Government respects patents. The manufacturer can hold it for 17 years. After that the Government buys it, and once they meet F.D.A. approval, then the generics start hitting the market.
Q. Are health insurers encouraging the use of generics and often not covering brand-name items?
A. Yes, that's one of the reasons we're in this business. There are quite a few national brand items which are going off patent in the next couple of years that have billions of dollars in sales. We're focusing on these products. A lot of them are in solid form, tablets and caplets. But there are still plenty of liquids. We only manufacture liquids and ointments, and there are far fewer liquid manufacturers than tablet manufacturers, which means a lot less competition for us.
Q. What drugs are coming off patent?
A. Among the most appealing are Zantac and Tagamet. Generic companies are working on identical formulations. These products have gotten an extra financial bang because they used to be prescription only and now they're available over the counter. People need not run to the doctor every time they need a Zantac as an antacid or for ulcers. They can just go to the drugstore and grab it off the shelf.
Q. How do you duplicate the formulas?
A. There's no great magic, really. The active ingredients are listed on the labels, The hard part is formulating a product that matches the taste, viscosity, color and so forth, and that's where the laboratory testing comes in. It's really a question of experience. There are only so many ingredients like glycerin, sorbitol, alcohol and water that you can put in these medicines. After a while people who are bright can duplicate or even make a new product fairly easily.
Q. Do generics ever work better than brand-name products?
A. The law states that if you're duplicating an item that's coming off patent, it can't be worse than the product you're duplicating. But it also can't be better. The law says it must be identical. Nevertheless, there are instances where generic makers believe our products are, in fact, better than the branded ones, though we cannot make these claims.
Q. Is your line of products for diabetics an example?
A. In a way, yes. Our cough syrups and creams are much better for diabetics than what's currently on the market. But they are our own branded line. To do well in the drug business, you need to find niche markets. The diabetic market is one we've pursued with a vengeance. There are 20 million diabetics in this country, and that number is growing because of better diagnostic techniques. Being a diabetic myself, I know these people have special needs.
For example, it used to be that if a diabetic had a bad cough, he'd have to buy a cough medicine off the shelf. Most of them contain a tremendous amount of sugar to mask the taste. So the diabetic was really taking a chance. he needed to calm his cough, but his blood sugar would go way up. Now there are alternatives, cough syrups with no sugar, alcohol or sugar derivatives that provide the same relief as Robitussin or Nyquil.
Diabetics are prone to ulcers and cracks in the skin, and there was really no product out there designed to take care of them. So we developed one. And we developed an artificial sweetener that doesn't break down. So it has no aftertaste, and you can cook with it. It also has no calories, which appeals to the diet conscious. Niche markets like this have been very profitable for us, and we're always looking for new ones.
Q. What about statements that zinc lozenges may help cure the common cold?
A. There's been no scientific evidence as yet that zinc lozenges can actually cure the common cold. But there's sure been a whole lot of talk. And I understand these products are moving off the shelves as quickly as they get on them. There's been a lot of talk about a combination of ascorbic acid and zinc, mostly in a lozenge form, right now. We're trying to make a similar product in liquid form, and we'll have it on test in a couple of weeks.
Q. Is this an important market?
A. Yes, but we remain cautious. It's been a bonanza so far. But it could turn out to be just a fad. Until it's scientifically proven, you can't really make any claims. Still, word of mouth gets around. One guy recommends it to another, and the products just soar off the shelves. So far they seem to be working pretty well.
Q. Can consumers expect to save a certain amount with generics?
A. It really has to do with how many other generic manufacturers are making the same product. For example, a patented itme which sells for $50 per 100 tablets may only cost $2 to make. Of course, the big companies claim they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on research and development and testing before they bring the product to market, and they must therefore charge $50 to recover their expenditures. But eventually a generic company will come along and sell it for $30, 40 percent less, because it's only costing them $2 to $5 to make. If a second generic comes along, they'll probably have to sell it for $20 to compete. It's a matter of supply and demand. But if only one guy has the generic equivalent, then he'd probably give a discount of 30 to 40 percent. That would prove satisfactory to the various agencies that pay for it, and the consumers would be pretty happy. It brings us to the issue of trying to be the first to get a generic approved, and that's what we all strive for.
Q. How is it doing business on Long Island?
A. It is a little more difficult to do business on Long Island than it would be in other places. In fact, we're constantly getting enticements from other states, tax abatements and the like. And the utility rates here are obviously tremendous. But we plan to stay here, because No. 1 we are New York people and No. 2 we have an extensive amount of equipment, which would be very difficult to move. We are at a bit of a disadvantage costwise. But nevertheless we've been in business for a long time and we're able to compete effectively in the national market. We also have an excellent pool of labor. Since Grumman moved out of the area, there's an abundance of people available for our production lines who may not have been available in the past. And we have access to graduates of some excellent pharmacy and chemical programs at the local colleges and universities.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Seth M. Glickenhaus;
A Man With All-Encompassing Opinions

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
SETH M. GLICKENHAUS says he has an opinion on everything, and after talking to him for just a few minutes this is indeed clear.
A financier, builder and philanthropist who made Nixon's enemies list in the early 1970's, Mr. Glickenhaus, who will turn 83 this week, has a lot to say about a lot of things. 
 A resident of New Rochelle and a law school graduate, Mr. Glickenhaus is the founder and senior partner of Glickenhaus & Company, a Wall Street firm that manages $4.7 billion in assets. He is a trustee of the Glickenhaus Foundation, which is a vehicle for philanthropy for his wife, Sarah, and himself. Another Glickenhaus enterprise is Fortune Homes Corporation, which is developing 93 homes in Chappaqua.
In his spare time, he plays tennis.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Glickenhaus:
Q. Is it really true that you have an opinion about everything?
A. Yes. Part of my work involves a broad catholic knowledge of what's going on in the world. So after a while, you form an opinion. And I like to exchange ideas with people.
Q. With all your activities, are you slowing down as you get older?
A. Actually, I've been forced to speed up. Your responsibilities grow as your firm grows; your family grows, and your hobbies and interests grow. To encompass everything, you have to speed up.
Q. Politics is one of your areas of interest, correct?
A. Yes. In our work, you have to be au courant with what's going on because these politicians today control huge sums of money and could alter the economic direction of the country. So we have to be interested in what's going on.
To give you some background here, I've always been a humanitarian. I began with the usual liberal attitudes that young people have. I was an ardent New Dealer. I used to believe that schools were the answer, that there was a great correlation between schools and education. Unfortunately, I find today that that connection is far more remote. Many of my attitudes that the Government could accomplish a good deal of social good were inaccurate.
Q. Did things change, or is it just your views that have changed?
A. I think Government has deteriorated. We used to have better people who went into the work. Brighter people, more honest people, people who would often consider what was in the public interest. Today the degree of corruption, stupidity and narrow parochial interest has grown enormously.
Q. On all levels of government?
A. Well, the Democrats and Republicans. In other words, at all levels.
Q. You were on Nixon's Enemies List. How did that come about?
A. My whole family was bitterly opposed to that ill-fated, ill-considered venture -- the Vietnam War -- and my children came to me and asked me to close the business for a day as part of a protest against the war. I said, "What a splendid idea." So I went to the New York Stock Exchange and asked them for permission to close. They held a special meeting. They came back and said that I was denied permission to close because historically stock exchange firms are proud of the fact that they are always open. They are open through tornadoes, storms. There was only one exception, it had something to do with a hurricane in Florida where some firm was washed out.
So, I went to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal with an ad, which read something like this: "Our firm will open today solely to comply with the rules of the stock exchange. As a protest against our Government's continued involvement in Vietnam, we are making a substantial contribution to various peace groups."
And when this fellow -- I forget his name, oh, yes, Nixon -- saw it he thought this was really dreadful because this was the Establishment refuting him. This wasn't a Commie sympathizer. So one day, sometime later I got a call from one of my partners who said, "On the first page of The Washington Post your name is featured prominently on the Enemies List." It was one of the proudest days of my life.
Q. You said before that politicians are more corrupt than in the past. Was Nixon the exception at the time, or is it that he was the turning point?
A. He stood out. In those days, he would have been impeached if he hadn't resigned. Today, we have guys who can be indicted for different crimes who stay in office.
Q. You don't like Clinton?
A. I don't like any of them. Once I voted for a Republican. I usually vote for the Democrat because they have more heart. But they've done a miserable job. When they had the power, they allowed the Government to spend absolutely extraordinarily obsessive sums on the military and to run social programs that were so badly administered that they never achieved their end.
I have an unremitting contempt for the Democrats. And for the Republicans, who are a bunch of heartless, selfish wretches who sold out to various aspects of business.
I voted for this guy Nader last year, but these third-party candidates are fanatics for the most part, very one-sided. It was a protest vote. I agree with Nader that our environment must be addressed and so forth, but he doesn't have the real analysis of what should be done.
Q. It would have been hard to picture him as President, wouldn't it?
A. Well, for me it's hard to picture any of them as President, not since Truman.
Q. Is he the last one you look back on with some affection?
A. The last statesman was former Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. We haven't had a statesman in Washington since then. There might be one that I overlooked, but the people in Washington are generally very narrow people and ignorant of really what's going on in the economy. Take what's going on today for example: No. 1, the military spending should be cut enormously. I'm not a pacifist; I realize we have to be strong. But they can cut it in half and still keep it strong. There is no enemy out there. We have the finest ships, the finest Air Force. We have submarines, any one of which, has more firepower than all the ammunition shot off in World War II.
Q. How would you define "statesman"? How would you know one?
A. A statesman would be obvious because it would be someone who, firstly, had a broad picture of where the public interest lay. And, secondly, he would put aside parochial interests and be so persuasive that he would get re-elected despite the fact that he was educating his own constituencies to things they might not immediately or easily accepted. He would be a person of great leadership skills and the ability to communicate his ideals.
Q. Did you ever consider running for office?
A. No, I was too busy with my business. When Johnson was President, he considered me for the head of the Tariff Commission, but I was rejected because he found some writing I had done where I said the only difference between one political party and the other was that one was in and the other was not.
It would have involved an enormous sacrifice on my part if I had gotten the job, and it would have been a real hot potato because I'd have been caught between the so-called free traders and the people looking for special tariffs. But being an independent soul, I would have taken the job even though my wife was upset at the idea of moving the children out of school.
Q. You have referred to yourself as a humanitarian. How do you define that?
A. It's a broad approach to people, to love everybody. I love the Arabs, I love the Jews, I love the Hindus, I love the Africans. I'm proud of being a human being much more than of being an American or being a Jew.
Q. How do you practice your humanitarianism?
A. Through various endeavors where we help, through the foundation and privately with my wife. We feel the people who are less fortunate than we in the United States should be helped. And we spend our time and effort and money doing it.
Q. There are many rich people who don't have this same view. How do you react to that?
A. Well, I've always tried to persuade them not so much from the humanitarian point of view but from the point of view of their own selfish interest. Helping the unfortunate is to their interest. The wealthy are the people who ostensibly have the most comfortable, most enviable way of life. If they want to preserve it they'd better give some portion of their income and capital to the have-nots. I would say that the present disparity of income between the wealthy and the poor could easily evolve into a very troublesome situation.

HEADLINE: In the Heart of America, A Quiet Place for Music

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa

 BODY:
ALAN LAWRENCE, 40, PLAYS the timpani in the Cedar Rapids Symphony, and not for a lot of money. Top players -- and he leads his section -- can expect $85 each for five rehearsals, $110 for the Saturday evening concert at the Paramount Theater that follows, and $110 more for a repeat performance on Monday. For a lot of his colleagues, the numbers go from $40 to $60.
The orchestra plays seven pairs of subscription concerts a year, eight pops performances, three chamber and eight children's programs, and the occasional special event. You do the arithmetic; it doesn't add up to much. 
 From the offices of the Chicago Symphony or the New York Philharmonic, lives like these look small and far away; the rewards are pocket change next to big-city pay scales that approach $85,000 a year for newcomers and twice that for principal musicians. From the streets of this modest Iowa city, on the other hand, it is we who appear vague, distant and perhaps irrelevant.
Mr. Lawrence's orchestra, 75 years old and one of up to 300 professional institutions in the United States, is actually somewhere in the middle of this hierarchy. It shares the turmoil and economic fears of its colleagues. It spends nowhere near the $43 million the Boston Symphony needs each year, though with its $1.4 million budget, it is more prosperous than neighbors who make do with a quarter of that amount.
Christian Tiemeyer is the orchestra's music director, and next to the better conductorial contracts in classical music, not for a lot of money either. Mr. Tiemeyer, 56, comes from Catonsville, Md., and studied the cello with Pablo Casals in Europe and Zara Nelsova at the Juilliard School.
Mr. Tiemeyer caught the conducting virus commonly known as "stick fever" at the Dallas Symphony, where he was principal cellist and eventually associate conductor. Later he played and conducted under Maurice Abravanel at the Utah Symphony. At one point in his career Mr. Tiemeyer was working 100 nights a year and doing it in a lot of different places. He has been in Cedar Rapids since 1982 and rarely stirs from home.
Jeff Smith, 35, is the board president of the orchestra and is about to turn the job over to James Hoffman, 43. Both men have gilt-edged futures in major corporations. Kathy Hall juggles the jobs of principal bassoonist and executive director with the dictates of a teen-age son. Her days and nights are long. If she (improbably) held those jobs in New York or Boston, her two salaries might approach a half-million dollars a year.
What are these people -- indeed, what is an orchestra of such solid accomplishment -- doing in a town like Cedar Rapids? Well, they are living their lives. Mr. Lawrence, the timpanist, is a little out of the ordinary in a community of 110,000 and an orchestra of 75 players. He is from Midland, Tex. A majority of his fellow musicians are Iowans or went to school here.
Ms. Hall, for example, who has an advanced degree in music and is highly thought of in both of her present jobs, comes from Donnellson, 100 miles south of here, where her father operated a feed and fertilizer business. Most orchestra managements would be horrified by the prospect of Ms. Hall's negotiating with herself at contract time, but Cedar Rapids is not New York or Boston.
Mr. Lawrence is also different in that he may be moving on. He takes auditions; the most recent was in San Antonio. On the other hand, after nine seasons he has abandoned apartment life and found a house to rent, has bought himself some modestly priced health insurance, works part-time as assistant manager for classical music in a record store and tries not to worry about retirement. Most of all, he teaches. It took him time, but he has come upon values here that he is starting to like and may not be as footloose as before.
Mr. Tiemeyer, in his former life, found himself with three small children and little time to give them. From Abravanel he learned the music director's loyalty to place, as opposed to the traveling conductor's yearning to be engaged and then re-engaged. Cedar Rapids offered him a full-time job and a home. His wife, Patti, a cellist, plays in the orchestra, too.
The president-elect, Mr. Hoffman, after a high-profile stint in Washington at the MCI Corporation, has come back home to Cedar Rapids and put his children in the city's admired public school system. Iowa's fleeing population has reversed direction, and many of the newcomers are actually people who grew up here, left to make their fortunes and are returning to raise their children.
The Paramount Theater, where the orchestra plays, is one of those movie palace and vaudeville theater restorations found growing hopefully in downtown grids of troubled urban America. Nearby, the Cedar River runs through town. So does the Union Pacific Railroad, with its mournful horns sounding pleasantly from the tracks behind the Five Seasons Hotel.
The city's river, its tree-lined outer boulevards and the surrounding farmland promise pleasing green in another season, but downtown's dowdy 1920's office rectangles and glassy high-tech high-rises are bleak in winter. On a cold Monday evening, the Paramount marquee reads "Physicians for the Arts," acknowledging one of a number of coalitions in this city that help pay for concerts. Nine hundred ten people have come to hear Brahms and Beethoven. One thousand thirty-five heard the same program two days before, but the Monday concert has a few tricks up its sleeve.
Mr. Tiemeyer, microphone in hand, pitches his program with the fervor of an upscale car salesman. Video cameras trained on different parts of the orchestra show up-close the workings of music-making by way of screened projections on each side of the stage. On Monday, intermissions are usually done away with and the programs shortened, but the mighty Brahms B flat Piano Concerto and the Beethoven Seventh Symphony, on the program for this evening, demand a breather for all concerned.
MANAGEMENT IS TRYING mightily to capture a new listenership, and the audience on Monday did have more than the usual share of young people. Why don't more come?
"A lot of people feel uncomfortable," said Mr. Smith, the president. "They don't know what to wear, when to clap. They are afraid of feeling out of place." Volunteers have formed a pre- and post-concert system of parties: a combination welcome wagon and singles bar for new people. Because many have no friends who come to concerts, a block of general-admission seats allows newcomers to pair off and sit with new-found acquaintances.
Cedar Rapids has advantages other places do not: a relatively stable society, established and generous companies like Quaker Oats, a growing high-tech industry that brings in young and educated employees, surrounding colleges and universities, and -- wonder of wonders -- a public school system that has not abandoned the arts.
Yet this is no Middle Western idyll of good will and plenty. The orchestra treads the same fragile, dangerous path as its colleagues large and small: with shrinking and aging audiences, higher costs, reduced government grants and competition for philanthropic gifts that are shifting everywhere in this country from arts to medical and humanitarian projects.
The parsimony runs across the board. The National Endowment for the Arts grant this year is $12,500, down from $18,000; the Iowa Arts Council grant is $18,000, down from $24,000, and the Iowa Community Cultural Grant is $13,000, down from $15,000. Corporate and private gifts run about a half-million dollars a year for a budget of $1.4 million and an endowment of about the same amount.
Single-ticket sales, the backbone of popular-culture events here, have grown stubbornly but help to offset a gradual trickling away of subscriptions. Gifts are hard won.
"Every budget we make is an act of faith," said Ms. Hall, the executive director. "We don't know how many tickets we are going to sell or how much money people are actually going to give us." The orchestra earns only 38 percent of its income. (Forty percent is considered acceptable in this business.) But few cities of such modest population have an orchestra of this size and solidity.
In concert, the Cedar Rapids Symphony does not make a sound like, say, the Philadelphia Orchestra, but it is not playing in Philadelphia and is not supposed to. What it does offer is tight, well-tuned ensemble, perfectly adequate principal players and sometimes very good ones, and sound musical direction. (The elusive rhythm of the Beethoven finale was correct and clear.) The Brahms concerto, at least as difficult, was made more difficult for the orchestra by Grant Johannesen's extremely slow tempos in the piano part. Brahms's exposed horn and cello parts were thoroughly professional and sometimes quite beautiful.
Where experienced players in major orchestras flirt with salaries of six figures, all the while complaining of artistic deprivations, this mix of old and young musicians plays with palpable delight. Some talked about their feelings the next day. They are wistful about money, they have the usual complaints about conductorial tyranny, but they love their jobs. They also seem to like where they live.
Two contradictary impulses inform the life of this orchestra, and the combination is peculiarly American. One says that growth is good, that because this country began as a few people in a big place, survival still equals expansion. The second impulse is mistrust of central authority. In the pyramidal politics of Europe, absolute control was exercised from faraway capitals by the few over the many: those many being our ancestors. The American Revolution told central power to go away: "We can take care of ourselves; leave us alone." If the facts have changed, the impulse remains.
So Cedar Rapids measures bigness and movement against smallness and boundaries. Asked whether the orchestra's season might grow beyond its seven classical weekends, Mr. Smith said, "There is no reason for growth." In Cedar Rapids, survival equals enclosure: a finite audience served finitely.
Growth of another kind, however, is inner necessity. At a loss to pay its musicians much more money, the orchestra board must find them more work: more students to teach, more run-outs to rural communities, more festivals, fairs and special events. Idealistic as these musicians appear to be, they have pushed for more money and are settling, if only for a 2.5 percent raise in their present per-service contract. The president-elect, Mr. Hoffman, says he does not know how he can pay much more and at the same time keep up with the orchestra's bills.
WITHOUT STUDENTS TO teach, most members of the Cedar Rapids Symphony could not live. For Mr. Lawrence there is Coe College in town; for others, Cornell College, 20 miles away. Wayne Thelander, a bass player in the orchestra and an employee of the public schools, could be found one recent morning rehearsing a string ensemble of 14-year-olds for a communal citywide concert.
The more common outlet for player-teachers is the Symphony School, founded 10 years ago and run by Stephanie Wagor. It is an unusual coalition between schools and the symphony by which two independent parties -- each with its own agenda, its own shortcomings and its own needs -- contractually agree to exchange services. An intensive third-grade string program in the schools has become as much a part of schoolwork as multiplication tables. Students get vouchers for concert tickets. Symphony musicians teach classes and after-school private lessons. Jocelyn Langworthy, the recently hired principal clarinetist, says she already has 40 pupils a week.
Two doctors play in the Cedar Rapids Symphony, along with an engineer, some school teachers, many freelance professionals and professors and graduate students from nearby universities and colleges. The principal flutist, Jane Walker, is a 25-year member. She and her husband operate a music store specializing in woodwind and brass repertory in nearby Iowa City. Blanche Lawrence has played in the violin section since 1931, when she was 14. Ms. Lawrence can remember a time in the orchestra's 75-year history when a fall concert would feature the first two movements of a symphony and the spring concert the third and fourth.
The parents of William Preucil, the concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, have been longtime members. There are more and more young players on the move and passing through, happy for employment. So hair-raising is the competition for orchestra jobs nationally that recent auditions for principal clarinet attracted candidates from music schools as lofty as Yale's.
A lot of this clarinetist's Yale classmates probably never heard of the Cedar Rapids Symphony, and those who have probably do not include it in their daydreams of success. If so, these calm farmland people of eastern Iowa don't seem to care. Their orchestra has neither record labels nor Carnegie Hall on its mind. Its musicians live in a place, and they are about that place. Prosperity lies not over the next mountain but next door.
"New York has no more relevance for Cedar Rapids, Iowa, than Cedar Rapids has for New York," said Mr. Tiemeyer over dinner one evening. "Each life is important, and Cedar Rapids is our life. This is real for us."

HEADLINE: L.I.R.R., Riders and Local Officials Square Off on Parking

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Maureen J. Hirsch left her house in Bay Shore at 7:30 to catch the 7:46 train at Deer Park on Feb. 26, she turned on her car radio and learned of a derailment in Westbury.
"They said there would be 60-minute delays on the Main Line to Penn Station," Ms. Hirsch said. "I thought of driving in. But even with a 60-minute delay, the train would still be faster than driving." 
 The train arrived on time, but then sat outside the Hicksville station for nearly two hours.
Ms. Hirsch, a legal assistant, fumed.
"They said on the radio that people who take this line should use the Babylon line instead, but what are you supposed to do with your car?" she asked. "There is no place to park in Babylon, even for people who take that train on a regular basis. And you must be a town resident and have a permit to park in the station's tiny lot."
To prevent commuters from parking on nearby streets, she noted, parking is limited to two hours.
"The railroad says to use another line, but there is no other option," Ms. Hirsch continued. "I would have loved for them to tell me where else I could park my car to catch a train. And now that I'm on this train I'm stuck."
To critics of the Long Island Rail Road -- as well as of the towns that control parking -- the problems represented another instance of a lack of understanding of commuters' needs and a lack of appreciation for what the commuter brings to the local economy. Town officials, by and large, work on the Island and rarely ride the railroad.
They do not experience walks from distant parking spaces, sometimes poorly maintained stations, delays, breakdowns, misinformation or lack of information and other indignities or quirks, like getting change from ticket machines in Susan B. Anthony coins.
Commuters generally earn higher salaries in New York City than on Long Island, but they are likely to shop in local stores and patronize higher-priced stores.
Ms. Hirsch's train pulled into Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan at 11:25, more than two and a half hours late.
A spokeswoman for the railroad, Susan McGowan, said: "Most customers know that parking is governed by the municipalities."
The L.I.R.R., Ms. McGowan added, suggested the Babylon Line just for riders who could be dropped off there, and radio stations may not have made that clear.
Another commuter from Bay Shore who was sitting with Ms. Hirsch, Gerry S. Cincotta, said that Babylon had few all-day meters and that "they are all taken by 6 in the morning."
The difficulty in finding available parking at other stations has been compounded by a steady increase in ridership over the last five years. Ridership has increased from 70.2 million morning passengers in 1992 to 74.4 million last year, the highest since 75.4 million in 1989.
"It's wonderful that the Long Island Rail Road has increased ridership," Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay said. "But we are the ones required to maintain the parking lots." Although "the commuters are our taxpayers," Mr. Yevoli said, "we are enabling the railroad's ridership to increase by taking care of the lots without any help from the railroad."
He said the town was trying its best to cope with problems at the most crowded stations, including Hicksville, Syosset and Massapequa.
Because of insufficient space at Massapequa, he said, the state began allowing commuters to park along Sunrise Highway last year. "I guess you must have close to 75 cars or more parked on Sunrise Highway each day," he said.
The town is restriping the lots for spaces with 1,800 square feet instead of 2,000.
"We picked up 75 spots in Syosset and 70 in Hicksville," Mr. Yevoli said. "We're working on Massapequa now."
If the Metropolitan Transportation Authority made money available, Mr. Yevoli said, additional space could be bought in Massapequa and an additional parking level built in Hicksville. "Hicksville is a hub," he said. "They are going to have to do something there."
Supervisor May W. Newberger of North Hempstead said: "It's an endemic problem. It's all over, like spreading fungus."
At Port Washington, Ms. Newberger said, the town bought a lot on Van de Ventor Avenue that it is paving for 114 spaces.
"We were prepared to condemn the property if we could not come to an agreement on the price," Ms. Newberger said. "It cost us a good amount of money."
The M.T.A., the parent of the Long Island Rail Road, did not pay any of the cost.
The chairman of the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council, Larry Silverman, said the railroad was responsible for building "as much parking as is needed for its riders."
"At our April meeting," Mr. Silverman said, "we've asked the railroad to send us an expert about the parking situation to speak to us. Our impression is that the railroad doesn't deal with it adequately at all. We scheduled this meeting because of numerous complaints from riders.
"With the growth in ridership, the railroad has to plan and believe in its future. But it doesn't have a vision of the future and just patches things up. There is no long-term planning in place."
Another spokesman for the railroad, Sam Zambuto, said it had earmarked $24 million to improve and expand parking over two years.
Mr. Silverman pointed out that when electrification was expanded on the Main Line in 1987, the railroad was unprepared for the surge in ridership at Ronkonkoma, taking years to plan and build additional parking.
He is concerned, he added, that the advent of dual-mode diesel engines next year will again catch the railroad flat footed. The new engines will enable commuters on nonelectrified tracks to ride to Penn Station without changing trains at Jamaica.
"That will take the pressure off the Syosset and Hicksville stations," Mr. Silverman said, explaining that riders will no longer have an incentive to forgo diesel trains on the Oyster Bay Line for faster electric trains.
Mr. Zambuto acknowledged that the new diesels might "shift riding patterns" and that the railroad was evaluating parking needs. "That's part of our plan for the future," he said. "We are evaluating possible changes in ridership on the Port Jefferson branch east of Huntington, on the Main Line east of Ronkonkoma, on the Montauk branch east of Babylon and on the Oyster Bay branch."
Mr. Zambuto said the railroad expected to begin receiving next year 116 bilevel coaches that will be pulled by 23 new diesel and 18 dual-mode locomotives. The coaches will replace 40-year-old cars that have "outlived their useful life," he said, adding that the L.I.R.R. is also taking into account that refurbishing old parking lots would attract additional riders.
Supervisor Richard H. Schaffer Jr. of Babylon said he hoped that the M.T.A. became "more serious about making access easier."
"It can't continue to rely on under-the-trestle parking," Mr. Schaffer said. "People are now parking everywhere and anywhere at some stations. The railroad has to take the money it got from increased fares and put it into parking. It has to make serious infrastructure improvements."
Although no vacant property is available near heavily used stations in Babylon, Mr. Schaffer said, the M.T.A. should try to buy nearby buildings because of the demand for parking at stations like Copiague.
Several town supervisors said they were unaware that the M.T.A. had set aside money to expand parking.
A spokeswoman for Hempstead, Marlene Kastleman, said the M.T.A. had given $800,000 to help buy property to add 30 spaces at Merrick.
Mayor Eugene E. Scarpato of Lynbrook said his village had discussed with the railroad the "haphazard" parking under the railroad trestle.
The L.I.R.R., Mr. Scarpato said, has agreed to add 50 metered spaces to the 150 spaces at the station.
Aware of concerns in Huntington, Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said the town was building two bridges across New York Avenue to improve accessibility to 450 spaces in two lots west of the station. The bridges, he added, are to be completed by the fall, before construction of an affordable housing complex on a 400-space site.
"One person fearful that there will be no spots" after the two lots are closed has distributed leaflets, Mr. Petrone said, but the town will conduct "a study to make sure there are spots."
The town, he added, is "looking at additional lots across the street."
Mr. Silverman said Mr. Petrone assured him in December that "they were doing this count."
"How much do you have to study to go out and count cars one day?" Mr. Silverman asked.
In a letter to Mr. Petrone on Feb. 13, he said his group's assessment had convinced him that "the remaining lots will be woefully inadequate."
"People will have to park in the boondocks a quarter-mile from the station," Mr. Silverman said. "That is inadequate planning on the town's part and on the part of the railroad."

A New State Code for Remodeling Projects Is Near

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY is putting the final touches on its first statewide code of standards that will govern the rehabilitation of residential and commercial buildings.
It is being crafted as the result of a 1995 state law calling for a more efficient and cost-effective way for property owners to restore buildings without compromising safety. It is also expected to address concerns over the possibility of a double standard of safety for new and existing structures. 
 The 1995 law charged the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs to adopt new controls to govern the state's 2.3 million residences and 500,000 commercial structures.
The new rules are being drawn up by the department's division of codes and standards together with the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and a 30-member advisory board. The board is made up of local code officials, developers, architects, preservationists and advocates of housing for low- and moderate-income people to make sure that all interests are represented.
Renovations are now governed under the state's construction codes for new buildings. Those codes in many cases require owners to upgrade older structures to new construction specifications governing such technical requirements as stairwell and corridor widths, number of exits and mechanical systems. Compliance is mandated when the cost of the renovation exceeds 50 percent of the overall value of the property, or if there is any change in its use.
Concern that such requirements increase costs and are often unwarranted for many rehabilitation projects led to the call for change.
Another factor is the aging of the state's building stock. David Listokin, a professor at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers who is directing the university's efforts on the code, said the time to institute change was now because the state's buildings, like its population, were reaching middle age. In terms of housing alone, half the residential units in the state were built before 1959, census figures show.
"This is a new approach to the existing construction code that provides a detailed set of measures to protect public health and safety without inhibiting rehabilitation," said William M. Connolly, director of the division of codes and standards in the Department of Community Affairs. The division will supervise the new controls.
New Jersey's effort has caught the attention of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is advocating rehabilitation standards as a provision in the national construction codes that could be voluntarily accepted by states. In doing so, the department is modeling its work on New Jersey's rehabilitation standards.
Essentially, the new code will set up more flexible standards for rehabilitations based on safety risks, what the building will be used for and the extent of the rehabilitation itself.
The level of work ranges from repair and renovation to alterations and reconstruction. The code will also permit alternative safety methods, including the installation of sprinkler systems instead of the reconfiguration of a building for an additional exit. In addition, there will be a separate section dealing with historic structures.
Professor Listokin said the new code "specifically spells out" what is needed to accomplish renovations. For instance, if a building is being changed from a private residence to a public use such as a restaurant the renovation would have to meet more stringent safety requirements. If there is no change of use, safety improvements will grow with the extent of the renovation.
E NCOURAGING the "renewal and restoration of the buildings we have" promotes other public benefits, Mr. Connolly said, and advocates of the new code agree. The benefits include preserving open space, providing housing affordable to lower-income people and revitalizing older urban and suburban centers, where much of the aging building stock is situated.
Those goals are in line with the aims of the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan, which encourages growth where roads, utilities and mass transit are in place and discourages it in less-developed areas.
From the municipal standpoint, said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, "we have to look at the new standards more closely." He said the league was concerned that the standards not "infringe on local prerogatives, increase costs and possibly jeopardize health and public safety."
Mr. Connolly said the issue of local control had been settled 20 years ago with the passage of the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act, which set standards for housing construction.
The current draft of the rehabilitation code generally has been well-received by builder and nonbuilder groups involved in renovations. Of the estimated $6.4 billion in construction activity reported last year in New Jersey, alterations and additions accounted for 46.4 percent of that total, according to state figures.
Making the process more efficient will make renovations less costly to do, said Andrew C. Cattano, director of technical services at the New Jersey Builders Association in Plainsboro. "It is a necessary change that can only help," Mr. Cattano said of the new standards.
William C. Asdal, who runs a company bearing his name in Chester that concentrates on remodeling and rehabilitation projects, agrees. "The new standards," he said, "will create opportunities to take a second look at buildings that under the old system were incompatible with current codes and economically infeasible to restore." Without the change those buildings would not be improved or improved without the proper permits, he added.
Affordable housing groups -- including the Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey, based in Trenton -- see the new standards as removing a regulatory barrier to recycling older building to residences for low- and moderate-income families. "Reducing the cost of renovation allows the public subsidies for projects to go farther and in turn more projects can get done," said Diane Sterner, executive director of the housing network.
A survey by the nonprofit group, which lobbied for a separate rehabilitation code, found that applying new construction standards to housing rehabilitation increased costs by an average of $9,000 a unit, or more than 10 percent of the total project cost.
The new code will be "another tool," added Peter Kasabach, housing director at Isles Inc., a nonprofit development group in Trenton. If its "effectiveness is not diluted in the implementation," Mr. Kasabach said, his group will revisit buildings it was forced to walk away from because of lack of public funds or the high cost of rehabilitation under the old rules.
Among them is a cluster of rowhouses on Passaic Street in the Canal Banks Redevelopment area of Trenton. Mr. Kasabach said Isles had renovated six of the three-story brick buildings on the block. Now they sit next to ones that are vacant and battered.
Though the discussion and tinkering continues, Mr. Connolly said he expected the code to be adopted by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/A Tilt to Landlords;
Lag in New Construction Tightens Midtown Market

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
HAS the balance of power changed? Is the great tenant market of the 90's in midtown office buildings finally coming to an end, with the balance of power shifting to landlords after a few years of steady economic recovery with virtually no new construction?
To some the answer is an unequivocal yes. "I think it has shifted from the tenant side to the owner side," said James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage specializing in tenant representation. 
 He said the reason was that vacancy rates -- particularly in prime midtown space -- were declining as expanding companies occupy the available space.
Others say the shift in the upper hand is a peculiarity of the New York market, which is focused on Manhattan. "New York is the only market I know of where it becomes a landlord's market while there are double digit vacancy rates," said Peter Friedman president of the Friedman Realty Group. "In New York, when the vacancy rate goes below 12 percent, it's a landlord's market."
Although the overall vacancy rate may still be in double digits, space in the most desirable buildings has become scarce, according RE/Locate, a real estate research firm. It reports that vacancies in the 180 Class A buildings between 34th and 61st Streets is just under 8 percent. For an elite group of 30 buildings built after 1980, the rate is just over 6 percent.
Asking rents have not climbed sharply, at least not yet, but brokers say the shrinking concession packages being offered by building owners to entice tenants are the best indications of a changing market.
"Two or three years ago, landlords were offering 18 months of free rent," Mr. Meiskin said. "Now it is 6 to 8 months on a 10-year deal."
Owners are also cutting back on the money they will contribute toward finishing or renovating the interior of buildings. "Those cash allowances were as high as $75 a square foot," Mr. Meiskin said. "Now it is $30 to $40 a foot and that's it."
"There has been a seismic shift from tenant to landlord," said Orna Shulman, executive vice president of the Intertech Corporation, which bought the office tower at 1500 Broadway at 43d Street in September 1995. Because of the reduction in concession packages, she said, effective rents are 15 to 20 percent higher than the company's expectations at the time of purchase.
Others say the situation, while it has generally changed in favor of building owners, is more complex than one side or the other having the clear upper hand.
"I'm not about to raise a flag and claim absolute victory," said Bruce Mosler, president of the Galbreath Company. 'It seems to me that the market is bifurcated. If you are looking for blocks of space under 50,000 square feet, there are a lot of choices. But if you are looking for over 300,000 square feet, it's very tough."
Mr. Mosler cautioned that mergers, such as the combination of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, will continue to have real estate implications, as staffs are trimmed and space becomes available. And as new buildings -- such as the Durst Organization's 1.6 million-square-foot building now under construction at what will be 4 Times Square -- fill up, the space being vacated may be hard to fill.
"New product is sexy and fills up quickly," he said. "But if 4 Times Square and other new buildings go up, there may be difficulty in backfilling the older space."
To Mary Ann Tighe, a broker at Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon Company, the market is more tenant-specific than anything else. "If the tenant is somebody who had to be in Midtown or Midtown South, needs 50,000 square feet or more of space, has a high level of technical requirements and needs floor plates of 25,000 square feet, that tenant is in a landlord's market."
MORE generally, Ms. Tighe said, landlords have more options today than in the early part of the decade, when vast amounts of space stood empty and rents were falling. "You can feel it in the market," she said. "Today there is always a deal in front of you or right behind you. If you decide to play hardball with an issue, the landlord has alternatives."
"There is no question that landlords are negotiating with multiple tenants in the better locations," said Andrew H. Roos, executive vice president of Williams Real Estate Company. "But there are still some good values out there for tenants who are willing to compromise."
In addition, Ms. Tighe said, the era of tenants' sending out requests for proposals from building owners and managers is over. "Today," she said, "you have to make an offer."
Mitchell Steir, an executive vice president of Julien J. Studley, acknowledges that tenants have less leverage than a few years ago, but argues that this is not a completely bad development. "My opinion is that we are in a 'fair play' market, where landlords have the ability to make a living," he said.
He said that while free rent and other concessions were smaller than they were a few years ago, they are larger than the last real estate boom. "Concession packages are still 150 to 200 percent of what they were 10 years ago," he said.
And while landlords have more options than they had when space was going begging, that has not translated into arrogance, according to Mr. Steir. "We don't see situations where the landlord says to a tenant, 'This is my renewal deal -- take it or leave it,' " he said. "There is still a strong desire to keep existing tenants to avoid the costs of getting new tenants."
But some have encountered signs that indicate some owners foresee much higher rent levels on the horizon. "We represent some tenants who are subleasing in the General Motors Building," Mr. Meiskin said. "The sublease is due in one year and the tenants are interested in renewing for 10 years at a rental rate of $50 to $55 a square foot. But the owners are not interested in renewing, apparently because they think they can get $70 a foot in a year."
Renewing existing tenants means the space would not have to be remodeled and there would be no down period while construction was taking place and no rent was being paid, Mr. Meiskin observed. "This is a perfect example of how the market has changed."
Patrick J. Brennan, the rental agent for the building, said the situation was more complicated than Mr. Meiskin described, because the space is under lease to a third party. He declined to comment further.
Some market participants observe that the increased tendency for properties to be financed by equity and debt raised on Wall Street is changing some of the rules of the game. Even if the vacancy rates decline, they say, a tenant with strong credit will still be able to engineer a favorable deal.
"Credit is king and the credit tenant is in control," said Joseph A. Farkas, manager of the New York office of the Koll organization. "Buildings are being taken through securities markets where the rating agencies are critical. And one of the things that they look at is the credit of the tenants involved."
Mr. Farkas cited the example of the contest between the Fuhrman Selz brokerage concern and Xerox Corporation for space in 280 Park Avenue, the Bankers Trust Building. "They both battled over that space and Xerox got it because of its credit," Mr. Farkas said, citing Xerox's enormously greater size. "This type of tenant will keep the market from being completely dominated by landlords."
WHENEVER vacancy rates decline and effective rents begin rising, talk of new construction begins. Douglas Durst, whose building at 4 Times Square is 87 percent rented even though excavation is not yet complete, said he perceived a "large pent-up demand for large blocks of high technology space."
He said the rapid leasing of 4 Times Square "was a surprise to us" and predicted that "future development will take place on the large sites that are available," such as the half a block on Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets, the block on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets and additional sites in the Times Square area. "The requirement is for large footprints," he said.
"We are flirting with the viability of new construction," said Mr. Friedman of Friedman Realty. "Some people say if we are within 10 percent of the rentals to justify new construction, it is time to buy dirt and get going, because it will take two to three years to get the project out of the ground."
He said the availability of financing, much of it from foreign sources seeking a stable investment climate, would stoke new development, even if traditional financing sources, like banks and insurance companies, stay on the sidelines. "Because of this flight capital there is a tremendous availability of funds to finance building in New York and its suburbs," he said.

Room for Improvement, Bank Survey Shows

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
The working poor had a harder time obtaining loans in New Jersey last year than in almost any other state, according to recently released Federal data. Only California and South Dakota ranked lower.
The data, published in January in Inside Fair Lending, the banking trade paper, gauged each bank's compliance with the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which prohibits bias in the offering of loans. Although the act sets no specific quota for these financial institutions, it makes their lending policies subject to annual review by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and three other Federal agencies that oversee the industry. 
 Banks were rated by the total number and the size of loans to low- and moderate-income applicants. The agencies also looked at the number of bank branches or automatic teller machines available in poorer areas, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Consumer advocates said the state's dismal ranking showed that banks and thrifts in New Jersey were more interested in public-relations gimmicks than in lending to those most in need.
"What this shows is, our banks are more interested in sending a bank officer to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity than they are in supplying a mortgage for someone to own their own home," said Andrea Luquetta, a consumer lobbyist for New Jersey Citizen Action. "Volunteering is all well and good, but what people really need are mortgages and loans to start businesses. That's what a bank is supposed to provide."
Timothy Doherty, a spokesman for the 73-member New Jersey Bankers Association, defended his constituents, saying that the ranking system was rigged against states with many small banks like New Jersey. He added that the state had improved its overall rating from 1995, when New Jersey ranked at the absolute bottom of the list. Last year, 4.4 percent of the state's banks and thrifts were assessed as being out of compliance or in need of improvement, compared with 14.3 percent in 1995.
"We have come up overall, and certainly that is a positive sign," he said. "But we will never achieve the level of larger markets like the Philadelphia and New York City regions, which have an extremely large volume of loans. And I think it's hard for regulators sometimes to see this."
States can improve drastically between surveys, as New York has proved. After being ranked the third worst state in 1995, it moved up to the middle only 12 months later, largely because of new lending practices.
While only 52 New York banks had satisfactory lending rates in 1995, the number jumped to 97 the following year. Those in the "outstanding" category rose from 19 to 31.

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
ERIC MUNOZ must have been destined to become a doctor. Who else from the 1961 graduating class of Atlantic Elementary School in Colts Neck would have saved and framed his eighth grade diploma? But there it is, right behind his desk at University Hospital here, jostling for wall space with real sheepskins and dozens of framed mementos, which together tell the crazy-quilt story of his life.
Any one of them can cause the burly, white-haired trauma surgeon to break into a story. There, for example, is a framed front page from the Sept. 28, 1995, Montclair Times -- "Post Office Slayer Will Never Go Free" -- signed gratefully by the only survivor of those shootings, David Grossman, whose life Dr. Munoz saved. "I was on the night that happened," said Dr. Munoz, recalling the phone call that told of a developing hostage situation in Montclair. "Five were coming in by helicopter. Then the call changed." Only Mr. Grossman made it to the hospital; the four others were already dead. 
 On his door is a photograph of a dark-haired Dr. Munoz launching a toy sailboat in Central Park in 1979. Its story is of a freshly minted surgeon, young and single, "living the good life in Manhattan." On another wall is a black-and-white photo, circa 1960, of Dr. Munoz's father at a Hispanic political rally in Monmouth County. Dr. Munoz, too, has become involved in politics, as has his son, William, whose campaign poster for the presidency of his sixth grade class, a post he won last year, hangs nearby.
Dr. Munoz's resume is 23 pages long. In addition to patching up knife and gunshot wounds at the state's busiest trauma center, Dr. Munoz, 50, regularly writes on managed care, teaches surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, is a councilman in Summit, a player in both Hispanic and Republican politics, and the father of five school-age children. He was recently appointed medical affairs liaison at the hospital, making him the official link between the hospital and outside institutions.
All this, and more, makes for a breathless schedule. One recent Thursday, Dr. Munoz went on the annual New Jersey Chamber of Commerce train trip to Washington along with 2,000 political and business leaders, flew back to attend his children's school talent show that night, popped over to a town meeting on preventing drug and alcohol abuse, returned to the talent show and then took his children and his wife, Nancy, out for Slurpees. (He missed his daughter's performance but caught the acts of two sons.) The next night, Dr. Munoz was back on duty in the emergency room, dealing with -- as he puts it -- a "variety of urban types of trauma."
Squeezing everything in isn't easy. "Time is the enemy," he jokes. "My family is worked in -- since it's a priority -- just like work."
At first, the man seems like an hodgepodge of contradictions: a deacon in the Presbyterian church raised by a Polish Jewish mother and a Puerto Rican father; a Republican who believes in gun control; a doctor who also holds an M.B.A.
But talk to him long enough, and certain patterns begin to appear. Dr. Munoz grew up above the Colts Neck General Store, which his parents, William and Frances, ran and which served, in a way, as the nerve center for the town. Anybody who needed to report a fire called the store, which in turn called the firehouse. His father established the town's first ambulance squad, which may have primed Dr. Munoz for his fast-paced medical career.
"When you're in an ambulance, people move out of your way," Dr. Munoz says. He recalls one specific motorcycle wreck right in front of the general store, that turned him from a bystander into an active participant. "I ran in, yelled for my father," Dr. Munoz remembers. "I went out to the street to try to administer first aid." The motorcyclist died anyway.
But even the more mundane chores of making sandwiches and serving strangers in a small-town general store was, in its own way, excellent training for emergency room work, Dr. Munoz says. Not only did he have to work fast and use his hands, but he was also "exposed to the entire population of America, migrant workers to millionaires, the entire spectrum." By the time he was 15, he points out, he had had "thousands of encounters with thousands of different people."
But the most exciting career can become humdrum, and even saving lives can turn routine. "After you do it 10,000 times, it's not as exciting as the first time," Dr. Munoz says. "You have a lot of burnout." If managing his time has been one of the basic challenges in Dr. Munoz's life, fighting boredom has been another.
So, in the early 1980's, Dr. Munoz took an unusual step for a practicing emergency room surgeon. Noticing that the health care system was beginning to undergo profound shifts, he decided to enroll in business school. "I didn't know exactly what was happening, but I knew there would be changes," he says.
Certainly, getting a master's degree in public health would have been a more predictable path for a doctor interested in the economics and politics of health care. But Dr. Munoz wanted to learn a completely different system of thought: "how the stock market works and why people buy soap," as he puts it. And despite the extra cost and work of grafting an M.B.A. program onto his surgical routine, Dr. Munoz was encouraged by one of his mentors from Yale, where he had done his internship and residency. "I don't know what this is going to do for you, but I guarantee that it's going to change your life," his old teacher, Dr. Hastings Kamuria Wright, said.
Dr. Munoz's 1983 M.B.A. from Columbia University indeed gave him the tools with which to understand managed care, and soon he was writing academic articles on titles like "Economic Cost of Trauma" and "Surgonomics." Some of the changes Dr. Munoz has witnessed over the last decade and a half were, in his view, necessary. Americans have now learned that "you can't give everything to everybody all the time," he says. But managed care has also, in Dr. Munoz's opinion, gone too far, and he sees it disappearing altogether 20 years from now. "Medicine's always been a business," he says. "What's different is that these companies have come in and made it brutally clear that profits are profits. They're in the business of not giving you medical care."
And that, in turn, has led Dr. Munoz into politics, the sphere in which he believes medicine will ultimately be saved. His background as a doctor, business school graduate and Hispanic political figure has led him into numerous public roles. He is a member of the New Jersey State Health Planning Board, and he has served on various health task forces and committees in Washington and New York City.
But Dr. Munoz also serves in the sphere of local politics, as councilman at large for the city of Summit, where he lives. Although he is interested in moving from local to state politics, he enjoys the intimacy of the political process at the local level. "It's wonderful," he says. "You learn from it. It's directly connected."
The connection was made even more direct earlier this year when Dr. Munoz, chairman of the public safety committee in Summit, noticed a suspicious character walking down a street in town late one night and called the police from his car phone. It turns out the man had just committed an armed robbery, and Dr. Munoz's vigilance led to a quick arrest.
He loved that moment, doing something directly for the public safety of his town, catching a robber. But it's just one small piece of a very busy life. Another piece is a $250,000 grant from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to identify teen-agers at risk for violence and lead them, through church-run mentor systems, away from drugs and guns and, with any luck, from his emergency room. To Dr. Munoz, that's just one more way of giving back, and remembering where he comes from.
"What you realize as a trauma surgeon is, you can patch people up one at a time, but unless you get at the root forces, you're not going to solve the problem," Dr. Munoz says. "We're not going to get rid of violence, but we don't have to be the most violent country in the world."

HEADLINE: Quick Bite/Middletown;
Hungry for a Cheese Sandwich? Try This Soup

BYLINE: By JOE BRESCIA 

 BODY:
The buzz was everywhere at the mini-mall on Route 35 South.
"Did you try the cheese soup at Benjamin's?" the man behind the counter enthusiastically asked a customer at Steve's Motophoto, a film developing shop. 
 A few doors away, at Rose Garden Gifts, a couple of other shoppers were also raving about their lunch: "The cheddar soup was great, and they served thick sandwiches."
That's what happens when a new restaurant serves a pleasing and economical midday meal.
In this case, the place that had people talking was Benjamin's, a spacious bistro decorated with golf memorabilia. It opened in late December, offering inventive sandwiches, most priced at $5, and the popular cheddar cheese soup, which costs $3.95. (By the way, the restaurant is named for one of the owners, Warren Benjamin Minton.)
The golden-yellow soup, almost thick enough to be a dip, may be brought to your table by Benjamin's pleasant host, Peter Hunt. It's served in a hollowed-out six-inch round of Boston brown bread, on a platter surrounded with slices of brown bread and marble rye.
What's the secret of the thick and tangy soup?
 "Cheddar, milk and smoked ham are among the ingredients we use," said Mr. Hunt, reciting his answer in name, rank and serial number cadence.
A diner quizzed him about detecting the taste of jalapenos.
"That's all I can say," he said. "It's the chef's secret." And then, with a smile, he went to attend to other customers.
But the savory soup is no secret in Middletown, where diners at Benjamin's enjoy a bowl when the days are damp and chilly (and even when they aren't.) For business people, it's a satisfying way to take a break from the phones and computers. For shoppers, it's a place to catch a second wind before resuming their errands. And for golfers, it's a place to entertain visions of warm weather and under-par scores on the local golf courses. JOE BRESCIA
 BENJAMIN'S, 776 Route 35 South, Middletown. (908) 706-5993. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 8 A.M. to 7 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 7 A.M. to 6 P.M.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Popularity Contests for Contrarians

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
What's hot and what's not? And why should stock market investors care?
Study after study has shown that people who put their money in the less-popular sectors of the market tend to do better than those who follow the hordes. That isn't surprising: contrarian investing is a longstanding strategy. 
 Latest to review the ugly-duckling theory are analysts at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund researchers. In a study conducted in January 1996, they found that buying the least-popular fund categories at the beginning of each year, and selling the most popular ones, improved investors' odds. The least-popular equity funds, chosen by cash flow, beat the average equity fund over the next one, two and three years 79 percent of the time from 1987 through 1994 and beat the most-popular funds 92 percent of the time.
At the beginning of this year, Morningstar updated its study by using its new fund categories, which are based on the funds' holdings, not on their objectives. Looking at the cash flow from 1987 through 1995, it found that the unpopular fund categories still won, beating the average equity fund in 19 of 24 time periods and whipping the popular funds 22 of the 24 times.
This year, betting on the underdogs meant owning funds in the utilities, communications and Latin America categories, the three most unpopular on Morningstar's latest list. The most popular categories were real estate, diversified emerging markets and mid-cap growth.
While it may seem logical to buy the most aggressive funds in unpopular categories, Susan Paluch, the managing editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter, argues otherwise.
"More aggressive funds naturally catch a larger rebound, but if their area doesn't recover immediately, they're digging out of a bigger hole," she wrote in reporting on the popularity contest in the newsletter's January issue.
She recommends utilities funds like Fidelity Utilities and Lindner Utility that have less exposure than others to United States interest rates and to deregulation. The Fidelity fund concentrates on energy and services areas and likes the Baby Bells over rate-sensitive electric utilities, while Lindner Utility holds many cable television and satellite communications stocks. For investors willing to take more risk, Ms. Paluch recommends Franklin Utilities.
Among communications funds, she says Flag Investors Telephone Income is most conservative, Fidelity Select Multimedia more daring. But the best option, she said, is the T. Rowe Price closed-end fund, New Age Media, which sells at a small discount.
Similarly, two closed-end Latin America funds are trading at deep discounts: Latin America Equity and Emerging Markets Telecommunications.
Another option, for people who prefer mutual funds, is Scudder Latin America, which Ms. Paluch says is "by far the category's best risk-adjusted performer."
 
Fewer Money Funds Waiving Expenses
Fewer taxable money market funds are waiving expenses to bolster their yields. Only 57.9 percent of 801 taxable money funds did so during the last quarter of 1996, down from 61.2 percent during the comparable period a year earlier.
Three funds waived all expenses in the period, and, not surprisingly, they were among the highest yielders, according to IBC's Money Fund Expense Report.
They were the E-Fund, with a yield of 5.76 percent; Olde Premium Plus, 5.53 percent, and Strategist Money Market, 5.39 percent.
The most expensive fund was John Hancock Money Market Fund/class B shares, which charged its investors 2.08 percent of assets annually.
 
New Name for Omni
Berger Associates of Denver, has purchased the $36 million Omni Investment fund and renamed it the Berger Small Cap Value fund. Bob Perkins, who started the fund in 1987, will continue managing it.
Over the 12 months through Feb. 21, Omni gained 28.5 percent, compared with an average of 15.4 percent for all small-company funds, according to Morningstar. It rose 18 percent a year for the five years ended then, compared with 13.7 percent for its peers. Over the last decade, Omni rose 12.6 percent a year versus 11.9 percent for its peers.
The Berger fund assesses no sales charge; the minimum investment is $2,000.

New Managers
J. Rodman Wright, former assistant manager of Pioneer Capital Growth, has taken the reins of the fund from Warren J. Isabelle, who left the firm.
Invesco Small Company Growth, formerly Invesco Emerging Growth, is now managed by Tim Miller, Stacie Cowell and Trent May, who are part of the five-person team managing Invesco Growth and Invesco Dynamics. John Schroer, the former manager, will focus exclusively on health care funds.
 
New Funds
Turner Ultra Large Cap will invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of companies with market capitalizations greater than $10 billion and with earnings growth potential and reasonable valuations.
John Hancock Financial Industries can invest in brokerage firms, insurance companies, asset management firms, finance companies and banks around the world. It seeks companies that have positive earnings outlooks and that sell for reasonable prices. The co-managers are James Schmidt and Thomas Finucane, who also run John Hancock Regional Bank. The maximum initial sales charge is 5 percent.
 
In Brief
Vanguard Trustees' Equity Fund International will be renamed Vanguard International Value Portfolio, and Vanguard Quantitative Portfolios will become Vanguard Growth and Income Portfolio, both effective on April 30.

In comparing returns each year for the next one, two and three years, the three least-popular equity fund categories beat the three most-popular categories 22 times out of 24. They beat the average equity fund 19 times. Graph shows popularity based on cash moving into or out of the funds, 1987-95. (Source: Morningstar Inc.)

HEADLINE: A Tale of 2 Economists: Sizing Up the Income Gap

 BODY:
"Like Oil and Water: A Tale of Two Economists," by Louis Uchitelle (Feb. 16), examined the contrasting views of Paul Krugman and Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, particularly their explanations for the growth of income inequality in the United States. Here are some readers' responses.
 
To the Editor: 
 I graduated from the predecessor of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management in 1942. The debate between the two M.I.T. economists is mind-boggling enough to convince me that we are looking at pure chaos -- the kind that generates the weather.
The worlds of meteorology and economics have much in common. The only difference is that the weather has been around long enough to establish a healthy state of chaos. (The world of economics, however, seems to be getting there nicely on its own.)
The world's atmosphere, however, has marvelous self-regulations; indeed, we have done well by sitting out our weather since time immemorial. Perhaps that's why the wisest advice you can get from an economic version of a meteorologist is this: When you invest wisely, sit on your investment. Stick with it!
The world economy is as controllable as the weather and just about as determinable. Professor Thurow? Professor Krugman?

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
Making an Impression Even if You Don't Fit the Mold

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Office environments usually breed a welcome camaraderie. But once in a while, circumstances dictate that someone finds himself or herself on the outside looking in.
 One day, Joseph H. Zimmerman of Wilmington, Del., looked up and realized he was alone. He had become the lone man in his section of a large pharmaceutical company, where the work involved complex computerized technical searches in medicine and chemistry. Most members of the unit held advanced degrees in science. 
 There was something else, too.
Mr. Zimmerman was not just the only man working with 13 women; he was also the "old man." In his 60's, he was often sought out by the women for advice, particularly emotional and financial.
In this unit, there was a Thursday morning ritual: a meeting over coffee and goodies in a conference room for relaxed talk, unrelated to work. The boss encouraged the meeting. She thought the atmosphere would enable the staff to get to know one another better, leading to improved interaction on the job.
"After a few sessions I stopped attending," writes Mr. Zimmerman, who was married and had three daughters at home. He said the women, whom he described as a "bright and worldly group," would start discussing "food preparation, love lives, recipes, fashion and the latest office gossip."
"Everybody took turns bringing in cookies and cakes they had prepared at home," he said. "I did not feel like baking cookies, and I didn't feel I should ask my wife to prepare goodies for my coffee group."
Birthday celebrations were a particular challenge. "Men just don't give a hoot about birthdays," he said. "Cards had to be bought and signed by everyone with cute little poems or soppy sentiments." And then the recipient was supposed to be surprised at the card and the cake.
"One day my boss came into my office and noted that I hadn't been to Thursday coffee in a while," Mr. Zimmerman continued. "She felt it was important that we have a relaxed bonding experience once a week. Once I told her my complaints, she nodded in understanding and laughingly told me I was excused from Thursday morning coffee time."
He has since retired, but every few months he rejoins his closest co-workers for lunch and a chance to catch up on company gossip.
But, he said, "I don't have to bring any cookies and cake."
Linda A. Teplin says she was something of a novelty in 1975 as one of the few women who served as faculty members at a large university medical school. Though clearly not discriminatory, the school had made few provisions for people like her.
She writes: "There were two washrooms on each floor: 'faculty' and 'ladies.' I never did figure out which one was intended for me."
Then there is David Erickson of Chatham, Mass., an editor with the Adams-Laux Publishing Company, who woke up one day to find himself the only male in his office after the only other man was laid off.
The next day the sign on the men's-room door was covered over.
The new sign said, "Dave's room."
Alice Dayton, 52, who works in Manhattan for Makovsky & Company, a public relations firm, deals with being twice the age of most of her office co-workers by telling "I remember" stories.
Some go this way:
"I remember walking around inside the first computer.
"I remember the first calculator. I was an economist at the fifth-largest corporation in the world. Lots of statistics. To multiply by five, you set the pins and whizzed the handle around five times.
"I remember when you had to crank the telephone to ring the operator.
"I remember before television, plastic bags and pantyhose.
"I remember when you had to squoosh the yellow packet in margarine to give it color.
"I remember rumble seats."
"A couple of years ago, I was a 58-year-old in a high-tech company populated by people my children's age," writes a Massachusetts man who asks that his name be withheld. "I could do E-mail, but that was about it; and my younger colleagues harangued me to use the laptops and other high-tech tools with which they surrounded themselves.
"Finally, I gave in and arranged to take a course in computer fundamentals."
The request was processed through the vice president for human resources, a younger man, and was returned with a note that said: "Approved, but I didn't think old dogs could learn new tricks."
The man replied via E-mail: "Thanks for your approval. I enjoyed your joke. So did my attorney."
Within minutes, the vice president was in the man's office. "He laughingly explained he was kidding, and I laughingly replied that I was, too," the man writes.
"I'm not saying any of that helped my career, but it's two years later, I'm still employed there and still the oldest dog in the pen."

 BODY:
Phew! At last the Humphrey-Hawkins Congressional testimony is over. I left them as confused as ever, and I have all the freedom of movement I could possibly want. I'll be using that freedom to tighten soon, no matter how much static I get from the "growth at any risk" crowd.
It is a little amazing, even in my 10th year in the job, to see how Wall Street hangs on my every word, yet manages to misinterpret many of them. Having issued three warnings about how stock prices were a bit rich, I threw a concession to the bulls, and they leaped for it as if it were a red cape. And we all know what happens to bulls who go for red capes. 
 "If profit margins continue to rise as Wall Street analysts expect them to," I told the House Banking Committee on Wednesday, "then the market is properly priced as best we can judge on the basis of the level of where interest rates are."
And, I might have added, if the moon is made of green cheese, then there is probably a cow up there somewhere.
What I know, and what everyone ought to know, is that analysts almost always overestimate earnings growth. Which is why stocks almost always seem cheap compared with forecasts. Now, they seem reasonable. And nobody bit on that qualification about interest rates. Did no one remember the hints I've been throwing around about "pre-emptive" action to halt inflation before it appears? I may not be very good at predicting the stock market, but I sure can forecast changes in short-term interest rates.
The Dow rose 93 points on that remark. And they loved it when I said I didn't view monetary policy as a tool to "prick the stock market bubble." That's the whole point. The stock market is not a bubble yet, but it's getting close to being one. I hope something will happen to slow the ascent of prices, or to bring them down gradually. Nobody has ever peacefully deflated a bubble.
I've lived a charmed life as Fed chairman. The 1987 crash came so early in my tenure that no one thought I was to blame. Then I engineered a steep yield curve so that the banks could borrow from depositors cheaply and make good money on two-year Treasuries. That got the banks out of the hole they had dug themselves into with a lot of foolish real estate loans. Now, almost everyone treats me with the kind of respect that other central bankers crave.
But more and more, I find myself thinking about Japan. In the 1980's, when real estate and stock prices were becoming a bubble, its central bank looked at inflation statistics, found them comforting, and did nothing until it was far too late. I won't make that mistake.
Now the Bank of Japan is desperately trying to get that economy moving, but it must deal with a Government too timid to use public money to rescue dying banks. It has pushed interest rates so low that they are financing speculation around the world, even if they haven't done much for Japan's economy. How I wish they would raise rates, or do something to push up the yen and scare the speculators.
Obviously, I can't let stocks be the only thing I watch. I've got two weapons -- my mouth and the Federal funds rate -- and with them I'm supposed to keep watch on economic growth, inflation and the dollar. Pushing up interest rates a bit will be easy. But what do I do if the economy looks a little weak and yet stocks keep soaring? Maybe I keep tightening. I don't think that would bring on a recession. At least I hope it wouldn't.
One thing I'm sure of: if the economy or the stock market crashes on my watch, I'll get the blame. I've got to find a way to make sure that doesn't happen. It would be nice if the stock market would deflate in a nice, gentle fashion. But if it won't, I'll have to find a way to encourage it not to become the kind of a bubble that would ruin my reputation, not to mention the economy.
