HEADLINE: The Road to Vegas: $55 and 70 Years

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Before she retires as chief executive on March 1, Marilyn Carlson Nelson will preside over a 70th anniversary celebration in Las Vegas this week for Carlson, the travel, lodging, restaurant and marketing business that began as the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938. 
 Ms. Nelson's father, Curtis L. Carlson, started the company in Minneapolis with a $55 loan, according to the Carlson Web site. In 2006, the company, which is still based in Minnesota, had sales of $37.1 billion; it employs almost 200,000 people under operations that include T.G.I. Friday's and Radisson Hotels. 
 In 1998, Ms. Nelson took over the chief executive post from her father, who died the next year. Last month, the company named Hubert Joly, head of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, to succeed Ms. Nelson as chief executive; she will remain chairwoman.
 That announcement came after a legal battle began between Ms. Nelson and her son, Curtis Carlson Nelson, former president and chief operating officer. Mr. Nelson left the company in 2006 and contended that he had been led to believe he would become chief executive. The company and a spokesman for Mr. Nelson both said that all legal issues had been resolved. The company would not comment further. 
 In a phone interview last week, Ms. Nelson, 68, said she was disappointed that a family member would not be running Carlson. She said she expected that over time, the job would be held at various times by ''family candidates and external candidates, whoever can best lead what has become a very large company.''
 The Las Vegas celebration will include speeches by Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, the departing chief executive of Nestle; Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister; and Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum.
 An evening gala will feature entertainment by Tony Bennett and the appropriately Minnesotan Garrison Keillor. JANE L. LEVERE 
 A CHARITY REMEMBERED When chief executives resign, their severance agreements usually reflect a concern for them and only them. But Peter van Stolk, the founder and departing chief executive of Jones Soda, appears to have considered people less fortunate than himself when he negotiated the terms of his departure this month. 
 Along with $450,000 in severance, Jones agreed to pay $100,000 to Mr. van Stolk to give to Vitamin Angels, a charity focused on the nutritional health of children in underdeveloped countries. He has supported Vitamin Angels through Jones for years.
 Last year, the company posted a video on YouTube and pledged to give 25 cents to the charity every time somebody watched the video, up to a limit of one million viewings. PATRICK McGEEHAN
 RUSSIAN TYCOONS TANGLE Alisher Usmanov, a Russian billionaire who made a fortune in distressed assets of mines and steel mills, has entered a takeover struggle for Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel and platinum group metals. 
 It is the most ambitious maneuver yet for Mr. Usmanov, who rose from inside Gazprom in the 1990s and survived a purge at the company after President Vladimir V. Putin came to power in Russia. 
 Now, Mr. Usmanov's ties to Gazprom are seen as auspicious in Moscow, where reliable connections to the Kremlin are essential for business survival and success.
 Mr. Usmanov's entry threatens the ambitions of another of Russia's richest men, the aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who is trying to gain control of Norilsk. 
 The two longtime owners of Norilsk, Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail D. Prokhorov (each worth about $21 billion, according to Finans magazine in Russia) said last year that they would divide their assets, setting off the current struggle. Mr. Prokhorov subsequently sold most of his stake to Mr. Deripaska.
 Norilsk, which is based in Siberia, began as a gulag slave labor camp. Today it has a market capitalization of $57 billion. ANDREW E. KRAMER 
 PAY DELAY Many corporations allow their senior executives to defer the receipt of some of their pay and collect it later, plus interest. For Ara K. Hovnanian, the chief executive of Hovnanian Enterprises, the company's deferred-compensation program has not been a can't-lose proposition. 
 The value of Mr. Hovnanian's deferred-pay account dropped more than $13 million last year, according to the company's proxy statement. To some degree, he suffered with the shareholders as the battering of the home-building industry took more than 75 percent off the price of Hovnanian's stock in 2007. But unlike the rest of them, Mr. Hovnanian was able to cushion the blow with a gain of $4.6 million from exercising options on the company's stock. PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: Governors of Both Parties Oppose New Medicaid Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Governors of both parties strongly objected on Saturday to a half-dozen new federal Medicaid regulations that they said would shift billions of dollars in costs to the states, forcing them to consider cutbacks in services. 
 The rules, scheduled to take effect in the next few months, would reduce federal payments for public hospitals, teaching hospitals and services for the disabled, among others. 
 State officials voiced their concerns as they arrived here for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association. 
 Federal health officials said the new rules were needed to end creative financing techniques that states had used to obtain excessive amounts of federal Medicaid money. 
 But governors said the Bush administration was unilaterally reshaping Medicaid in ways that would harm some of their most vulnerable citizens. Moreover, they said, the rules are taking effect at a time when the national economic slowdown is cutting into state tax revenues. 
 ''Governors strongly oppose the changes,'' said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican who is chairman of the association's Health and Human Services Committee. ''The timing could not be worse.''
 One of the rules would ban the use of federal Medicaid money to help pay for the training of doctors, a use that has been allowed since the inception of Medicaid more than 40 years ago. Another would set new limits on Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes operated by states, cities, counties and other units of government.
 A third rule would limit Medicaid coverage of rehabilitation services for people with disabilities, including serious mental illnesses.
 Federal officials estimate that the rules will save the federal government $15 billion over five years. But that figure may be low. California alone says it could lose $12 billion over five years.
 Congress delayed some of the rules last year, but they will soon take effect unless Congress intervenes again.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, said the rule changes ''would effectively end the federal government's participation in many crucial components of the Medicaid program.'' 
 Dr. Rhonda M. Medows, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Health, said: ''We understand the need for financial safeguards, but these rules, taken together, would have a tremendous adverse impact. They would undermine the health care safety net for the entire state of Georgia, reducing federal Medicaid payments for hospitals, nursing homes and school clinics.''
 The National Conference of State Legislatures joined governors in criticizing what it described as ''the regulatory activism'' displayed in the new rules.
 The federal government and the states share the cost of Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 60 million low-income people, including 30 million children. 
 Dennis G. Smith, director of the federal Center for Medicaid and State Operations, said the rules were needed to ''protect the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program.'' Since 2003, he said, federal officials have persuaded 30 states to end ''questionable Medicaid financing arrangements.'' The purpose of such arrangements is to maximize the use of federal money while holding down the use of state and local revenue.
 Although the most blatant problems have been corrected, the administration says, many states still use federal Medicaid money for purposes unrelated to Medicaid.
 ''We believe that paying for graduate medical education is outside the scope of Medicaid's role, which is to provide medical care to low-income people,'' Mr. Smith said. ''There is no explicit authorization under the Medicaid statute to subsidize the training of physicians.''
 Robert M. Dickler, chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said, ''It's a little surprising that the federal government would just now discover that there's no legal basis for the Medicaid payments it's been making for medical education since 1965.''
 Stan Rosenstein, the Medicaid director in California, said the payments were justified because ''interns and residents provide a tremendous amount of care to Medicaid beneficiaries.'' 
 The federal government says this rule would save $1.8 billion over five years. But New York, which trains 15 percent of the nation's doctors, says it would lose more than that alone. State officials are also concerned about a rule that would eliminate federal contributions for a whole category of public spending on health care for the poor -- specifically, spending by autonomous units of local government like the Denver Health and Hospital Authority.
 ''As a result of this rule, we will lose $60 million a year,'' said Dr. Patricia A. Gabow, chief executive of the Denver agency, which operates a 477-bed public hospital, the city's public health department and its ambulance service. ''We were part of the city government for more than 130 years. In 1997, we became an independent governmental entity, but we don't have taxing authority. So we don't qualify as a public provider, and we can't draw down critically important subsidies for services we provide to the entire community.''
 Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals, said the rule's importance went far beyond Medicaid because it would compromise the ability of public hospitals to provide vital services like trauma care and burn treatment. 
 New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the largest municipal health care system in the country, which gets 60 percent of its budget from Medicaid, said the rules would have ''a potentially devastating impact'' and could force cutbacks in services.
 A group of 17 states, including Connecticut, Michigan and New Jersey, told the administration that the new restrictions were ''simply awful public policy.'' Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, are fighting the rule on public hospitals. 
 The rule ''would have a devastating effect on North Carolina's Medicaid system, costing our hospitals hundreds of millions of dollars annually,'' Mrs. Dole said.
 The Medicaid rules were overshadowed last year by a battle over insurance for children.
 ''We can have a legitimate discussion about expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program,'' said Governor Douglas of Vermont. ''But the Medicaid rules are different. They renege on commitments already made.''
 In Vermont, Mr. Douglas said, ''we've come to rely on Medicaid to help pay for special education and other services to children with disabilities.''
 Medicaid is a crucial part of the foundation on which many states were planning to build coverage for the uninsured. 
 Deborah S. Bachrach, a deputy commissioner in the New York State Health Department, said, ''The new Medicaid rules make it difficult to pay for current programs and nearly impossible to expand coverage to all.''

HEADLINE: Texas Women, With a Strong Legacy, Size Up the Democratic Field

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
She served as first lady through her husband's two terms, suffered the indignities of his impeachment and then made history running for his office on her own.
 No, not her. It was Miriam Amanda Wallace Ferguson, known as ''Ma,'' the first woman elected governor of Texas, back in 1924.
 So you'll pardon the women of Texas (and Ma Ferguson was known for her generous pardons) if they don't go all wobbly over the idea of the first female president.
 Texas is no stranger to powerful women, which is why it was scarcely accidental that in Thursday night's debate, both Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama bowed to such trailblazers as former Representative Barbara Jordan and former Gov. Ann Richards. 
 ''While all those redneck bubba cowboys were driving the cattle, the women were running the ranches,'' said Terri Burke, a longtime Abilene newspaper editor who was recently named executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.
 As Texas prepares to deliver a giant and perhaps decisive verdict on March 4 on the two closely matched Democratic presidential contenders, women -- who traditionally outnumber men at the polls in this state and around the nation -- may well hold the key to victory. And while many women champion Mrs. Clinton's bid for the White House as the obvious next leap across the gender gap, others say her historic candidacy no longer carries the same urgency as it would have, say, for their mothers' generation.
 ''We're beyond feminism,'' said Kathy DeLange, 64, a retired school psychologist, who wore her heart on her head -- an Obama cap -- as she arrived at the polls here on Tuesday for the first day of early primary voting. ''We're into personism now.'' 
 But not so for Jane Tillinghast, a certified public accountant who said she had just cast her ballot for ''somebody seasoned and experienced'' -- Mrs. Clinton. ''I grew up at the beginning of the women's movement,'' said Ms. Tillinghast, 61. ''There's an awful lot of prejudice against Hillary.''
 Experts say the women's vote in Texas is likely to be sliced and diced by age, race and economics, fragmenting any unity and making assumptions risky, particularly with the party crossovers of the open primaries.
 With younger women gravitating to Mr. Obama, there are still many women like Melanie Carter, 31, an accountant and mother of a 12-week-old son, who said: ''I definitely would like a woman as president. I don't know when we'll get another shot.'' 
 But Frances T. Farenthold, 81, a prominent national Democrat who is known as Sissy and served from 1969 to 1973 as the only woman in the Texas House of Representatives, said she could not forgive Mrs. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war and was supporting Mr. Obama.
 ''I'm not going to set aside everything because a woman is running,'' Ms. Farenthold said, adding that the state's tradition of strong women went only so far. ''There's a tradition of having pets, too,'' she said.
 As a top Texas Republican, Comptroller Susan Combs is unlikely to vote for either Democrat, but she said Mrs. Clinton's candidacy was not the automatic draw for women it once might have been. 
 ''Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto -- for us to be looking at a woman as president, it's a little late,'' said Ms. Combs, who also served as state agriculture commissioner. 
 ''Women have gotten comfortable in their own skin, regardless of whether they are Republicans or Democrats,'' she said. ''They don't have to vote for 'The Woman.' ''
 It was different when Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990, Ms. Combs said, adding, ''There was a disproportionate shift of women voting for a woman.'' 
 Since then, she said, Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, became the first woman elected to the Senate from Texas and is one of the state's top vote-getters. She is a likely candidate for governor in 2010 or possibly even for vice president this year.
 Ms. Richards, who lost the governor's mansion to George W. Bush in 1994 and died in 2006, would not have taken Mrs. Clinton's bid so lightly, said Cathy Bonner, one of her confidantes. 
 ''Her legacy to us is, it would matter when the first woman became president and the leader of the free world and commander in chief,'' said Ms. Bonner, a marketing executive who was director of the State Commerce Department from 1991 to 1994. ''It's very important for generations to come after 220 years of never having a woman's voice at that level.''
 Ms. Bonner said Mrs. Clinton was in the mold of the Texas pioneers, ''women of true grit, survivorship and independence,'' who, she said, were out ''pulling the wagon, just like the men.''
 Gretchen Ritter, director of the Center for Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, said the state had a dual legacy. ''We have long produced strong women leaders, but we're also a Southern state, not supportive of the position of women,'' Dr. Ritter said.
 The civil rights and feminism movements of the 1960s and '70s, she said, propelled a wave of memorable Texas women into public life: Ms. Jordan, the first black woman in the Texas Senate, who later became the first black woman to represent a once-Confederate state in the House of Representatives; Irma Rangel, the first Mexican-American woman in the Texas House; Eddie Bernice Johnson, the first woman to lead a major Texas House committee and now a member of Congress from Dallas; and Sarah Weddington, who argued Roe v. Wade.
 And Texas would hardly have been the same without the columnist and author Molly Ivins, who died of breast cancer last year at 62 and used her last column to denounce the war in Iraq. ''Raise hell,'' she wrote. ''Think of something to make the ridiculous look ridiculous.''
 But few Texas matriarchs matched the antic record of the groundbreaking Ma Ferguson, who won office at 49 after her husband, James, was impeached in his second term in 1917 after feuding with the University of Texas and taking a $156,000 ''loan'' from the state's beer brewers. (Wyoming had become the first state to inaugurate a woman as governor two weeks earlier.) 
 Mrs. Ferguson vowed to share leadership with her ousted husband, offering ''two governors for the price of one,'' and battled the Ku Klux Klan. But she became notorious for her prolific and possibly lucrative executive pardons that sprang about 100 convicts a month from prison. 
 Once in the Texas Capitol, a legendary story goes, she nearly collided with a man, who said, ''Pardon me.'' ''Sure,'' she responded. ''Come on in. It'll only take a minute or two to do the paperwork.'' 
 She fended off an effort to impeach her as well, finished her two-year term, and ran again and won in 1932. 
 Texas politics has sobered up some over the years, but this year's Democratic presidential primary contest is likely to be as hard-fought as any, with the contenders vying to exploit differences among women and Hispanics and wrest the slightest advantage from otherwise obscure hot local races.
 ''A lot is generational in Texas,'' said Dr. Ritter, a political scientist and the author of ''The Constitution as Social Design.'' ''Women 40 and older are more aware of gender discrimination, and maybe more distrustful of a charismatic man in the public arena. But tons of younger women are going out for Obama.''
 State Representative Ana E. Hernandez, 29, Democrat of Houston and the youngest woman in the Texas House, is a case in point. She is a Mexican-born lawyer, ''both female and minority,'' who resisted widespread Hispanic support for Mrs. Clinton and cast her vote for Mr. Obama. 
 So did Kelly Greenwood, 37, a lawyer who said she changed her mind every week before deciding on Mr. Obama. ''I think the world will adore him,'' she said.
 But Janis Hutchens, 58, a flight attendant originally from Arkansas -- where, she volunteered, ''I loved the Clintons'' -- said she cast her vote to send a woman to the White House.

HEADLINE: Missile Strike By Israelis In Gaza Kills 3 Palestinians

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli Army missile strike in the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday afternoon, Palestinian medical officials said. It was not immediately clear whether those killed were civilians or combatants. 
 Local witnesses said the three were sitting outdoors, drinking tea and smoking, in an area east of Beit Hanun, near the border with Israel, when they were killed. No militant group immediately claimed them as members. The three were all men in their 20s, according to a Palestinian medical official.
 But an Israeli Army spokesman said ground forces had attacked a squad that was on its way to fire mortar shells at Israel. ''According to our information, those who were hit were armed men,'' the spokesman said. 
 Militants from Gaza fired four mortar shells at Israel earlier Saturday, but caused no casualties or damage, the spokesman said. 
 On Saturday morning, advocates in Gaza, which is controlled by the militant Islamic group Hamas, tried to impose a half-day strike as part of a public campaign against Israel's economic embargo of the strip. Store owners were asked to remain closed until 11 a.m., with limited success. 
 Israel has restricted the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza since Hamas took over the area last June. It recently tightened the blockade in response to intensified rocket fire from the strip. Israel, like the United States and the European Union, classifies Hamas as a terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it. Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Dimona earlier this month.
 But European Union and United Nations officials have recently raised concerns about the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. European officials have been trying to bring about discussions among Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, which is led by President Mahmoud Abbas, about a controlled reopening of the passages into Gaza. The government of Mr. Abbas, which is based in the West Bank, has offered to send back members of the Presidential Guard to secure the crossings. 
 On Thursday, the European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, France, passed a nonbinding resolution urging Israel not to inflict ''collective punishment'' on civilians in Gaza because of the rockets, and called on Israel to lift the blockade.
 But Israel contends that opening the crossings would strengthen Hamas and is skeptical about the ability of the pro-Abbas forces to act in Gaza independently of the rival Islamic group. 
 The foreign minister of Israel, Tzipi Livni, said Thursday, ''It would be better if Europe understood that Gaza is a zero-sum game -- either Hamas or the moderates.'' 
 She spoke after meeting with Marc Otte, the visiting European Union special representative to the Middle East peace process, and was referring to the Abbas camp, with whom Israel is engaged in peace talks.
 Also on Saturday, Mr. Abbas ordered an investigation into the death in custody of a Hamas preacher from the West Bank. The preacher, Majed Barghouti, 44, from the village of Kobar, died Friday in a Palestinian intelligence service prison in Ramallah run by pro-Fatah forces loyal to Mr. Abbas. Mr. Barghouti was detained a week earlier. His family alleged that he had been tortured by his interrogators and said that he was healthy when he was arrested. The intelligence service suggested that Mr. Barghouti had died of heart problems. 
 Scores of Hamas members have been detained in the West Bank by pro-Abbas forces since the Hamas takeover of Gaza. Many have been released after handing over weapons. 
 In the West Bank early Saturday, Israeli forces arrested a senior militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a militant leftist group, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. The militant, Majdi Mabrouk, was arrested at his home in the Ein Beit Ilma refugee camp in Nablus.

HEADLINE: U.S. Defense Chief and Australians Insist Alliance Is Strong

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and top Australian officials insisted Saturday that the security alliance between the United States and Australia had not frayed despite Australia's recent pledge to remove all combat forces from Iraq. 
 Australia's new prime minister, Kevin Rudd, announced late last year that the country's 550 combat troops in Iraq would leave by mid-2008, fulfilling a pledge he made during his campaign against John Howard, whom Mr. Rudd defeated in November's parliamentary elections. 
 But Mr. Gates and his Australian hosts accentuated the positive, talking about the many foreign policy matters on which the two countries agree. Mr. Gates praised the work of the roughly 1,000 troops Australia has deployed in Afghanistan, and Stephen Smith, Australia's foreign minister, said things were ''effectively business as usual.''
 Mr. Gates traveled to Canberra with John D. Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state, for a slate of annual security and diplomatic talks between the United States and Australia. Yet the visit was just as important as a way for the administration to take the measure of Mr. Rudd, who had spent some of his campaign criticizing Mr. Howard for marching in lockstep with President Bush.
 Mr. Gates was the first member of the Bush cabinet to meet with Mr. Rudd since he was elected. Mr. Rudd is a longtime critic of the Iraq war, and opinion polls in Australia showed that only about a third of Australians supported keeping troops in Iraq. 
 During a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Gates wore a blue sling on his right arm, which he had fractured after slipping on ice at his home in Washington. 
 Since taking office, Mr. Rudd has shown a willingness to break with the Bush administration on matters besides Iraq. He reversed the policy of his predecessor by signing the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, making the United States the only industrialized nation that has not ratified the agreement. 
 Still, Australian officials emphasized how essential Australia's alliance with the United States was to their country's security and said they did not intend to reduce Australia's commitment of troops to Afghanistan. 
 They also brushed aside questions about whether Australia's growing economic ties to China would influence the country's defense policy toward Beijing. Mr. Rudd is a former diplomat who was stationed in Beijing for several years and speaks Mandarin. 
 Mr. Smith, the foreign minister, even pointed out how much the Bush administration had tied the American economy to the Chinese market. 
 ''Australia's economic engagement with China is only beaten by the U.S.'s economic engagement with China,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Future to Wince At

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA. 
Anthony DePalma is the author of ''The Man Who Invented Fidel: , Castro, Cuba and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times.''

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
 A SIMPLE rule that correspondents follow is, ''The bigger the news, the smaller the story.'' In other words, to bring home the impact of a monumental event, tell how it touches ordinary people. In the last few days, on a trip to Cuba that was in every way supposed to be about the lives of ordinary people -- my own family -- the big news story found me. 
 The visit started as a reunion in Cuba of two sides of our family whom international politics had kept divided for decades.
 My wife, Miriam, left behind much of her family when her grandmother whisked her out of Cuba in 1962. She and I had visited over the years, but she always was afraid to bring our three children, fearing they might somehow be snatched from her. But now that they are adults, she wanted them to know the grandmother they had never kissed, and the tragic homeland they had only seen in photos. 
 We arrived not at the fine new airport in Havana I've used many times as a correspondent, but at a smaller, more crowded one that Cuba uses for these family visits, as if to rebuke exiles for having left. 
 Our reunion was delayed, however, by the surprise announcement last Tuesday that Fidel Castro -- whose revolution had torn the family apart -- was too ill to return to power. Suddenly, I was at work. 
 When the Cuban National Assembly meets today to pick a president and commander in chief, it won't be Fidel Castro. But nobody can be sure whether his vow to step aside offers a distant hope of mending the breach between Cuba and the United States, or is just a reminder of how difficult that would be. 
 Still, what most surprised us was how little Cubans clamored for drastic change. Dictator or hero, Mr. Castro's grip on power was ending, and no one seemed to care. Miriam was disappointed that the streets of Matanzas, Havana, San Agustin and Guanabacoa, the working class city across Havana Bay where she grew up, were tranquil, as if nothing at all had happened. 
 Of course we understood that things are not always as they seem, and that became clear when the maid in our 133-year-old hotel came to mop up the mess caused by a leaking pipe. Hearing the lilt of Miriam's Spanish put her at ease. After chatting for a few minutes, she poked her head into the hallway to check for supervisors and shut the door. Only then did she speak from the heart. 
 ''Nobody says it, but everybody knows that someone new could be worse than what we have now,'' she whispered. It was the kind of declaration I've learned to trust because it stems from neither fear nor a desire to curry favor. 
 Despite having plenty of motivation to demand change -- the frequent shortages, the decrepit housing, the cruelty of having one currency for tourists and another with far less buying power for Cubans -- she said she feared change more than she feared the status quo. Then she checked the hallway again.
 Such skittishness might seem odd to Americans. After all, change seems to be on the lips of every candidate back home. 
 But just as Americans are debating what change means, and how to accomplish it, Cubans see change in many different ways. After Fidel's announcement, the Communist Party newspapers and state-controlled television mockingly dismissed foreign news reports that change was suddenly in the air over Cuba. ''They talk about a coming epoch of change, as if the revolution hasn't been an epoch of change from the beginning,'' Lazaro Barredo Medina, editor in chief of the party daily Granma, said in one broadcast. 
 Truth is, things have changed since my first trip to Cuba in 1978. The heavy presence of the Soviet Union then is a faint shadow now, reflected in blue-eyed Cubans named Yuri. There seem to be more new cars on the roads, more fast food on the street, and more buildings undergoing repair. There even seem to be more buses and fewer people waiting for them since Fidel's younger brother and temporary replacement, Raul, publicly demanded that something be done about the pitiful mass transit system when I was here just a year ago. 
 But much has not changed, or has gotten worse. More families live two or three generations in the same cramped apartments. Detention, interrogation and other troubles still descend on people who dissent in ways as small as wearing a plastic wrist band embossed with the word ''cambio,'' which means change. The press is still controlled, and disloyalty to the Communist Party still raises the suspicion of neighbors that can lead to the loss of a job or a house. Dissidents remain enemies of the state.
 Still, many people we met shared a fear expressed by Miguel, a 62-year-old retired army lieutenant colonel who lives in Altamar, just outside Havana. He drives a 1958 Dodge with bad brakes and a top speed of about 37, which is the number of years he has owned it. He said he worried about only one thing after Mr. Castro: what he called the Americanization of Cuba.
 By that he meant a savage capitalism that might take away from Cubans the best houses, the best land, the best factories. In short, if a transition means that the little they have managed to acquire might be taken away, he'd rather not change. 
 Cuba is not a country where change has ever come easily; when it has come, injustice and violence often were its companions. Cubans know that what the Cuban-American analyst Marifeli Perez-Stable of the Inter-American Dialogue calls Cuba's ''long century'' -- the turbulent period that began with the wars of independence from Spain in the mid-19th century and continues today -- has brought little peace. 
 The revolution itself has left many Cubans, including our relatives here, fed up with promises of change. They long ago tired of sacrificing for an ideal tomorrow; when we finally got together, three days after Fidel's announcement, Miriam's stepbrothers and sisters told me their main concerns are getting enough to eat, getting shoes for their children and getting to work on time each day.
 Cuba's leaders also fear sudden change because it would undermine the official legend of a triumphant socialist revolution. As the 50th anniversary of Fidel Castro's Jan. 1, 1959, victory approaches, Cubans cannot escape the past. Film clips of Fidel fighting in the Sierra alongside Che Guevara are on TV every day. The 62-foot wooden pleasure boat ''Granma'' with which Castro and 81 insurgents launched their uprising in 1956 remains on display under glass in the center of Havana, a revolutionary Ark of the Covenant. 
 Of course, Fidel Castro has led the resistance to change, grasping power for so long that he has gone from fierce young rebel to doddering old man before the eyes of the world. Mostly bedridden for the last 19 months, he has stubbornly refused to step aside until now. But even a Maximum Leader cannot fend off time forever, or do anything to stop the impending loss of his friend and economic crutch, Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan leftist whose electorate has insisted that he abide by the country's term limits. 
 There is growing evidence that Mr. Castro's brother Raul has grown impatient with his role as place holder and has been agitating for a permanent transfer of power. Although Raul is considered the weaker of the two men, he has stood up to his older brother before. During Fidel's first trip to the United States in 1959, Raul met him in a Houston hotel and told him to stop touring like a rock star and get back to serious business in Havana. Fidel returned shortly and adopted a decidedly tougher stance toward the United States. 
 As head of the armed forces since 1959, Raul Castro has kept the army one of the few functional institutions in Cuba. His reputation today as an efficient manager is as strong as his revolutionary reputation was as an efficient executioner. 
 Whatever form a new Cuban regime takes -- Raul as president with younger, post-revolutionary officials arrayed as vice presidents or some surprise variation -- Fidel's presence will continue to be felt, even if, as he has promised, he becomes a simple ''soldier of ideas,'' dedicated to thinking and writing. 
 Sitting at an old Havana cafe, a friend put it to me this way: Fidel is like a huge Airbus that leaves so much turbulence in its wake that other aircraft cannot take off or land behind it until the air clears. Even in his absence from power, Fidel will shape the actions of whoever comes after him. 
 When Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian president, heard about Mr. Castro's effective resignation he said: ''Fidel is already a myth.'' Alejandro Rodriguez, a columnist for the newspaper Juventud Rebelde (''Rebel Youth,'' another name from revolutionary mythology) wrote last week that ''Fidel is Cuba, because Juan, Pedro, Chico and Mariana are Fidel.'' 
 No one would have expected our children, Aahren, Andres and Laura Felice, to feel like part of Cuba or Fidel as they gingerly set foot in their mother's homeland for the first time. They delighted in the beauty of the seacoast and the countryside, but grew upset as beggars and pimps tailed them in old Havana. The three peppered Miriam with questions, asking without fully realizing what they were saying, ''What was it like when you were Cuban?'' After bringing flowers to the tomb of the grandfather they never knew, squeezing into the sliver of a house where Miriam once lived, and peeking into the worn-out school that she had once attended, they simply fell silent. 
 When they finally got to meet their Cuban family, an expected initial awkwardness soon gave way to discoveries of points of concurrence: the boredom of school, the frustration of seeking a first job, planning for the future.
 But that is where the reality of our two worlds imposed itself. Aahren, our oldest son, had just become a lawyer; his cousin Aidan and a friend had just figured out a way to grind up pork into ham that they smoke for 12 hours in a makeshift hothouse in the yard. Aahren is planning a full life ahead; Aidan dreams of taking to the sea.
 ''Cubans today are not like the Cubans of the 1950s,'' Aidan said. He thinks that 50 years of worrying about getting enough to eat has beaten the heart out of them. Inside their refrigerator were the eight eggs per month they are rationed, and little else.
 Given time it might be possible to bridge the gap between their dreams. But for that to happen, there will have to be change. 
 Their 81-year-old Cuban grandmother is ill now, and if she does not survive, our children will not be able to go back to Cuba unless American laws change; they do not now permit visits to see uncles and cousins.
 Miriam, close to tears, told me she would never go back because too much has already changed. 
 Of course, there will shortly be new presidents in both Cuba and the United States. If that changes things, that would be big news, and I will be back.

HEADLINE: Where 'Mortgage' Isn't a Scary Word

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
INVEST in a mortgage REIT? For some people, that might seem as foolhardy as buying swampland in Florida.
 There is good reason for the trepidation surrounding these real estate investment trusts, which hold mortgage debt or lend money to owners and developers. The sector lost a staggering 42 percent, on average, in 2007 and 19 percent, annualized, over the last three years, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Over five years, returns for the sector have been relatively flat. 
 (By contrast, the far larger market of equity REITs, which own portfolios of commercial real estate, had average annualized returns of nearly 9 percent over three years and about 19 percent over five, though it reversed course last year, posting negative returns of nearly 16 percent, on average, amid concerns about the economy.) 
 A confluence of economic circumstances is blamed for the dismal performance of mortgage REITs: a wave of mortgage prepayments from refinancing, and rising short-term interest rates, along with, oddly, falling long-term rates. Later, the subprime mortgage crisis took its toll. Dozens of mortgage companies have filed for bankruptcy, including REITs like American Home Mortgage Investment and New Century Financial. 
 ''Some people just hear the word 'mortgage' now and they are afraid,'' said Michael R. Widner, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. 
 But a handful of mortgage REITs is managing to rise above the rubble and even thrive as the economy falters. They are the so-called agency REITs, which devote the bulk of their portfolios to residential mortgages guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The subset includes Annaly Capital Management, MFA Mortgage Investments, the Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation and the Capstead Mortgage Corporation.
 While the outlook remains grim for the mortgage REIT sector as a whole, and while overall credit quality has deteriorated, many analysts have a positive view on these specialized companies. ''These are the hidden gems, and this is their time to shine,'' said Steven C. DeLaney, a senior research analyst at JMP Securities. 
 ''They are very much countercyclical to the economy and to financials in general,'' he added. ''They are traditionally recession-loving stocks. They also do not have any material degree of credit risk.'' 
 Mr. DeLaney noted that about three or four years ago, while the economy was expanding and the housing market strong, these REITs underperformed. ''Now the shoe is reversed,'' he said. He charted the beginning of their recovery to the summer of 2006, when the Federal Reserve last raised short-term interest rates. 
 Since last September, the Fed has cut its benchmark federal funds rate -- the interest rate on overnight loans between banks -- by 2.25 points, to 3 percent, amid signs that the economy is weakening. Economists believe that the central bank will continue to loosen credit in the months ahead.
 Agency REITs typically do well in an environment of declining interest rates, and particularly when the yield curve steepens, meaning that short-term rates are falling faster than long-term rates. The companies raise capital by issuing stock and through short-term borrowing and invest in mortgage-backed securities, with maturities covering years or even decades, and they profit from the difference between the cost of borrowing money and the interest received from the investment, minus expenses. 
 ''These are business models designed to arbitrage or capture the spread difference,'' explained Matthew Howlett, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. 
 This year through Thursday, the home-financing REIT category, of which agency REITs are a part, returned an average of 12.13 percent, the highest of all sectors, according to the REIT trade association. The average dividend yield was 7.52 percent, versus 5.29 percent for the property-holding equity REITs. 
 Mr. Howlett and other analysts are especially bullish on Annaly Capital, the largest of the agency REITs, with nearly $54 billion in gross assets. 
 ''They are the behemoths and really the most transparent name out there,'' Mr. Howlett said, noting the company is best known among the agency REITs. ''They have been forecasting this type of environment -- where a housing correction causes an economic slowdown and a reduction in short-term interest rates -- and they've actually been preparing for this in their portfolio.''
 Indeed, Annaly has been steadily raising capital to acquire more mortgage-based securities through stock offerings; it has raised $3.1 billion in four public offerings since March 2007. MFA Mortgage, meanwhile, raised $443 million since October; Capstead Mortgage, $324 million since October; and Anworth, around $200 million since November. 
 In a recent interview, Michael A. J. Farrell, the founder and chief executive of Annaly, noted that the company had also shifted the composition of its portfolio toward higher-yielding fixed-rate securities from floating-rate and adjustable-rate securities. The allocation will vary during economic cycles -- though, given the current economic conditions, it seems unlikely to change anytime soon.
 Despite the Fed's aggressive rate cutting, Mr. Farrell said he did not foresee a swift economic turnaround, largely because lending standards were also being tightened in response to the problems in the subprime mortgage market. 
 ''Lenders are too skittish to pass along the Federal Reserve rate cuts to consumers,'' he said, even for mortgage refinancings.
 Annaly's business approach seems to be paying off. This month, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $151 million, or 37 cents a share, versus $51 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. For the year, profits more than quadrupled, to $414.4 million from $93.8 million in 2006; on a per-share basis, the profits tripled, to $1.32 a share, from 44 cents. 
 Shareholders have benefited from a higher stock price -- it is now near its 52-week high -- and from dividends that have risen to 34 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 10 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2005. (In exchange for favorable tax treatment, all REITs are required to disburse the bulk of their profits as dividends.) 
 Profits are up for other agency REITs as well. 
 For instance, MFA Mortgage recently announced that it earned $18.6 million, or 16 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $4.4 million, or 6 cents a share, in the 2006 quarter. 
 Capstead Mortgage posted fourth-quarter net income of $15.86 million, or 31 cents a share, versus a $2.35 million profit in the quarter the previous year. 
 Many analysts are predicting that earnings will continue to grow in the months ahead. Mr. Widner of Stifel Nicolaus, for example, says his estimates of 2008 earnings per share are $2.80 for Annaly, $2.42 for Capstead and $1.25 for MFA Mortgage. 
 Share prices are also headed higher, they say.
 Mr. DeLaney says he thinks that the stock price for Annaly, in particular, could increase by an additional 20 to 30 percent by the middle of the third quarter. 
 ''They still have some room to grow; most people think the Fed hasn't stopped easing'' interest rates, he said.

HEADLINE: The Big Commute, in Reverse

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
ON most days, Matthew Davis, a 28-year-old portfolio manager, can count on spending about two hours getting to work and another two hours getting home. That's going against the tide of commuters going into New York City for work. Mr. Davis, who rented an apartment in Park Slope in Brooklyn when he landed a job in the securities industry in New York, found himself not on Wall Street, but in Ronkonkoma, working for a financial services management company. 
 He starts his morning with a stop for tea and a bagel at his neighborhood delicatessen, and walks 30 minutes or takes the subway to the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. In Jamaica, Queens, he changes trains and settles in for a 60-minute ride to his company's office near MacArthur Airport, deep in Suffolk County. There, he keeps a car for the last leg of the commute, a total of two hours each way. ''Usually, until I get to Mineola, I have to stand, but then I find a seat and read the paper,'' he said. ''I tried to find an apartment closer to work, but after 20 minutes of driving, I still wasn't anyplace that was close to anything. I really like living in the city.'' 
Mr. Davis is among the some 300,000 people who live in New York City and make their way to jobs in the suburbs every day, part of a fast-growing segment of the work force that has turned the traditional idea of bedroom communities on its head. The group includes young workers in high-skilled professions, as well as tens of thousands of others up and down the income spectrum who prefer city living or cannot afford the suburban dream.
 Planners and business groups across the region have increasingly come to realize that these commuters are a critical part of their economic prospects and are vigorously promoting transportation initiatives to encourage them. But they face considerable obstacles.
 Many who travel to work against the tide have arduous commutes -- long drives on crowded highways, or, for those who do not want or cannot afford cars, combinations of trains, buses, car pools and taxicabs cobbled together on transit systems that were not designed to accommodate them.
 In spite of that, the number of city residents working in the suburbs grew 12 percent from 2000 to 2005, according to census figures calculated by the Queens College sociology department for The New York Times. About one in 11 city workers has a job in the suburbs, and the number is growing faster than any other segment of commuters.
 The reason: A lot of jobs are in the suburbs. Whether they are at the upper end of the skill-and-income spectrum or the more modest-paying jobs in retail, health care or personal services, there is a labor demand in the suburbs. ''Labor just simply flows to where the need is,'' said Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Business Council of Fairfield County, Conn. ''We have more jobs than people, and we have to get people from somewhere.''
 With many companies that signed leases for Manhattan office space during the stock market boom in the late 1990s now facing renewals at much higher rents, there could be more opportunities for the suburbs to gain jobs.
 ''There certainly are jobs in Manhattan, but there are more in the suburbs for me,'' said Jonathan Berenbom, an actuary who left a job in the city for another one with a reinsurance company in Greenwich, Conn. ''A lot of companies are moving, because the costs are less.'' He traded a 35-minute subway ride for a 90-minute commute by subway and train.
 Unemployment rates in the suburbs are remarkably low, 3.8 percent on Long Island and 3.7 percent in Westchester, compared with 5.2 percent in New York City in December. But the number of jobs declined faster than in the city in 2007, suggesting that businesses are having difficulty finding workers, say economists.
 ''Eighteen- to 34-year-olds are leaving the suburbs because of housing prices,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. ''It's hard for companies to bring people here from North Carolina or Ohio, because you can get a dynamite house for $250,000 in North Carolina, and here you get a shoe box.''
 So business groups have been encouraging transportation projects that make it easier to import workers from elsewhere, including the city. On Long Island, they have backed the construction of a third track on the Long Island Rail Road, which would move more people both ways.
 ''Long Island is going to have to draw work force from the city because our younger work force is declining,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. ''Without it, we're going to have a serious problem in the future.''
 In Westchester, where a third track on Metro-North Railroad's line to White Plains was completed two years ago, business groups are lobbying for a new Tappan Zee Bridge to bring workers from Rockland County.
 ''We have a system that gets them effectively to White Plains and Yonkers and other places along the train lines, and when a new Tappan Zee Bridge is built, we will get people in from the West,'' said Marsha Gordon, the president of the Business Council of Westchester.
 Most reverse commuters drive, according to census figures. But with highways saturated at rush hours and cars expensive to maintain in the city, more attention is focusing on mass transit. 
 ''As congestion on the highways has mounted, there has been a resurgence of interest in and use of transit in the suburbs,'' Mr. Bruhl said. ''Now building next to train stations is the hot button.''
 Among the suburban regions, Long Island has the greatest number of New York City residents in its work force, but Westchester and Connecticut have seen the fastest growth recently, the census figures show. 
 The number of New York City residents who work on Long Island grew 5 percent from 2000 to 2005, to 111,826 from 106,487, according to the census. The number of city residents commuting to jobs in the Westchester and Connecticut suburbs is up 32 percent, to 72,487 in 2005 from 54,875 in 2000. In New Jersey, the number of reverse commuters has grown 14 percent, to 89,559 from 78,293. 
 ''Riders from the city to the suburbs is the fast-growing part of the market, and Metro-North and New Jersey Transit have been able to take advantage of it,'' said Christopher Jones, vice president for research at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit organization that monitors transportation and development issues.
 Metro-North runs several trains an hour on the reverse commute on its three lines. From 7 to 8 a.m., for instance, Metro-North runs 12 trains from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal and 5 trains in the opposite direction.
 New Jersey Transit started carrying passengers on trains that it once sent empty on the reverse route at rush hour, said James P. Redeker, assistant executive director of the agency. Ridership on the reverse commute grew 72 percent from 1996 to 2006, when the number of riders over all increased 48 percent.
 On the Long Island Rail Road, reverse commuting increased steadily through 2003, but has not grown since. Railroad officials say it is because they cannot add more trains -- 14 trains operate eastbound on the Main Line in the morning rush, compared with 146 operating westbound. Supporters, including interest groups across the spectrum from business to environmental, think adding 10 miles of third track from Floral Park to Hicksville will make Long Island more competitive for reverse commuters: If you build it, they will come, they say. The communities along the line have fought bitterly against the idea.
 ''You create demand by creating more frequency,'' said Lisa Tyson, the director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, which supports the third track because it could reduce automobile pollution and increase job options for lower-income workers.
 But there are other impediments for reverse commuters, as the predicament of Mr. Davis and others aboard the 7:39 from New York to Ronkonkoma illustrates. Commercial development in the suburbs is not always close to rail lines, and getting from the train station to workplace can be a challenge.
 ''The time from 1980 to 2000 was the era of growth for suburban office parks,'' Dr. Hughes said. They were developed along highway routes and drew workers in cars from the surrounding suburbs, not mass transit commuters.
 Anthony Parker, 28, used to take the subway from Jamaica to Astoria, where he worked as an insurance adjuster. But his company moved the operations to Melville in Suffolk County, and his company is in a classic low-density suburban office park of two- and three-story buildings with vast parking lots spread out along a busy multilane roadway.
 Mr. Parker drove to the new office in a car pool for a while, but after its other members were laid off, he started taking the 7:39. It takes him 20 more minutes to get to work than when he was driving, including a 15-minute bus ride when he gets off in Farmingdale -- if he is lucky.
 ''If you miss the bus, that's a problem, because the buses run about one time an hour,'' Mr. Parker said.
 ''The office parks are difficult to get to,'' said Mr. Redeker of New Jersey Transit, where planners have rerouted bus lines, sponsored shuttle vans and organized van pools to help get workers from trains to workplaces. ''Middlesex County has a lot of towns looking at developments that are near, but not on, the train lines.''
 Dr. Hughes said companies whose Manhattan leases are running out are finding that the rents have doubled, and they are looking at suburban alternatives that are substantially cheaper. ''There's going to be some repositioning,'' he said. ''Where are they going to go? I think Connecticut has the edge. Stamford has rail access, and that's critical.''
 Other cities in Westchester and Connecticut are poised to take advantage of the potential, Dr. Gordon said. ''A lot of the new development in Westchester is in the downtowns, and it's because of the availability of the train,'' she said. ''White Plains and Yonkers and New Rochelle are right there in creating development around transit.''
 Long Island grew as a bedroom suburb and has little historic downtown development. ''We're going to have to be more intelligent about how we access our railroad stations,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association. ''We will need jitneys or minibuses running to our major employment centers.''
 In Farmingdale, where about half of the riders on the 7:39 get off, some companies have already taken the initiative. OSI Pharmaceuticals, which develops cancer drugs at a plant in the Route 110 corridor, runs two vans a day during each rush hour.
 ''We like being in New York and we enjoy being in Long Island,'' said Kathy Galante, vice president for marketing. ''We have access to a lot of the academic world -- Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is very important to us -- and we also need access to Wall Street. Being on Long Island is the best of both worlds.''
 She said the company decided two years ago to try to tap the labor pool in New York City, and now a dozen of its 250 Farmingdale employees ride the train and take a shuttle from Farmingdale, and vice versa.
 Dan Sherman, 39, a medicinal chemist, is one of them.
 ''I don't have a car, and I don't want a car,'' said Mr. Sherman, who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. ''I don't want to live on Long Island, but this kind of business is never in a place where I want to live.
 ''Company buses are a big perk,'' he said. ''I would have been reluctant to take this job without that.''

HEADLINE: The Big Commute, in Reverse

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
ON most days, Matthew Davis, a 28-year-old portfolio manager, can count on spending about two hours getting to work and another two hours getting home. That's going against the tide of commuters going into New York City for work. Mr. Davis, who rented an apartment in Park Slope in Brooklyn when he landed a job in the securities industry in New York, found himself not on Wall Street, but in Ronkonkoma, on Long Island, working for a financial services management company. 
 He starts his morning with a stop for tea and a bagel at his neighborhood delicatessen, and walks 30 minutes or takes the subway to the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. In Jamaica, Queens, he changes trains and settles in for a 60-minute ride to his company's office near MacArthur Airport, deep in Suffolk County. There, he keeps a car for the last leg of the commute, a total of two hours each way. ''Usually, until I get to Mineola, I have to stand, but then I find a seat and read the paper,'' he said. ''I tried to find an apartment closer to work, but after 20 minutes of driving, I still wasn't anyplace that was close to anything. I really like living in the city.'' 
Mr. Davis is among the some 300,000 people who live in New York City and make their way to jobs in the suburbs every day, part of a fast-growing segment of the work force that has turned the traditional idea of bedroom communities on its head. The group includes young workers in high-skilled professions, as well as tens of thousands of others up and down the income spectrum who prefer city living or cannot afford the suburban dream.
 Planners and business groups across the region have increasingly come to realize that these commuters are a critical part of their economic prospects and are vigorously promoting transportation initiatives to encourage them. But they face considerable obstacles.
 Many who travel to work against the tide have arduous commutes -- long drives on crowded highways, or, for those who do not want or cannot afford cars, combinations of trains, buses, car pools and taxicabs cobbled together on transit systems that were not designed to accommodate them.
 In spite of that, the number of city residents working in the suburbs grew 12 percent from 2000 to 2005, according to census figures calculated by the Queens College sociology department for The New York Times. About one in 11 city workers has a job in the suburbs, and the number is growing faster than any other segment of commuters.
 The reason: A lot of jobs are in the suburbs. Whether they are at the upper end of the skill-and-income spectrum or the more modest-paying jobs in retail, health care or personal services, there is a labor demand in the suburbs. ''Labor just simply flows to where the need is,'' said Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Business Council of Fairfield County. ''We have more jobs than people, and we have to get people from somewhere.''
 With many companies that signed leases for Manhattan office space during the stock market boom in the late 1990s now facing renewals at much higher rents, there could be more opportunities for the suburbs to gain jobs.
 ''There certainly are jobs in Manhattan, but there are more in the suburbs for me,'' said Jonathan Berenbom, an actuary who left a job in the city for another one with a reinsurance company in Greenwich. ''A lot of companies are moving, because the costs are less.'' He traded a 35-minute subway ride for a 90-minute commute by subway and train.
 Unemployment rates in the suburbs are remarkably low, 3.8 percent on Long Island and 3.7 percent in Westchester, compared with 5.2 percent in New York City in December. But the number of jobs declined faster than in the city in 2007, suggesting that businesses are having difficulty finding workers, say economists.
 ''Eighteen- to 34-year-olds are leaving the suburbs because of housing prices,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. ''It's hard for companies to bring people here from North Carolina or Ohio, because you can get a dynamite house for $250,000 in North Carolina, and here you get a shoe box.''
 So business groups have been encouraging transportation projects that make it easier to import workers from elsewhere, including the city. On Long Island, they have backed the construction of a third track on the Long Island Rail Road, which would move more people both ways.
 ''Long Island is going to have to draw work force from the city because our younger work force is declining,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. ''Without it, we're going to have a serious problem in the future.''
 In Westchester, where a third track on Metro-North Railroad's line to White Plains was completed two years ago, business groups are lobbying for a new Tappan Zee Bridge to bring workers from Rockland County.
 ''We have a system that gets them effectively to White Plains and Yonkers and other places along the train lines, and when a new Tappan Zee Bridge is built, we will get people in from the West,'' said Marsha Gordon, the president of the Business Council of Westchester.
 Most reverse commuters drive, according to census figures. But with highways saturated at rush hours and cars expensive to maintain in the city, more attention is focusing on mass transit. 
 ''As congestion on the highways has mounted, there has been a resurgence of interest in and use of transit in the suburbs,'' Mr. Bruhl said. ''Now building next to train stations is the hot button.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Kenyan Roots

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: KOGELO, Kenya 

 BODY:
A barefoot old woman in a ripped dress is sitting on a log in front of her tin-roof bungalow in this remote village in western Kenya, jovially greeting visitors.
Mama Sarah, as she is known around here, lives without electricity or running water. She is illiterate and doesn't know when she was born. Yet she may have a seat of honor at the next presidential inauguration in Washington -- depending on what happens to her stepgrandson, Barack Obama.
 Mama Sarah cannot communicate with Mr. Obama, who calls her his grandmother, because she speaks only her Luo tribal language and a little Swahili. Senator Obama's Luo is pretty much limited to ''musawa,'' meaning ''how are you?'' 
 People around here are giddy at the prospect of a President Obama.
 ''I'm up at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. to listen to BBC news and get the latest on the campaign,'' said Nicholas Rajula, who describes himself as a cousin of the senator. ''By the way, what's the latest news about the superdelegates?'' 
 You might think that all Kenyans would be vigorously supporting Mr. Obama. But Kenya has been fractured along ethnic lines in the last two months, so now Mr. Obama draws frenzied support from the Luo ethnic group of his ancestors, while many members of the rival Kikuyu group fervently support Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 The Obamas are better off than most in the area, for Mama Sarah's house has a tin roof -- a step up from the mud huts with thatch roofs that are common in the village. Mama Sarah also has a cellphone, which she charges from a solar panel, and a radio that she uses to follow primaries in America.
 But the poverty is unmistakable. Jane Raila, who says she is another relative of the senator, was hobbling barefoot with a homemade crutch, for she had been crippled by polio as a child. ''We're all very excited by the news from the U.S.,'' she said. ''We stay up late to listen to the news bulletins.''
 Mr. Obama's late grandfather is said to have been the first person in the area to wear Western clothes rather than just a loincloth. For a time he converted to Christianity and adopted the family name Johnson.
 Later he converted to Islam, taking four wives. Senator Obama's father, who apparently converted to Catholicism while attending a Catholic school, was also polygamous in keeping with local custom, taking an informal Kenyan wife who preceded Mr. Obama's mother but remained a consort, according to accounts by local people and the senator himself.
 The father, also named Barack Hussein Obama, was as much of a pathbreaker as his son. He went from herding goats in Kogelo to studying in Hawaii and at Harvard, even if his career as an economist was frustrated in part by ethnic rivalries.
 Senator Obama barely knew his father and does not know his Kenyan relatives well. He has visited Kenya three times, most recently very briefly in 2006.
 On his last visit, Mr. Obama visited two area schools that had been renamed for him. The intention in renaming the schools seems to have been partly to attract funding. One person after another noted pointedly that it was a shame that a school named for a great American should be so dilapidated.
 Some of Mr. Obama's innumerable relatives also see him as a meal ticket. They have made arrangements with a tour group to bring buses of visitors to have tea with Mama Sarah. 
 They are also trying to raise money from interviews with her. I had made arrangements to visit Mama Sarah weeks ago, and she had agreed to speak. But when I showed up, she said that her children had told her to keep quiet. Frantic phone calls. Fierce arguments. Hints that money might make an interview possible. I didn't pay. I didn't get the interview.
 That's O.K. Having seen the poverty in Kogelo, I'm less offended by the outstretched palms than awed by the distance that the Obama family spans. 
 Frankly, I worry that enemies of Senator Obama will seize upon details like his grandfather's Islamic faith or his father's polygamy to portray him as an alien or a threat to American values. But snobbishness and paranoia ill-become a nation of immigrants, where one of our truest values is to judge people by their own merits, not their pedigrees. If we call ourselves a land of opportunity, then Mr. Obama's heritage doesn't threaten American values but showcases them.
 The stepgrandson of an illiterate, barefoot woman in this village of mud huts in Africa may be the next president of the United States. Such mobility -- powered by education, immigration and hard work -- is cause not for disparagement but for celebration.

HEADLINE: It Must Be Ohio

 BODY:
The Ohio Democratic primary is still nine days away and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are already accusing each other of being soft on trade. Criticisms of trade agreements in Ohio are as predictable as praise for ethanol in Iowa. But they do the voters no favor. 
 Ohio, which has lost almost a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs since 2000, is feeling the pain of globalization. Yet what the voters deserve to hear (and are unlikely to hear from the Republicans) are honest answers about how government can help them adapt.
Instead, both Democratic candidates were sending out mailers last week denouncing each other's presumed support for the 14-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Middle-class voters across the country are legitimately anxious. Tens of thousands of workers have lost their health insurance, while wages have barely risen. But blaming Nafta or any trade agreement only feeds misguided protectionist sentiments at home and strains already difficult relations around the world. 
 It is also factually inaccurate. In a review in 2003, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that Nafta had slightly increased growth in the United States and that any disruptive effects on employment were small. Trade opens foreign markets for American producers and gives consumers more choices, while competition spurs productivity growth at home. 
 If the candidates are not careful they will quickly pen themselves into dubious policy positions that they would have to follow, or flip-flop on, once elected.
 Would the Clinton administration really stand by its call for a ''timeout'' on trade deals even if that were to scuttle the Doha round of negotiations aimed at helping the world's poorest countries? Would an Obama or a Clinton administration follow up on both candidates' call for a 27.5 percent tariff against Chinese imports as punishment for the manipulation of exchange rates? Give them another week and a half and they might talk themselves into even more difficult corners. 
 Even more important, the Democrats' posturing on trade threatens to divert the nation's attention from what is really needed: a set of domestic policies to help American workers cope with the dislocations wrought by globalization and technological progress.
 These policies include health care reform, to ensure that workers who lose their jobs do not lose access to affordable care. It includes improved unemployment insurance, more progressive taxation to deal with the stagnation of middle-class incomes, and more investment in the lifelong training and education of American workers.
 The Democrats are already calling for many of these policies. When they rail against trade, they also divert attention from their own strongest suits. The presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain, defends free trade, but has only perfunctory proposals on how to help the victims of economic disruption. 
 The Democrats need to articulate a coherent vision for how this country can compete in and benefit from a globalized world. Taking rhetorical axes to Nafta is not only pandering, it is bad policy and counterproductive.

HEADLINE: L.I. Duck Farms Struggle With Water Regulation

BYLINE: By DONNA DEEDY

DATELINE: MORICHES, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Long coops, each housing ducks of a different age, hug the ground and form a courtyard at the entrance to the Jurgielewicz family property -- believed to be the only major free-range duck farm in the United States.
 Inside, on fresh straw bedding, ducks eat organic feed and sip fresh water from automated reservoirs. They breathe fresh air circulating through large windows and waddle outside, where they preen their feathers, shake their tails and splash in man-made puddles with a chorus of quacks. 
 This 47-acre swath of land in the coastal pine barrens of eastern Long Island, where the Jurgielewicz family has been raising ducks since 1919, is home to thousands of white Pekin ducks that roam the banks of a dammed mill pond. The plastic wrapper of a white Pekin duck raised on the Jurgielewicz farm boasts ''Genuine Long Island duckling, South Shore brand, free range.''
 In the 1960s, this region, wedged between the Peconic and Moriches Bays, was home to more than 60 farms that produced more than 60 percent of the nation's ducks. That number has been whittled to two: the Jurgielewicz farm, operated by brothers Paul and Tom, and Crescent Duck Farm, operated by the Corwin family. 
 Together, they employ about 200 people, generating $25 million a year in revenue and producing about 10 percent of the nation's ducks. 
 Now the two remaining duck farms say they are facing hardship. 
 The State Health Department says nitrogen levels downstream in the Forge River, a tributary of Moriches Bay, exceed the agency's standards, a condition the state attributes partially to the duck farming industry upstream.
 In spring, an overgrowth of seaweed chokes the water. In summer, blue crabs, eels and juvenile flounder -- all bottom fish -- rise to the surface, eventually suffocating in oxygen-depleted waters. 
 ''It's the worst case of anoxia I have seen,'' said Larry Swanson, a coastal oceanographer from the Marine Science Research Center at Stony Brook University, who has studied the problem. 
 In 2006, the Jurgielewiczes put in a new wastewater clarification system after the state's Department of Environmental Conservation forced them to remove decades of bottom residue from West Mill Pond, which the ducks use. But the family objected months later when the agency drafted strict new wastewater regulations for their farm, requiring the installation of another costly wastewater treatment system by this spring.
 Jonathan Sinnreich, a lawyer for the farm, raised objections to the new regulations and requested a hearing. In a letter to the environmental agency, Mr. Sinnreich requested proof that the conditions in the heavily populated Mastic Peninsula of the Forge River are caused by duck farm activities. 
 Paul and Tom Jurgielewicz declined several requests for comment. But Doug Corwin, the other duck farmer on Long Island, said, ''We're duck farmers, not wastewater specialists.'' 
 Mr. Corwin, who recently installed a $4 million wastewater treatment system at his farm in Aquebogue, 14 miles from here, said that rather than comply with costly wastewater regulations, ''most duck farmers over the last 30 or 40 years have found it easier and more economical to sell off their farmland to real estate developers.'' 
 In the case of the Jurgielewicz farm, the brothers sold development rights for their farm to Suffolk County and the town of Brookhaven for $5.6 million last May. Under the terms of the agreement, they still own the farm and can raise their ducks, but can never sell or subdivide the land for real estate development. 
 Their product, the Long Island duck, is a delicacy for chefs around the world. 
 ''Long Island Pekin duck is mild and tender meat; it's just perfect,'' says Guy Reuge, the owner of the restaurant Mirabelle in St. James. ''We serve Long Island duckling as a specialty prepared with two recipes served over two courses. We render the duck fat to prepare duck confit using only organic ducks from Jurgielewicz. I have personally visited the farm and the cleanliness is impeccable.'' 
 Those who live downstream from the farm are less impressed.
 ''The D.E.C. regulations are a step in the right direction, but we need all problems addressed -- we need municipal sewers,'' said Ron Lupski, who first reported dead fish and rotten-egg smells on the river in 2005. Mr. Lupski, a carpenter, is the head of Save the Forge River, a campaign sponsored by more than 250 local businesses and residents.
 As Harry Wallace, chief of the Unkechaug Indian tribe, whose land, now a reservation, has been situated along the Forge River since precolonial times, put it, ''Our livelihood depends on the health of this river.''
 For environmentalists and some residents of the region, there is another culprit: leaching residential cesspools. 
 ''The sheer volume of groundwater that feeds the Forge River and its tributaries, especially in high-density areas, delivers a tremendous nitrogen load, likely far more than, say, a concentrated amount from a point-source discharge,'' said Robert Waters, supervisor of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services' Bureau of Marine Resources. 
 ''It's not too complicated to understand,'' said Albert Langhorn, who represents the tribe for the Save the Forge River campaign. ''Every 50 feet is a home, each with a cesspool. Sewage has been leaching into the groundwater from these homes for 30 to 40 years now.''
 But without federal funding, which is not available, municipal sewage treatment projects are not an option, officials said. 
 Long Island's groundwater has been studied extensively since the 1940s, when wells in densely populated areas of Nassau County were abandoned because of contamination, primarily from residential cesspools. A 1972 study by the federal Environmental Protection Agency stated that sewage treatment was vital to protect water quality on Long Island, but after disclosures of public corruption surrounding the building of a plant at Bergen Point in Babylon, plans for a facility for the Mastic area were dropped.
 ''They're always blaming the ducks,'' said Burt Culver, a fifth-generation duck farmer, whose family helped to establish the industry on Long Island in 1858. ''They tried blaming red tide on the ducks. That wasn't true. They tried blaming the shellfish die-off on the ducks, and that problem got worse after most of the duck farms left.'' 
 Faced with a growing number of complaints and accusations, in 1960 the Culver family -- along with truckloads of white Pekin ducks -- moved from Westhampton to Indiana, where most of the nation's ducks are produced today. 
 ''Like my 82-year-old father always says: 'What are people going to eat after they've run all the farmers out of business, tofu?' Farmers grow that, too, you know.''

HEADLINE: Constraining the Medicare Debate

 BODY:
The Bush administration has just made several proposals -- some sensible, some not -- to reform Medicare financing and spending. Unfortunately, the exercise is seriously hobbled by an ill-advised 2003 law that prevents consideration of some of the best and fairest ways to begin fixing Medicare. 
 The 2003 Medicare prescription drug law requires that no more than 45 percent of total Medicare expenditures be paid for by general revenues, drawn mostly from the progressive income tax. (The other main funding sources are payroll taxes and beneficiary payments.)That restriction means that Congress can't bolster Medicare with money generated by closing corporate tax loopholes or letting the president's tax cuts for the wealthy expire. Those sensible steps would increase the amount of income tax supporting the program -- pushing it over the arbitrary 45 percent cap. Instead, as health care costs rise and the population ages, the program will have to reduce services and reimbursements or find additional revenues elsewhere.
 Now that two reports from the Medicare trustees have projected that the cap will be reached in the next several years, the administration has submitted its proposals for keeping general revenue support below 45 percent of Medicare costs. Its main proposal is to reduce the subsidy, and thereby increase the premiums, for wealthier beneficiaries in the drug program -- individuals who earn more than $82,000 a year, and couples above $164,000. That alone would keep the support from general revenues below the cap, according to officials. 
 Such increases have already been imposed on the part of Medicare that covers doctors' bills, and it seems reasonable to apply them to drug coverage. The major defect is that the income limits would not be indexed for inflation, so more and more beneficiaries would face increased premiums over time. That flaw should be repaired if this proposal is accepted by Congress.
 Other potentially useful proposals would speed the adoption of electronic health records, pay health care providers based partly on the quality of their work, and disclose pricing and quality information to help consumers pick their doctors and hospitals.
 The worst proposals, a slew of provisions to restrain medical malpractice awards, look mostly like a jab at the trial lawyers who support the Democratic Party. They are not apt to save the program much money. 
 The administration has made no effort to reduce the lavish and unjustified subsidies granted to the private health plans that participate in Medicare. Eliminating them could save Medicare far more general revenue money than reducing drug-program subsidies would. 
 Medicare needs to be reformed, but that debate should not be artificially constrained. Congress needs to focus on ways to restrain the relentless rise in health care costs that is bedeviling all health insurers, including Medicare. Congress and the administration need to be able to consider all possible sources of revenue for Medicare -- on their own sound and equitable merits.

HEADLINE: Living With Danger, and Wondering How to Live Without It

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY. 
Online: A slideshow from Newport, Ind., at nytimes.com/danbarry.

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Ind. 

 BODY:
 The employees pull up to the gate, show their identification cards to the armed security guards and continue on. They drive past wooded stretches and open fields, past the occasional frolicking deer, and park before buildings of almost requisite ugliness. Shift time.
 Save for those stockpiles of chemical warfare agent on the grounds, the Newport Chemical Depot could be any other industrial plant. But here they are, steel containers of viscous fluid the color of straw and as lethal as almost anything on earth. 
 The agent's benign name, VX, leaves people to wonder if the V stands for victory or venomous, while its very nature challenges the imagination to convey the deadliness at hand. Just know that a drop on the skin can cause gruesome death in minutes.
 During the cold war, this rural corner of west-central Indiana produced thousands of tons of VX for the government. Now this same rural corner is oh-so-carefully neutralizing a sizable portion of the VX it made long ago, in keeping with international treaty and the ever-peculiar endeavors of humankind.
 Of course, for those on the other side of the plant's fence, all of this has meant adapting to unthinkable thoughts. Sara Morgan, a retired teacher who over the years has challenged some Army decisions regarding the VX stockpile, says she lives in a farming area that, in preparations for a major chemical accident, used to be referred to as ''the dead zone.''
 ''Now they call it the Immediate Response Zone,'' she says wryly. ''The I.R.Z.''
 Still, many people here are proud that when their country called, they answered, conducting a cradle-to-grave mission that should be completed by late summer. They worry less about the risks of the job -- no injury or death so far -- than they do about the loss of hundreds of jobs when that last droplet of VX is destroyed at what is the largest employer in Vermillion County.
 The nerve agent is so much with the community that it has nearly lost its ghastliness. A local calendar features both the artwork of schoolchildren and tips for emergency preparedness; next month, then, the drawings of Kyle and Amber and Brittney will appear below the explanation that VX ''affects the nervous system by interfering with the signals sent from the brain to the vital organs and other body parts.''
 These calendars, along with pens, decks of cards and other informational items, are free at the Newport Chemical Stockpile Outreach Office in nearby Clinton, where a white hazmat suit is displayed in the window and the office manager, Susan Gilman, describes the work at the depot as ''our contribution to national security.''
 That contribution stretches back to 1941, when the Army took over several square miles of farmland, along with some homes and a few cemeteries, to build an installation. First it produced explosives, then heavy water, and then, in 1961, a ''deterrent'': the nerve agent called VX.
 By the time President Nixon declared a moratorium on chemical weapons in 1969, the Newport plant had produced 4,500 tons of VX -- enough, if judiciously applied, to kill nearly everyone on the planet. Although most of it had already been shipped in bombs and rockets to various American bases, the plant still had more than 1,200 tons of VX, which raised the question: Now what?
 For several years the steel containers, each one holding nearly 180 gallons of VX, lay on the ground outside, like abandoned farm equipment. Then they sat for 25 years inside a warehouse, until the attacks of 9/11 prompted the Army to store them in gravel-covered igloos surrounded by guards, fencing and signs that say, ''Use of Deadly Force Authorized.''
 There is, though, one homey touch: the igloo entrances are painted to resemble red barn doors.
 A couple of years ago the Army finished decontaminating and tearing down anything used to produce VX. Now, in new buildings a few dozen yards away, a government contractor is neutralizing one steel container of the chemical agent at a time, in a project that is expected to cost nearly $2 billion.
 Most depot employees were either very young or not yet born when their country decided it simply had to have VX; some have parents who helped to create the chemical agent. Their inheritance, then, is a well-paying but very strange, very delicate assignment.
 Each container of VX is removed by forklift from its igloo, strapped to a truck bed and carried a quarter-mile to the ''demilitarization facility.'' No container is moved in rain or snow, to eliminate the remote chance that a VX droplet escapes and is mistaken for mere precipitation.
 The container is placed in a chamber designed to keep humans separate from chemicals made to kill them. The VX is drained into a larger vessel, and the emptied container is flushed with a hot caustic solution, rinsed, dried and baked for 90 minutes at 1350 degrees Fahrenheit. Eventually it finds its way to a scrap-metal recycler in Alabama.
 The VX, meanwhile, is mixed and cooked with a solution of sodium hydroxide and water, until the nerve agent is destroyed and caustic wastewater, called hydrolysate, is left. This wastewater is then sampled for trace amounts of VX; about one of every four batches needs further cooking to kill the stuff. But, again, now what?
 After years of contentious debate and thwarted plans, the Army quietly -- secretly, some say -- struck a deal in 2007 to truck the byproduct 1,000 miles south to Port Arthur, Tex., for incineration. So far, those who say the incineration is environmentally hazardous have failed in court to stop the shipments.
 Here, meanwhile, feelings remain mixed about, of all things, VX. ''It's such an odd set of circumstances,'' says Ed Cole, the executive director of the Vermillion County Economic Development Council. ''We want the threat to go away, because that would allow us to market the county more effectively. But once that VX is gone, we'll lose 830 to 1,000 jobs.''
 Luckily, horribly, the Newport Chemical Depot still has more than 200 tons of a deadly cold war remnant to destroy. This means that at least for another few months, some people in west-central Indiana will continue to keep their country safe from a threat, real and self-created.

HEADLINE: Bank Sues Buyer of Clear Channel Unit, Jeopardizing Deal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

DATELINE: Another buyout is in danger of collapsing 

 BODY:
-- but this time because one of the banks involved is suing its own client, the private equity firm trying to do the deal.
 The deal in jeopardy is Clear Channel's $1.2 billion sale of its television unit to Providence Equity Partners, a media-focused buyout firm. Providence began to balk at the price, citing deterioration in the business and the economy, prompting a lawsuit by Clear Channel. Yet by late last week, the two sides had struck a deal in principle to lower the price by $100 million.
 But now comes a new bombshell. Wachovia, one of the three banks financing the deal, is now refusing to commit. It even sued its client, Providence, in a North Carolina state court on Friday, contending that the new agreement has voided its previous commitment. Goldman Sachs and UBS, the two other banks, have committed to finance the new transaction, which now calls for Providence to borrow less money at a higher interest rate. 
 The lawsuit offers a new peek inside the tense negotiations between corporate America, Wall Street banks and private equity firms as they try to cope with a worsening economy and stormy credit markets.
 Wachovia has an unusual role in Clear Channel, which is based in San Antonio and is the largest owner of radio stations in the United States. Even as it seeks to sell its television unit, Clear Channel is busy trying to close an even larger $25 billion buyout of the rest of the company. Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., had committed to financing both deals.
 Wachovia's jitteriness is not unique, as Wall Street banks fear worsening problems in loans to private equity firms. Over the last two years, banks including Wachovia had queued up to lend hundreds of billions of dollars for buyouts, reaping lucrative fees along the way. 
 But the near-freeze in the credit markets has made it almost impossible for banks to resell those loans, which now trade at about 85 cents on the dollar. Banks fear that they will have to take large write-downs if they are forced to keep those loans on their books, at a time when many have already taken sizable hits from their bets on subprime mortgages.
 Still, while some lenders have refused to finance already announced deals -- the buyout of the mortgage lender PHH fell through last month after JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers backed away -- it is rare to see a bank turn around and sue its own client.
 In the case of the Providence deal, Wachovia has committed to loan $450 million of the $1.2 billion purchase price. If Wachovia causes the deal to collapse, it would be held responsible for a $45 million breakup fee.
 Some people inside the deal speculate that Wachovia may be seeking to create an escape hatch from the larger buyout. But it is unclear how Wachovia will accomplish that: The $25 billion deal is not contingent on the sale of the television stations.
 Wachovia runs a high risk by suing its own client and killing the television stations deal. As part of financing the larger $25 billion deal, it also agreed to help finance a bridge loan if the smaller deal fell apart. 
 It may also risk damage to its reputation by turning on its own client. Never one of the biggest players in the leveraged loan market, Wachovia may see its business dry up if potential clients see the bank as a potential turncoat when things go bad.
 A hearing on the Wachovia lawsuit is scheduled on Tuesday. Wachovia has hired Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, a Charlotte, N.C. firm, as its legal counsel.
 Providence and Clear Channel are still hoping to strike a new deal for the television stations as soon as Monday, with UBS and Goldman Sachs still providing financing. But it is unclear whether the deal can close without Wachovia's support.

HEADLINE: Born Irish, but With Illegal Parents

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Cork-born and proud of it, George-Jordan Dimbo is top to toe the Irish lad. He studies Gaelic, eats rashers, plays hurling, prays to the saints, papers his walls with parochial school awards, and spends Saturdays at the telly watching Dustin the Turkey, a wisecracking puppet, mock the powerful. 
 If the Irish government has its way, he may soon be living in Africa.
 George, 11, is an Irish citizen and has been since his birth when Ireland, alone in Europe, still gave citizenship to anyone born on its soil. His mother and father, Ifedinma and Ethelbert Dimbo, are illegal immigrants from Nigeria, who brought him back to Ireland three years ago, judging it the best place to raise him. 
 Since then, the unusual trio -- the Irish schoolboy and his African parents -- have shared a single room in a worn Dublin hostel while facing a prospect dreaded by children on both sides of the Atlantic, a parent's deportation.
 ''Dear justice minister,'' George wrote when he was 9. ''I heard my Mommy and Daddy whispering about deportation. Please do not deport us.''
 ''Remember,'' he added, ''I am also an Irish child.''
 Thousands of Irish children face similar risks, living in a country where one or both parents do not legally reside. Their stories find abundant parallels in the United States, where an estimated five million children -- including three million American citizens -- have parents who are illegal immigrants. New efforts to catch them make fear of deportation a growing factor in American life, the flip side of generous laws that make infants instant citizens. 
 The battle over the ''I.B.C.'s'' -- Irish-born children -- stems from a decade of head-turning change that has brought this island of red-haired Marys and blue-eyed Seans the demographic version of an extreme makeover. 
 For centuries, Ireland was a racially homogenous land of emigrants. Now it is a multicultural nation of immigrants, whose share of the population, 11 percent, is nearly as high as that in the United States.
 Years of Irish prosperity have drawn Polish plumbers, Lithuanian nannies, Latvian farm workers, Filipino nurses, Chinese traders, and sub-Saharan asylum seekers. The town of Portlaoise, about 40 miles southwest of Dublin, has the country's first African-born mayor. The Synge Street School, where George Dimbo says his Hail Marys beneath a plaster Virgin, is walking distance from the city's first mosque and rents classroom space to two Chinese academies.
 ''I went to bed in one country and woke up in a different one,'' writes the Irish novelist, Roddy Doyle, in a collection of short stories called ''The Deportees'' (Viking, 2007). They depict characters as diverse as an African war survivor on his first day of class, and Fat Gandhi, a gay tandoori vendor who ''quickly realized that his loud embrace of Christianity was very good for business.'' 
 The Dimbos are the kind of memorable figures who might have tumbled from Mr. Doyle's pages. A former graduate student in Cork, Ms. Dimbo, 42, wore a Yoruba headdress to a recent parent-student event, and has just written a feminist novel about a migrant prostitute. Mr. Dimbo, 43, releases his frustrations with a daily run through the Dublin streets, and George is so unusually courteous that his sixth-grade teacher thought he was ''taking the mickey''--Irish for pulling his leg.
 ''He's the most mannerly child I've taught in years,'' said the teacher, Brendan O'Boyle. ''He's very, very good, very upright, very honest.''
 ''He's one of the best guys we've ever had,'' said last year's teacher, Gerard Mooney.
 Not long after George arrived, a classmate told him that he disliked black people.
 ''But I'm black,'' George recalls answering.
 ''No,'' the boy said. ''You're Irish.''
 So Far, Little Conflict
 Ireland's dash to diversity has so far provoked little of the conflict found elsewhere in Europe or the United States. There are no major anti-immigrant political parties and little anti-immigrant violence. When a Dublin high school student, Olukunle Elukanlo, was deported to Nigeria in 2005, his protesting classmates won his return.
 Government officials here often credit Irish history for the tolerance. ''There's an emotional sense of understanding about what immigrants are going through because of our experience as immigrants,'' said Conor Lenihan, the minister of integration. 
 But others see undercurrents of racial unease that could boil into conflict, especially if hard times return. ''In Irish literature there's a big fear of the returned immigrant who brings all sorts of chaos with him,'' said Mary Gilmartin, a geographer at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. ''Many people here feel threatened.''
 As recently as the 1980s, young Irish were fleeing unemployment in droves, many to work illegally in the United States. By the late 1990s, an economic boom called the Celtic Tiger was luring them home, along with droves of foreign construction workers, farm hands, waitresses and nannies. A wave of asylum seekers joined them, many from Africa.
 Some had escaped harrowing wars or genital mutilation. But officials grew skeptical of their claims as their numbers surged to about 12,000 in 2002 from a trickle a decade before. 
 Ireland not only offered citizenship to children born upon arrival; until 2003 it also allowed their illegal-immigrant parents to stay, a shortcut many asylum seekers used to win residency. Word got out: with a visa to Britain, a pregnant woman could reach Northern Ireland, take a cab across the border, and gain residency by giving birth. 
 Ms. Gilmartin argues that reports of abuse were exaggerated. But a 2004 referendum changed the rules, reserving citizenship for the children of longtime legal residents. It passed with nearly 80 percent of the vote.
 By then, Ireland had about 18,000 mixed families of Irish children and illegal-immigrant parents. Wary of the costs of large-scale deportation, the government ran a one-time legalization program that gave residency to about 95 percent of those parents. The Dimbos were among the 1,000 or so families whose cases were rejected, and they have appealed to the Supreme Court. 
 Their situation, like that of millions in the United States, pits competing interests: those of children (to live in their country with their parents) against those of states (to enforce borders for the perceived common good). 
 Odyssey to Ireland
 Ms. Dimbo first came to Ireland legally, to get a master's degree in sociology in 1995. She was recently married, two months pregnant, and unaware, she said, that Irish law would make George a citizen. She gained legal residency through his citizenship, but they returned to Nigeria when George was 2 to join his father, who ran an import business. 
 With Ms. Dimbo working as a bank manager in Lagos, the family lived comfortably, but came back to Ireland twice, believing each time that George's citizenship and their past residence gave them the right to stay. The most recent time was in 2005, to apply for the legalization program, not realizing, they said, that it only covered families who had remained in Ireland, which disqualified them.
 With their savings gone, they have spent nearly three years in a government ''accommodation center'' -- a dormitory where they share one room, line up for meals, and are barred from working. 
 ''You feel like you're a prisoner,'' said Mr. Dimbo, a proud man dismayed by his forced dependency. ''If we had known our lives would be like this, we never would have come.''
 George said if his parents left, he would go with them -- ''every child needs his parents'' -- and wrote the justice minister to convey his fears. ''I am very worried,'' he wrote.
 Gathered at another accommodation center, an hour outside Dublin in Mosney, many parents said their fears of deportation had begun to affect their children.
 ''My daughter knows I'm depressed,'' said a single mother from Nigeria, who declined to be identified for fear of harming her case. ''She goes, 'Did I do anything wrong?' '' Another single mother said, ''I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my child.''
 Other complaints come from men sneaking into Ireland, to join their children and wives who got residency through the legalization program. To avoid new waves of migration, the program gave no right to family reunification. ''Unless we control the flows of people, public attitudes will turn against the whole process of immigration,'' said Mr. Lenihan, the government minister. 
 But in denying children their fathers, the men say, the government may create the kind of immigrant underclass that plagues other parts of Europe.
 ''Our children are going to be growing up angry,'' said one of four illegal-immigrant fathers from Nigeria who met with a reporter in Balbriggan, a Dublin suburb.
 Another father blamed race. ''If our kids were really Irish to them, they would not say, 'Take the fathers away,' '' he said.
 At the same time, many of those facing deportation marvel at Ireland's virtues, including the freedom to protest without getting shot and ambulances that come when summoned. When Lynda Onuoha joined Mosney mothers to demonstrate outside Parliament, they waved Irish flags. ''We wanted people passing by to see that even though our kids are black, they are Irish by nationality, and we want to make a home here,'' she said.
 Even after tightening its rules, Ireland remains more generous than most of its European peers. The United States is the rare country that gives immediate citizenship to the children born inside its borders, whether their immigrant parents are legal residents or not. A 2007 bill to end the practice, which stems from the 14th Amendment, drew nearly 100 Congressional co-sponsors, though legal scholars have traditionally argued that a change would require a constitutional amendment.
 Fear for U.S. Children
 Deportations in the United States have been rare, but with enforcement on the rise, migrant groups warn of a new generation of American children haunted by fear. Border control advocates respond that the parents have only themselves to blame, for migrating illegally. 
 At times, Ms. Dimbo says the same. ''To come here without papers, we are wrong,'' she said. ''We are cap in hand, saying for George's sake, let us forgive and forget.'' Adding her own note of Irish chauvinism, she said it was only when she got to Donegal that she appreciated the phrase ''deep, blue sea.''
 Mr. Dimbo added, ''I love this country.''
 George has spent 6 of his 11 years in Ireland, including most of his school years. What he recalls of Nigeria is mostly the heat and the corporal punishment in school. Asked if he feels more Irish or Nigerian, he answered politely in a Dublin lilt.
 ''I think I feel more Irish,'' he said. ''For one, because I am Irish.''

PERSON: Douglas A. Fraser 

HEADLINE: Douglas A. Fraser, 91, Union Chief Who Helped Chrysler, Is Dead

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA and MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Douglas A. Fraser, who as president of the United Automobile Workers union agreed to concessions that helped the Chrysler Corporation avoid bankruptcy in the late 1970s, died late Saturday. He was 91.
 Mr. Fraser died at Providence Hospital in suburban Southfield, Mich., his wife, Winifred, said Sunday. He had emphysema. 
 Mrs. Fraser said he had donated his body to the medical school at Wayne State University in Detroit, where Mr. Fraser taught after retiring from the union in 1983. No funeral was planned, though a memorial service will be held later, she said.
 Mr. Fraser, known as Doug to factory workers and corporate chairmen alike, led the union from 1977 to 1983, a period of intense turmoil in the American automobile industry. 
 Rapidly rising fuel prices and surging sales of fuel-efficient Japanese cars had produced huge financial losses at the Detroit auto companies, particularly at Chrysler, which was heavily dependent on large automobiles.
 As Chrysler ran short of cash and faced possible bankruptcy, Mr. Fraser was instrumental in helping to arrange legislation that provided the $1.2 billion in federally guaranteed loans that put Chrysler back on its feet. 
 The deal called for hourly workers at Chrysler to accept wage cuts of $3 an hour and gave the company permission to cut nearly half of its 100,000 jobs in the United States.
 Lee A. Iacocca, then the chief executive at Chrysler, nominated Mr. Fraser as a company director in 1980, making him the first labor leader to join the board of an American automobile company.
 Mr. Fraser, however, stressed that he represented Chrysler's workers, not himself. He was the lone dissenting vote when the board gave generous stock options to Chrysler executives, including Mr. Iacocca. 
 Although he had little formal education, Mr. Fraser was an avid reader, known for discussing economics with corporate executives, voting patterns with political officials and shop floor issues with factory workers. In contrast to his successors, who shunned the news media that followed the union, Mr. Fraser was fond of calling journalists to discuss their articles, occasionally correcting them on matters of union history. 
 (In a call last month to The New York Times, Mr. Fraser, in commenting on an article on Toyota Motor, remarked, ''I hate them -- because they're so good.'')
 He had an impish sense of humor that was often on display when negotiating pressure was the highest. Angered at comments by Roger B. Smith, the General Motors chief executive, during a pivotal point in negotiations in 1982, Mr. Fraser declared that he wanted G.M. to get a ''zipper for Roger Smith's lips.''
 Union officials were not spared, either. When one union delegate persisted in demanding attention at a meeting, Mr. Fraser, who was presiding, stood and threw his chair at the delegate.
 Membership in the United Automobile Workers was at its peak of 1.5 million in 1978, a year after Mr. Fraser took charge, but the industry soon faced dire times as an energy crisis led to the rising sales of Japanese automobiles. 
 Along with a deal at Chrysler that cut workers' wages by $3 an hour, to $17, Mr. Fraser subsequently agreed to deals at G.M. and Ford Motor that temporarily froze wages and cost-of-living adjustments. 
 He tried to persuade executives at G.M. to negotiate an agreement that would link concessions by workers to lower prices for G.M. cars, in an effort to stimulate sales.
 The plan collapsed on the details. But in later years, Mr. Fraser said the initiative had demonstrated that the union was prepared to be creative even in difficult times. ''We didn't quite get there,'' he said, ''but conceptually, it was a great idea.''
 Douglas Andrew Fraser was born in Glasgow on Dec. 18, 1916, and was brought to the United States when he was 6 years old. His father, Samuel Douglas Fraser, was an ardent unionist, and talk of union activities was common fare at the dinner table.
 ''I suppose you could say I belonged to the union before I went to work, because we talked about it all the time,'' he said.
 To the disappointment of his father, who had wanted him to go to college, Mr. Fraser dropped out of high school in 1934 and went to work in small factories in the Detroit area. He was fired from his first two jobs for trying to organize fellow workers. ''At the second place, they broke into my toolbox and found authorization cards, so they found a way to fire me,'' he said.
 He found a job at a DeSoto plant owned by Chrysler that had been organized by the U.A.W. and rose rapidly in the ranks of the union, becoming a local president at 27. After three terms, he was hired in 1947 as a member of the union's international staff.
 He came to the attention of Walter P. Reuther, a longtime leader who had become president of the union after World War II. Mr. Reuther appointed him as an administrative assistant in 1951, a position that put him at Mr. Reuther's side as the union helped set the social agenda of the nation in the 1950s and 1960s.
 In a series of victories, the union won benefits like company-paid health and dental care, income assistance for workers who had been laid off, pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. 
 Mr. Reuther began grooming Mr. Fraser to succeed him, and Mr. Fraser became a member of the union's executive board in 1962 and a vice president in 1970.
 But when Mr. Reuther died in an airplane crash in 1970 at the age of 62, another vice president, Leonard Woodcock, narrowly defeated Mr. Fraser for the presidency. Mr. Fraser succeeded Mr. Woodcock in 1977.
 Mr. Fraser said he tried to pattern his leadership after that of Mr. Reuther, who saw the union as a conduit for social activism.
 The union's current president, Ron Gettelfinger, said Sunday: ''Doug was a friend, a mentor and a counselor to so many within the U.A.W. and the larger labor movement. His integrity and his enduring commitment to protecting the rights of workers will continue to inspire us.''
 After he retired from the union, Mr. Fraser turned to teaching at Wayne State in Detroit, as well as at Harvard University, the University of Michigan and Columbia Business School, where he was labor leader in residence for three years.
 He said he enjoyed the repartee with students, but was appalled by how little they knew about Mr. Reuther and labor history. After one seminar at Columbia, Mr. Fraser said a student came up to him and remarked, ''I must admit you do not fit the stereotype of a labor leader.''
 Mr. Fraser asked the student what the stereotype involved.
 ''Well, an overweight guy who smokes cigars and uses a great deal of profanity,'' the student responded.
 ''Young man, you have just described Lee Iacocca,'' Mr. Fraser said he had told the student.
 Mr. Fraser's first wife, Eva Falk, died in 1970. He is survived by his second wife, Winifred; his daughters, Jeanne Fraser and Judith Yonich; stepdaughters, Barbara MacKenzie and Sandra Bryner; and several grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LEHMAN, ORIN

 BODY:
 LEHMAN--Orin, educator, philanthropist, civil rights advocate and conservationist with a life-long commitment to public service, died February 22, 2008. He died peacefully at home in New York City surrounded by his loving family and friends. The cause of death was pneumonia. Born January 14, 1920, he was 88. He was the son of the late Allan Sigmund and Evelyn Schiffer Lehman, and the brother of the late Ellen Lehman Long. He was the great-grandson of Mayer Lehman, founder of Lehman Brothers investment house, and grandnephew of Herbert Lehman, the former Governor of New York and U.S. Senator. 
Mr. Lehman grew up in Tarrytown, NY, graduated from the Scarborough and The Taft Schools, Princeton University and New York University where he earned masters and doctorate degrees in American history.In World War II, Lehman was an Army pilot with the rank of Captain. He was badly wounded in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. In 1947 he partnered with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, and founded Just One Break (JOB), whose mission is to find competitive employment for people with disabilities. JOB is the nations's oldest not-for-profit employment service for people with disabilities. Over half a century after founding it, Orin Lehman remained Chairman Emeritus of its board of directors until his death. Mr. Lehman's first public appointment came in 1950 when President Truman appointed him to the advisory board of the Economic Cooperation Administration where he succeeded his great-uncle Herbert Lehman. In 1952, while an associate in the Lehman Brothers firm, he was designated New York City's Outstanding Young Man of the Year by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. While prominently engaged in public life, Lehman explored a variety of careers. He served as an economic adviser to the U.S. mission at the United Nations, became the Chairman of the New York Board of Corrections, and published weekly newspapers. He served as Chairman of the Board of the New School of Social Research for ten years, where he also taught. In the 1970's he produced theatrical plays offBroadway, among them two hits by Jules Feiffer and the Pulitzer Prize winning play ''The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' by Paul Zindel. In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered Mr. Lehman the job of Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation which he accepted, calling it ''The greatest job in the world.'' He was re-appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo, and by the time he retired in 1993, he had served 18 years as Commissioner, the longest period of any individual in that position. Mr. Lehman understood the value that parks would play not only in lives of New Yorkers, but also their overall benefit to the environment. His highest priority was making parks and open spaces accessible to all, long before it was the fashion and the law of the land. He was loved and respected by state park employees who affectionately called him ''Father Nature.'' During his tenure, the Empire State Summer and Winter Games, Senior Games and Games for the Physically Challenged were created. In addition to his public service, Mr. Lehman lived life to the fullest, playing golf, flying airplanes, and never letting his need for crutches interfere with his active schedule. Mr. Lehman was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Jewish Committee, a trustee of the Taft School, where he received the Citation of Merit Award, a director for UNESCO, 1968-1971 (United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization), a director of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 1965-1974, a trustee of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation and a member of The Council on Foreign Relations. He was, until his death, a member of The Century Association in New York City. He was a soft-spoken man with a quiet bearing which belied his sense of humor and fun-loving nature. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family. Mr. Lehman was married to the late Jane Bagley Lehman and is survived by his former wife, Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman, his three daughters, Susan Lehman Carmichael (Mrs. Trent) of Greenwich, CT, Brooke Lehman and Sage Lehman of New York City and his four grandchildren Avery, Haley, Ryan and Whitney Carmichael. His companion Monique Van Vooren and his beloved Boston Terrier, Snookums, also survive him. A Memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York City on Tuesday, February 26th at 5:00pm. The Rabbi Ronald Sobel will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be made to Just One Break (JOB), 570 Seventh Ave, NY, NY 10018. www.justonebreak.com

HEADLINE: Locking In Viewers to Watch the Commercials

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Looking to strike a blow against the proliferation of digital video recorders, the ABC network, its affiliated broadcast stations, and Cox Communications' cable systems are establishing an on-demand video service that would allow viewers to watch ABC shows like ''Lost'' and ''Desperate Housewives'' any time they choose. 
 The catch: It uses a new technology that disables the viewers' ability to fast-forward through commercials. 
 The system, which ABC is expected to announce Monday, has been tested over the last several months in homes served by Cox in Orange County, Calif. The programs replayed on this video-on-demand service would include advertising sold by the network as well as by local ABC stations, but the total number of commercials in the shows would be far less than the over-the-air broadcast version of the show. 
 ABC and Cox executives said that consumer response to the test had been positive. Several executives involved in the project, which ABC plans to offer to other cable systems around the country, said the move was an overt attempt to staunch the use of DVRs like TiVo, which viewers often use to avoid commercials. That activity is increasingly seen as threat to broadcast television, which depends on ad revenue to pay for programs.
 ''This does counter the DVR,'' said Anne Sweeney, the president of the Disney-ABC television group. ''You don't need TiVo if you have fast-forward-disabled video on demand. It gives you the same opportunity to catch up to your favorite shows.''
 Ray Cole, president of Citadel Communications, which owns three local ABC stations, who is also the chairman of the board of affiliated ABC stations, was even more direct about the goal of the new service.
 ''As network and affiliates, we both have an interest in slowing down the explosive growth of DVRs,'' Mr. Cole said. ''This is about combating DVRs. As we developed this at every stage, there was an agreement that however we put this together, disabling the fast-forward function was key.''
 Cable systems are increasingly offering DVRs as part of their packages to customers because satellite distributors, the main competitors for cable, routinely offer DVR service. But at the same time, cable operators would clearly welcome any development that could counter the spread of the machines, which are costly for them to maintain. DVRs wear our frequently, leading to many service calls and high labor and maintenance costs.
 Time Warner Cable has experimented with two similar services. One called Start Over lets customers restart a show in progress; the other, still in test phase, is called Look Back and lets viewers watch a show within 24 hours of its initial air time, without skipping commercials. 
 For the latter service to be used more broadly, Time Warner would have to negotiate with rights holders to acquire the replay rights to shows. In the Cox service, viewers can replay the shows any time on demand for up to four weeks, and ABC has already signed off on granting rights to its shows.
 Ms. Sweeney said that Cox approached ABC with the idea, and the network stipulated that it would have interest only in a video-on-demand service that included technology to disable the fast-forward function. ''Skipping commercials is obviously not a good thing for our advertisers,'' Ms. Sweeney said.
 ABC has been first among the networks in experimenting with other methods of delivering its programs, having concluded, as Ms. Sweeney put it, that ''the days of being able to say come home at 9 p.m. and see 'Desperate Housewives' are over and have been over for a long time.'' 
 ABC was the first network to make shows available on the iTunes download service and to replay its shows on its Web site. In the former example, ABC has not sold commercials, likening that service to DVD sales; but it does sell commercials on replays of its shows on ABC.com.
 In both cases, the ABC shows are primarily seen on the small screen. Ms. Sweeney said what excited the network about the Cox deal was that the shows could be seen on full-screen televisions. ''We didn't have a strategy for the big screen TV.''
 Robert C. Wilson, the senior vice president for programming at Cox Communications, said that the focus groups the company had organized in Orange County to measure reactions to the service indicated a high degree of satisfaction. ''They told us they valued the enhanced access to programs and were not concerned about the disabled fast-forward,'' Mr. Wilson said.
 One other constituency whose satisfaction was crucial was ABC's affiliated stations. ABC's iTunes deal led to angry protests from station managers, who believed that ABC was violating agreements that stations would have an initial period of exclusivity over the network programs. 
 When ABC made its deals to sell commercials in programs replayed on ABC.com, it invited the local stations into the deal, allowing them to sell one local commercial on each show. The video-on-demand deal also allows stations to sell commercials. 
 Mr. Cole said, ''The ability for local stations to participate in the economics of video on demand is exciting.'' He said that initially the technology involved might make it difficult for some stations to place local commercials in the replayed ABC shows and that ABC has put a revenue-sharing arrangement in place to compensate the stations.

HEADLINE: Money and the People's Choices

 BODY:
A mind-boggling amount of money has already been spent on this year's presidential election, and we haven't even gotten to the conventions. The raising and doling out of lavish sums has been dispiriting to watch, a muddle of incompetence, avarice and special pleading, only vaguely restrained by the nation's campaign finance laws. We sincerely hope that things improve before the general election onslaught. 
 Given this spectacle, it is discouraging to think that this year's presidential candidates are vying to take control over the national purse strings. 
 Most worrisome may be the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, which heaped $5 million on consultants last month. The campaign splurged on luxury hotel rooms and spent nearly $100,000 for pre-Iowa-caucus party platters. 
 Then there's Senator John McCain's quasi-farcical attempt to reverse his commitment to public financing for the primary season. Mr. McCain had grasped at public financing like a tax-subsidized life preserver last year when his campaign was foundering. Now that he's the presumptive Republican nominee and the donors have returned, he wants back into the world of deep-pocket financing so he can spend more freely up until the Republican convention in September.
 He may be able to talk himself out of that moral trap. But right now, the Federal Election Commission doesn't have the power to grant him permission to change his mind -- or not. Because of an ongoing standoff between Congress and the White House, the commission lacks the quorum it needs to make such decisions. 
 Even if the F.E.C. had a quorum, the matter is further complicated by questions over whether -- during darker days -- he used his past commitment to public financing as collateral for a bank loan to help keep his campaign afloat.
 Finally, there's Senator Barack Obama's grand gesture of proposing that the Democratic and Republican nominees enter into a pact after the conventions to accept public financing, along with its $85 million spending limit. Mr. Obama made the proposal last year, before he became a private fund-raising prodigy. 
 Lately, the senator sounds as if he's hedging his good-government bet. He's now asking for a detailed -- and far more difficult to reach -- agreement that would also cover spending by outside groups and the political parties, as well as by Senator McCain in the period before the Democrats select a nominee. 
 Senator McCain, for his part, while now seeking private financing for the primaries, says he would accept public financing for the general election -- when he must fear being buried by Mr. Obama's fund-raising.
 Americans deserve better. 
 Congress could put the public financing system on firmer footing by updating campaign subsidies to meet inflation. The voters, for their part, should insist that the candidates accept public money and operate within the rules of the system.

HEADLINE: For Hispanics in South Texas, the Choice Is Tough

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
As recently as two weeks ago, Rudy Davila III, a pharmacist, was part of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's political firewall, the bloc of Hispanic voters from here to the border with Mexico whom she counted on to keep her presidential campaign from collapse. But the firewall is showing signs of cracking.
 The Davila family has been doing business in this overwhelmingly Mexican-American city for more than 100 years, beginning with a corner grocery that in four generations has become a $16 million medical supply company. The same neighborhoods that propelled the Davilas' business gave rise to powerful Mexican-American civil rights organizations, whose leaders built a following that has largely remained loyal to the Democratic Party. 
 It was loyalty to Mrs. Clinton that initially motivated Mr. Davila to support her candidacy. He said that not only had his family's business prospered during Bill Clinton's time in the White House, but that he also saw improvements across the city's impoverished West side. 
 Mr. Davila's loyalty weakened, however, after Mrs. Clinton began losing primary after primary. Then, after watching the effect Senator Barack Obama had on his community last week, feelings of loyalty were overcome by a sense of pragmatism.
 ''The lines to get into the plaza went more than a mile,'' said Mr. Davila, showing photographs his assistant had taken at the Obama rally held less than half a block from his pharmacy. ''The crowd was one-third white, one-third black and one-third Latino. I had never seen anything like it in San Antonio. And I knew right then he was the best candidate to defeat the Republicans in November.''
 Here in the heart of Hispanic Texas, voters like Mr. Davila are being pulled hard from both directions. It is hard to interview a Clinton supporter at a coffee shop or taco joint without next running into someone supporting Mr. Obama. A P.T.A. meeting that started with polite applause during the presentation of the bilingual spelling bee awards ended in prickly political debate. 
 Recent polls have found the same trend that foiled Mrs. Clinton in her string of recent losses has begun to play out in Texas. Her double-digit lead over Mr. Obama has plummeted to a virtual tie. Mr. Obama has a significant lead over Mrs. Clinton among blacks and white men. His support among white women is about even with hers. And although she still has an advantage among Latinos -- an estimated 25 percent of the electorate and some of her most steadfast supporters -- that gap has begun to narrow.
 With the Texas primary just over a week away, political pundits are reluctant to predict how things would ultimately play out among Texas' Latino voters. Still, there is endless hashing over how Mr. Obama has made considerable gains in such a short time with an electorate whose ties to Mrs. Clinton date to 1972, when she registered voters along the border with Mexico in support of George McGovern. 
 But today's Hispanic voters are a generally younger, more educated and more affluent electorate than they were two decades ago -- qualities that make them impervious to Mrs. Clinton's big-name endorsements. 
 For Hispanics in South Texas who live along the border, their ties to Mexico are little more than symbolic. Lydia Carrillo of the Southwest Voters Registration and Education Project said that most Hispanics here had been in this country for generations, and that they were just as concerned about issues involving education, the economy and health care as they were about an immigration overhaul. 
 Veterans groups pointed out that Houston and San Antonio had suffered the second- and third-highest numbers of fatalities from the war in Iraq, after New York, so Mr. Obama's opposition to the war from the beginning resonated strongly here. 
 ''Predicting a winner in the March 4 primary would be foolhardy,'' wrote Jaime Castillo, a columnist at The San Antonio Express-News. ''Hillary's supporters are die-hards, the kind of voters who cast ballots in every Democratic primary. Obama's backers are energized, but their commitment is untested over the long haul. They are an amalgam of party regulars, young kids, independents and the politically disenchanted.''
 Other pundits and politicians echoed Mr. Davila, saying heart had less to do with Hispanic voters' choices than hard-headed calculations about which Democratic candidate had the better chance of winning the White House. 
 ''Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have strong platforms,'' said Representative Charles A. Gonzalez, who has endorsed Mr. Obama. ''It may sound clinical, but Hispanic voters, like all voters, not only want someone who speaks to their hearts. Obama is not only the best positioned to win in November, but also to live up to the promise to unite the country.''
 Those who have managed statewide campaigns in Texas said the state had two important dividing lines: the one that marked the border with Mexico and the one marked by Interstate 10 from El Paso through San Antonio to Houston that divides North Texas from the south. North of the interstate are Texas's prosperous, racially diverse economic capitals. The south is overwhelmingly Hispanic, and poorer, though the region has enjoyed some growth since the North American Free Trade Agreement turned the Rio Grande Valley into one of the most bustling commercial zones in the world.
 Political analysts said Mrs. Clinton's base of support had been the south, and they added that she remained stronger than Mr. Obama here. But because of the complicated way Texas selects its presidential nominee -- a contest that is part primary and part caucus, and which assigns delegates to state Senate districts according to turnout during the 2004 presidential contest -- the regions with the largest numbers of delegates are in the north, where Mr. Obama is expected to receive significant support.
 ''Texas is more like the South than the West,'' said Antonio Gonzalez of the Southwest Voters Registration and Education Project. ''Institutions, unions, community organizations are weak. Voters are increasingly individualistic. They are not organized on either the left or the right. So a charismatic candidate can come in and run the table.''
 Nina Perales of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund agreed, saying, ''Mrs. Clinton was counting on the old ward captains, and I'm not sure they're really there anymore.''
 Mrs. Clinton has endorsements from more than 100 Hispanic community leaders, businesspeople and elected officials. She has retained considerable support among Hispanic men. But Mrs. Clinton's staunchest support is from Hispanic women, who see their own struggles in hers.
 ''I think as a female she'll have more compassion for the elderly,'' said Mary Louise Arce, 63. ''We've become a lost group. Even doctors don't take care of us the way they take care of the young.''
 Mary Perez, wife, mother of two and president of the 20,000-member student body at San Antonio Community College, served as host to Chelsea Clinton at the campus last week. She said that she identified closely with Hillary Rodham Clinton's drive and determination and that electing a woman would make a much bigger, and better, difference to the country, than electing a black man. And as a mother without medical insurance who said she had occasionally put her own health at serious risk in order to keep the rest of her bills paid, Ms. Perez said universal health care was much more important than affordable health care.
 ''I blocked out the pain as long as I could,'' Ms. Perez, 26, said of a recent kidney infection that she waited several weeks to treat. ''And then, when I started getting 105-degree fevers, I decided to go to the hospital.''
 When asked whether she was still paying off the $10,000 bill, Ms. Perez voice cracked, ''Yes.''
 But Mr. Obama has made an aggressive play for some of Mrs. Clinton's southern stronghold, with forays into the Rio Grande Valley to talk to students about his plans to offer tax breaks that would defer the costs of their loans, to veterans about building more military hospitals, and to single mothers about improving public schools.
 As has been the case elsewhere, the tight race between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama has produced divided loyalties in Texas.
 Mary Olga Montez, a retired military aircraft mechanic, said she had been focused on keeping the peace in her house. In her 53 years of marriage to her husband, Robert, an accountant, she said they had differed on presidential candidates numerous times. But Mrs. Montez typically kept her choice to herself -- until this year.
 ''He kept telling people that both of us were supporting Clinton, so finally, I told him, 'No. I'm supporting Obama,' '' recalled Mrs. Montez, 73. ''I said, 'We need change. We need something different, new ideas.' ''
 Mr. Montez, 75, said: ''How soon people forget. The Clintons did a lot for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for everybody. Now it seems like everyone's forgotten.''
 Referring to his wife, he half joked, ''Some people, you just want to send them to the corner with a dunce cap on.''
 When asked whether all the talk of politics had put a strain on their relationship, Mrs. Montez got the last laugh. ''I just feed him a good dinner,'' she said, ''and that's the end of that.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer and Aide Differ on Presidential Race, but 'It's a Free Country'

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer has endorsed Hillary Clinton, but one of his closest aides and friends, Lloyd Constantine, is solidly in Barack Obama's corner. 
 ''I'm not Obama Girl, I'm Obama Man,'' Mr. Constantine, below, said jokingly, referring to the female star of a popular YouTube video. ''A couple years ago, I had a client, Aon, which is the largest reinsurance broker in the world, and their deputy general counsel is a guy named Bob Rifkin, and he had a very close relationship with Barack, and I had a very close relationship with Eliot. We started to have a debate about who's going to be president first,'' he continued in a recent interview. ''I was advocating Eliot, he was advocating Barack. We would talk about this incessantly. I gave him his instruction on Eliot, and he gave me my instruction on Barack, and I think we both convinced each other, frankly.''
 Empire Zone would here note that Mr. Spitzer has previously professed a lack of interest in running for the presidency -- but then again, so has Michael R. Bloomberg, the New York mayor. 
 Mr. Constantine, a senior adviser to the governor, has donated the maximum amount allowable to Mr. Obama's campaign; three other partners at his former law firm, Constantine Cannon, have also donated to Mr. Obama. Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Constantine are both founding partners of the firm.
 Mr. Constantine said he informed his boss before he sent his $2,300 to the Obama campaign. 
 ''When I was about to make my contribution and max out, I said to Eliot, 'You don't mind?' and he said: 'Absolutely not. It's a free country.' ''
 Mr. Constantine said he was surprised, but pleased, by how the presidential race had played out since his donation, made in September. He said he was even satisfied with the likely Republican nominee. 
 ''I went to the polls the last few times voting for the person I disfavored the least,'' he said. ''This time, Americans have a choice of three very good people, and the one I backed is the best of the three.'' 
 Election Weather
 As the hotly contested special election to fill the vacated seat of Senator James W. Wright, an upstate Republican, goes down to the wire with voters on Tuesday, there is one major worry for the party's Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno: the weather. 
 The seat up for grabs is in the 48th Senate District, along Lake Ontario north of Syracuse, where snowstorms are common and residents don't even flinch unless there are more than a couple feet of snow.
 ''That's what's kind of disturbing,'' Mr. Bruno said during an interview last week on WCBI-AM in Albany. ''If you want to talk about tension, you want to talk about stress, if I force myself or allow myself to think about the weather and what can happen out there and what a snowstorm of 12 or 18 inches could do if it falls in the wrong parts of that district ...'' So, Empire Zone asks Mr. Bruno, above, what do you do about it? ''What do you do about it?'' he said. ''You pray to the good Lord that fairness wins out, and that the weather is Republican weather.'' TRYMAINE LEE 
 'Living Wage' Clash
 Assembly Democrats are once again locking horns with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, this time over the reauthorization of recently expired laws involving industrial development agencies.
 The agencies grant hundreds of millions of dollars each year in tax-exempt financing and other tax breaks to companies and nonprofit organizations in an effort to promote job growth. But Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Buffalo-area Democrat, wants them to set conditions for that aid. He has tucked into a pending reauthorization bill provisions that require some recipients to pay a ''living wage'' for any jobs created using the tax breaks.
 Those provisions are strongly opposed by development officials in New York City, who say the requirement would gut the program.
 ''It does not make sense, in the guise of reform, to make the program effectively unusable,'' Seth W. Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement. ''Though a salary approaching $20 an hour for New Yorkers is a nice goal, it is unlikely that many developers will access this program if such a requirement is the price of doing so.''
 But Mr. Hoyt, left, says he does not trust the city's estimates for how much the new requirements, which would apply to civic organizations and some health care entities, would increase costs. He also hinted that he had staked out a provocative position on the Assembly bill in part to encourage more compromise from the Republican-controlled Senate, which he said had been dismissive of what he sees as the need to overhaul development agencies.
 ''I think there are a lot of people who will scream that the sky is falling,'' Mr. Hoyt said. ''But I would submit that the sky isn't falling, and in the end, there will be a lot of people who will be satisfied with the compromise we reach.'' NICHOLAS CONFESSORE 
 Church on YouTube
 The state's Roman Catholic bishops have gone digital in their campaign against Gov. Eliot Spitzer's effort to strengthen state laws protecting abortion rights. Last week, the church made its self-proclaimed YouTube debut -- a 10-minute video that is part public service announcement, part campaign ad. Over the soft notes of an electric piano, Kathleen M. Gallagher, a lobbyist for the New York State Catholic Conference, the bishops' public policy arm, urges New Yorkers to register their dissatisfaction.
 A bill introduced by State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat, on behalf of Mr. Spitzer would write into state law the abortion rights guaranteed by the United States Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. ''We must do all within our power to oppose this misguided, immoral and radical proposal,'' Ms. Gallagher says, giving opponents several ways -- both high tech and low tech -- to do just that. She directs them to the conference's Web site, where they can send a form e-mail message to their representatives in the State Legislature, or write letters to the editorial page of their local newspaper. 
 For the less technologically savvy, Ms. Gallagher suggests snail mail. 
 But nothing beats a pop-in visit, she says: ''Better yet, visit your state senator in his or her district office.'' As of Friday night, the video had been viewed by about 7,000 people on YouTube. JEREMY W. PETERS 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Empire Zone column in some editions last Monday about Lloyd Constantine, an aide to Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York who is backing Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential contest instead of the governor's choice, Hillary Rodham Clinton, misspelled the surname of a former business associate of Mr. Constantine's who he said convinced him that Mr. Obama was the candidate to back. He is Bob Rivkin, not Rifkin.

HEADLINE: German Vote Confirms Shift Of Political Center to the Left

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The successor to the East German Communist Party won representation in the legislature of the northern city of Hamburg on Sunday, confirming a leftward political shift across Germany. 
 The results, after a similar outcome in two state elections in January, come amid an increasingly sharp conflict about whether the former Communists, known as the Left Party, would be a viable political partner in Hamburg and elsewhere in Germany. 
 That dispute, in turn, is worsening already fractious relations between the two large parties of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government in Berlin.
 Though a tiny slice of the German political landscape, Hamburg has in the past few weeks taken on an outsized importance as a test case for whether Germans, weary of years of belt-tightening economic restructuring, would drive the political center of gravity further left. 
 The vote confirmed the trend, with the Left Party winning 6.5 percent of the vote, according to German public television's preliminary exit polls. 
 The city's popular mayor, Ole von Beust of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, won 42.7 percent, stripping him of the absolute majority he has used to govern for the last four years. The Social Democrats, the pillar of Germany's center-left, won 34.1 percent.
 The Left Party, a combination of former Communists, disillusioned Social Democrats and western radicals, won enough votes last month in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony to win parliamentary representation. While the Left Party is well represented in the east and has parliamentary seats in the northern city-state of Bremen, it had never sat in one of the large western states' parliaments.
 The votes contributed to a brewing sense of political helplessness.
 ''The German political system is now effectively in gridlock,'' said Jackson Janes, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, a research group based in Washington. ''And no one knows how to get it out.'' 
 After last month's votes, Kurt Beck, the national chairman of the Social Democrats, spoke out against ''any kind of active cooperation'' with the Left, a formulation that only fueled speculation that his party might try to form a minority government with the Left's support.
 The Left is still viewed with great suspicion by many Germans because of its Communist past. At the state level, it currently governs only in Berlin, which is also a state, and it has never played a national role.
 In Hamburg, the top Social Democratic candidate, Michael Naumann, a former New York publishing executive, categorically ruled out a coalition with the Left Party during his campaign.
 Mrs. Merkel, the chancellor, currently sits atop an unwieldy ''grand coalition'' of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, a government created in part to keep the Left Party out of national politics after elections in 2005. Over the weekend, conservatives reacted to news that their partners in the capital might reverse course over the Left Party's role with veiled threats of reprisals in Berlin. 
 ''If a promise is broken, it will not be without effects on the grand coalition,'' Christian Wulff, premier of the state of Lower Saxony and a close ally of Mrs. Merkel, told dpa, the German press agency, on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Mexican Workers Barely Increased Remittances in '07

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Mexicans working in the United States sent back almost $24 billion to their families at home last year, almost the same amount as the year before, the Mexican central bank reported on Monday. 
 The bank said the economic slowdown and the crackdown on illegal immigrants in the United States helped to explain sluggish growth in money transfers, known as remittances. 
 Remittances grew 17 percent in 2006, in line with the annual double-digit growth over much of this decade. But in 2007, they increased by just 1 percent, to $23.98 billion. 
 The sharp contraction in the United States housing industry last year had a particularly noticeable effect on remittances because many Mexicans are employed in construction. 
 The central bank added that heightened border security was making it much harder for Mexicans to enter the United States in search of work without authorization. Once in the country, it is harder to find jobs because of tighter controls against employers who hire the undocumented. 
 Remittances are among Mexico's largest sources of foreign currency. Last year, foreign companies invested $23.23 billion to build factories or set up other businesses in Mexico, the second-highest total for foreign direct investment ever. That was still less than the money that the largely low-skilled Mexicans sent home in the form of remittances. 
 The central bank recently cut its economic growth forecast for 2008 by half a percentage point, to a range of 2.75 to 3.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Visa Plans $17 Billion Public Offer

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Floyd Norris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Undaunted by recent turbulence in the financial markets, Visa Inc., the nation's biggest credit card network, said Monday that it would forge ahead with what would be the largest initial public stock offering in United States history. 
 Visa plans to sell as much as $17.1 billion of stock in late March, following in the footsteps of its smaller rival, MasterCard, which went public in May 2006. 
 Visa and MasterCard are prospering as Americans increasingly flex plastic, rather than use cash, to pay for just about everything. The companies have not been hurt by the credit squeeze, because they do not actually make credit card loans; they merely process transactions for banks that do. 
 If all goes as planned, Visa's offering would generate a windfall for thousands of its so-called member banks, which own the company. The largest gains would go to many of the nation's biggest banks, which have been stung by losses stemming from mortgage-linked investments. 
 ''Visa will be able to tell its story, even in an uncertain market, because its story is a good one,'' said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter. ''If investors think MasterCard is a good story, Visa looks like the same thing on a bigger scale.''
 Visa plans to sell 406 million Class A shares for $37 to $42 a share, with just over half going to the public and the rest to Visa's member banks. 
 The first $3 billion will be placed into a special account to cover outstanding antitrust and unfair-pricing claims brought by merchants. Visa will use some of the new money to streamline its operations, expand in fast-growing emerging markets and invest in new technology like systems that enable people to make card payments via cellphone. But the bulk of the capital will end up in the banks' coffers, from repurchasing stock from them.
 Visa's member banks can use the extra cash. 
 If Visa's shares are valued at a midpoint price of $39.50, JPMorgan Chase, the company's largest shareholder, would receive an estimated $1.1 billion for its stake. Bank of America would get about $545 million; National City would get about $380 million; and Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo can each expect around $240 million or more. 
 ''The credit crunch is pretty cyclical; the prospects for Visa are very strong long-term,'' said Marc Abbey, the managing partner of First Annapolis, a consulting firm that works with many banks and payments companies. ''I am sure it is convenient for them to have extraordinary gains at the same time they have extraordinary losses.'' 
 Since going public nearly two years ago, MasterCard shares have soared 408 percent, closing at $198.45 on Monday. It now has a market value of $26 billion. 
 MasterCard's successful I.P.O. prompted Visa to move forward with its own plans to go public. Since October 2006, Visa has reorganized its sprawling management structure, bringing together all of its global operations with the exception of those in Europe. 
 It has also hired Joseph W. Saunders, the former head of the Providian Financial Corporation, as its new chairman and chief executive, giving him a pay package worth $11.1 million in cash for 2007. Upon completion of the I.P.O., he is expected to receive an additional $11.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. 
 Visa transactions accounted for roughly 66 percent of all credit and debit card purchases in the United States in 2006, compared with about 26 percent for MasterCard, according to The Nilson Report data. 
 Growth in card transactions, the foundation of the companies' businesses, has historically held up well, even when the economy and consumer spending slows.

HEADLINE: For North Korea, Music and Choreography

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea 

 BODY:
Projected on a scrim, the gently falling ''snow'' speckled the precisely twirling figures at the Mansudae Art Theater in a dance depiction of Korean Communists' guerrilla action against the Japanese. At the climax, a nighttime scene of downtown Pyongyang materialized, with warm lights glowing in the high-rise buildings.
 Outside, in real Pyongyang, where electricity is often scarce, most buildings were dark. Malnutrition persists in the countryside. Yet North Korea presented a lavish welcome on Monday to its latest visiting delegation, the New York Philharmonic: a gala performance of traditional music and dance, and an endless banquet with quail eggs, roast mutton and pheasant-ball soup.
 American and North Korean diplomats are now haggling over Pyongyang's promise to abandon its nuclear weapons program, and the United States has dangled the prospect of a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War if the country ultimately complies. But the orchestra's heavily choreographed visit -- to include master classes, tours of the town and a concert on Tuesday night -- is the first hint of a broader thaw in a half-century-long cultural standoff. 
 The North Koreans opened the door to some 400 people, the largest contingent of Americans to visit this isolated, totalitarian state since the Korean War ended in 1953. The group includes musicians, orchestra staff, television production crews and 80 journalists, as well as patrons who paid $100,000 a couple.
 They came bearing bows and basses rather than the arms and armor Americans carried the last time this large a contingent set foot in the North Korean capital. The brass will issue fanfares, not orders.
 Critics hold out little hope that this updated version of ping-pong diplomacy, sports and cultural exchanges that helped warm relations with Maoist China in the 1970s, will do much to transform North Korea under Kim Jong-il. Mr. Kim has cracked open North Korea's door to outside businessmen, sports teams and diplomats in the past without allowing significantly more pluralism in the country's regimented economic and political life, and there are few signs that the arrival of the New York orchestra signals a major shift in direction.
 The Bush administration has kept its distance from the event. Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, visited Seoul on Monday for South Korea's presidential inauguration, but said she had no plans to come to Pyongyang and sought to play down the performance as a diplomatic instrument.
 Even so, some proponents of engagement with North Korea say they hope that the visit will nudge North Korea to greater contact with the outside world as China, the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia press Pyongyang to end its nuclear program. 
 Whatever the political results, the visit will take its place with other orchestral diplomacy, including the Philadelphia Orchestra's concert in China in 1973 and the Boston Symphony's triumphant appearance in the Soviet Union in 1956. The New York Philharmonic also visited the Soviet Union in 1959.
 ''There's no color here, everything is so gray,'' said Stephen Freeman, the bass clarinetist. He pointed out the lack of traffic lights in the streets, or even traffic. ''My initial reaction is it's kind of depressing.''
 Some of the musicians were troubled by the disparity between the country's poverty and the luxury of the banquet.
 ''It's painful,'' said Katherine Greene, a violist. ''It's the duality of people who want to show you everything beautiful that represents their country. At the same time, it's very sobering because I know what's beyond the hotel and the banquet.''
 But Mr. Freeman gave a more upbeat review of the dance performance held after the orchestra's arrival, which was presented especially for the Philharmonic and included numbers called ''The Fan Dance,'' ''Winnowing'' and ''Water Jar Dance.'' An amplified orchestra mixing Asian and Western instruments accompanied the pieces, which were models of precision. 
 ''Beautiful costumes, excellent coordination and dancing,'' he said. ''I was captivated by it.''
 The Philharmonic will play in the East Pyongyang Grand Theater, where music of Gershwin, Dvorak and Wagner, not to mention the American and North Korean national anthems, is to be broadcast live on state radio and television. That will be a novelty for a populace shut off from the world by government censorship.
 In a special gesture, the orchestra planned to play a folk song deeply resonant to all Koreans, ''Arirang,'' as an encore. 
 The trip has been stirring for the eight orchestra members of Korean origin.
 Michelle Kim, who went to the United States from Seoul at 10 and whose parents had left the North during the Korean War, said the performance of music so familiar in a place so seemingly remote was moving.
 ''I didn't think for a second they were North Koreans, or South Koreans,'' she said. ''The concert was mesmerizing.''
 The works were introduced by a woman in the characteristic tones of official North Korean public speech, with translation. After the final number, Lorin Maazel, the Philharmonic's music director, was invited to present a bouquet to the performers massed on the stage. He handed the flowers to a dancer who was wearing the red scarf of revolutionary struggle.
 Buses then took the contingent for a banquet at the Palace of Culture, with its giant lobby painting of the late Kim Il-sung at the head of a crowd of people. The first half of the menu was Korean: dried fish strips, heart-shaped rice cakes and kimchi. The second was Western: roast salmon, mutton, crab au gratin and mushrooms. Bottles of beer and ginseng rice wine crowded the center of each table.
 The vice minister of culture, Song Sok-hwan, gave a speech calling the visit a ''big stride in cultural exchange.'' Mr. Maazel expressed admiration for the performers seen earlier. ''We feel quite close to them,'' he said.
 An elaborate welcome ceremony began earlier in the day, when Asiana Flight OZ 1004 from Beijing, the previous stop on a three-week tour of Asia, arrived with the orchestra and followers. A light snow was falling. After journalists poured down the plane staircase and took up positions, Mr. Maazel walked down the steps followed by top orchestra officials. He was greeted by Mr. Song of the Culture Ministry. 
 The orchestra posed as a group for a ''class picture'' on the tarmac, a sign of the historic nature of the trip. Meanwhile, interpreters and guides identified the journalists they had been assigned to serve and mind.
 Because North Korea does not allow mobile phones from outside the country, passengers had to drop theirs in individual plastic bags and hand them over in Beijing to Philharmonic officials.
 North Korea, with its tight controls on the daily lives of its people, remains firmly in the grip of its leader, Kim Jong-il. But it also has begun to encourage expanded trade with China, Japan and South Korea, and has made concessions regarding its nuclear program. It has begun dismantling its Yongbyon reactor but missed a deadline to reveal the details of its program and denuclearization efforts have stalled.
 Only a trickle of foreigners come regularly to North Korea. A resident Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate position of envoys here, reported the words of one foreign ministry official: ''Yes, this is something big.''

HEADLINE: Selling Gold At I.M.F. To Rebuild Its Finances

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For decades, the International Monetary Fund has played a pivotal role in rescuing insolvent countries and stabilizing the world economy. But after years of budget problems, the fund received approval on Monday from the Bush administration to sell gold bullion to stabilize its own shaky finances. 
 The sale, which Congress also must approve, must be accompanied by cuts in the fund's budget and changes in its governance to give more influence to emerging countries and perhaps less to Europe, said David H. McCormick, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.
 ''The I.M.F. must reform to remain relevant,'' Mr. McCormick said in a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''The world economy is constantly changing, and the I.M.F. must now change with it, as it has successfully done in the past.''
 Mr. McCormick called for the fund to reduce the number of executive board members to 20, from 24, and to make room within the 20 for developing countries. The emerging economic powers, including China, Brazil, Russia, India and Mexico, have agitated for more such board seats in recent years. The fund took a step in that direction in 2006 but now needs to do more, he said.
 Fund officials say they have been trying to move in that direction but have met resistance from European countries. Europe's representation has been high since the fund was created at the end of World War II to help restore economic stability after years of violence and recession.
 In the 1990s, the I.M.F. played a central role in the bailout of countries in Asia and Latin America, engendering bitterness among their citizens because of the austerity programs imposed as a condition of the rescue. Since then, most of those countries have gotten back on their feet and prospered from their exports, accumulating vast reserves.
 Many of them have repaid the I.M.F. and are now talking about setting up their own monetary funds and reducing the I.M.F.'s influence. The I.M.F. has lost income as its lending activities have shrunk, and it faces $100 million in cuts from a $900 million budget. It also plans to sell some of its 103 million ounces in gold bullion to set up an investment fund to generate revenue.
 According to the treaty setting up the I.M.F. after the war, the United States must obtain Congressional approval for a sale of gold. Many of the countries that belong to the I.M.F. are resisting sales because they regard the gold as belonging to them. Mr. McCormick said in an interview that the fund contemplated selling about 13 million ounces, to raise about $12 billion. Mr. McCormick said that such a sale would probably not disrupt gold prices, which are at record levels of about $940 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Aid Rising Locally, As Is Dissent

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration and Congress consider proposals to ease the home foreclosure crisis, local governments across the country have been lending money to imperiled homeowners and confronting some opposition.
 Some of these municipal and state efforts have met resistance from people who consider the assistance undeserved and adamantly oppose anything that resembles a taxpayer bailout.
 Seattle, which has nowhere near the kind of foreclosure problem other cities have, began a modest program last month offering loans of up to $5,000 to help a few dozen homeowners avoid losing their homes.
 Not only are people in Seattle relatively prosperous, but they have a reputation for being nice, too. Yet no sooner had Mayor Greg Nickels announced the program than opposition surfaced. 
 ''Just can't agree with using taxpayer dollars to bail out private homeowners, no matter how the mayor tries to justify it,'' read a complaint posted on the ''Soundoff'' section of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Web site.
 Mark Ellerbrook, who manages Seattle's homeownership program, said that, aside from residents hoping to apply, few people were enthusiastic about the program. He said he understood that reaction, given the local housing market.
 ''People struggle to buy homes in this city, for sure,'' Mr. Ellerbrook said. ''And then you have what looks, on the face of it, like the city giving money to people who made bad decisions.''
 In Massachusetts, MassHousing, a quasi-state agency, began a loan refinance program last summer that relies on bond revenue. After its initial public relations effort, the agency had to make clear ''that this is not taxpayer-funded,'' said Tom Farmer, an agency spokesman. 
 ''The talk radio was all up in arms: 'Why should we be helping these people out?' '' Mr. Farmer said. '' 'They should have known what they were doing.' ''
 The goal of these programs is not just to keep people from losing their homes, but also to limit broader economic fallout, including plummeting property tax revenues and widespread declines in home values. Still, they pit what some government officials say are practical economic solutions for the common good against individual ideals of fairness and personal responsibility.
 The opposition may be rooted in ''this ancient notion of deserving versus undeserving, and you're undeserving if you made a bad decision,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
 While the negative reactions have not stopped the assistance efforts, it has put some local officials on the defensive and forced them to try to sell the programs to the general public, not just to the intended recipients.
 ''This is not a bailout,'' Joseph Smith, the commissioner of banks in North Carolina, said this month in announcing a program to direct $300,000 in taxpayer money to mortgage counselors who could help homeowners refinance. ''We're not paying off anybody's mortgage.''
 Small, government-supported ''rescue loan'' programs have been used in many places before. Those efforts, as well as the current ones, typically have been cast as having broader benefits, similar to the way public health programs are portrayed, Mr. Retsinas said.
 ''Much of the rationale,'' he said, ''is less the notion of keeping an individual from getting sick than it is, 'If we vaccinate this person, their illness won't cause other people to get sick.' ''
 The program in Seattle is intended to help about 40 homeowners threatened with foreclosure. In Ohio, two government-sponsored programs offer similar assistance. Massachusetts, Maryland and other states also have loan or refinancing programs. 
 Some of these programs tap into into taxpayer money directly, while others use revenue from the sale of bonds or other sources. Most require borrowers to pay back the loan eventually, though some forgive them altogether. 
 Some programs, like Maryland's, are designed for people caught in subprime mortgages, and these can have more generous terms. Several of the programs, including Seattle's, aim to help low- or moderate-income borrowers facing an unexpected financial hardship, like loss of a job or illness. Many have strict requirements that often prevent people from qualifying, sometimes leading to charges that they do not go far enough.
 Government has a history of getting involved in foreclosure crises. During the Great Depression, the federal government created the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which helped refinance about a million loans -- and made a profit in the process. In December, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, suggested that government provide assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure.
 Until recently, the Bush administration has focused on getting banks and lenders to restructure or refinance home loans, but critics say it is unclear how many people will be helped.
 Bruce Marks, the chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, which works with lenders to restructure loans under terms that homeowners can afford, said giving loans to homeowners improperly focused public frustration on borrowers instead of banks and lenders.
 ''Before you criticize other people, ask your family members, ask your neighbor, ask your co-workers whether their home is at risk of foreclosure, and you will find that the people closest to you are about to lose their homes but they're too embarrassed to tell you and to reach out for help,'' Mr. Marks said. ''That's how pervasive this crisis is.''
 Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has written about the foreclosure prevention programs of the Great Depression, echoed concerns that, in some cases, government intervention could reward irresponsibility and make markets unpredictable. ''The problem on the other side,'' he said, ''is if you have a general problem that threatens to cause a general downward spiral, then everybody's going to suffer.''
 Ryan Ellis, the tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative antitax group, said his group opposed efforts by the Bush administration to nudge banks and lenders into restructuring some loans, much less direct government loans to homeowners facing foreclosure.
 ''You can call it community reinvestment, neighborhood protection, whatever you want,'' Mr. Ellis said, ''but if you're taking away the downside risk of a loan, you're bailing them out.''
 Foreclosures have increased as the national real estate market continues to decline. On Monday, the National Realtors Association reported that the sales of existing homes declined in January, the sixth consecutive month that sales have dropped. The median home price in January was $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier.
 Prevention programs and the way they are received can vary depending on the region. In Ohio, foreclosure rates are among the highest in the nation because of fallout in the mortgage industry but also because of the widespread loss of manufacturing jobs. Two state programs there are offering nearly $5 million in loans to homeowners. 
 Lou Tisler, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater Cleveland, which administers funds for the programs statewide, said political opposition had been little more than background noise. ''We're all suffering together through the whole economy,'' he said. ''It's not just the housing bust. It's not just people losing their jobs. It's not just medical costs. It's everything together. It allows for a stretch of innovation.''
 In Maryland last month, the Department of Housing and Community Development started its ''Bridge to Hope'' loan program, which caps loans at $15,000 and focuses on keeping low- to moderate-income homeowners in their homes. The program has an initial budget of $400,000.
 Clarence Snuggs, the deputy secretary of the department, said Maryland was ranked fifth nationally for its rate of so-called subprime loans. 
 ''There are good people out there who are in bad loans that put them in tough situations,'' Mr. Snuggs said. ''We need to find ways to help them to help us all.''
 In California, the notion of a government loan program seems remote to some state leaders, given how big such a fund would have to be and that California's budget deficit is larger than most state budgets.
 State Senator Michael Machado, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Finance and Insurance, is from Stockton, where the foreclosure rate increased 271 percent in 2007. 
 ''If they got into a situation that got bad for them, they need to live through that and they shouldn't expect government to bail them out,'' he said, summarizing what he says is a commonly held view. ''And when you're dealing with a $14.5 billion deficit like we are here in California, it's difficult to do that anyway.''

HEADLINE: The Advantages of Closing a Few Doors

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: The next time you're juggling options 

 BODY:
-- which friend to see, which house to buy, which career to pursue -- try asking yourself this question: What would Xiang Yu do?
 Xiang Yu was a Chinese general in the third century B.C. who took his troops across the Yangtze River into enemy territory and performed an experiment in decision making. He crushed his troops' cooking pots and burned their ships. 
 He explained this was to focus them on moving forward -- a motivational speech that was not appreciated by many of the soldiers watching their retreat option go up in flames. But General Xiang Yu would be vindicated, both on the battlefield and in the annals of social science research. 
 He is one of the role models in Dan Ariely's new book, ''Predictably Irrational,'' an entertaining look at human foibles like the penchant for keeping too many options open. General Xiang Yu was a rare exception to the norm, a warrior who conquered by being unpredictably rational. 
 Most people can't make such a painful choice, not even the students at a bastion of rationality like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Dr. Ariely is a professor of behavioral economics. In a series of experiments, hundreds of students could not bear to let their options vanish, even though it was obviously a dumb strategy (and they weren't even asked to burn anything).
 The experiments involved a game that eliminated the excuses we usually have for refusing to let go.. In the real world, we can always tell ourselves that it's good to keep options open. 
 You don't even know how a camera's burst-mode flash works, but you persuade yourself to pay for the extra feature just in case. You no longer have anything in common with someone who keeps calling you, but you hate to just zap the relationship. 
 Your child is exhausted from after-school soccer, ballet and Chinese lessons, but you won't let her drop the piano lessons. They could come in handy! And who knows? Maybe they will. 
 In the M.I.T. experiments, the students should have known better. They played a computer game that paid real cash to look for money behind three doors on the screen. (You can play it yourself, without pay, at tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com.) After they opened a door by clicking on it, each subsequent click earned a little money, with the sum varying each time. 
 As each player went through the 100 allotted clicks, he could switch rooms to search for higher payoffs, but each switch used up a click to open the new door. The best strategy was to quickly check out the three rooms and settle in the one with the highest rewards. 
 Even after students got the hang of the game by practicing it, they were flummoxed when a new visual feature was introduced. If they stayed out of any room, its door would start shrinking and eventually disappear. 
 They should have ignored those disappearing doors, but the students couldn't. They wasted so many clicks rushing back to reopen doors that their earnings dropped 15 percent. Even when the penalties for switching grew stiffer -- besides losing a click, the players had to pay a cash fee -- the students kept losing money by frantically keeping all their doors open. 
 Why were they so attached to those doors? The players, like the parents of that overscheduled piano student, would probably say they were just trying to keep future options open. But that's not the real reason, according to Dr. Ariely and his collaborator in the experiments, Jiwoong Shin, an economist who is now at Yale. 
 They plumbed the players' motivations by introducing yet another twist. This time, even if a door vanished from the screen, players could make it reappear whenever they wanted. But even when they knew it would not cost anything to make the door reappear, they still kept frantically trying to prevent doors from vanishing. 
 Apparently they did not care so much about maintaining flexibility in the future. What really motivated them was the desire to avoid the immediate pain of watching a door close. 
 ''Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss, and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss,'' Dr. Ariely says. In the experiment, the price was easy to measure in lost cash. In life, the costs are less obvious -- wasted time, missed opportunities. If you are afraid to drop any project at the office, you pay for it at home. 
 ''We may work more hours at our jobs,'' Dr. Ariely writes in his book, ''without realizing that the childhood of our sons and daughters is slipping away. Sometimes these doors close too slowly for us to see them vanishing.''
 Dr. Ariely, one of the most prolific authors in his field, does not pretend that he is above this problem himself. When he was trying to decide between job offers from M.I.T. and Stanford, he recalls, within a week or two it was clear that he and his family would be more or less equally happy in either place. But he dragged out the process for months because he became so obsessed with weighing the options. 
 ''I'm just as workaholic and prone to errors as anyone else,'' he says.. ''I have way too many projects, and it would probably be better for me and the academic community if I focused my efforts. But every time I have an idea or someone offers me a chance to collaborate, I hate to give it up.''
 So what can be done? One answer, Dr. Ariely said, is to develop more social checks on overbooking. He points to marriage as an example: ''In marriage, we create a situation where we promise ourselves not to keep options open. We close doors and announce to others we've closed doors.''
 Or we can just try to do it on our own. Since conducting the door experiments, Dr. Ariely says, he has made a conscious effort to cancel projects and give away his ideas to colleagues. He urges the rest of us to resign from committees, prune holiday card lists, rethink hobbies and remember the lessons of door closers like Xiang Yu.
 If the general's tactics seem too crude, Dr. Ariely recommends another role model, Rhett Butler, for his supreme moment of unpredictable rationality at the end of his marriage. Scarlett, like the rest of us, can't bear the pain of giving up an option, but Rhett recognizes the marriage's futility and closes the door with astonishing elan. Frankly, he doesn't give a damn.

HEADLINE: Yazoo Pumps, R.I.P.?

 BODY:
Stephen Johnson, the embattled career scientist who runs the Environmental Protection Agency, seems ready to defy Congress on an issue that his more politically connected predecessors ducked. Mr. Johnson has all but decided to cancel the Yazoo Pumps, a flood control scheme in the Mississippi Delta that is potentially the most environmentally destructive project undertaken by the Army Corps of Engineers at Congress's request. 
 Haley Barbour, the Mississippi governor who once ran the Republican National Committee, may well use his party connections to try to persuade Mr. Johnson to back off. The administrator should resist this and all other entreaties to do so.
 The cozy relationship between the Corps of Engineers and its pork-loving paymasters in Congress has produced many dubious schemes over the years, none as patently absurd as this one. 
 Billed as necessary to the Mississippi farm economy by its Senate champions, including the recently retired Trent Lott, the project envisions the world's largest hydraulic pumping plant, costing about $200 million. The pumps would drain many thousands of acres of wetlands and hardwood forests so that a relatively small number of soybean farmers who already drink liberally from the public trough can plant more crops. The operation would damage two wildlife refuges, and, by destroying wetlands that filter out pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorous, would further degrade the waters of the lower Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico.
 John Meagher, the recently retired head of the E.P.A.'s wetlands division, said in a letter to The Times last year that in his 25 years at the agency he had never seen a proposal that would do more damage to the environment than the Yazoo Pumps. 
 Even so, despite personal misgivings, earlier -- and far better known -- administrators, including Christine Todd Whitman and Michael Leavitt, did not veto the project despite their statutory authority under the Clean Water Act to protect wetlands. 
 The agency has vetoed only 11 such projects over the years. The Yazoo Pumps would destroy more wetlands than those 11 projects combined. Mr. Johnson should bring the veto tally to an even dozen and -- once and for all -- kill them off.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Introduce a Notably Improved Mainframe

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The mainframe, the aged yet surprisingly resilient survivor of computing, is getting a face-lift. A model called the I.B.M. z10, which is being introduced Tuesday, is far faster and has three times the data-juggling memory of its three-year-old predecessor, the z9.
 But the significance of the new machine, analysts say, is that it is a big step in a broad campaign by I.B.M. to make the mainframe computer a high-performance, energy-efficient engine for running all kinds of nonmainframe software. 
 The goal, according to I.B.M. executives and analysts, is to recast the mainframe as a nimble supercomputer in corporate and government data centers, running Web-based programs, Linux, advanced data mining and business intelligence software. 
 To do that, I.B.M. has refined its mainframe hardware and come up with new software tools, as part of a five-year, $1.5-billion overhaul.
 ''The mainframe's ability to survive is only as good as its ability to innovate and compete for these new computing workloads of the future,'' an analyst at Forrester Research, Brad Day, said. ''And I.B.M. is starting to succeed at that.''
 The stakes are high. Though the sales of mainframes account for less than 4 percent of I.B.M.'s revenue, the sales of mainframe software, storage and services are a big, profitable business. The overall business dependent on mainframes represents about 25 percent of company revenue and nearly half of its profit, said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 At Hannaford Brothers in Scarborough, Me., a supermarket chain with stores in five states, the company has consolidated many programs onto its two mainframes. They include its consumer Web site, its Web portal for tracking shipments from suppliers and store and customer data that were once housed on computers in individual stores.
 ''The mainframe has become very flexible and very scalable for us,'' said Bill Homa, Hannaford's chief information officer.
 Robert Woeckener, a senior technology manager at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio, said his company had consolidated more than 1,300 programs onto 480 virtual computers -- software that emulates a machine -- that run on two mainframes. 
 Nationwide began the program more than two years ago, projecting savings in energy, administration and other costs at $15 million over three years. ''We're probably running ahead of that,'' Mr. Woeckener said.
 I.B.M. competitors say that some individual success stories among mainframe users do not change the reality that the mainframe is in retreat. 
 In 2004, Microsoft founded the Mainframe Migration Alliance, a group of technology companies that helps corporations move software applications from mainframes to smaller computers powered by low-cost microprocessors and typically running Microsoft's Windows server operating system. Microsoft tracked 85 mainframe migration projects last year, and the company says 55 more are under way.
 I.B.M., to the contrary, says that the mainframe is in the midst of a revival. It is adding customers in developing nations, the company maintains, as banks, corporations and government agencies expand and need the kind of reliability and security that the mainframe delivers. I.B.M.'s mainframe revenue in India, China, Brazil and Russia grew 18 percent last year.
 Six hundred software applications, it says, were introduced on the mainframe last year.
 Rising energy costs and environmental concerns are putting pressure on growing computer data centers, with their voracious appetites for electricity. The z10, I.B.M. says, delivers the computing power of 1,500 industry-standard servers, running on personal computer microprocessors, while consuming 85 percent less energy and covering 85 percent less floor space.
 So the mainframe, it argues, has become the low-cost data center technology, although the machines cost $1 million and up.
 ''The market economics are moving in our direction, and we're seeing a return to the mainframe,'' said James Stallings, general manager of I.B.M.'s System Z division.
 Traditionally, mainframe computers run at utilization rates of 85 percent and more. PC-style servers, by contrast, have had utilization rates of 15 percent or so, because they have been less able to run many computing chores at once, as if mimicking the work of several machines -- a capacity the mainframe has had for decades. 
 But this so-called virtualization technology is increasingly coming to industry-standard servers, led by the software company VMware. 
 Several computer makers, including Dell and Hewlett-Packard, are announcing Tuesday that they will embed VMware's basic software into the hardware of the server computers, with shipments to begin within 60 days.
 ''We can get up to 80 and 85 percent capacity utilization now,'' Diane Greene, chief executive of VMware, said in an interview from a company gathering for partners, attended by 4,500 people in Cannes, France.

HEADLINE: Counting the Homeless to Help End Their Plight

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Looming over a shuttered nightclub by Interstate 91 is a billboard featuring fistfuls of cash and a brassy promise that Connecticut Lottery players could win $100,000 a year in perpetuity and be ''Set for Life.''
 Steps away, in the brush behind a fence, lives a man named Joe whose life is far from set.
 A former roofer who suffers from anxiety, Joe said he has lived for the past two years in his makeshift hideaway under the stars, surviving mainly by scrounging metal that he turns into jewelry or sells to recyclers for about $50 a week. He said he does not take drugs, but the volunteers who encountered him one recent night as they trekked through the city's vacant lots and alleyways for the state's annual count of the homeless said he sometimes steals bicycles to support a crack cocaine habit.
 As the temperature dipped into the 20s, Joe accepted a pair of gloves and a flashlight. But he declined a ride to a shelter or to avail himself of social services that could lead to longer-term help. 
 ''The shelters are filled with drunks, addicts and thieves, and the little I have, I'd like to hang on to,'' said Joe, who asked to be identified only by his first name. ''Since I've been staying outside, I haven't gotten a cold or flu,'' he added. ''I manage to stay warm.''
 Asked if there was anything more he needed, Joe told the volunteers: ''No, unless you have an old laptop so I could put my stuff on eBay.''
 And so Joe was counted, as part of an annual ritual in which volunteers here fanned out from 7 to 9 on a designated winter night to take stock of the homelessness problem. This year's tally will not be available until at least March, but last year, New Haven reported 778 homeless people, roughly a fifth of the total counted statewide.
 New Haven is among some 4,000 communities nationwide that have been participating in the surveys -- coordinated to avoid double-counting the itinerant homeless -- since January 2005; in recognition of the principle that you cannot manage what you do not measure, those that count at least every other year are rewarded in their competition for federal money.
 ''This is an essential business practice that was not being practiced,'' said Philip F. Mangano, who has served as the Bush administration's homelessness czar since 2002, running a council that coordinates homeless-related services among 20 federal agencies. Mr. Mangano, who previously worked as an advocate for the homeless in Massachusetts, refers to homeless people as ''consumers'' and compares his work to the abolition movement.
 Washington has increased financing to fight homelessness every year since 2005, and President Bush is proposing $5 billion -- a 3 percent increase over last year -- for fiscal 2009. Connecticut's count cost about $100,000 -- $20,000 for equipment like flashlights and refreshments for the volunteers, the rest to pay analysts to go over the data -- and was paid for by state agencies and private grants.
 Over all, officials estimate there are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, one in five of them considered chronically homeless. But counting them is not as simple as it sounds.
 One man collecting cans on Chapel Street insisted he was not homeless, saying he would catch a bus home when he finished. The volunteers were not sure whether to count him. Another man dressed in camouflage attire walked by without being approached. ''College student,'' guessed Debbie Fisk, the social worker guiding the three-volunteer team that let him pass.
 As the director of outreach for the Connecticut Mental Health Center, Ms. Fisk is familiar with many of the street people by name and habit, and can often spot their calling cards.
 This year, she started her search on Water Street, where several major roads intersect overhead like spaghetti. She and her two counting comrades squeezed through a gap in a fence and braved a thicket of thorns to reach an embankment filled with makeshift tents.
 ''Victor?'' she called over and over, beaming a flashlight into the embankment. There was no response.
 Over near Chestnut Street, Ms. Fisk found another pied-a-terre under a highway overpass, but still no occupants. Her fellow volunteer Joe Parente, a vice president at Easter Seals Goodwill Industries, spotted a pillow, blanket, toothpaste, soap, cologne, reading material, condoms, and a length of pipe that, he posited, the occupant ''probably uses for protection.'' Nearby, another cubbyhole featured a stuffed bear, caked in dust.
 Underpasses are popular living areas, Ms. Fisk said, because they protect against the elements and are hard to spot from the street. Still, she knows one longtime occupant who ended up with dangerous levels of carbon monoxide in his blood.
 Strolling by was a man who seemed delusional. He was happy to talk and be counted. Asked if his bed was nearby, he said, ''Yeah, but before I sleep, I'm watching the children.''
 ''That's Victor,'' Ms. Fisk said once he passed. ''He's been sleeping outside for 14 years.'' She added: ''We've offered him subsidized housing, but he's too paranoid.''
 New Haven is one of about 325 cities and counties around the nation that in recent years have devised ambitious 10-year plans not just to reduce homelessness, but also to end it. And New Haven is serious. Local property taxes finance emergency shelters. Top officials chart the city's progress and press Hartford and Washington for support. 
 But sometimes it seems that the more services a city offers, the more homeless people seem to gravitate to its streets. Advocates say it is no coincidence that Connecticut's Department of Correction sometimes discharges inmates to New Haven, where those without stable homes will be cared for. 
 ''We are faced with endless problems like that,'' said Alison Cunningham, the executive director of Columbus House, a nonprofit operator of shelters and housing in New Haven.
 As rain pelted New Haven one night this month, the men's shelter on Grand Avenue and the overflow shelter on Cedar Street were both near capacity by nightfall.
 Shelter operators do not like to turn anyone away, but ''at some point if it gets too full, we don't have enough cots,'' Ms. Cunningham said. The Cedar Street shelter has an official capacity of 75, she added, but ''we've reached 125 on some nights.'' 
 Just last week, the city used the gymnasium of a school that was on break as a ''temporary overflow to the overflow,'' Ms. Cunningham said, to house 35 men who had nowhere else to go. She has been running Columbus House for 10 years and said she cannot remember a time with demand this high.
 ''It's people struggling with the cost of living, people not being able to keep up with rent and the increase in the bills they have,'' she said. ''This is a very tough economy, and it's really telling now that we see more people bailing out of housing because they can't afford it.''
 Mondale McIntyre, a soft-spoken Bridgeport native, arrived early enough to snare a spot in the Grand Avenue shelter. He said he had spent 7 of his 30 years behind bars for drug-related infractions and recently lost a $100-a-day job laminating phone book covers in West Haven for a subcontractor of AT&T.
 Mr. McIntyre said that he was raised by his grandparents in North Carolina after his parents ended up ''on the street,'' and that he once wanted to be a zoologist, but put that dream aside ''because I got into trouble.''
 ''When you're young and nobody really wants to hire you, the only thing you really cando is sell drugs,'' he said ruefully. ''Being a young African-American coming up in the streets,'' he says, he can see how becoming a drug dealer, with all the trappings ''is almost a goal,'' much like ''a white man in Greenwich might want to be a doctor or lawyer because that's what he's around.''
 He said he could stay with a sister in New Britain, but worried that if he did, he would not push himself to get off her couch and out of his rut. ''I left to come here, so I can better myself,'' he said.
 But on Feb. 1, New Haven police investigating a nearby disturbance discovered a 2-year-old warrant for Mr. McIntyre's arrest, stemming from a drug sale in Middletown.
 The authorities took him into custody and confiscated his belongings. They refused to store the items, and demanded to know where they could be shipped. He gave his sister's address, but he said the package has yet to turn up. 
 Released from jail 11 days later, he left with nothing but the brown prison uniform on his back. 
 ''Everything I had on me that day -- my birth certificate, my Social Security card, my identification, my life'' was taken, Mr. McIntyre said. ''I can't get a job now because I don't have my ID.''
 For six years now, Unchu Yu, 55, a Korean-born woman living in Bethany, awaits New Haven's homeless each Sunday at 7 a.m., with coffee, doughnuts and whatever else she can whip up, from spring rolls to Italian wedding soup.
 Most weekdays, churches in New Haven furnish breakfast for the homeless, but on Sundays, churches have services. So Ms. Yu, who is known as Jacky, persuaded Trinity Lutheran Church to lend her a kitchen and a meeting room. ''If I don't make food, they've got no place to go,'' she said of the people who are expected to vacate the shelters by 7:30 each morning.
 Called Agape Church, her gathering is a family affair. Her husband, Siyoung Yu, who works for a computer company, frequently delivers a sermon while she cooks. ''It's not like a normal church,'' she said, acknowledging that the couple could be accused of giving ''the same sermon all the time.'' Mostly, she explained, they urge visitors to ''try to stay with God'' and ''get off drugs and alcohol.''
 ''They listen,'' she said.
 After worship, Ms. Yu offers rides to anyone who wants to look for work or housing. She has also co-signed leases and helped with payments needed to secure an apartment. ''People think I'm crazy, but this brings so much happiness for me,'' she said.
 A Cheshire church provides Agape with gift-wrapped boots each Christmas. The company that runs Quinnipiac University's dining services sends soup.
 But some of Ms. Yu's supporters suffer fatigue, as homelessness never seems to fade. Ms. Yu raises money each year to try to extend the months that some local shelters operate. 
 ''We raised four months of money in 2002,'' she said. ''In 2003, we raised three months and in 2004, we raised two months. Every year, it's the same kind of problem, all the time.''

HEADLINE: FORD IS PUSHING BUYOUT OFFERS TO ITS WORKERS

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: WOODHAVEN, Mich. 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company is applying the hard sell these days -- piling on incentives, doling out marketing DVDs and brochures, and making offers it hopes are too good to pass up.
 But Ford's big new push is not to sell cars. Instead, it is trying to sign up thousands of workers to take buyouts, partly by convincing them that their brightest future lies outside the company that long offered middle-class wages for blue-collar jobs.
 So, Ford is pitching a buffet of buyout packages that are easily among the richest ever offered to factory workers, including one-time cash payments of $140,000 or college tuition plans for an entire family.
 The automaker is also putting on job fairs in its plants and mailing each of its 54,000 hourly workers a feature-length DVD, titled ''Connecting With Your Future,'' that extols the promise of new careers beyond the assembly line. 
 Last Friday, inside a huge sheet-metal stamping plant in this industrial center south of Detroit, Ford workers spent their lunch hour perusing opportunities to go back to school, hire on at growing companies and open fast-food franchises.
 ''I am taking it seriously, but it's really hard to think about leaving,'' said Jerry Thomas, a 37-year-old millwright with 12 years at Ford. ''The only thing that would make me do it is the uncertainty. We just don't know what's going to happen with Ford.''
 The push to move workers out reflects the tough times in Detroit. Ford has lost $15 billion in the last two years, and General Motors and Chrysler are also revamping after heavy losses.
 While Detroit's Big Three have already cut about 80,000 jobs through buyouts and early retirements since 2006, a new blitz is under way to shrink employment even further to make way for lower-paid workers in the future.
 The aggressive approach to buyouts is particularly striking at Ford.
 In the early 1900s, the company founder, Henry Ford, transformed the American workplace by pioneering $5-a-day wages on the assembly line. And the company's paternalistic culture still lingers in the way workers often refer to the company as ''Ford's,'' in reference to the family that provided them a comfortable income.
 Ford executives say the buyout packages, which are the most lucrative and diverse ever offered in the industry, reflect a belief that Ford should look after its workers and ease their transition into different careers.
 ''We need to restructure, and it's important to our business to do so,'' said Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford's head of global manufacturing. ''But we want to do it in the best way for our employees.''
 But there is no mistaking Ford's message that this is the last companywide offer, and there could be layoffs if further downsizing becomes necessary.
 Ford is not saying how many workers it expects to take the buyouts by a March 18 deadline. But Wall Street analysts say the company has set a goal to get 8,000 employees to sign up.
 General Motors is also extending buyout offers to all of its 74,000 hourly employees, while Chrysler is offering buyouts to workers on a regional and individual plant basis.
 The belt-tightening comes after years of declining market share and increased competition from foreign automakers, led by Toyota.
 ''These companies are trying to do in the last 24 months what they should have done over the last 24 years,'' said John A. Casesa of the automotive consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group. ''That's why it's such a shock to the system.''
 Ford has eliminated more than 32,000 jobs over the last two years through buyouts and early retirements. But it needs to cut more to improve productivity, make room for transfers from its former Visteon parts plants, and pave the way for new hires at wages of $14 an hour -- roughly half of current pay scales.
 ''We always prefer for people to voluntarily leave and that's why we put the energy and effort into this package of buyouts,'' said Martin J. Mulloy, Ford's vice president for labor affairs.
 The buyout deals were developed with the United Automobile Workers union. In fact, one senior union official endorsed the downsizing effort in a cover article titled ''Fresh Opportunities'' in the company's internal Ford World magazine.
 ''Because of the loss of market share and because the economy is so bad, there aren't enough jobs for everybody,'' said the official, Bob King, the U.A.W.'s Ford division vice president.
 The company is offering a broad range of buyout and early retirement packages.
 Employees with as little as one year of seniority can receive $100,000 cash, although they give up all health benefits after a six-month period. For employees at least 55 years old and with at least 10 years on the job, the payout jumps to $140,000.
 Ford, which has a younger work force than G.M., also included many educational options. One buyout offer provides a worker four years of tuition reimbursement up to $15,000 annually, plus health care coverage over that period and a stipend equal to 50 percent of base wages.
 At the Woodhaven stamping plant, the 1,142 hourly workers are wrestling with the many choices facing them.
 ''They want to give people incentive to walk away,'' said Jim Irey, who has worked in the plant for 40 years. ''It's the reality of the business, whether you like it or not.''
 Another worker, Andy Linko, contrasted the buyout deals to how he fared when his previous job as a steel worker disappeared.
 ''We never had this type of opportunity when I was in the steel industry,'' Mr. Linko said. ''We knew for years that the industry was in trouble, and one day the doors just shut.''
 The job fair at Woodhaven offered a mix of career prospects, from truck driving to electrician work at the local utility to franchise opportunities at the Little Caesars pizza chain.
 One recruiter, Heidi Daniels of DTE Energy, said the plant was a ''great opportunity'' to find skilled labor. ''I've heard of offering out-placement assistance, but this is unique,'' Ms. Daniels said. ''It's almost unheard-of.''
 Ford has also gone to great lengths to promote the promise of life after the auto industry.
 In its DVD, Ford employs actors to urge workers to take ''the opportunity to step out and try something new.'' Various segments of the DVD highlight former Ford workers who have started their own businesses after taking buyouts.
 The company does not track the fortunes of all its former employees, but said it was proud of the ''success stories'' of people who have taken buyouts.
 One such worker, Dale Beck, took a $100,000 buyout in 2006 to open a Little Caesars outlet in St. Louis.
 ''I went from making cars to making pizzas, and it's turned out pretty well for me,'' Mr. Beck said. ''I also know some people who took the money and spent it, and now they're struggling.''
 Workers in the Woodhaven plant seem to split among younger workers who see the buyouts as a window to a new life, and older employees who cannot imagine giving up their Ford paychecks.
 ''I'm taking the $100,000,'' said Stacy Haynes, a 34-year-old mother of four children. ''I've been here 12 years, and I can't believe I lasted this long.''
 Bill Fender, a 58-year-old tool and die maker with 37 years on the job, sees it differently.
 ''I'd like to retire, but it's just not enough money for me now,'' Mr. Fender said. ''I'm making almost $80,000 a year, and I can't see leaving that behind.''
 One thing Ford workers are proud of is that their buyout options are more extensive and, in some instances, better paying than those at G.M.
 Those bragging rights seem a poignant commentary on the depth of Detroit's difficulties, said the historian Douglas Brinkley, author of a book on Ford titled ''Wheels for the World.'' 
 ''There was a time in the 20th century when you flashed a Ford badge in Detroit and it meant you were a man on the rise,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''Now, the new status symbol of the Rust Belt is they are downsizing people better than other companies are.''

HEADLINE: Investing in Our Cities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Thank you for ''In Search of a Real Urban Policy'' (editorial, Feb. 19), on why presidential candidates must focus on urban policy. 
 Urban leaders have been shut out of the current White House, with tremendous consequences, from the housing crisis to the decay of vital infrastructure. Candidates can reverse this debacle by listening to the nation's urban experts: the mayors of cities big and small. 
 They might learn that cities have long been America's economic engine; that in recent years cities have been thrust to the front lines of homeland security and felt the brunt of the federal government's failure to address immigration and health care; and that without federal investment in urban infrastructure, education and economies, the nation as a whole is crippled. 
 Candidates might also discover that cities across the country are leading the way not only on urban issues but also on solutions to overarching problems like global warming. 
 Andrea Batista Schlesinger Executive Director, Drum Major Institute for Public Policy New York, Feb. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Since urban policy doesn't rate billing on the candidates' Web sites, we shouldn't be surprised that candidates don't talk about culture and the arts, even though it is the cities' cultural vibrancy that attracts visitors and residents alike; and nonprofit arts alone inject $134 billion annually into the national economy. 
 And we forget, at our peril, that the health of our creative community is tied to the well-being of our cities: creative people seek to be with other creative people, but lack of affordable housing, problematic public education and congestion make it difficult for people to put down roots. 
 Yet candidates for elective office at every level of government have learned that they only need assure advocates of their support, which too often evaporates in the face of other pressing budget concerns. 
 They know that the arts are not a salient issue that will cause elected officials to lose voter support. It is vital that, somehow, we put urban needs in the top rank of our political agendas. 
 And central to those needs is a strong commitment to our nation's culture and the arts.
 Leida Snow New York, Feb. 19, 2008

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LEHMAN, ORIN

 BODY:
 LEHMAN--Orin, educator, philanthropist, civil rights advocate and conservationist with a life-long commitment to public service, died February 22, 2008. He died peacefully at home in New York City surrounded by his loving family and friends. The cause of death was pneumonia. Born January 14, 1920, he was 88. He was the son of the late Allan Sigmund and Evelyn Schiffer Lehman, and the brother of the late Ellen Lehman Long. He was the great-grandson of Mayer Lehman, founder of Lehman Brothers investment house, and grandnephew of Herbert Lehman, the former Governor of New York and U.S. Senator. 
Mr. Lehman grew up in Tarrytown, NY, graduated from the Scarborough and The Taft Schools, Princeton University and New York University where he earned masters and doctorate degrees in American history.In World War II, Lehman was an Army pilot with the rank of Captain. He was badly wounded in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. In 1947 he partnered with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, and founded Just One Break (JOB), whose mission is to find competitive employment for people with disabilities. JOB is the nations's oldest not-for-profit employment service for people with disabilities. Over half a century after founding it, Orin Lehman remained Chairman Emeritus of its board of directors until his death. Mr. Lehman's first public appointment came in 1950 when President Truman appointed him to the advisory board of the Economic Cooperation Administration where he succeeded his great-uncle Herbert Lehman. In 1952, while an associate in the Lehman Brothers firm, he was designated New York City's Outstanding Young Man of the Year by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. While prominently engaged in public life, Lehman explored a variety of careers. He served as an economic adviser to the U.S. mission at the United Nations, became the Chairman of the New York Board of Corrections, and published weekly newspapers. He served as Chairman of the Board of the New School of Social Research for ten years, where he also taught. In the 1970's he produced theatrical plays offBroadway, among them two hits by Jules Feiffer and the Pulitzer Prize winning play ''The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' by Paul Zindel. In 1975, Gov. Hugh L. Carey offered Mr. Lehman the job of Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation which he accepted, calling it ''The greatest job in the world.'' He was re-appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo, and by the time he retired in 1993, he had served 18 years as Commissioner, the longest period of any individual in that position. Mr. Lehman understood the value that parks would play not only in lives of New Yorkers, but also their overall benefit to the environment. His highest priority was making parks and open spaces accessible to all, long before it was the fashion and the law of the land. He was loved and respected by state park employees who affectionately called him ''Father Nature.'' During his tenure, the Empire State Summer and Winter Games, Senior Games and Games for the Physically Challenged were created. In addition to his public service, Mr. Lehman lived life to the fullest, playing golf, flying airplanes, and never letting his need for crutches interfere with his active schedule. Mr. Lehman was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Jewish Committee, a trustee of the Taft School, where he received the Citation of Merit Award, a director for UNESCO, 1968-1971 (United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization), a director of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 1965-1974, a trustee of the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation and a member of The Council on Foreign Relations. He was, until his death, a member of The Century Association in New York City. He was a soft-spoken man with a quiet bearing which belied his sense of humor and fun-loving nature. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family. Mr. Lehman was married to the late Jane Bagley Lehman and is survived by his former wife, Wendy Vanderbilt Lehman, his three daughters, Susan Lehman Carmichael (Mrs. Trent) of Greenwich, CT, Brooke Lehman and Sage Lehman of New York City and his four grandchildren Avery, Haley, Ryan and Whitney Carmichael. His companion Monique Van Vooren and his beloved Boston Terrier, Snookums, also survive him. A Memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York City on Tuesday, February 26th at 5:00pm. The Rabbi Ronald Sobel will officiate. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be made to Just One Break (JOB), 570 Seventh Ave, NY, NY 10018. www.justonebreak.com

HEADLINE: Bush Cool to States' Call For Public Works Projects

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush rebuffed appeals from the nation's governors on Monday to increase spending on roads, bridges and other public works as a way to revive the economy.
 Governors said Mr. Bush had told them at a White House meeting that he wanted to see the effects of his economic stimulus package before supporting new measures. 
 A bipartisan group of governors is pushing for major road and bridge projects as a way to create jobs and foster economic development. But the White House says the money could not be spent fast enough to be of much immediate help.
 ''There's no short-term stimulus to the economy for some of these projects,'' Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, said. 
 Moreover, Ms. Perino said, the president will not accept any bill that raises taxes to finance such projects. Governors would have more money available, she said, if Congress ended the wasteful earmarking of billions of dollars for specific projects.
 In a report on Monday, the National Association for Business Economics, a professional group, said, ''Economic growth is expected to slow to a crawl in the first half of 2008.''
 Asked about the president's response, Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, said: ''I think I can summarize his remarks best by saying he did not think he would be interested. He wants to see the results of the stimulus package that was just passed.''
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the National Governors Association, described the response as ''a fairly significant no.''
 ''There are tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects ready to go,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''I asked the president if he would support spending on those projects as part of a second stimulus package, and he said no.''
 Other governors pushing for spending on transportation projects include Jon Corzine of New Jersey, a Democrat; Charlie Crist of Florida, a Republican; Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican; and Eliot Spitzer of New York, a Democrat.
 After the cool reception at the White House, governors said they would take their proposals to Congress.
 In his campaign for the Democratic nomination, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has said he wants to spend $60 billion on roads, bridges and other public works over the next 10 years.
 In an effort to avert a recession, Mr. Bush recently signed a $168 billion measure to provide tax rebates to encourage consumer spending and to offer new tax incentives for businesses to buy equipment.
 Brian G. Turmail, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said highway spending was not an effective way to stimulate the economy because ''it takes too long to get the money into projects.''
 Rather than asking for an increase in federal highway spending, Mr. Turmail said, governors should seek additional money from the private sector, including pension funds and investment banking concerns.
 Mr. Crist said that he was exploring public-private partnerships and that federal officials had to ''increase their investment'' in transportation projects. 
 Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters told governors, ''The federal role in transportation should be more limited than it is today,'' and should focus on the Interstate and Defense Highway System and traffic congestion in major metropolitan regions. 
 Instead of relying so heavily on gasoline taxes, Ms. Peters said, states should charge highway users directly.

HEADLINE: Gates Pledges U.S. Help For Indonesian Military

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates pledged arms upgrades and other Pentagon support for Indonesia on Monday, as the Bush administration forged closer ties to the military of a country still viewed skeptically by some in Congress for past human rights abuses. 
 During a series of meetings in Jakarta, Mr. Gates tried to broaden the focus of American relations with Indonesia beyond the fight against terrorist networks, giving only passing mention to the threats they represent, in a speech before a group of foreign policy experts. 
 Instead, he emphasized the emergence of Indonesia as the ''bedrock'' of Southeast Asia and vowed that the United States would help to shore up the country's aging military hardware. He was not specific in the types of upgrades he would approve, but Indonesian officials have, among other things, sought replacement parts for its fleet of C-130 cargo planes. 
 Aides to Mr. Gates said that in the years immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, American policy toward Indonesia was driven too often by the Bush administration's demands for an aggressive campaign against terrorist cells in Indonesia. 
 During a visit in 2006 by Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary at the time, his Indonesian counterpart, Juwano Sudarsono, publicly warned the Bush administration that its counterterrorism policies were overbearing and self-defeating. 
 In his speech on Monday, Mr. Gates occasionally struck humble chords, admitting that at times the United States had been ''arrogant'' in dealings with other countries. 
 Mr. Gates called the development of Indonesia's military ''a key component'' of relations between the United States and Indonesia, and ''a vital aspect of Indonesia's emergence as a prosperous and stable democracy with global reach.''
 In 1992, Congress restricted arms sales and most American training for Indonesia, citing human rights abuses by the Indonesian military under Indonesia's longtime dictator, Gen. Suharto. Internal dissent forced Mr. Suharto to resign in 1998, but Congress enacted new curbs the next year, after a rampage by an army-backed militia in what was then East Timor Province, and again in 2003, after the killings of two American teachers in Papua Province in 2002. 
 Meanwhile, Islamic separatists within Indonesia and Al Qaeda were believed to have begun collaborating. Security experts blamed the groups for a series of terrorist strikes on Indonesian territory, including the bombings in Bali in 2002 that killed more than 200 people. Military ties between Jakarta and Washington were restored in late 2005. 
 Indonesia has largely emerged from the economic woes that crippled the country in the late 1990s, but is still viewed by many Western security experts as a potential hotbed of Islamic radicalism. More recently, the Indonesian government has been credited for cracking down on militants through a combination of successful police work and a campaign to turn the population against them. 
 Senior American military officials have long railed against the restrictions on training and equipping Indonesia's military imposed by Congress, saying they served only to weaken American influence over a country of growing strategic importance. 
 During a visit to Jakarta last September, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, signed an agreement with Indonesian officials to use a $1 billion Russian loan to sell the country Kilo-class submarines, helicopters and tanks. 
 American officials worry that even though the ban on weapons sales has been lifted, labyrinthine procedures and what Mr. Gates on Monday called ''bureaucratic inertia'' could still hold up the flow of military hardware.

HEADLINE: Oscar Hangs His Head As Commercials Disappoint

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FANS of advertising who watched the Academy Awards could be excused for wishing that Javier Bardem had come onstage to accept his Oscar for best supporting actor toting the stun gun his character wielded in ''No Country for Old Men.''
 Please, Anton Chigurh! Put us out of our misery! 
 O.K., so perhaps the commercials shown by ABC on Sunday were not awful enough to warrant a zap from the captive bolt pistol, as the contraption is called. But there were few spots of Oscar, er, caliber.
 One reason may be the brief time between the settlement of the writers' strike and the broadcast.
 Many of the commercials were spots that had been run before, from advertisers like General Motors, McDonald's and Pfizer. That was counter to a recent trend to treat the Oscars like the Super Bowl by offering new spots.
 ''The Super Bowl has become an advertising spectacle because almost all the creative in the Super Bowl is new,'' said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at TNS Media Intelligence in New York, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres. ''For the marginal football fan, that becomes another reason to watch the game.''
 Without a similar commitment to fresh work for the Academy Awards show, he added, ''the advertising doesn't bring people to the set the way it does for the Super Bowl.''
 The paucity of new commercials was probably not the primary reason the broadcast drew so few viewers -- an average of 32 million, according to estimates by Nielsen Media Research on Monday, which would be the lowest tally since Oscar came to TV in 1953.
 Still, it would have been nice if more sponsors had joined advertisers like American Express, Coca-Cola, Mars, MasterCard and Unilever in running spots that had not been seen before.
 What follows is an assessment of some of the best and worst Oscar commercials that appeared nationally.
 BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY A series of spots for American Living, a new line of apparel and home furnishings from the J. C. Penney Company, seemed cut from the same cloth as the familiar campaigns for Polo, Ralph Lauren and other brands sold by the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation.
 That similarity was no accident. The commercials were created internally at Polo Ralph Lauren by a unit named Global Brand Concepts. And Bruce Weber, who has helped create campaigns for brands including Polo and Ralph Lauren, directed the spots.
 BEST SONG Although the American Living commercials seemed derivative, the music in most of them was original. The spots featured a new song, ''Killing the Blues,'' by Alison Krauss, who is known for country and bluegrass tunes, and Robert Plant, the rocker of Led Zeppelin fame. The song is from their new album, ''Raising Sand.''
 BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS The model Heidi Klum is no movie star, but she was mentioned often enough during the broadcast to warrant an honor. Why? Several commercials for Diet Coke promoted a sweepstakes that will give away a red designer dress that she ''wore on the red carpet'' before the show.
 The commercials, created by Wieden & Kennedy, were part of an initiative by Diet Coke, a Coca-Cola brand, to promote healthy hearts among women. Yes, you can join the company in contributing to heart health even if drinking carbonated beverages may not contribute to heart health.
 BEST VANISHING ACT The ceremony took place at the Kodak Theater, as was noted as the broadcast began. And the Eastman Kodak Company also won an Oscar during the presentation of the scientific and technical awards.
 But there were no commercials for Kodak, a longtime sponsor. The company's extensive -- and costly -- digital makeover may have taken precedence over buying spots in an expensive TV show (an estimated average of $1.8 million for each 30-second spot).
 WORST VANISHING ACTNate Berkus, the decorator and designer, is the host of ''Oprah's Big Give,'' a new series that ABC promoted frequently during the show. But you would never know it because the spots were focused on the host, Oprah Winfrey. Agency: created internally at ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company.
 BEST MAKEOVER The chef Rocco DiSpirito appeared more fit and trim than usual in a commercial for the Bertolli line of foods sold by Unilever. The spot promoted a contest for consumers to submit video clips to a Web site (bertollinightsin.com).
 In the commercial, Mr. DiSpirito was constantly being interrupted as he tried to eat a meal during a ''romantic night in.'' No wonder he looked so good -- no carbs for him. Agency: McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 WORST TIMING A commercial for Cymbalta, a drug to treat depression sold by Eli Lilly & Company, appeared after the tribute to figures from the film industry who died in the last year. Agency: Draft FCB, an Interpublic unit.
 BEST VISUAL EFFECTS Or to be more precise, best effects by a visual organ. The star of a commercial for MasterCard Worldwide was a wandering right eye, an oddball eyeball that had a mind of its own. Some found the spot, which promoted an online sweepstakes (priceless.com/search), to be creepy. But it certainly stood out amid a sea of dullness.
 The commercial may have secretly been paying tribute to a film nominated for four Oscars, ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,'' the story of a stroke patient who communicated with the world by blinking his eye. Among the prizes in the sweepstakes is a portrait painted by Julian Schnabel, the director of the film. Agency: McCann Erickson.
 BEST LIVE-ACTION SHORT FILM Celeste Wouden, a mother of two from Mantua, Utah, gave Madison Avenue some spirited competition with a commercial she created for Dove Supreme Cream Oil Body Wash. The spot, called ''Speedy Spa,'' was selected during the show as the winner in a commercial-making contest for consumers (dovecreamoil.com).
 The contest attracted more than 3,500 entries, said Unilever, which sells Dove. That was more than twice the number submitted in a similar contest last year.
 BEST COMEBACK In October, Lowe Worldwide, an agency owned by Interpublic, lost the creative assignment for the GMC brand sold by General Motors to Leo Burnett, part of the Publicis Groupe. But two of the three GMC commercials during the show, for the Acadia crossover, were from Lowe.
 The third GMC spot, for the Yukon hybrid, was created by Burnett. If it seemed familiar, it was also shown during Super Bowl XLII on Feb. 3.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day on Tuesday, about commercials that ran during the Academy Awards show on Sunday, referred incorrectly to ''Killing the Blues,'' a song featured in a commercial for J. C. Penney. Although the recording heard is from a new album by Alison Krauss and Robert Plant, the song itself is not new. (It is by John Prine and has been recorded by many artists.)
The Advertising column in Business Day last Tuesday, about commercials that ran during the Academy Awards show, misidentified the writer of ''Killing the Blues,'' a song featured in a commercial for J. C. Penney. And a correction in this space on Thursday cited another incorrect writer for the song. ''Killing the Blues'' was written by Rowland Salley. It is not by Alison Krauss and Robert Plant, whose version of the song on their new album was heard in the ad. And it is not by John Prine, who recorded it, as did many other arists.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: J. C. Penney's American Living spot seemed similar to Ralph Lauren ads

HEADLINE: McCain Says Prospects May Hinge on Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: ROCKY RIVER, Ohio 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain said Monday that he needed to convince the American people that the troop escalation in Iraq was working and that American casualties there would continue to decline. If he did not, he said, ''I lose'' the election.
 ''Is there any doubt?'' Mr. McCain said to reporters on his campaign bus. 
 But then he pulled back from his blunt assessment. ''Let me not put it that stark,'' he said, explaining that he believed people would judge his candidacy on his ability to handle the economy, which has emerged as a pre-eminent voter concern, as well as on national security.
 Nevertheless, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made clear that he believed his prospects in November would rest in large measure on the way the situation in Iraq played out. 
 ''If I may, I'd like to retract 'I'll lose,' '' he said. ''But I don't think there's any doubt that how they judge Iraq will have a direct relation to their judgment of me.''
 Mr. McCain said he believed opinion was shifting to his point of view, referring to a recent USA Today poll that, he said, showed that ''now the majority of Americans believe the surge is succeeding.'' 
 The USA Today/Gallup poll he was apparently referring to, however, found that not a majority, but 43 percent of Americans believed the troop increase was ''making the situation there better,'' an increase from 22 percent last July. 
 The poll, conducted Feb. 8 to 10, also underscored just how unpopular the war continues to be, with 60 percent saying it was a mistake. 
 Yet the new dynamic in Iraq -- with American casualties plummeting and violence in Baghdad falling to 2005 levels -- has altered the political landscape for Mr. McCain since last summer, when American troop deaths spiked and his candidacy ran aground.
 Mr. McCain has, of course, staked his candidacy on his support for President Bush's escalation strategy, which was unveiled early last year and resulted in more than 30,000 additional troops in Iraq. 
 When Mr. McCain's campaign stalled, he set about reviving it with a ''no surrender'' tour meant to identify him even more closely with the strategy. He invariably cites his early call for assigning more troops to Iraq as evidence of his ability to handle what he calls the ''transcendent challenge'' facing the country in the form of radical, violent Islam. 
 Mr. McCain has continued to paint a far rosier picture than the Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, about military progress in Iraq, as well as political gains. He said Monday that his close friend and supporter Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, had just returned from Iraq, where he flew over Baghdad and counted ''50 soccer games going on.'' 
 ''It's generally quiet,'' Mr. McCain said, ''recognizing there will be suicide bombers for the foreseeable future, just as the Israelis continue to encounter suicide bombers because they're the most difficult thing to counter in warfare.''
 At a town-hall-style meeting here, Mr. McCain also said political progress was being made in Iraq. 
 ''They were wrong, Senator Clinton and Senator Obama, when they said that the surge would fail,'' he said. ''And they were wrong when they said that the political process would not move forward.''
 Mr. McCain pointed to the Iraqi Parliament's recent passage of a budget as a sign of progress, but the major steps toward political reconciliation that the troop increase was supposed to help usher in have not occurred. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama cite that as evidence that the strategy in Iraq is still not succeeding.

HEADLINE: Is That Your Final Question?

 BODY:
Tonight, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will debate in Ohio. It will be the 20th debate, and possibly the last, of the Democratic presidential campaign. Is there anything left to ask? The Op-Ed page asked five experts to pose the questions that they feel have not been answered over the course of more than a year of campaigning. Here's what they would ask the candidates if they were moderating tonight's debate.
 1. Responding to a questionnaire from The Boston Globe on presidential power, you both criticized President Bush's use of signing statements, with which he has asserted a constitutional right to bypass more than 1,000 sections of bills that he has signed into law. You both also said you would continue using signing statements, though in a less aggressive way. 
 But the American Bar Association has called for an end to this practice, and Senator John McCain says he will never issue a signing statement. Why are they wrong? 
 2. Both of you have said the Constitution does not allow a president to detain a citizen without charges as an enemy combatant. But President Bush won court rulings upholding the indefinite detention of two Americans as enemy combatants. Were the courts wrong? Does a president have the authority to interpret the Constitution differently from the judiciary? Would you ever use the court-approved authority to hold a citizen indefinitely as an enemy combatant?
 3. Both of you have said that President Bush cannot attack Iran without first obtaining Congressional authorization for the use of military force. But two Democratic presidents, Harry Truman and Bill Clinton, ordered American forces into extended armed conflicts without Congressional authorization. Did the Korean and Kosovo wars violate the Constitution? Would an attack on Iran be legally different, and if so, how?
 4. Are there any circumstances -- including in matters of detention, surveillance, interrogation and troop deployments -- under which you believe that presidents have the constitutional power as commander in chief to bypass laws in order to take an action they think is necessary to protect national security? 
 5. Proponents of the so-called unitary executive theory argue that the Constitution does not allow Congress to enact statutes that place the actions of executive-branch officials beyond the president's control, such as by giving independent decision-making authority to the head of a regulatory agency. Do you agree?
 -- CHARLIE SAVAGE, a reporter for The Boston Globe and the author of ''Takeover: The Return of the Imperial Presidency and the Subversion of American Democracy.''
 1. Social Security will go into a cash deficit during the next president's prospective second term. Therefore, if elected, you will: a) do nothing and leave growing deficits to your successor; b) cut benefits, eligibility or both, as President Bush tried; c) raise the payroll tax; or d) there is no d. Those are the only options. 
 2. Domestic gun owners kill more Americans each year than terrorists have in total since 2000 (even if you define all American fatalities in Iraq as related to terrorism). Can the homeland be secure when our schools are not? If your answer is no, will you take on the National Rifle Association and work for a gun law with teeth?
 3. Senator Obama, virtually all economists say trade is good for growth, but you have blamed trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement for the loss of American jobs. Do you really think building an economic wall along the Rio Grande will promote a stronger, more resilient American economy, and if so why?
 4. Senator Clinton, will you take on your Wall Street friends and raise the effective income tax on private-equity fund managers and hedge fund managers, who are now taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 percent? Please explain why the richest Americans should pay the lowest taxes.
 5. Senator Obama, you rail against the oil companies, but under the American system of free enterprise, aren't companies supposed to earn a profit -- and even to charge what the market will bear? 
 6. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a president you both have evoked, said Americans need fear only fear itself. Under President Bush, Americans have been told to so fear terrorism that the executive branch has been permitted to snoop on citizens, hijack the powers of Congress and torture foreigners. Do you agree that fear of terrorism has been pushed too far, and if so, what measures would you adopt to return the United States to a more normal civilian life? 
 -- ROGER LOWENSTEIN, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of the forthcoming ''While America Aged.'' 
 1. Both of you have argued for more widespread access to the Internet in schools. Given the recent ''To Read or Not to Read'' report from the National Endowment for the Arts, which revealed a steep decline in reading among young people, and the lack of evidence that computers in the classroom help students learn, wouldn't federal funds be better spent on projects that encourage reading and engagement with the arts? 
 2. The Internet is often praised as a liberating force in American culture, but it has also drawn comparisons to an unruly mob. Would you support a federally financed, long-term study of how our use of this technology is changing our behavior, for good and for ill? 
 3. You have both admitted to being BlackBerry addicts. How has this desire for constant connection and endless information changed your personal relationships and how has it transformed political culture? 
 -- CHRISTINE ROSEN, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a senior editor of The New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society.
 The long advocacy for universal health-care coverage by Democrats has earned a base of public support, but it has also provided an easy focus for political attacks. Although universal coverage will protect businesses and families from unmanageable costs, it will also increase government spending considerably and increase government involvement in health care. 
 The strategy you have adopted as candidates is the same one that Democrats have used for decades without success (including in 1993, when I was a health policy adviser in the first Clinton administration). You have both designed plans that aim to minimize government costs and to minimize changes for Americans with good health coverage, while still constructing a safety net of coverage for the growing millions without insurance.
 This approach, however, inevitably increases the complexity of our Rube Goldberg health system. It has made your policies difficult to explain. It has failed to prevent charges that you are promoting ''socialized medicine.'' And it has cost you the enthusiasm of Americans who want a simpler, tax-based, Medicare-for-all system. 
 How do you persuade supporters of single-payer health care that your proposals are worth fighting for? And how can you assure the rest of us that the costs and complexities of your plans are actually manageable?
 -- ATUL GAWANDE, a general surgeon, a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of ''Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance.''
 1. Senator Obama, as commander in chief an American president must understand the sense of honor that motivates his armed forces. Last September, MoveOn.org ran an advertisement in The Times that mocked Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American commander in Iraq, as ''General Betray Us.'' You chose not to vote on the Senate resolution that condemned the advertisement. Would you still characterize the Senate vote as a ''stunt'' and ''empty politics''? 
 2. Samantha Power, one of Senator Obama's chief foreign policy advisers, strongly criticized the United States in her book ''A Problem From Hell'' for failing to intervene in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and for the three-year delay in intervening in the Bosnian war, until the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
 Saddam Hussein also committed genocide by killing thousands of Iraqi Kurds with chemical weapons in the late 1980s and massacring thousands of Shiite marsh dwellers in southern Iraq after the first gulf war. How could we have left Mr. Hussein in power? How can Senator Obama say that removing a genocidal killer was a ''dumb'' war?
 3. Senator Clinton, you have stated that American troop withdrawals from Iraq will begin as soon as you take office as president. But you also note on your campaign Web site that you will order ''narrow and targeted operations against Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in the region.''
 Isn't that what the surge is about? The United States and local leaders have allied to drive out members of Al Qaeda from Baghdad and other areas. How is your policy any different from the policy of President Bush? 
 4. The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution bars any former president from election to a third term. Is it truly consistent with the spirit of the Constitution to have the same professional couple occupying the White House for 12 years? Isn't this all the more true when Bill Clinton promised that voters would receive, during his first term, ''two for the price of one''?
 -- RUTH WEDGWOOD, a professor of international law and diplomacy at Johns Hopkins, was an adviser to the Rudolph Giuliani campaign.

HEADLINE: Now Boarding Business Class

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
For a long time, low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways have had a reputation for catering to leisure travelers -- in fact, half of Southwest's passengers and 75 percent of JetBlue's customers fit in that category.
 But both airlines have been moving aggressively to capture a bigger share of the lucrative business travel market. 
 For instance, Southwest and JetBlue now offer fully refundable fares, intended to appeal to business travelers with changing schedules. The two are also at the forefront of the stampede to introduce in-flight Internet access this year.
 And Southwest is starting to make its fares available through the computer systems that corporate travel managers use to book tickets. The airline is even starting to negotiate discounted contracts for corporate business, something that was anathema before.
 ''While we have been adamant historically that we would not even consider that, I think there will be some situations in the future where that will make sense,'' said Gary C. Kelly, Southwest's chief executive.
 For its part, JetBlue said it was considering creating enhanced front cabin seating to attract business travelers willing to pay for perks like more legroom. 
 Several of these efforts are receiving a positive reception from industry analysts, business travelers and the managers who make decisions about which carriers employees can or must fly. 
 ''They're moving in the right direction,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group aviation consulting firm, referring to Southwest's strategy to court more corporate fliers. 
 ''To get the business traveler, you need a number of things,'' he said. ''Reliability -- they've got that. Frequency -- in most markets, they've got that.
 ''But you've also got to have a low-anxiety product,'' he added, mentioning that Southwest's seating policy may need some refining.
 Last fall, Southwest, known for its first-come-first-served boarding process, changed that to ensure that those paying the highest ticket prices -- $10 to $30 extra for its ''business select'' fares -- are placed at the front of the line.
 All boarding passes are now numbered so passengers no longer have to line up early, which was a major turn-off to many business travelers already stressed and pressed for time. 
 So far, Southwest is selling an average of two to three business select tickets per flight, Mr. Kelly said, and it aims to earn an additional $100 million a year in incremental revenue from these fares.
 Although Mr. Boyd praised that change, he said that Southwest might have to offer assigned seating or other enhancements to woo the business crowd. He noted, for instance, that JetBlue's wider seats and live television were competitive advantages, compared with major carriers' economy cabins.
 Southwest and JetBlue have also been able to outshine their older competitors in customer service.
 ''JetBlue does not have passengers; they've got groupies,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''They've gotten where they've gotten strictly because of good service.''
 Southwest also had the best on-time record of the 10 largest domestic carriers last year, according to data compiled by the Department of Transportation.
 That is a big reason Joshua White, an accountant in Melville, N.Y., gives Southwest almost all of his business, flying out of MacArthur Airport on Long Island to visit clients about two to three times a month.
 Mr. White also appreciates the new numbered boarding procedure, saying it ''alleviates the panic'' previously associated with lining up for seats. He said he had paid the extra fee for the business select ticket a few times, mostly to get priority boarding on longer flights. 
 ''It's no guarantee of a completely comfortable flight,'' he said. ''But your odds will bump up a bit if you pay the extra money.''
 Corporate travel managers also report an increased receptiveness to low-cost carriers among their clients.
 ''There's definitely a willingness to fly low-cost carriers as they continue to add services,'' said Mary Ellen George, general manager for Advito, a travel management consultant based in Dallas.
 To capture a bigger share of those corporate travel dollars, however, a more important factor may be offering the discounted contracts that businesses have long negotiated with the larger airlines.
 ''Southwest is starting to move into that territory, albeit very slowly,'' said Dale Eastlund, director for the air consulting group at Carlson Wagonlit Travel Associates, a travel management company. ''They've had discussions with companies, but companies are trying to weigh the benefit of a corporate contract with Southwest versus just using them when they offer the lowest fares.''
 Given the current economic climate, price may ultimately dictate which airline business travelers choose to fly.

HEADLINE: South Korean President Pledges Pragmatism

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
After he was sworn in Monday, President Lee Myung-bak pledged to revive South Korea's economy, improve relations with the United States and draw North Korea out of its isolation.
 Mr. Lee, a former mayor of Seoul and a construction industry executive, signaled a departure from a decade of left-leaning rule that yielded breakthroughs in the country's relations with North Korea but strained its alliance with Washington. 
 ''At times over the last 10 years, we found ourselves faltering and confused, but now we will take with us our achievements as well as the lessons that we learned from our failures and start anew,'' Mr. Lee, 66, said during the ceremony. ''We must move from the age of ideology into the age of pragmatism.'' 
 Mr. Lee was sworn into office in an outdoor ceremony in front of the National Assembly here as tens of thousands of guests, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, sat in the bitter cold. 
 As leader of the conservative Grand National Party, Mr. Lee won a landslide victory in December after running a campaign focused almost exclusively on revitalizing the flagging economy. 
 He won despite being dogged by accusations of unsavory business practices; a special prosecutor cleared Mr. Lee, the first South Korean president with a business background, of fraud accusations only last Thursday.
 America's half-century alliance with South Korea had been strained in recent years because of differences over how to deal with North Korea, though the Bush administration's full-fledged negotiations with North Korea in the last year have narrowed those differences. 
 Washington had accused South Korea of coddling North Korea, while South Korea had said that hard-liners in the Bush administration were aggravating tensions with the North.
 Mr. Lee's predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun, maintained that South Korea should play a new role as a ''balancer'' in the great power rivalries in Asia. But Mr. Lee has put the emphasis back on the alliance with the United States.
 ''We will work to develop and further strengthen traditional friendly relations with the United States into a future-oriented partnership,'' Mr. Lee said in his speech. ''Based on the deep mutual trust that exists between the two peoples, we will also strengthen our strategic alliance with the United States.''
 Yoon Duk-min, a senior analyst at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said working relations between the United States and South Korea had already improved greatly since Mr. Lee's election two months ago.
 ''Disagreement over North Korea was always the main obstacle to good relations,'' said Mr. Yoon, who was an adviser on the transition team's committee on foreign affairs. ''But because President Lee Myung-bak's policy toward North Korea is not that different from the Bush administration's current policy, it's created a favorable environment for bilateral relations.''
 In his inaugural speech, Mr. Lee reiterated his willingness to engage North Korea economically as long as it gave up its nuclear program. Unlike Mr. Roh, who always emphasized that North Korea was a small country that felt threatened by the outside world, Mr. Lee placed the onus on North Korea to act.
 ''Once North Korea abandons its nuclear program and chooses the path to openness, we can expect to see a new horizon in inter-Korean cooperation,'' Mr. Lee said, adding that he was willing to help North Korea raise its per capita income to $3,000 from about $900 within 10 years.
 Considered a moderate in his party, Mr. Lee, unlike some South Korean conservatives, does not call for removing the Communist government or Communist leadership in Pyongyang and is not expected to emphasize human rights violations in the North. During the transition, he signaled that he would take a harder line on the North by eliminating the Ministry of Unification, which critics consider soft on the North, but eventually decided to keep it.
 Like his left-leaning predecessors, Mr. Lee said policy toward the North should ''prepare the foundation for unification.'' But unlike his predecessors, experts said, Mr. Lee does not believe that improving relations with North Korea alone will lead to peace on the peninsula and eventual reunification. 
 In his speech, after singling out the United States, Mr. Lee mentioned the importance of building closer ties with China, Russia and Japan.
 ''For the last 10 years, South Korea's foreign policy goals, whether it was denuclearization or peace, focused almost exclusively on North Korea, while relations with other countries in the region were underestimated,'' said Kim Tae-woo, a security expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.
 ''That will change,'' said Mr. Kim, who was also an adviser on the transition team's committee on foreign affairs. ''President Lee Myung-bak realizes that those goals can't be accomplished through bilateral relations with North Korea alone.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S SUPPORT GROWS BROADER, NEW POLL FINDS

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and DALIA SUSSMAN; Marjorie Connelly, Megan Thee and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the past two months, Senator Barack Obama has built a commanding coalition among Democratic voters, with especially strong support among men, and is now viewed by most Democrats as the candidate best able to beat Senator John McCain in the general election, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 After 40 Democratic primaries and caucuses, capped by a winning streak in 11 contests over the last two weeks, Mr. Obama has made substantial gains across most major demographic groups in the Democratic Party, including men and women, liberals and moderates, higher and lower income voters, and those with and without college degrees.
 But there are signs of vulnerability for Mr. Obama, of Illinois, in this national poll: While he has a strong edge among Democratic voters on his ability to unite and inspire the country, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is still viewed by more Democrats as prepared for the job of president. And while he has made progress among women, he still faces a striking gender gap: Mr. Obama is backed by two-thirds of the Democratic men and 45 percent of the women, who are equally divided in their support between the two candidates. White women remain a Clinton stronghold. 
 When all voters are asked to look ahead to the general election, Mr. McCain is more likely to be seen as prepared for the presidency, able to handle an international crisis and equipped to serve as commander in chief than either of the Democratic candidates.
 Even so, the poll provides a snapshot of Mr. Obama's strength after this first, frenzied round of primaries and caucuses, which knocked seven of the nine Democratic candidates out of the race. For the first time in a Times/CBS poll, he moved ahead of Mrs. Clinton nationally, with 54 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they wanted to see him nominated, while 38 percent preferred Mrs. Clinton. A USA Today/Gallup Poll released Monday showed a similar result, 51 percent for Mr. Obama to 39 percent for Mrs. Clinton.
 These national polls are not predictive of the Democratic candidates' standings in individual states, notably Ohio and Texas, which hold the next primaries, on March 4. Most recent polls there show a neck-and-neck race in Texas and Mrs. Clinton with a lead in Ohio; her campaign advisers say that if she prevails next Tuesday the race will begin anew.
 Mark Penn, the chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, said the polls ''reflect momentum from Senator Obama's recent wins,'' and ''will snap back if we are successful in Ohio and Texas.'' He added that other national polls showed a far closer race. Bill Burton, spokesman for the Obama campaign, said, ''As we've made our case for change across the country, people have responded.''
 The Times/CBS poll shows that Mr. Obama's coalition -- originally derided by critics as confined to upper-income reformers, young people and blacks -- has broadened significantly. In December, for example, he had the support of 26 percent of the male Democratic primary voters; in the latest poll, that had climbed to 67 percent.
 ''He's from Illinois, and I'm from Illinois, and he reminds me of Abraham Lincoln,'' said Dylan Jones, 53, a laborer from Oxford, N.C., who was interviewed in a follow-up to the poll. ''I can see him out there splitting rails. I don't have anything against Hillary Clinton, so I guess it's because he's new blood.''
 Similarly, Mr. Obama's support among those with household incomes under $50,000 rose to 48 percent from 35 percent since December. His support among moderates rose to 59 percent from 28 percent. In contrast, Mrs. Clinton's strength among Democratic men dropped to 28 percent from 42 percent in December; her support among voters in households making under $50,000 held stable.
 Even among women, Mr. Obama made strides. He had the support of 19 percent of white women in December and 40 percent in the most recent poll. White women, however, remain Mrs. Clinton's most loyal base of support -- 51 percent backed the senator from New York, statistically unchanged from the 48 percent who backed her in December.
 ''I like them both,'' said Ann Powers, 64, a coordinator for special education programs in Fort Dodge, Iowa. ''I just think he is too inexperienced and she's dealt with more in the last 20 years.'' The national telephone poll of 1,115 registered voters was conducted Feb. 20-24. It included 427 Democratic primary voters and 327 Republican primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters, plus or minus five percentage points for Democratic voters and plus or minus five percentage points for Republican voters.
 The poll showed Republicans settling in with their likely nominee. Eight in 10 said they would be satisfied if Mr. McCain won their party's nomination, although just 3 in 10 said they would be very satisfied. Nearly 9 in 10 said he was prepared for the presidency, and more than 8 in 10 said they had confidence in his ability to deal with an international crisis, while a remarkable 96 percent said he would likely make an effective commander in chief.
 But misgivings remain among those who describe themselves as conservative Republicans, with a majority saying his positions on the issues are not conservative enough.
 On the Democratic side, primary voters indicated they saw few substantive differences between their candidates on issues like the war in Iraq and health care. Most have confidence in both candidates to handle the economy, the war in Iraq and an international crisis. And large numbers think it is likely that either candidate would make an effective commander in chief.
 Mr. Obama's advantages are more apparent on other measures. Nearly 6 in 10 said he had the best chance of beating Mr. McCain, double the numbers that believed Mrs. Clinton was more electable. He is also viewed by more Democratic voters as someone who can bring about ''real change'' and is willing to compromise with Republicans ''the right amount'' to get things done. 
 Democratic voters are also more likely to say Mr. Obama cares a lot about them, inspires them and can unite the country. Sixty-three percent of Democratic voters said he cared a lot about them, while fewer than half thought Mrs. Clinton did. Nearly seven in 10 said he inspired them about the future of the country; 54 percent said Mrs. Clinton did. Three-quarters said he would be able to unite the country as president; 53 percent said Mrs. Clinton would.
 Mrs. Clinton also has her strengths: Her supporters are, in general, more committed; nearly 8 in 10 of Mrs. Clinton's backers said they strongly favored her, while 6 in 10 of Mr. Obama's supporters strongly favored him. Only 18 percent of her supporters backed her with reservations; about a third of Mr. Obama's supporters said they had reservations about their candidate.
 Democratic women are also more likely to say that the news media have been harder on Mrs. Clinton than on other candidates: 56 percent felt that way, compared with 39 percent of Democratic men. Both men and women were more likely to think the news media has been harder on Mrs. Clinton than on Mr. Obama.
 Not surprisingly, Democratic primary voters had an opinion on the appropriate role of the 795 superdelegates who could determine the party's nominee. More than half said that these party leaders should vote for the candidate who received the most votes in the primaries and caucuses.

HEADLINE: More Homes Fail to Sell, And Prices Slide Further

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The backlog of unsold homes continued to pile up in January, a sign that home prices will continue to drop as would-be buyers hold out for better deals. 
 Sales of previously owned homes fell for the sixth consecutive month, dropping 0.4 percent, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. While the decline was less than forecast, the sales pace is the slowest since the survey began nearly a decade ago. The median home price dipped to $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year ago.
At the current sales rate, it would take 10.3 months to sell off the inventory of unsold homes. ''That's enormous,'' said Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR. ''That's double the normal amount and well above where we were a year ago.''
 In a research note, Mr. Shapiro said that inventories might actually be higher ''if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices.'' 
 Economists see little relief in the months ahead, as a combination of tighter lending standards, the softening job market and elevated inventories keep buyers on the sidelines.
 ''Home sales have not hit bottom yet,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''Prices haven't declined enough to stimulate enough demand for sales to turn up.''
 Weak demand is likely to put more pressure on homeowners to lower their asking price, extending one of the worst slumps in the history of the housing industry. The median price of an American single-family home fell in 2007 for the first time in at least four decades, and sales of those homes dipped 13 percent last year, the biggest annual decline in a quarter-century.
 Sales of single-family homes actually ticked up in January, but the rise was offset by a plunge in sales of condominiums and apartments. Median prices fell in both categories.
 Still, there were a few positive points in the report. Economists had predicted a steeper drop-off in sales, and purchasing figures were revised up for the last five months. The December sales estimate was raised to a 4.91 million annual rate. The Northeast had the steepest declines in January, with sales falling 3.6 percent, but in the Midwest sales rose by 3.4 percent.

HEADLINE: New Worries On Inflation And Homes

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Houses are getting cheaper by the month. Everything else is becoming more expensive.
 Several economic reports released on Tuesday provided fresh evidence that the economic pain of a prolonged slump in housing is being compounded by the rising cost of oil, food, clothes and other goods. Not surprisingly, a measure of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in nearly five years. 
 In addition to squeezing American homeowners, the confluence of falling home prices and accelerating inflation is putting policy makers in an increasingly tough position. If they move aggressively to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy, they risk fueling inflation further at a time consumers are already strained. But if they fail to act boldly, the economy could weaken faster.
 ''The Fed is now having to walk a very fine line,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in bonds. ''We have clearly seen an acceleration in inflation pressure in the last couple of months and the risk is that the markets are going to react negatively to aggressive easing going forward.'' 
 Nonetheless, the stock market rebounded from an early decline on Tuesday to close up for the day. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent, to 1,381.29, and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 114.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,684.92. 
 Energy and technology stocks led the market higher after oil prices surged above $100 again and I.B.M. announced that it would buy back $15 billion of its stock and raised its profit forecast. 
 In the bond market, investors snapped up inflation-protected Treasuries, indicating that they were worried about higher prices. The yield on the 10-year inflation-protected note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 1.407 percent from 1.507.
 The dollar fell to $1.4967 against the euro, its lowest level since that currency was created. It was also trading near long-term lows against other major world currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars. 
 A widely followed index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas fell by 9.1 percent in December from the month a year ago. Using a three-month moving average, the index, the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller, is falling at an annual pace of more than 20 percent. The index tracks repeat sales of single-family homes; it does not include condominiums.
 Another index of home prices that covers more of the country but does not track loans above $417,000 fell 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the period in 2006. The index, compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, showed prices declining in all states, except Maine.
 The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices, which exclude taxes and distribution costs, rose 1 percent in January, in contrast to a drop of 0.3 percent in December 2007. Compared with a year ago, prices were up 7.4 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, which are more volatile from month to month, the index increased 2.3 percent from a year ago, up from 2 percent in December.
 The latest inflation report appears to corroborate a broader trend of higher prices. 
 Last week, the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 4.3 percent last month from a year ago, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in December. The core rate of inflation -- which excludes food and energy -- was 2.5 percent, up from 2.4 percent. The Fed's target for inflation is 1 percent to 2 percent.
 ''The pressures are too great here,'' said Seth B. Plunkett, a bond portfolio manager at American Century Investments, a mutual fund company. ''Look at the things that are accelerating: food and energy. What is decelerating? It's electronics and light trucks. These are not things that people buy every day.''
 The drumbeat of negative economic data appears to be taking a toll on consumers -- at least in the way they perceive the economy, if not in how they spend. 
 The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to a reading of 75 this month, from 87.9 last month. The index was last at this level in early 2003, at the start of the war in Iraq and a time when the economy was growing but the unemployment rate was hovering just below 6 percent. By contrast, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in January.
 ''The reality is that the consumer is the driver for the U.S. economy,'' said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''Consumers are overspent and heavy in debt.''
 The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to 3 percent, from 5.25 percent in September, in an effort to offset the drag from the housing market on the broader economy. Its efforts have helped reduce some strains in the financial markets but they have been less successful in lowering borrowing costs and easing lending standards for businesses and consumers.
 On Tuesday, the vice chairman of the Fed, Donald L. Kohn, said in a speech that at least some of the increase in borrowing costs was ''a healthy correction to previous excesses.'' He also asserted that the problems in housing and the financial system pose a greater threat to the economy than inflation.
 ''In my view, the adverse dynamics of the financial markets and the economy have presented the greater threat to economic welfare in the United States,'' he said, according to his prepared remarks.
 In the last several weeks, mortgage interest rates have risen sharply as bond investors have grown more risk-averse. The national average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.04 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, from a low of 5.48 percent in mid-January when the Fed cut rates in between its regular meetings.
 ''The phone was ringing off the hook, everyone wanted to shop mortgages and rates,'' D. Ritch Workman, president of the Florida Mortgage Brokers Association, said about the low rates. ''By the time they got around to picking a lender it was too late and those rates were gone.'' 
 Economists say home prices will remain under pressure for much of the next year or longer because the supply of homes for sale remains high. It has also become harder for home buyers to get mortgages as rates have risen and banks have become more conservative in demanding bigger down payments than they did during the housing boom.
 In many parts of the country, specialists note that home prices remain too high based on affordability calculations made using incomes and interest rates. A recent report by analysts at Credit Suisse, the investment bank, said that prices in some metropolitan areas like Phoenix, Miami and Los Angeles would have to decline by 20 percent to 40 percent from their current levels for home affordability to be restored to its long-established level.
 Mr. Leamer noted there was a silver lining to the steeper drop in home prices at the end of last year: it will eventually allow people who are currently renting to buy properties and help clear out the large number of homes that are on sale now.
 ''The question is, Are you going to get the bad news week after week for 10 years?'' he asked. ''Or are you going to get the bad news right this year and then you'll learn to live with the reality that your home is not worth what it was?''

HEADLINE: Russia Quietly Starts to Shift Its Oil Trade Into Rubles

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Americans surely found little to celebrate when the price of oil settled above $100 a barrel last week. 
 They could, though, be thankful that oil is still priced in dollars, making the milestone of triple-digit oil prices noteworthy at all. 
 Russia, the world's second-largest oil-exporting nation after Saudi Arabia, has been quietly preparing to switch trading in Russian Ural Blend oil, the country's primary export, to the ruble from the dollar. Industry analysts and officials, however, say that this change, if it comes, is still some time off. 
 The Russian effort began modestly this month, with trading in refined products for the domestic market. 
 Still, the effort to squeeze the dollar out of Russian oil sales is yet another project notable for swagger and ambition by the Kremlin, which has already wielded its energy wealth to assert influence in Eastern Europe and former Soviet states. 
 ''They are serious,'' said Yaroslav Lissovolik, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Moscow. ''This is something they are giving priority to.'' 
 Oil trading is nearly always denominated in dollars. When Middle Eastern oil is sold to Asia, for example, the price is set in dollars. 
 Similarly, Russia's large trade with Western Europe and the former Soviet states in crude oil and natural gas is conducted in dollar-denominated contracts. Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, set the price of gas in Ukraine at $179 per 1,000 cubic meters in 2008, for example. There are no proposals yet to switch gas pricing away from dollars. 
 As a result, companies and countries that buy petroleum products are encouraged to hold dollar reserves to pay for their supplies, coincidentally helping the American economy support its trade deficit. 
 Russia would like to change this practice, at least among its customers, as a means of elevating the importance of the ruble, a new source of national pride after gaining 30 percent against the dollar during the current oil boom. 
 In a speech on economic policy this month, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a deputy prime minister and the likely successor to President Vladimir V. Putin in elections on March 2, said Russia should seize opportunities created by the weak dollar. 
 ''Today, the global economy is going through uneasy times,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''The role of the key reserve currencies is under review. And we must take advantage of it.'' He asserted that ''the ruble will de facto become one of the regional reserve currencies.''
 Other oil-exporting countries are also chafing at dealing in the weakening dollar. 
 Since 2005, Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, has tried to open a commodity exchange to trade oil in currencies other than the dollar. The Iranian ambassador to Russia said Iran might choose rubles to free his country from ''dollar slavery.'' 
 To be sure, some economists have dismissed the project as improbable, given the exotic nature of a security -- oil futures contracts denominated in rubles -- that would blend currency risk with the dollar-based global oil market. 
 Ruble-denominated futures contracts for Ural Blend, the main Russian grade, would be attractive only if the dollar continues to depreciate, said Vitaly Y. Yermakov, research director for Russian and Caspian energy at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
 ''There is a big distance between the desire to trade commodities for rubles and the ability to do so,'' he said. 
 All this has not stopped the Kremlin from trying. 
 In a sign of the government's seriousness, a new glass-and-marble high-rise home for a ruble-denominated commodity exchange is rising this spring in a prestigious district in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city after Moscow. The exchange will occupy three floors of the 16-story tower on Vasilievsky Island, one of the islands that make up the historic city center. 
 The director of the St. Petersburg exchange, Viktor V. Nikolayev, said that the intention was to move slowly and gain market acceptance; the government will not strong-arm sellers or buyers onto the exchange, even in an industry dominated by the state. 
 Web-based trading for refined products like gasoline or diesel is being introduced in three phases for domestic customers, beginning with government buyers like the Russian navy or municipal bus companies. Private brokers will be allowed to trade in March; futures contracts will be introduced in April. 
 Mr. Nikolayev said no timeline had been established for trading for export on the exchange, which also handles grain, sugar, mineral fertilizer, cement and esoteric financial products like Russian government beef and pork import quotas -- all in rubles. 
 ''We are in Russia, and the currency is rubles, not euros, not dollars,'' he said. ''We don't want to depend on the rise or fall of the dollar.'' 
 ''We will trade in rubles, to strengthen the ruble,'' he said.

HEADLINE: GAS PRICES SOAR, POSING A THREAT TO FAMILY BUDGET

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Cleveland.

 BODY:
Gasoline prices, which for months lagged behind the big run-up in the price of oil, are suddenly rising quickly, with some experts saying they could approach $4 a gallon by spring. Diesel is hitting new records daily, and oil settled at a record high of $100.88 a barrel on Tuesday.
 The increases could not come at a worse time for the economy. With growth slowing, energy increases that were once easily absorbed by consumers are now more likely to act as a drag on household budgets, leaving people with less money to spend elsewhere. These costs could worsen the nation's economic woes, piling a fresh energy shock on top of the turmoil in credit and housing.
 ''The effect of high oil prices today could be the difference between having a recession and not having a recession,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist. 
 The depth of the nation's economic problems became clearer Tuesday with the release of figures showing that prices at the producer level rose 1 percent in January from December, driven in large measure by energy costs. Compared with a year ago, prices were up 7.4 percent, the worst producer price inflation in the United States since 1981. 
 Other new figures showed that home prices around the country are falling at an accelerating pace, suggesting no end is in sight for the housing slump. 
 As of Tuesday, regular gasoline was selling at a nationwide average of $3.14 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club, up from $2.35 a year ago. The price has jumped 19 cents a gallon in two weeks.
 Energy specialists predict that, as demand picks up further this spring and summer, retail prices will surpass the high of $3.23 a gallon set last Memorial Day weekend. That high fell short of the inflation-adjusted record of $3.40 in today's money that was set in 1981.
 On Tuesday, diesel prices rose to a record $3.60 a gallon, compared with $2.62 a gallon last year.
 For a decade, rising oil prices failed to dent global economic growth. In the United States, consumers absorbed the higher costs because of easy credit and rising prosperity, while in developing countries, government subsidies helped ease the pain. The rise in energy prices was a result of growing demand around the world.
 The price of oil has quadrupled in six years, and the close Tuesday was not far below the inflation-adjusted high set in April 1980, after the Iranian revolution. That record, $39.50 a barrel, equals $103.76 in today's money.
 As oil prices spiked last fall, low wintertime gasoline demand helped keep prices in check. But now, experts say, the price of oil is finally showing up at the pump.
 For ordinary Americans like Phyllis Berry, a 31-year-old factory worker for General Motors in Cleveland, gasoline costs are starting to hurt.
 ''I used to fill it up pretty regularly, but now I drive it until the tank is almost empty, looking for the cheapest place to buy gas,'' said Ms. Berry, who drives a beat-up Dodge Caravan. 
 She said that she used to take her four children to the movies four or five times a month. But with the cost of gas, tickets, popcorn and soda adding up to $70, they now go only once a month. 
 Still, things are not quite as bad as during the 1970s and 1980s oil shocks. In the early 1980s, at the height of the last energy crisis, energy accounted for about 8 percent of household spending. As prices fell and the economy became less energy-intensive, energy costs fell under 4 percent of household spending in the early 1990s.
 With the run-up in prices in recent years, economists say energy's share of disposable income is slowly creeping up again. In December, that figure reached 6.1 percent, the highest level since 1985. The increase of two percentage points -- amounting to $200 billion -- is a huge sum, a little less than half what Americans spend each year on new cars and automobile parts.
 ''You're adding an oil shock on top of a crunch on credit and a housing collapse,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight. ''Even the U.S. economy cannot withstand all of that at the same time.'' 
 American consumers have responded belatedly by cutting back on their energy use. Oil demand in the United States grew by just 0.4 percent in 2007 and is expected to be flat in 2008. 
 But global oil demand, the relentless driver behind higher prices, is still expected to increase by 1.4 million barrels a day this year, analysts estimate. That growth, from China and the Middle East, may help keep prices up, whatever happens to the American economy. 
 According to the latest forecast by the Energy Department, gasoline prices should peak near $3.40 a gallon this spring.
 But many analysts consider the government's forecast conservative, foreseeing a sharper spike as refiners come out of the seasonal maintenance period and start producing summer-grade gasoline in March and April.
 ''We've gone this high without the normal summer dynamics,'' said Tom Kloza, publisher and chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. ''That's when I think we will have the big jump -- of 50 cents to 75 cents a gallon.''
 Mr. Kloza said he expected gasoline to peak around $3.50 to $3.75 a gallon nationwide. Geoff Sundstrom, AAA's spokesman, echoed that view and added that gas at $4 a gallon is possible this summer. ''We've gone from a worrying situation for gasoline to one that is quite alarming,'' Mr. Sundstrom said.
 Oil prices are unlikely to drop anytime soon, analysts said. Barclays Capital recently increased its long-term prediction, saying prices could reach $137 a barrel in 2015, up from a previous target of $93 a barrel.
 ''The remorseless move up in long-run prices has not yet fully played out,'' Barclays analysts said in a note to investors. 
 While demand keeps growing, producers are struggling to catch up. They are not replacing the oil they are pumping out of the ground fast enough because of restrictions on access to fields, as well as rising costs. Meanwhile, demand in China, India and the Middle East is expected to push oil consumption up by more than one million barrels a day, each year, for the next decade.
 ''An oil crisis is coming in the next 10 years,'' John B. Hess, the chairman of the Hess Corporation, said at a recent conference held by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''It's not a matter of demand. It's not a matter of supplies. It's both.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Among Countries Investigating Tax Evasion

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; Sarah Plass contributed reporting.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Following the lead of Germany and Britain, at least eight other countries, including the United States, said Tuesday that they were investigating whether some of their citizens were using banks in Liechtenstein to evade taxes. 
 The countries involved in the investigations also threw their combined weight behind efforts to change banking secrecy rules in Liechtenstein, a principality nestled between Austria and Switzerland that has a thriving business in managing outsiders' money.
 German prosecutors, aided by stolen bank records, began their crackdown nearly two weeks ago, when the police searched the home of a prominent German executive. 
 Since then, 91 of the 150 people being investigated so far have confessed to evading taxes, the prosecutors said, and 72 people have turned themselves in without a visit from the authorities.
 Targets in the inquiry have already paid 27.8 million euros, or $41.5 million, to begin settling their cases, and German prosecutors made clear Tuesday that they expected to collect much more before their investigation is over.
 ''At the moment, this sum is rising daily,'' one prosecutor, Hans-Ulrich Kruck, said in a brief statement in Bochum, Germany. ''We have already been notified of more voluntary payments.''
 The investigation goes back to 2006, when German intelligence services paid nearly 5 million euros for confidential banking data to an informant, apparently a former employee of the LGT Group, a Liechtenstein bank. 
 Later, the British authorities paid money to the same person for data on British subjects who had sheltered money in Liechtenstein, and they are investigating about 100 people in Britain, according to an official close to the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing. 
 Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden are also looking into tax evasion by their citizens in Liechtenstein, according to statements from Britain and other countries.
 The Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday that it was beginning enforcement action against ''more than 100 U.S. taxpayers'' on suspicion of evading taxes through investments in Liechtenstein. The I.R.S. was approached last year by an informant with data from the LGT Group, said Barry Shott, deputy commissioner for international affairs in the agency's large and medium-size business division.
 ''We get information from a lot of people in a lot of different ways all the time,'' said Mr. Shott, who did not identify the informant. ''We came into possession of the information and it seemed to be interesting.''
 He stressed that the United States did not pay for the information upfront. But he noted that under federal law, a person who gives the I.R.S. useful information can file a claim to receive a percentage of the money that is collected based on the data.
 Audits in the United States have gotten under way, and the I.R.S. is already experiencing ''a range of cooperation'' with the taxpayers involved, Mr. Shott said. He stressed that the I.R.S. would look favorably on people who report themselves, but that the agency would go to them if necessary.
 ''We know who they are,'' he said.
 Other countries have long sought to pressure Liechtenstein to adopt rules of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development aimed at curbing tax evasion. The organization, based in Paris, has called Liechtenstein, Monaco and Andorra ''uncooperative tax havens.''
 Dave Hartnett, acting chairman of Revenue and Customs, the British tax agency, said in a statement, ''In the light of recent developments involving Liechtenstein bank accounts, there needs to be a significant move toward full implementation of O.E.C.D. standards on transparency and effective exchange of information in tax matters.'' 
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, said last weekend that Germany would also push for change in other countries, including Switzerland, Luxembourg and Austria. 
 Those countries have agreed to limited efforts directed by the European Union to provide account information or tax revenue, and Germany is pressing for further action. Germany plans to raise the issue at a meeting of finance ministers from the 27-nation European Union next week, and with Prince Albert II of Monaco, who is visiting Berlin this week.
 ''Liechtenstein is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Grace Perez-Navarro, deputy director of the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the O.E.C.D. ''They are interested in seeing change in other places, too.''
 Fears that Germany and other countries might mount a sustained effort to curb investments in Switzerland have prompted sharp reactions in that country, a well-known destination for money from around the world.
 Michel Y. Derobert, head of the Swiss Private Bankers Association, said that disclosures that Germany's spy agency was involved in obtaining data on its citizens from abroad sat uneasily with his members.
 ''I think this type of episode will discourage German-speaking banks from hiring Germans,'' Mr. Derobert told the newspaper Le Matin in Switzerland. ''That would be logical, although until now we have had good relations with Germany.''
 The Munich newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported Tuesday that German prosecutors had trained their sights on Vontobel Treuhand, the Liechtenstein subsidiary of the prominent Swiss bank Vontobel.
 The prosecutors in Bochum confirmed Tuesday that they believed ''a second foreign bank'' -- in addition to LGT -- had helped Germans evade taxes, but did not identify it.
 Vontobel said Tuesday that no client data from its Liechtenstein affiliate had been ''obtained unlawfully or used for improper purposes.''
 LGT, which is owned by the royal family of Liechtenstein, said Sunday that the data obtained by the German authorities covered 1,400 clients, 600 of whom are German citizens.
 The information is thought to have been taken by a former employee, Heinrich Kieber, who offered it to at least two European countries, Germany and Britain.
 The data was from LGT Treuhand, a subsidiary of the bank that specializes in setting up foundations, where money can be sheltered and then invested without reporting capital gains to governments outside Liechtenstein. German prosecutors said Tuesday their investigation involved more than 200 million euros that had been put in such foundations.
 After Germany and Britain obtained their data, authorities began sharing it, according to another official close to the investigation, since a network of tax treaties foresees just such a step. Torsten Albig, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, said Monday that Germany would share the information, and the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, said he had already requested it from the Germans.
 Eric Woerth, the French budget minister, said France was scouring a list of hundreds of names.

HEADLINE: Profit Rises at Macy's and Falls at Target

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The department store company Macy's said Tuesday that lower costs sent fourth-quarter profit up more than analysts had expected, while Target reported that its sales declined. 
 Net income at Macy's rose 2.3 percent, to $750 million, or $1.73 a share, on a tax benefit and lower costs to integrate former May Department Stores locations. At Target, profit fell 8.1 percent, to $1.03 billion, or $1.23 a share. 
 The results underscored an erosion of confidence among American consumers as the outlook for the job market dimmed and fuel and food prices soared. 
 Macy's margins improved as a percentage of sales, helping profit beat analysts' estimates by 4 cents a share. Earnings were also helped by a tax benefit of 18 cents a share.
 Integration costs at Macy's, which is based in Cincinnati, dropped by more than half, to $69 million in the quarter. The retailer acquired the May stores in 2005 for $11 billion.
 Macy's is in the process of shutting nine stores before March and also is combining regional divisions. The moves will eliminate almost 3,200 jobs.
 Macy's shares climbed $1.76, or 7.1 percent, to $26.52, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 At Target, customers bought food and pharmacy items and cut back on discretionary goods.
 Target ''has clearly felt the impact of the economic slowdown in 2007,'' the chief financial officer, Douglas A. Scovanner, told analysts in a conference call. The retailer ''continues to expect a soft sales environment going into 2008.''
 Earnings were helped by Target's credit card operations, where profit before taxes climbed 12 percent, to $137 million.
 Twenty analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that the company, which is based in Minneapolis, would earn $1.22 a share.
 Target shares rose $1.64, or 3.1 percent, to $54.89.

HEADLINE: Getting Real About the Rescue

 BODY:
Some big banks are supporting new proposals to rescue homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, but let's get one thing straight: the banks haven't been struck by a sudden urge to help the needy. Rather, by advocating bailouts, the lending industry is trying to head off a possible change in the law that would let troubled borrowers modify their mortgages in bankruptcy court -- where lenders, not taxpayers, would be stuck with the losses. 
 Congress must not kowtow to the lenders. It should insist that borrowers be given a chance to modify their mortgages under bankruptcy court protection before it even thinks of asking taxpayers to pick up the tab for the mortgage mess. Under current law, borrowers cannot rework the mortgages on primary homes in bankruptcy proceedings. Senate Democratic leaders are pushing a bill to let many at-risk homeowners do just that. The House Judiciary Committee has passed a similar measure. Republicans, who are balking, should get on board, or risk leaving their constituents without an effective way to save their homes. 
 If the bankruptcy provision becomes law, as it should, lenders will have a powerful incentive -- which they currently do not have -- to modify troubled loans voluntarily. If they can't or won't come to new terms with borrowers, then they would run the risk that a bankruptcy court would do the modifying for them. 
 So far, despite a lot of promises, the industry has been unable or unwilling to rework the junk loans of the bubble years in ways that come near addressing the enormity of the problem. In contrast, access to bankruptcy court would mean relief for some 600,000 homeowners -- not by wiping out their debts, but by modifying the loan terms so borrowers can pay them off over time. 
 Lenders object that by giving homeowners the right to modify their mortgages under court supervision, the bankruptcy amendment would raise the cost of mortgages for everyone, forever. That concern is surely overstated, but not entirely without merit. To address it and other industry worries, lawmakers have proposed constraints, such as limiting the bankruptcy relief to junk mortgages of the past few years. 
 The bankruptcy amendment has another virtue: it could bolster a worthy rescue idea floated recently by the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, one of the nation's bank regulators. The idea is that if lenders voluntarily agree to loan modifications, they would become entitled to a share of the house's appreciation, if any, when the house is ultimately sold. 
 Like other Bush administration plans, this one suffers from its emphasis on voluntary cooperation, which has been shown to be inadequate. The bankruptcy amendment, however, would give lenders more incentive to go along, by providing a real downside to not acting voluntarily -- losing control to a bankruptcy judge. 
 In the end, taxpayer-funded bailout proposals may make sense, but only if other prudent measures have been exhausted. That has not happened yet. There are two good, complementary ideas on the table -- the carrot for lenders offered up by the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the stick provided by the bankruptcy amendment. Congress and the Bush administration should move forward quickly on both of them.

HEADLINE: Small and Midsize U.S. Banks Beginning to Struggle in Credit Crisis

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The credit crisis is tightening the screws on thousands of small to midsize banks across the United States, squeezing local builders and businesses that depend on those lenders for financing.
 Losses are mounting so rapidly at some of these banks that a small number of them, perhaps 50 out of the 7,500 nationwide, could fail over the next 12 to 18 months, analysts said. Some of the others are likely to shut branches or seek out mergers as the weakening economy strains their finances. 
 Small lenders are in far less danger than they were during the 1980s and early 1990s, when roughly 1,600 federally insured institutions failed during a savings and loan crisis. And unlike many bigger banks, they shied away from complex mortgage-linked investments and subprime home loans. 
 But the breadth and depth of the current troubles have caught bank executives by surprise. 
 Federal regulators are particularly concerned about the exposure of smaller banks to the commercial real estate market, which has begun to soften in some parts of the country. 
 ''There were people in denial six to nine months ago,'' said Keith D. Maio, the president of the National Bank of Arizona in Phoenix, a small bank owned by the Zions Bancorporation based in Salt Lake City. ''I don't know if anybody is in denial anymore.''
 Federal regulators concerned about the health of the industry are stepping up regular bank examinations and forcing some lenders to bolster reserves. During the last four years, just four United States banks have failed. 
 Stock market investors see trouble brewing. Shares of small banks have tumbled in recent months, with the Standard & Poor's midcap regional banking index sinking 20 percent from a year ago. 
 ''The megabanks get all the headlines,'' said Jaret Seiberg, a research analyst for the Stanford Group, a private wealth management and banking firm. ''But this is causing a lot of trouble for the industry and it is going to persist for the next few years.''
 Small banks have been losing business to larger rivals for years. Big banks have muscled them aside in the credit card and home mortgage businesses. In response, many small and midsize banks, typically defined as those with assets ranging from less than $1 billion and $20 billion, pushed into construction and commercial lending, betting that their local knowledge of markets would give them an edge. 
 The strategy paid off, delivering years of strong profit growth. But now, as real estate and construction loans sour, small lenders are starting to see their balance sheets pinched.
 Mark T. Fitzgibbon, the director for research at Sandler O'Neil & Partners, said losses at smaller lenders might ultimately reach $105 billion, or 15 percent of what he projected could be $700 billion of losses industrywide. 
 ''The real estate problem has gotten worse and more pervasive, more rapidly,'' Mr. Fitzgibbon said. The rapid decline in home prices in areas like Florida and Southern California is just the start. ''I think you will see that spread to other parts of the country soon,'' he said.
 Already, residential construction lending is running into trouble. As new homes have become harder to sell, developers are falling behind on payments, and are no longer seeking new loans. 
 For all public banks, the late loan payment rate rose in the fourth quarter to 4.11 percent of the total, up 76 percent from the third quarter and 142 percent from the first three months of 2007, according to a Stanford Group analysis. 
 And the problems are likely to get worse. Some home builders are rapidly drawing down so-called interest reserves, the extra cash cushion built into a loan that is intended to protect banks by ensuring that borrowers can pay back interest. Reserves for loans for construction projects that started before the credit crisis will start running out in the next six months. Small business loans could be next. 
 ''We are seeing an uptick in nonperforming loans to small businesses -- the local retail stores, service providers, dentists, vets -- but off of historically low rates.'' said Steven D. Fritts, associate director for risk management policy for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Federal banking regulators are particularly concerned about small banks' exposure to commercial real estate. 
 In the last six years at community banks, the ratio of commercial real estate loans to capital, a measure regulators use to monitor loan exposure, nearly doubled to a record 285 percent, according to data from the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Nearly a third of all community banks exceed 100 percent of their capital. 
 Granted, most banks report that their loan portfolios are holding up and actual delinquencies remain near all-time lows. But over all, the number of borrowers falling behind is growing. 
 Timothy W. Long, head of supervision for midsize and community banks at the office of the comptroller, said regulators were monitoring lenders closely. He said the industry had not experienced this tough a period in years. 
 ''I would tell you a lot of bankers out there have never had a loan charged off,'' Mr. Long said. ''The last time we went through this, the loan officers were in junior high.'' 

GRAPHIC: GRAPH: SMALL BANKS, BIG EXPOSURE: As big banks moved aggressively into the credit card and mortgage businesses, smaller banks went into construction and commercial lending. A result is that many small banks have heavy exposure to commercial real estate relative to their capital levels, which is now drawing scrutiny from regulators.

HEADLINE: There Will Be Floods

BYLINE: By ALEX PRUD'HOMME. 
Alex Prud'homme, the co-author with Julia Child of ''My Life in France,'' is writing a book about water.

 BODY:
LAST month, a 30-foot section of levee ruptured in Fernley, Nev. While the cause of the breach, which swamped 450 homes and forced dozens of people to evacuate, is unknown, anyone familiar with the drowning of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina will tell you this: Levees fail. 
 Indeed, there are more than 100 antiquated earthen berms across the country in danger of collapsing. What happened in Nevada is a harbinger of a much larger problem nationwide. 
 In Texas City, Tex., for instance, levees protect 50,000 residents and $6 billion worth of property, including almost 5 percent of the nation's oil-refining capacity. Imagine the consequences, in this day of $100-a-barrel oil, if those defenses fail. 
 Even more vulnerable are the 1,100 miles of levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, north of San Francisco. Cobbled together 150 years ago to provide farmland, they are now part of an intricate, fragile system that supplies fresh water to California, the eighth-largest economy in the world. 
 On a recent visit, I noticed that the water had risen nearly to the top of the levee on one side, while the land had subsided at least 30 feet below on the other side. The water pressure against the decrepit berm was palpable. Should the levee crack, be overtopped by a storm or liquefied by an earthquake, saltwater will surge inland, destroying lives, perhaps flooding Sacramento and paralyzing California.
 A year ago the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which builds and maintains many of these levees, admitted that 122 are at risk of failure. California, with 37 at-risk levees, and Washington State, with 19, are the worst off. But the list includes levees near Albuquerque, Detroit, Hartford, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Omaha and Washington. 
 These levees were designed poorly and built of whatever material was close at hand -- clay, soft soil, sand mixed with seashells. Tree roots, shifting stones and rodents weaken them further. The land the berms are built on often subsides, while the waters they restrain constantly probe for weak spots.
 Sadly, America's flood-protection system has long been undermined by bureaucratic turf wars, chronic underfinancing by Congress and a lack of political leadership. The heart of the problem is the Corps of Engineers, which Congress has ''streamlined'' relentlessly for decades, imperiling its mission through budget cuts and neglect. The Corps has a good set of engineering guidelines for levees, but it doesn't always follow them. Now largely staffed by civilians, the Corps has a backlog of projects it does not have the money to accomplish. 
 Business has also ignored the levee problem. Developers, abetted by the Supreme Court's vague 2006 ruling on the Clean Water Act, have rushed to fill in wetlands and build in floodplains. 
 But water is an inexorable force that, sooner or later, will assert itself. This is a lesson others have taken to heart. In 1953, a hurricane in the North Sea breached dikes and flooded the Netherlands, setting off a period of national soul-searching. Realizing that they had suffered from poor engineering and communication, the Dutch spent billions of dollars to create a world-class flood control system and are now armed for a once-in-10,000-year event. 
 The United States isn't even prepared for a once-in-100-year event. In light of climate change, we need to emulate the Netherlands and make flood protection a national priority. 
 For starters, we need to reinvigorate the Army Corps of Engineers and give it a mandate to build and maintain a coherent, robust, nationwide flood protection system -- as opposed to the ineffective, piecemeal measures that failed so catastrophically in New Orleans. 
 Second, the laws stemming from the 1928 Flood Protection Act, which immunize the Corps from prosecution when its levees fail, must be repealed. Already, the Corps has quietly begun to decertify some of its levees, effectively abdicating responsibility when disaster strikes.
 And finally, citizens and businesses who benefit from levees should apply their skills and resources to their upkeep. For years, we have relied on dredging, bulldozing and building ever-taller walls to control nature. Instead, the Corps should work with other government agencies, businesses, scientists and environmental groups to develop a greener, more intelligent system that integrates traditional engineering with natural defenses like wetlands, islands and reeds. Such an approach will be costly and require maintenance, but will prove far more effective than our current methods. 
 The need to eliminate dangerous levees gives Congress the chance to rethink land and water use, and how they are connected. We should integrate nature and technology, build only in areas that can be adequately protected and allow some wetlands to return to their naturally unconstrained state. After all, experts say, there are only two types of levees: those that have failed, and those that will fail. If we have learned anything from Hurricane Katrina, it's that we cannot simply wish natural flooding away.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Plans $15 Billion Share Buyback

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
I.B.M. said on Tuesday that its board had authorized a $15 billion share buyback program that could increase 2008 earnings by up to 5 cents a share, sending its stock up 4.2 percent. 
 News of the planned repurchase, equivalent to about 10 percent of the market capitalization of I.B.M., pushed the stock market higher. The company's shares rose $4.30, to $114.38.
 ''I.B.M. is showing its confidence it can still generate a lot of cash in a difficult environment,'' an analyst at American Technology Research, Shaw Wu, said. ''We are in a bear market, we are literally on the brink of recession -- we actually might be in one already.''
 The new repurchase authorization comes after I.B.M. reported strong fourth-quarter results on Jan. 17 and gave a 2008 outlook that topped expectations, saying growth abroad would make up for the weaker American economy.
 I.B.M. said it now expected full-year earnings of at least $8.25 a share, or 16 percent year-on-year growth, as a result of the buyback. In January, the company forecast 2008 earnings at $8.20 to $8.30 a share.

HEADLINE: Jury Selection Starts in Corruption Trial of Mayor Who Ran Newark for 20 Years

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
Reviewing the questionnaires filled out on Tuesday by 135 potential jurors in the corruption trial of former Mayor Sharpe James, Judge William J. Martini of United States District Court said he was struck by the unusual number who had checked the box for Question 36. Many, it seemed, thought they might be swayed by racial, religious or ethnic bias, or by ''personal sympathy'' or ''personal dislike'' for Mr. James, his co-defendant or the lawyers and witnesses in the case.
 That should hardly be surprising with a larger-than-life figure like Mr. James, whose outspoken, aggressive, irrepressible personality dominated Newark civic affairs for the two decades he ran City Hall. 
 He is charged with using his power to help a female companion defraud a city program intended to rehabilitate Newark's ailing neighborhoods, but the trial will also stand as a verdict on the reign of Mr. James, who is alternately seen as a heroic figure in Newark's recovery from its 1967 riots and as a symbol of the state's particularly self-serving brand of politics. 
 ''We have surveys that show that 53 percent of the public thinks that he's guilty even though they haven't heard the evidence,'' Thomas R. Ashley, one of Mr. James's lawyers, said in an interview as jury selection began. 
 Judge Martini expressed concern that so many jurors questioned their ability to be impartial, but noted that some of them also checked ''yes'' to Question 37, saying they could follow the law according to his instructions. So when Judge Martini starts questioning potential jurors individually on Wednesday, he plans to ask whether the questionnaire was poorly worded or the issues and public officials involved in Mr. James's trial are truly that divisive.
 Prosecutors have charged in an indictment that Mr. James, 72, used his connections to allow the companion, Tamika Riley, to purchase steeply discounted parcels of city land that she later sold at a profit of more than $700,000, often without fulfilling her obligation to improve the property. 
 Many Newark residents credit Mr. James with beginning the revitalization of downtown and, in his final years, a boom in residential development that saw hundreds of new houses replace vacant lots and dilapidated slums. As the city's second black mayor, Mr. James has also been praised as a tireless, occasionally bombastic, advocate for racial justice.
 But the former mayor's blunt personality and taste for yachts and luxury cars also made him no shortage of enemies.
 His administration was investigated in the mid-1990s after hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to the Sharpe James Civic Association could not be accounted for, and although Mr. James was never charged, he came to be viewed by many as a symbol of the politician on the take.
 Because federal court draws potential jurors from across North Jersey, Mr. James's fate will likely be decided by a cross section of the demographics and divergent opinions found there.
 ''There's been this dual view,'' said Ingrid Reed, policy analyst at the Eagleton Institute of Politics in New Brunswick. ''There's the Sharpe James who fought for the people in Newark when they were being overlooked, and the Sharpe James who seemed like so many other New Jersey politicians and couldn't control the urge to put self-interest before their constituents.'' 
 The charges of fraud, conspiracy and failure to provide the public with honest services strike at the very heart of Mr. James's legacy -- his efforts to rebuild a blighted city. 
 An indictment prepared by the lead prosecutor in the case, Judith H. Germano, charges that Mr. James made extensive efforts to allow Ms. Riley, who had no development experience, to purchase nine vacant city properties at prices far below market value. According to federal agents, she purchased nine lots for $46,000 and sold them for more than $700,000.
 The indictment also charges that Mr. James, who served one term as a state senator, used his state office to try to win a grant for Ms. Riley, who frequently accompanied Mr. James on trips to Memphis; Sag Harbor, N.Y.; and Boca Chica, Dominican Republic; and to his beach house in Bayville, N.J. 
 Mr. James's lawyers say that Ms. Riley received the same treatment given hundreds of people who participated in the redevelopment program. They also point out that her purchases were approved by Municipal Council members, including Cory A. Booker, who was elected to succeed Mr. James as mayor after going to court to block some of the cut-rate land sales.
 ''Sharpe James never put any kind of pressure on the department of housing, the city council or anyone else to sell Tamika Riley property for less than others were paying,'' said Alan Zegas, another of Mr. James's lawyers. 
 Because there is no evidence that Mr. James received any financial benefit from Ms. Riley's profits from the land sales, one key question in the trial will be the nature of their relationship. 
 Prosecutors have argued that Mr. James, who is married, was involved in a romantic affair with Ms. Riley, and have portrayed the land deals as the mayor using city assets to underwrite the expenses of an extramarital affair. Among the evidence they will present are suggestive details of the trips they took together, including receipts that they say show Mr. James paid for body lotion and erotic films during some of their stays in hotels. 
 Mr. Ashley called the notion of a romance ''complete nonsense.''
 The trial may last more than three months, and prosecutors have indicated that they expect to call 50 or more witnesses, including employees of agencies involved with redevelopment and land sales. Some of the most intriguing evidence is likely to be statements already made by Ms. Riley and Mr. James. 
 The judge has agreed to let prosecutors present statements that Ms. Riley, 38, made when she was considering a possible plea bargain on the charges of conspiracy and tax fraud. In court papers, prosecutors say that Ms. Riley acknowledged in an interview having a ''phenomenal'' and ''intimate'' relationship with Mr. James, and felt like a $700,000 paramour. They said the statement showed that the land deals were linked to the romance.
 Ms. Riley's lawyer, Gerald Krovatin, sought unsuccessfully to have those statements excluded from the trial, saying that they had been coerced. 
 One key piece of evidence against Mr. James is likely to be a speech he made on the floor of the State Senate in 2004 in which he criticized members of the Newark Municipal Council for helping their friends and relatives buy cut-rate city land and asked the Legislature to give the mayor's office more power over property sales.
 ''We have council people who are saying, I won't be here forever, but if I can send a million dollars of municipal property to my boyfriend, girlfriend, mama, papa, brother or friend or organization -- well, if I want this, I'll go get it,'' he said in the speech, according to the indictment. 
 Mr. James went on to describe such insider deals as ''thievery with municipal property,'' the indictment said.
 He also faces a second trial on charges that he improperly billed the city for $58,000 in personal expenses, including trips with Ms. Riley and other women. 
 Wearing a black suit and dark striped tie, Mr. James did not speak during the court hearing Tuesday and declined to talk to reporters outside the courthouse. Since he ended his 20 years as mayor in 2006, and his single term as state senator last month, Mr. James has been spotted at city restaurants or attending New Jersey Devils games in the Prudential Center, an arenathat many consider part of his legacy. 
 He also spends much of the workweek in his lawyer's office, preparing his defense. 
 ''He's a fighter,'' Mr. Zegas said. ''He's eager to get on with this and get on with his life.''

HEADLINE: Warrantless Searches Removed From Legislation in Mexico

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Mexican lawmakers on Tuesday stripped a controversial provision from their plan to overhaul the country's judiciary that would have given police officers, who are widely mistrusted here, the ability to enter homes without obtaining warrants beforehand.
 Warrantless searches would have been allowed only in emergencies and in cases of hot pursuit of criminal suspects. But human rights groups had strongly opposed the measure, fearing that a police force notorious for corruption would abuse the authority. 
 One newspaper labeled the plan the ''Gestapo law.'' 
 The last-minute change, approved overwhelmingly by the House of Deputies, delays passage of a revamping of the country's judicial system that is meant to speed up trials that now stretch on for years and to better equip the country in its battle against narcotics traffickers.
 ''In this country, no one is satisfied with our justice system,'' said Cesar Camacho Quiroz, a legislator representing the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party, who opposed the expanded police powers.
 The reforms amending the Constitution will now go back to the Senate, which had endorsed the search provision. If both chambers agree on a reform proposal, a majority of the 31 states must approve the changes before they go into effect.
 There is widespread agreement that Mexico's judiciary is broken and ill equipped to address the heavily armed organized crime figures who control huge swaths of the countryside. The backlog of criminal cases grows greater by the month. Corruption mars many of the decisions that are handed down.
 The reforms put forward by President Felipe Calderon would replace the current system of secretive paper trials with one of oral arguments similar to those held in American courts, albeit without juries. In addition, criminal defendants would be presumed innocent, a new legal standard in Mexico. 
 Mr. Calderon had also proposed allowing the police to enter homes without warrants if they were pursuing a suspect in the act of committing a crime or if they had reason to believe someone inside was in danger. 
 Some critics have complained that the provisions go too far, however, giving law enforcement officials too much leeway to monitor phone calls and to review private records. They feared that allowing police officers access to homes even in limited cases would open a loophole dishonest officers could exploit.
 Lawmakers also approved new restrictions on cigarette smoking that will prevent smokers from lighting up in offices, restaurants and other public spaces across the country. Those establishments wishing to set up areas for smokers would be required to install equipment to ensure that secondhand smoke does not reach nonsmokers.
 The smoking law, approved by the Senate on Tuesday and earlier by the lower chamber, was hailed by antitobacco advocates as a groundbreaking step that would serve as a model for Latin America. 
 ''Smoking has been so ingrained in the culture of Mexico, and this shows Mexico is waking up to the economic and health effects of smoking,'' said Mark Hurley, a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C.
 Mexico City, which passed its own restrictions late last year, continued refining them on Tuesday to overcome legal challenges. A World Health Organization study this month estimated that 30 percent of Mexican men and nearly 10 percent of Mexican women smoke. 
 The government has said four major smoking-related diseases are responsible for $642 million in health care costs. The poorest fifth of the population, W.H.O. estimated, spends 11 percent of their income on smoking.
 The new smoking restrictions call for hefty fines and even 36 hours in jail for violators. But past efforts at restricting smoking have failed to take hold, largely because of lax enforcement.
 Already, the governor of rural Nayarit State, which grows most of the country's tobacco, said he would not allow the restrictions to be enforced there. He said the law is not just antitobacco but antifamily and antifarmer.
 Approval of the judicial reform package has been a high priority for Mr. Calderon, whose predecessor, Vicente Fox, failed to push his own reform package through Congress three years ago.
 Under Mr. Calderon's measure, criminal suspects will be entitled to public defenders, not the less-qualified advocates who sometimes represent them now. The proposal would allow organized crime suspects to be detained for up to 80 days with a judge's permission, and those suspects could be denied the right to the new public oral trials that other defendants will have.
 ''Organized crime is the principal challenge to our security,'' said Marina Arvizu, an opposition legislator.

HEADLINE: Providence Begins to See Its Future Around the Corner

BYLINE: By DONNA PAUL

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
This is a city of 25 diverse neighborhoods, many with distinctive New England character, but it is Downcity that is the urban core and the city's historical heart. 
 Downcity is centered on Westminster Street, an urban thoroughfare lined with a cohesive ensemble of 18th- and 19th-century neo-Classical-style and Italianate mercantile buildings, made of brick, limestone and cast iron.
 Until the middle of the 20th century, it was a vibrant shopping district, perhaps the most prominent in the state, whose residents used to talk about going ''downcity'' rather than ''downtown.'' It offered chic clothing shops, jewelers, tailors, salons and a number of local department stores: Shepard's, Peerless and Gladdings.
 But once the venerable tenants left, the buildings were vacant for years. Today, different kinds of stores are opening here. Cheese shops, design stores and restaurants are setting up in these stately buildings, hoping first-floor retail spaces will capture the attention of new residents in the area. 
 There has long been talk of a renaissance in Downcity, which covers a 36-block area, about a quarter mile long and a third of a mile wide, and progress has been made. 
 ''In 1990, you could have thrown a bowling ball down Westminster Street,'' said Thomas Deller, director of planning and development for the city and executive director of the Providence Redevelopment Agency. 
 ''Everything in Downcity continues to evolve,'' he said. ''What happens in good city planning is the ability to keep a pulse of what's happening, to make sure that the plan is clear about what you want to achieve.'' He added: ''Here's a city that has figured it out.''
 Arnold B. Chace, 60, owner, president and chief executive of Cornish Associates, a real estate development firm, has been a seminal figure in the redevelopment of Downcity. 
 Today, there are residential lofts, a bookstore, a cafe, a college library, stores, a wine shop, restaurants, arts organizations, theater companies and a hotel in Downcity. Many occupy buildings owned by Cornish.
 According to Mr. Chace, Cornish Associates has acquired eight buildings since 1991, paying as little as $3 to $10 a square foot. To date, his company has committed $80 million to restore them. 
 As Mr. Chace, who is known as Buff, tells it, his interest in Downcity dates to a day in 1991 when he was looking at buildings that had been foreclosed, accompanied by his twins, who were then 7 years old. ''I was explaining to them about what had happened here, and my daughter asked me, 'Why don't you do something about it?' '' Mr. Chace said.
 That elicited a response. ''The very heart of our city was in disrepair, and I became committed to rebuilding that heart,'' he said. 
 He helped to persuade the mayor, Vincent Cianci, and the Providence Foundation, a nonprofit group that works on redevelopment, to sponsor a five-day program in 1991 to analyze the downtown and develop a master plan to revitalize its core. A leading participant was the architect and New Urbanism advocate Andres Duany.
 There were two more such planning sessions involving Mr. Duany, in 1994 and 2005, and a master plan was adopted by the city after the 1994 meeting. 
 For the revitalization of Downcity, Mr. Chace has been guided by the principles laid out in the plan: walkable streets; continuous retailing, with no offices on ground floors; and mixed use. 
 But the effort to attract retailers was undercut when the huge Providence Place Mall, with about 1.3 million square feet and 170 stores, including Nordstrom and Macy's, opened about a half-mile away in August 1999. 
 Cornish Associates shifted its focus to housing. It has created 196 loft apartments by renovating the eight buildings. About 95 percent of the apartments are occupied, roughly a fifth by artists. The lofts range from 550 to 2,700 square feet and rent for $500 to $3,000 a month. 
 None of this could have happened without significant tax credits. ''It took a major effort, changes in zoning, and getting legislation passed to make this work,'' Mr. Deller said. Federal and state historic tax credits return 20 and 30 percent of the total rehabilitation expenses respectively to the developer of a project in a historic district.
 In 1999, additional incentives to attract artists were passed, including a proposal pushed by Mr. Cianci that artwork created in the district would not be subject to sales tax, nor would artists be subject to state income tax. 
 Three universities -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island School of Design, and Johnson & Wales -- own property in Downcity. There are also a number of arts organizations, including the Trinity Repertory Company, the Providence Performing Arts Center and the Black Repertory Theater.
 AS220, a nonprofit artist group, currently owns and operates two buildings. Umberto Crenca founded the group at 220 Weybosset Street in 1985; the name, short for Artist Space 220, is supposed to evoke P. S. 1, the contemporary art center in Queens. 
 He began in a single room, but in 1993, Lucie Searle, a developer, assisted the organization in buying a 22,000-square-foot- building for $400,000. A second building was bought in 2005 using tax credits. AS220 is about to buy its third building for more than $1 million. 
 Retail spaces have been slower to fill, and this is a problem in Downcity. ''Critical mass must be created for an infrastructure of services to come in,'' Mr. Chace said, citing dry cleaners, groceries and drugstores as the kinds of businesses that are needed. 
 In 2003, Mr. Chace offered extraordinary leases to his first retail tenants. ''I allowed tenants to enter deals without rent, and I took a percentage of sales,'' he said. He now lists annual asking rents of around $20 a square foot. At Providence Place Mall, the annual rents are about $75 or $80 a square foot. 
 The attractive rents have helped attract independent shop owners. Heejun Arms, 38, opened Elsa Arms, a store selling designer clothing, one year ago on Westminster Street. She was drawn to the high ceilings. ''I couldn't find this anywhere else,'' Ms. Arms said. 
 George Germon and Johanne Killeen, prominent Providence chefs who own the restaurant Al Forno, which has operated for 28 years in another part of the city, are about to create a new venture in Downcity. Their restaurant-wine bar, called Tini, is to open in April. 
 Michael Corso, 37, who has worked for Cornish Associates, opened Tazza Caffe in late 2003, signing a 10-year lease. His goal was to create a European style neighborhood espresso bar. ''We have a dynamic bunch coming in here: artists, professionals, politicians,'' he said. 
 David N. Cicilline, the current mayor, is optimistic about Downcity. ''People are living here for the first time in a long time,'' he said. 
 Mr. Crenca, the artist, notes there is more to be done, however. ''We are at a very critical juncture,'' he said. ''Others need to step up to the plate.''

HEADLINE: Union Strikes Parts Maker For G.M.

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union called its third strike in five months Tuesday, sending some 3,650 workers at parts factories in Michigan and New York off the job in opposition to proposed pay and benefits cuts, and to what it called unfair labor practices. 
 Analysts said that the strike, against American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings, threatened to shut down some truck production at General Motors, the supplier's biggest customer and former parent company. G.M. officials said there were no immediate disruptions, and both companies had stockpiled some parts in preparation for a work halt, though it was reported to be only a few days' worth.
 The U.A.W.'s president, Ron Gettelfinger, who led the union in brief strikes against G.M. and Chrysler last fall, accused American Axle of failing to provide enough information for the union to evaluate the proposed cuts.
 In a statement, Mr. Gettelfinger said talks broke off Monday night, when the previous contract expired ''with major issues unresolved.'' No new talks are scheduled.
 He said that the company's demands included cutting wages as much as $14 an hour, to about half the current rate for most workers, and eliminating retirement health care coverage and pensions. ''Our members cannot be expected to make the extreme sacrifices American Axle is asking for with nothing in return,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said.
 Workers walked picket lines and huddled near fire barrels during a snowstorm outside American Axle headquarters in Detroit and elsewhere. Some said they were upset that a profitable company was making such demands of them at a time when prices were climbing rapidly and bills were piling up. American Axle reported a profit of $37 million last year; each of the three Detroit automakers lost billions.
 ''I'd have to pick up and move out of state because I wouldn't be able to support my family'' under the company's proposed contract, said Annette Harris, 48, a single mother of three, who has worked for American Axle since its founding in 1994. ''If they cut our pay, a lot of people are going to lose their homes.''
 The company posted a statement on its Web site Tuesday asserting that it now compensates workers $70 an hour, including benefits, about three times as much as rivals who have recently signed new labor deals.
 ''All of the changes we have proposed have been accepted by the U.A.W. in agreements with our competitors in the United States,'' American Axle's chief executive, Richard E. Dauch, said in the statement. ''I have no idea why A.A.M. is being singled out for a different set of economic conditions.''
 Dana Edwards, the shop chairman for U.A.W. Local 235 in Detroit, said that ''a lot of open issues'' remained and that it appeared this strike could last considerably longer than those against the automakers last year and the one-day walkout against American Axle in 2004.
 In trading Tuesday, shares of American Axle fell 3 cents, to $22.94. Analysts said they believed that the company would eventually be able to make a deal that still improved its competitive position greatly.

HEADLINE: A Highflier Loses Altitude As Google's Clicks Go Flat

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Are Internet users clicking on fewer Google ads and putting the company's growth prospects at risk?
 Those questions are weighing on investors, who have cut the value of Google shares by 38 percent since they peaked at $747.24 in early November. 
 The slide continued Tuesday when Google shares dropped 4.6 percent to close at $464.19, as investors were spooked by a report by the research firm comScore that said clicks on Google ads the United States were flat in January when compared with a year earlier. 
 In all, Google's shares have fallen $283 from their peak, wiping out $83 billion in market value, and bringing a aura of vulnerability, at least on Wall Street, to a company that just four months ago seemed unstoppable. 
 Investors have focused with new intensity on Google's so-called paid clicks, which grew at 30 percent in the fourth quarter, because the search and advertising giant earns the vast majority of its revenue from text ads, for which it is paid only when users click on them. 
 Many analysts saw the comScore report as the clearest sign that Google, which does not give forecasts about its future performance, is not impervious to the slowdown that is buffeting the United States economy. 
 ''There are pretty strong signals now that the economic slowdown is having impact on consumers' behavior online and therefore having a negative impact on Google,'' said Clayton Moran, an analyst with the Stanford Group.
 Wall Street analysts say that in addition to concerns about the economy, the company is facing a growing number of questions that are weighing on its shares. Has Google gotten so big that its ability to gain further market share is limited? Is its spending out of control? Will it face stronger competition if its two chief rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, end up merging?
 For now, however Google remains a highly profitable company that is outpacing all of its major competitors. Its share of the fast-growing online advertising market in the United States increased to 28 percent last year, from 19 percent in 2005, according to eMarketer, a research firm. 
 And even some of Google's biggest critics are reluctant to bet against the company in the long term. 
 ''Everything wrong with Google's stock is self-inflicted,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Precursor Group, who testified before Congress against Google's proposed merger with DoubleClick. 
 Mr. Cleland said the most recent quarter, when Google's revenue grew at 51 percent while profit rose only 17 percent, was the latest sign that the company was overspending. ''If they cut their spending a little, so that they could start gaining earnings momentum again, their stock valuation would return,'' he said.
 Others point out that the unexpected weakness in ''paid clicks'' that comScore reported may be the result of deliberate actions taken by Google that may benefit it in the long term. 
 ''I think at least half of it is self-inflicted,'' said Jordan Rohan, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Rohan noted that Google has reduced the clickable area in text ads to avoid accidental clicks, which earn it revenue but are of little value to advertisers. 
 In recent months, Google has taken other measures to improve the usefulness of its ads. For instance, it ended contracts with Web sites whose sole purpose is to carry ads -- the kind that Web users are directed to when they mistype a Web address -- as those ads tend to deliver poor results for marketers. 
 Many sophisticated marketers base their search advertising budgets not on the number of clicks they receive, but on the value those clicks create in terms of purchases or sales leads, said Marianne Wolk, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. If Google weeds out poor quality clicks, advertisers may be willing to pay more for every click, Ms. Wolk said. 
 Google may be cleaning out poor performing sites from its advertising network so it can market the network more effectively to brand advertisers after its acquisition of DoubleClick, which is being reviewed by regulators in Europe, Ms. Wolk said.
 ''Google has had this history of making major changes to the platform that have had terrific impact on monetization,'' Ms. Wolk said. ''Given the track record, we will give them the benefit of the doubt.''
 Others went as far as to question the accuracy of comScore's one-month report. During a Jan. 31 conference call to discuss fourth-quarter earnings, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, repeatedly told investors that the company had not been affected by the economic slowdown.
 ''I am happy to say that we have not yet seen any negative impact from the rumors of future recessions,'' Mr. Schmidt said. 
 Derek Brown, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors appear to be overreacting to data that Mr. Schmidt's own statements seem to contradict. Mr. Brown noted that while Google's share decline is significant, other technology stocks that climbed sharply in 2007, like Apple and Research in Motion, are also down sharply, in part, because of concerns about the economy. 
 Google's rate of growth has slowed markedly in recent years, from 92 percent in 2005, to 73 percent in 2006 and 56 percent last year. Growth in the fourth quarter was 51 percent, slightly shy of analysts expectations. While many believe that the slowing trend is inevitable given Google's growing size, others worry it is happening faster than anticipated. 
 ''The fourth quarter didn't show the company's growth falling off a cliff, but it did show a slowdown,'' said Mr. Moran, of the Stanford Group. ''This is a high flying stock that trades a lot on momentum, and the momentum has turned decidedly negative.''

HEADLINE: Humane Society Criticized In Meat Quality Scandal

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As the meat industry scrambles to recover from a public-relations disaster over an undercover video of abused cattle, the secretary of agriculture and at least one congressman have picked an unlikely target to share in the blame: the Humane Society of the United States.
 The Humane Society shot the video of what appear to be sick or lame cattle being forced to their feet with forklifts, hoses and electric prods at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Company in Chino, Calif., in October and November. 
 Released publicly in late January, the video touched off criticism of the Department of Agriculture's inspection of the meat supply and led to the biggest beef recall in history, 143 million pounds.
 At a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, assailed the Humane Society for waiting to inform the federal government.
 ''Why wait until February to release the video?'' Mr. Burgess demanded of a Humane Society representative. ''Why wait until now to bring this to our attention?''
 His criticism echoed a point made last week by Ed Schafer, the secretary of agriculture, who said he was ''extremely disappointed'' in the Humane Society. He complained that ''for four months, theoretically, animals were not being properly treated, and the Humane Society stood by and allowed it to happen.''
 Humane Society representatives said Tuesday that the criticism was misplaced. They said the primary concern of their organization is animal welfare, not food safety, and as soon as they had the tape they took it to local prosecutors in California.
 The Humane Society said it was asked to withhold the tape while the prosecutors conducted an investigation. The society released the tape after growing frustrated with the pace of that investigation. Shortly afterward, prosecutors charged two slaughterhouse workers with violations.
 The recall of meat from Westland/Hallmark has focused attention on potential food safety hazards, especially since some of the meat was served to schoolchildren. Slaughtering cattle that cannot walk, known as ''downer'' cattle, poses a slight risk of introducing disease into the food supply.
 The Humane Society said its principal motivation in penetrating the slaughterhouse was to check whether Westland/Hallmark was treating animals in a humane manner.
 ''First and foremost, the U.S.D.A. should not be relying on a private animal welfare charity to do its job for them,'' said Paul Shapiro, who oversees issues involving farm-animal abuse for the Humane Society. He said there was little incentive to go to the Department of Agriculture anyway because the agency often ignores abuse allegations.
 Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said the Humane Society should be praised, not blamed, for uncovering the abuse and potential food safety problems at Westland/Hallmark. 
 ''It is the height of irony that the U.S.D.A. is now trying to blame the whistle-blower for the agency's own irresponsible behavior,'' she said in an e-mail message.
 Officials at Westland/Hallmark Meat declined to comment on Tuesday. Steve Mendell, the company's president, refused to appear voluntarily at Tuesday's Congressional hearing. The company has stopped operating, though whether the shutdown will be permanent remains to be seen.
 Agriculture officials maintain that no one has become sick from the Westland/Hallmark meat, and that the risk of contracting mad cow disease from it is quite low.
 The cattle in question had passed initial inspection by a Department of Agriculture veterinarian. But if cattle go down in the time between that inspection and slaughter, a federal veterinarian is supposed to be summoned to determine if they are fit. Whether that happened in every instance at Westland/Hallmark is at issue.
 Dr. Michael Greger, director of public health and animal agriculture for the Humane Society, urged a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee at Tuesday's hearing to close the ''loophole'' that allows veterinarians to approved downed cattle for slaughter. He said that created a financial incentive for just the sort of abuse shown in the undercover videotape.
 Several members of Congress on Tuesday bemoaned what they described as an underfinanced and antiquated food-safety system.
 Robert E. Brackett, who served as director of the Food and Drug Administration's food-safety unit until last year, criticized both the Bush administration and Congress, saying they failed to provide enough money to the agency to protect the food supply.
 ''Because F.D.A. food-related funding has not kept pace with inflation, more than 800 scientists, inspectors and other critical staff have been lost in the past four years,'' said Mr. Brackett, now a vice president at the Grocery Manufacturers Association.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Focus on Economic Cost of War

BYLINE: By DAVID HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Undeterred by President Bush and Senator John McCain proudly pointing to progress in Iraq, Congressional Democrats are trying to mount new lines of attack against the administration's war policies.
 In a shift from last year's failed legislative efforts to force a reduction of troops, the Democrats' new approach is aimed primarily at framing the issue for the November elections by focusing on the financial cost of military operations and on the war's implications for the nation's troubled economy. 
 With the fifth anniversary of the war fast approaching, the Democrats, citing testimony by the Pentagon's own commanders, are also emphasizing the strain on the armed forces. In addition the Democrats contend that the war against terrorism should be waged primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan, not Iraq. 
 The change in tactics by the Democrats is one of necessity. The closest they came last year to forcing the administration to alter its war plans was in September, when they mustered 56 votes -- 4 short of the 60 they needed -- to advance legislation that would have required troops to be given as much time back in the United States as they spent overseas before being redeployed.
 The Democratic presidential candidates have seized on the Pentagon's announcement that when the troop escalation ends in July, there will still be 8,000 more soldiers in Iraq than when the so-called surge started because some support units will remain.
 And on Monday a coalition of Democratic advocacy groups, with support from John Edwards, who ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, announced a $20 million public awareness campaign to highlight ''the crushing cost of the war.''
 ''We have to send a message here,'' said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a West Point graduate and former Army paratrooper who has emerged as one of the Democrats' most authoritative voices on the war.
 ''We have to have a long-term sustainable strategy; 140,000 troops is not sustainable in the longer term,'' he said.
 While they sought to focus last year on the all-consuming chaos in Iraq, Democrats now acknowledge that there have been recent security gains. But they say those gains may prove temporary, that political progress has been too slow and that given domestic concerns, the human and financial cost is just too steep. 
 Republicans, including the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, say they are happy to spend a few days talking about Iraq.
 ''We welcome a discussion,'' Mr. McConnell said Tuesday, ''which would give us a chance to talk about the extraordinary progress that has been made in Iraq over the last six months, not only on the military side but also with civilian reconciliation beginning to finally take hold.'' 
 The war issue had faded from focus on Capitol Hill early this year as lawmakers spent the first weeks of the term negotiating an economic stimulus package. But it came gusting back onto the Senate floor on Tuesday with debate over two bills sponsored by Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.
 The first bill would restrict the financing of military operations to fighting terrorism, protecting American troops and training Iraqi forces. The second would give the Bush administration 60 days to report to Congress on its global strategy for defeating Al Qaeda and would limit the length of troop deployments.
 On war-related measures last year, Republicans repeatedly blocked Democrat-backed bills outright. But on Tuesday, Republicans appeared so confident and so eager to talk about the war that they voted overwhelmingly to bring Mr. Feingold's first bill up for 30 hours of debate. 
 That vote was 70 to 24, with 43 Republicans joining 26 Democrats and one independent in favor of debating the bill, while 20 Democrats, 3 Republicans and one independent voted against it. 
 Mr. Feingold's bills, which are certain to be defeated, are the first of several efforts by Democrats to press the war issue.
 Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and John Kerry of Massachusetts returned from a trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan warning of a resurgence of Al Qaeda because of the continuing concentration of resources in Iraq.
 And on Thursday the Joint Economic Committee, led by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will hold a hearing on the costs of the war. 
 This flurry of largely uncoordinated activity suggests that Democrats will take an aggressive stance ahead of the next report by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander in Iraq, who will testify before Congress in early April.
 General Petraeus is expected to recommend that the reduction in troop levels now under way be halted for at least a short period, starting in July, to assess the progress that has been made. 
 Despite the recent military gains, Senator Reed and other Democrats said they were confident that voters remained as weary of the war as ever. 
 ''I think they are beginning to ask themselves questions like, 'O.K., now that everyone says we have made real progress on the ground, why can't we start coming out more dramatically?' '' Mr. Reed said. ''And now with the economy becoming such a central issue -- $190 billion a year -- why are we spending there instead of here?''
 The Democrats are also focusing on the strain on the military. 
 In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, said, ''The cumulative effects of the last six-plus years at war have left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight and unable to do the things we know we need to do to properly sustain our all-volunteer force.'' 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said Democrats would continue to emphasize the cost of the war. 
 ''We are not going to lose this subject; it's too important to the American people,'' he said. ''If this war goes on another year, we will have borrowed a trillion dollars to pay for this war in Iraq.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Welfare Lives, Especially for Baseball

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
More than four years ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg claimed victory over one of the city's longest-running three-card-monte operations: big companies demanding, and getting, tax breaks to remain in New York when they really weren't going anywhere. 
 ''We've essentially ended corporate welfare as we know it, by no longer paying companies -- who wouldn't have left anyway -- to stay in our great city,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 This week, details are emerging about $20 million in tax breaks that the city is ready to provide for Major League Baseball to put a new television network in an office tower that would be built in East Harlem -- a deal that officials say makes good economic sense for the city, but which critics see as another episode of binge subsidies to fabulously profitable professional sports operations. 
 For decades, pretty much every New York mayor has made a pronouncement almost exactly like the one Mr. Bloomberg made in October 2003. There would be no corporate handouts in their governments, only hard-headed business deals in which enough jobs would be saved or created to outweigh the cost of the subsidy.
 Since Mr. Bloomberg declared victory over corporate welfare, Goldman Sachs has been given $650 million in city and state subsidies to build a headquarters in Battery Park City. JP Morgan Chase got about $240 million to build in Lower Manhattan after threatening to move to Stamford, Conn., although the mayor of Stamford said he had never heard from Chase about it. These funds were needed, state and city officials said, to help rebuild the streets left desolate by the attacks of Sept. 11. 
 Big as those handouts were, they have been dwarfed by public subsidies that have nothing to do with Lower Manhattan. For the city's two baseball teams, the Bloomberg administration has agreed to build new highways, train stations, garages and parkland so the teams can have new ballparks.
 All told, the city and state have agreed to provide about $1.3 billion to the Yankees and Mets, whose new stadiums will have fewer seats and more expensive tickets. Corporate welfare has been transformed into monopoly welfare.
 Major League Baseball plans to put a new television network in an office building that would go up near Park Avenue and 125th Street. Although the precise amounts of the tax breaks are still being calculated, city officials expect to provide $15 million to the developer, Vornado Realty Trust, and $5 million to Major League Baseball. And city documents show that baseball would be able to use some of the $5 million to pay for equipment and furnishings for its headquarters, at Park Avenue near 46th Street in Midtown Manhattan.
 Where baseball spends the subsidy does not matter to the city, said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. The city wants 125th Street to become a different kind of business hub, and the new tower would be the first major office building in Harlem in 30 years. Construction costs are no less in Harlem than they are in Midtown, Mr. Pinsky said, but the developers cannot charge as much rent.
 ''The rents barely cover the cost of development, or barely don't,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''We don't see that we're losing the value of these benefits -- absent them, the project wouldn't happen, so we wouldn't have them anyway.'' 
 Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a private watchdog group that tracks how the city uses incentives, says the city lost its grip with the building of the baseball stadiums.
 ''Our wounds are still open from the Yankee Stadium deal,'' Ms. Damiani said. ''The love affair with professional sports doesn't make sense. Hands down, we don't think these two projects should be publicly subsidized.''
 Mr. Pinsky said that in the scheme of things, the city is offering a small amount of money to get a 21-story building on a piece of land that has been vacant for years, even though it is just steps from the 125th Street Metro-North station, where trains depart for the entire region. 
 The 350 to 500 jobs in the television network, which is a new enterprise, are expected to pay an average of $98,000 annually, according to city officials.
 Ms. Damiani argues that the city needs ''more transparency and accountability'' in how it provides its handouts, noting that the city did not disclose its cost-benefit analysis of the Yankee Stadium parking garages until the day it began borrowing money for them. 
 Mr. Pinsky said, ''We don't give a lot of subsidies, but it's very important to receive a positive return.'' 
 Ms. Damiani said it's corporate welfare, ''with a new dress, and a different shade of lipstick.''

HEADLINE: Bush Vows to Veto a Mortgage Relief Bill

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush sided with banks and mortgage lenders on Tuesday, threatening to veto a bill being offered by Senate Democrats that would give more bargaining power to homeowners who face foreclosure.
 Opening what is likely to be an intense political battle in the deepening mortgage crisis, the White House said it strongly opposed the bill, which would let bankruptcy court judges modify the terms of a mortgage as part of the restructuring of a debt in a bankruptcy filing.
 Supporters of the legislation say it could prevent as many as 600,000 home foreclosures affecting people who took out tickler or other complicated mortgages and now face steep increases in interest rates and monthly payments. 
 Consumer and civil rights groups argue that the change in bankruptcy law would provide the surest way of helping families renegotiate mortgages that have been bundled into complex securities and sold to investors.
 But mortgage lenders, and the Wall Street firms that purchased the loans, have mounted a campaign against the bill, saying it would send a chilling message to investors and lead to higher borrowing costs in the future. 
 ''We're pulling out all the stops on this,'' said Stephen O'Connor, chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''How will lenders and investors react to the added risk? They will likely charge a higher interest rate, likely charge more points on the mortgage and likely demand higher down payments.''
 Unlike most other kinds of debt, including loans for vacation homes and rental properties, mortgages on a primary residence are outside the power of federal bankruptcy judges to change. 
 In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, the White House said the bill would ''undermine existing contracts'' and lead to tighter credit.
 ''These and other provisions of the bankruptcy-related provisions in the bill would fundamentally alter the expectations of parties to hundreds of thousands of home purchases after the fact,'' it said. It also objected to provisions that would provide $4 billion for state and local governments to redevelop abandoned homes and provide money for homeowner counseling programs.
 The Bush administration has started a program it calls Hope Now, which encourages mortgage lenders to modify loans and sometimes freeze interest rates for people who face big increases in their monthly payments.
 But that program is voluntary, and the guidelines for providing relief are so narrow that it is expected to help only a tiny fraction of the 1.8 million subprime mortgage borrowers facing increases in these initial rates. Nor would the program provide help to people whose homes have declined in value and can no longer be sold for enough to pay off the mortgage.
 Supporters argue that the bill could prevent more than 600,000 foreclosures, which are often more costly to lenders than reductions in monthly payments, and would prevent a chain reaction of declines in home prices in neighborhoods surrounding the foreclosed homes.
 ''Avoiding foreclosure can't be just a part of the proposal, it is the heart of the proposal,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and sponsor of the Senate measure.
 Senate Democrats have narrowed Mr. Durbin's original bill, tailoring it to people with particular kinds of problems and applying it to existing mortgages rather than to all mortgages in the future.
 For practical purposes, Democrats will need 60 votes before debate can begin. Democratic leaders had originally planned on taking up the matter Tuesday, but decided instead to begin debate on legislation to scale back military operations in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Corzine Proposes Cuts in Budget and Work Force

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Declaring that New Jersey had reached an irrevocable ''turning point'' because of years of bad fiscal habits, Gov. Jon S. Corzine proposed a budget on Tuesday that would reduce the state's work force by 3,000 people, close three departments and prune expenses for services including colleges and hospitals.
 If enacted as proposed, the overall state budget would shrink by $500 million to $33 billion, marking only the fifth time in the last 50 years that New Jersey would spend less money than it did the previous year. Assuming inflation this year at around 3 percent, as it has been since 2004, the cut would be equivalent to roughly $1.5 billion, or 4.4 percent of last year's budget, in real terms.
 ''Frankly, New Jersey has a government its people cannot afford,'' a somber Governor Corzine told a stone-silent group of legislators, lobbyists and local officials in his annual budget address. 
 ''We must turn away from the era of spending and borrowing beyond our means, once and for all,'' he said. ''In practical terms, failing to take on the tough choices will only force New Jersey into a deeper fiscal swamp.''
 Mr. Corzine delivered the harsh prognosis against a grim national backdrop, given that more than 20 states, New York included, are now grappling with budget shortfalls because of a downturn in the national economy, according to an analysis released Monday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
 But New Jersey's troubles are especially deep, fiscal analysts say, because of rising costs for pension and health care benefits, a ballooning increase in spending under both Republicans and Democrats over the last decade or so and the longtime practice of paving over deficits with one-shot revenues that dried up the following year. 
 So while the slumping housing market has led to shrinking tax receipts across the country, only a few states face a greater shortfall than the nearly 10 percent gap New Jersey has to fill, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said. Arizona's deficit is the largest, 16 percent, followed by California, at 15 percent.
 Here in Trenton, Mr. Corzine warned that the new math was full of difficult numbers, big and small. 
 He proposed cutting state aid to colleges and universities by $76 million, or 4 percent. Grants to towns? Down $190 million (about 10 percent). Hospitals? Less $144 million (14 percent). His plan would shut down the Departments of Personnel, Agriculture and Commerce, and trim jobs across the board, largely through buyouts. Residents would face longer lines and shorter hours at motor vehicle registries, and limited hours at public parks.
 Beyond the numbers, Mr. Corzine said he wanted to change the culture of the way the state government operated. He said, at several junctures, that he had been humbled by the anger of the public, much of which has been trained on him and his proposed toll increases in a series of town-hall meetings in recent weeks.
 In a 25-minute speech, the governor used some variation of the word ''cut'' at least 28 times and elicited applause just twice: when he entered the Assembly chamber, and when he left.
 ''I have heard firsthand the public's frustration and anger generated by too many years of overspending, borrowing and false rhetoric,'' he said. ''And they're right.''
 He later referred to his plan as ''cold-turkey therapy for our troubled spending addiction.''
 After the speech, the state's top two legislators, both Democrats like the governor, offered a guarded assessment.
 Senate President Richard J. Codey said that ''anything that affects the middle class or the poor is going to get a thorough look at and see whether we can restore some of the cuts that have been proposed.'' In a sign of the challenging economy, he added: ''But if we do that, we have to also propose a cut of our own.''
 Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. said he believed that the budget reflected the consensus that the public was demanding spending cuts. ''I think they've said with a very clear and loud voice, 'We're not prepared to consider tolls or taxes or revenue anywhere until you can convince us and demonstrate to us that you've cut everywhere that's possible.'''
 Republicans, meanwhile, said that they felt vindicated, at least in part, because they had been calling for spending cuts for years. 
 ''It's a good beginning for us,'' said Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, the minority leader. ''I would like to see them cut a little deeper.''
 The Senate minority leader, Thomas H. Kean Jr., chimed in. ''We need to go further,'' he said, arguing that the proposed budget ''is still 20 percent higher than the day the governor took office.''
 Full details of the budget will be released in the next week or so. Then the Legislature embarks upon months of hearings to dissect the plan, before hammering out a budget by the constitutional deadline of June 30.
 But even in outline form, a few proposals were dominating the halls of the State House.
 One was Mr. Corzine's proposal to eliminate three departments (which would save about $60 million). Another was the plan to cut the state work force of 80,000 by 3,000 jobs (which would save $136 million).
 He said he would accomplish the job cuts through a combination of early retirement, attrition and layoffs. To avoid repeating New Jersey's history of enjoying short-term savings at long-term costs in early retirement programs, Mr. Corzine vowed to push for a law limiting to 10 percent the number of vacated positions that could be refilled later.
 But labor unions, and their supporters, were furious.
 ''Clearly the governor's attack on public employees -- hard-working, nonpolitical state employees -- as a way to balance this budget is wrong,'' said Senator Bill Baroni, a Republican from Mercer County.
 The budget comes at a crucial time for Mr. Corzine, a liberal Democrat who was a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and a former United States senator, before arriving in Trenton in January 2006.
 Last month, Mr. Corzine unveiled his long-gestating plan to generate up to $38 billion in bonds to help pay down state debt and finance transportation projects by relying on sharply higher tolls. And though he has secured the endorsement of an impressive group of Republicans, business leaders and scholars, the public does not like the plan, and several Democrats have said they oppose it, too.
 Now, with Mr. Corzine scheduled to face re-election in 2009 and his approval numbers sinking, he is fighting for political survival, said Brigid C. Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University.
 ''This is not the speech that he wants to give,'' Ms. Harrison said. ''This is a bitter pill for him to swallow. It flies in the face of his ideology. This sounds like the kind of speech that you think a conservative or a Republican would give.''

HEADLINE: China Says It Will Resume Human Rights Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China said Tuesday that it would resume a human rights dialogue with the United States, in a move that appeared to be aimed at countering criticism from activists ahead of the Olympic Games here in August. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice won agreement to restart the talks after discussions with Chinese officials here on Tuesday on the second leg of a three-nation tour that began in South Korea and will end in Japan on Thursday.
 But she said no date had been set for the next round. 
 China suspended the exchanges in 2004 after the Bush administration sponsored an unsuccessful resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission attacking China's human rights record.
 ''We are ready to resume the human rights dialogue,'' the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said at a news conference with Ms. Rice in Beijing, Reuters reported. ''We are willing to have exchanges and interactions with the U.S. and other countries on human rights on a basis of mutual respect, equality and noninterference in each others' internal affairs.''
 China is anxious to prevent critics and activists from linking its human rights record with the Olympic Games.
 ''The Olympics, which is a great gathering for the Chinese and the people of the world, shouldn't be politicized or subject to boycott for political reasons,'' the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, told a separate news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. ''That's against the general will of the people of the world.''
 This month, China dismissed Steven Spielberg's decision to withdraw as artistic director for the Games. Mr. Spielberg resigned in protest over what he said was China's failure to use its influence to halt the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan.
 Games organizers and Chinese government officials said connecting Darfur with the Olympics would not help resolve the issue.
 Ms. Rice told reporters she raised three specific rights cases in talks with Chinese officials, including the arrest of Hu Jia, a prominent human rights advocate.
 Mr. Hu, an advocate for people with AIDS, dispossessed farmers and the environment, has accused the authorities of failing to live up to promises to improve human rights before the Olympics.
 He has been charged with subverting state power.
 Ms. Rice said she had also called on China to use its influence to persuade North Korea to speed the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program.
 North Korea, in a 2005 agreement with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, pledged to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in return for economic and diplomatic incentives.
 North Korea also promised to disclose all of its nuclear arms programs by the end of 2007. But it has failed to meet this deadline.
 The North counters that the other parties have not moved quickly enough on promises to provide fuel and to remove North Korea from the United States' list of nations that sponsor terrorism.

HEADLINE: Binding Emissions Treaty Still a Possibility, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; James Kanter reported from Paris, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A senior White House official on Tuesday outlined a new tactic aimed at convincing a skeptical Europe that the Bush administration would support a meaningful agreement to limit global warming.
 The official, James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the United States could accept a binding treaty if it included mandatory steps by China and other big developing countries as well. 
 An acceptable pact, he said, would have all the world's economic powerhouses, established or emerging, agree to a long-term goal for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions at some point, and commit to take measurable, verifiable steps domestically in the short term. 
 The new approach reflected a shift in tone and language by the Bush administration on climate negotiations. Instead of focusing on what it would reject, the statements focused on what the United States would accept. And echoing language Mr. Bush made in his State of the Union address, they indicated that the United states was not intractably opposed to binding commitments.
 Mr. Connaughton and other American officials are capital-hopping in Europe this week in an effort to gain momentum for climate talks organized last year by the United States among the countries responsible for the brunt of greenhouse-gas emissions. President Bush has pledged to forge an agreement on a long-term goal for emissions cuts and short-term steps among those countries by the end of 2008. 
 ''We are prepared to put our national plans into an international agreement if other countries do, too,'' Mr. Connaughton said by telephone from Berlin. A prerequisite for the United States agreeing on a pact with mandatory measures, he said, would be binding commitments from the largest developing countries.
 For years, the White House often shaped its stance in climate talks around what it was not willing to do, specifically anything it thought would harm the economy or any action not accompanied by meaningful moves by big developing countries.
 Mr. Connaughton acknowledged that this framing might have obscured the administration's willingness to agree on a treaty with the right components. 
 ''What was missing from that was the inverse,'' Mr. Connaughton said. ''We would have an interest in joining an internationally binding agreement as long as China and India are also legally bound.''
 That is a very big condition, particularly because the major developing countries have insisted that they have the right to expand their economies -- and emissions -- so long as the emissions did not approach the much higher per-capita emissions rates that are the norm in the world's industrialized powers. 
 Mr. Connaughton noted the stark difference in stances, saying the language agreed to in the latest round of United Nations negotiations on climate, in Indonesia last December, was far too bifurcated, with developed countries agreeing to negotiate toward binding ''commitments'' and developing countries pursuing only nonbinding ''actions.'' 
 Environmental campaigners criticized the new stance, saying the United States committed in the original climate treaty, negotiated in 1992, that the developed countries would step first.
 ''We still think the right posture for the United States is to honor the deal made in 1992 by the first President Bush, which is to show leadership among the industrialized countries and get out there and make some real commitments,'' said David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''That will then allow us to ask for real meaningful commitments from developing countries.''

HEADLINE: The Politics Of Trade In Ohio

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Watching Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton compete with each other to say the nastiest possible thing about the Nafta trade deal has made me think about the politics of abortion.
 In campaign after campaign for more than 30 years now, Republicans have been denouncing Roe v. Wade. Yet even though they have held the White House for most of that time -- and made 12 of the last 14 Supreme Court appointments -- abortion remains legal.
 This straddling has served Republicans well. They have been able to win over voters who care about abortion above all else without alienating swing voters, most of whom, polls show, think it should be legal at least some of the time. Talking tough and governing gently helped the party build a majority.
 Now come Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, campaigning across Ohio with a similar kind of tough talk about foreign trade. Based on what they're saying, you'd have to conclude that they believe that Nafta and other trade agreements have caused Ohio's huge economic problems. 
 ''She says speeches don't put food on the table,'' Mr. Obama said in Youngstown. ''You know what? Nafta didn't put food on the table, either.'' Later, he went further, claiming that Ohio's workers have ''watched job after job after job disappear because of bad trade deals like Nafta.''
 Mrs. Clinton's advisers, meanwhile, have been putting out the word that she tried to persuade her husband not to support Nafta -- which liberalized trade with Mexico and Canada -- when he was running for president. (He did support it, aggressively, and signed it into law in 1993.) ''I'm not just going to talk about what's wrong with Nafta,'' she said in Youngstown, the day after Mr. Obama had been there. ''I'm going to fix it and I have a four-point plan to do exactly that.''
 But when you read this plan, or Mr. Obama's trade agenda, you discover none of it is particularly radical. Neither candidate calls for a repeal of Nafta, or anything close to it. Both instead want to tinker with the bureaucratic innards of the agreement. They want stronger ''labor and environmental standards'' and better ''enforcement mechanisms.''
 It's a bit of an odd situation. They call the country's trade policy a disaster, and yet their plan to fix it starts with, um, cracking down on Mexican pollution. 
 The question this raises is what Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton would really do about Ohio's troubles if one of them became president -- and whether it would make a difference.
 There is no doubt that trade has hurt many people in Ohio. In just the last few months, Alcatel-Lucent has announced plans to close a telecommunications equipment factory in Columbus and move some of the jobs to China, while a steel-door plant near Youngstown shut its doors and shipped some of its equipment to Mexico.
 Back in 2000, the typical Ohio family was still making more money than the typical American family, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. But over the last eight years, real median income in Ohio has dropped almost 10 percent, to about $47,000, leaving it $2,300 below the national median.
 ''Trade has winners and losers,'' said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and a Democrat, ''and there have been a lot of losers in Ohio.''
 The first problem with what the candidates have been saying is that Ohio's troubles haven't really been caused by trade agreements. When Nafta took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, Ohio had 990,000 manufacturing jobs. Two years later, it had 1.03 million. The number remained above one million for the rest of the 1990s, before plummeting in this decade to just 775,000 today. 
 It's hard to look at this history and conclude Nafta is the villain. In fact, Nafta did little to reduce tariffs on Mexican manufacturers, notes Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth economist. Those tariffs were already low before the agreement was signed.
 A more important cause of Ohio's jobs exodus is the rise of China, India and the old Soviet bloc, which has brought hundreds of millions of workers into the global economy. New technology and better transportation have then made it easier for jobs to be done in those places and elsewhere. To put it in concrete terms, your credit card's customer service center isn't in Ireland because of a new trade deal.
 All this global competition has brought some big benefits, too. Consider that cars, furniture, clothing, computers and televisions -- which are all subject to global competition -- have become more affordable, relative to everything else. Medical care, movie tickets and college tuition -- all protected from such competition -- have become more expensive.
 So what can be done for Ohio?
 There is actually a fair amount of agreement among economists on this question. The solution should involve more government investment in infrastructure, the medical sciences, alternative energy and other areas that could produce good new jobs. A more strategic approach to investment, one less based on the whims of individual members of Congress, would also help. 
 ''While our competitors -- China and others -- are investing heavily in infrastructure,'' Donald Plusquellic, the mayor of Akron, the world's onetime rubber capital, told me, ''we've done a terrible job reinvesting in America.'' 
 But as Mr. Slaughter, a former adviser to President Bush, points out, the payoff from these investments won't come for a long time. They will do little to help former factory workers who have had to take lower-paying jobs -- which is one reason that calling for new investments doesn't bring nearly the cheers on the campaign trail that denouncing Nafta does. 
 The best way to help those workers, Mr. Slaughter argues, is to cut their taxes and make the tax code more progressive. This would allow global trade to continue expanding the country's economic pie, while making sure that high-income workers weren't the only ones benefiting. 
 Here, finally, is where we get to the good news about the Ohio campaign. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton favor all these ideas. They both want to invest in infrastructure, science and alternative energy, and they both want to cut taxes for everyone but the affluent. Mr. Obama, in particular, has proposed a cut in payroll taxes, perhaps the most regressive part of the tax code.
 Over the last week, the candidates' talk has, at times, been silly and even inaccurate. And Ohio's problems would certainly be easier to solve if, as Luis Proenza, president of the University of Akron put it, the candidates were ''more true to reality and less prone to invective.''
 But the larger problem is that Ohio's voters have good reason to be angry. For years, they have been promised that globalization was making the United States a richer country. They're still waiting for their share of the bounty.

HEADLINE: NEWS ANALYSIS; Raul Castro Hints at Change, but Cuba Remains Wary

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
In his first state reception as Cuba's president, Raul Castro met Tuesday not with leftist Latin American leaders like Hugo Chavez and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, nor with Chinese officials, but with the secretary of state of the Vatican, a traditional enemy of Communism and a critic of Cuba's record on human rights.
 Mr. Castro's decision to begin his tenure by meeting the Vatican's top diplomat, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, a possible go-between with the United States and Europe, reflects his practical, no-nonsense style as well as his greater willingness to put ideology aside to achieve his goals than his brother often showed.
 Mr. Castro, who is 76 years old, is hardly a fresh face to Cubans, having served as the defense minister for the past half century. Many people doubt that he intends to upend his brother's legacy. Yet he does seem inclined to govern more pragmatically than his more doctrinaire and romantic brother, who ran this country for 49 years as if it were his own business, signing off on almost every government decision. 
 Raul Castro has said the government needs to shrink and become more compact. He has promised ''structural changes'' and ''big decisions.'' ''We have to make our government's management more efficient,'' he said Sunday, adding, ''We have to plan well, and we cannot spend more than we have.''
 Since he became acting president after Fidel Castro fell ill and disappeared from public view in July 2006, Raul Castro has sought to improve public transportation and shake up the state-controlled dairy monopoly. He also shocked people when he acknowledged that the average salary of about $19 a month was too little to live on. As he took office Sunday, he raised the possibility of revaluing the Cuban peso to give salary-earners greater buying power. Raul Castro's decision on Sunday to put his closest friends and loyalists in the major positions of vice president and defense minister also suggests that he has control of the government, even though he has promised to consult Fidel Castro on important matters.
 Despite such steps, many Cubans say they see few signs of real change. Some say they suspect that Fidel Castro will continue to rule from behind the scenes. Others see little ideological difference between the ex-president and his brother. Still others argue that the centralized bureaucratic apparatus of the state is too rusty to be reformed.
 A young man stood in Havana's central park on Monday, scanning the faces of the new government leaders, his face scrunched up in puzzled concentration. When a reporter asked him what he thought of the new president, he muttered, ''It's good,'' rattled the paper shut and marched quickly away, casting a furtive glance at a nearby police officer.
 ''Everyone is afraid to talk,'' said a student sitting on a park bench nearby who identified himself only as Alejandro. ''This is the time when the people should go to the street, but they are afraid. My country is like a prison.''
 A few blocks away, Jose, a store clerk in his 30s, was waiting in line outside a post office in Old Havana to send an e-mail message to a family friend through a secure Internet connection that allows no other contact with the outside world. 
 ''There was no change,'' he said, echoing the views of others. ''Look, if you paint this tile here and you paint it with the same color, there is no change. The brothers think alike.''
 Many experts on Cuba, however, say the two brothers often have not seen eye to eye. They have clashed over the years on everything from Fidel Castro's short-lived flirtation with the American public in 1959 to the necessity of allowing some private enterprise during the economic crisis here in the 1990s. 
 Fidel Castro, who is 81, was renowned for his ability to recall arcane details and second-guess his cabinet members, fostering an atmosphere in which even high-ranking officials were afraid to act without the president's explicit approval. 
 Raul Castro, who spent much of his life at the head of Cuba's military, has a reputation for delegating authority and demanding results from managers, people who know him say. ''He once said to me after I had given a report at a meeting, 'All right, this is your report, if one word of this is not true, I'm going to cut you in half,' '' recalled Vladimiro Roca, a former fighter pilot who fell out with the authorities and has become a leading dissident.
 Fidel Castro often rambled on for hours in sometimes dull but occasionally stunning oratory. Raul Castro gives short, precise speeches, always going directly to the heart of his subject. Where Fidel Castro sought the international limelight, his brother focuses more on bread-and-butter domestic issues.
 In recent public speeches, Raul Castro appears to have calculated for political reasons that he cannot distance himself too much from his brother, who, despite his long illness, continues to lead the Communist Party and to cast a large shadow over Cuban politics. 
 For example, the new president made it clear in his first speech to the National Assembly over the weekend that he would continue to consult Fidel and even asked for a vote to authorize him to do so, drawing extended applause from party regulars.
 But the younger Castro's actions show that he is willing to take Cuba in a different direction from that of his more dogmatic brother. Over the last year and a half, Raul Castro has openly criticized state salaries as too low to live on, and speaking to the Congress, he raised the possibility of revaluing the Cuban peso to give salary-earners more buying power.
 Mr. Castro has taken steps to decentralize the production and distribution of milk. He has imported hundreds of buses from China to alleviate transportation woes and rid the streets of tractor-trailers fitted out for public transportation, eyesores known as camels. He has all but done away with the obligatory mass demonstrations Fidel Castro often organized to rally people against the United States. 
 The younger Castro has even encouraged a measure of public debate about government programs, something his brother rarely allowed. Last fall, he authorized town hall meetings across the island to let people vent their frustrations with the system, though he made it clear that decisions about changes would rest with the ruling party.
 Indeed, one of the two state newspapers, Juventud Rebelde, has done exposes on the filching of goods and food from state-run businesses that has become part of life here. Leading cultural figures, meanwhile, have called for dropping onerous visa requirements and other limits on personal freedom.
 Raul Castro seems firmly in control of the Council of State, the main governing body. He named his old friends and military comrades -- Jose Ramon Machado Ventura and Gen. Julio Casas Reguiero -- as first vice president and defense minister, respectively. 
 The upper echelon of the council is stacked with other military leaders who are considered close to the new president, among them Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra and Juan Almeida Bosque. 
 ''This is Raul's team, the group of vice presidents,'' said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst who wrote the book ''After Fidel'' and has studied the brothers for years. ''I do think that Raul is in charge. He's going to pay proper homage to Fidel but not obeisance.''
 What is more, Raul Castro says he will not officially appoint the rest of his cabinet until December at the earliest. Some political analysts says this gives him time to purge the cabinet members considered to be more loyal to his brother than to him if he wishes. 
 Still, after 49 years of living under Fidel Castro, many Cubans are skeptical of their new leader's ability to get things done. They are waiting for Raul Castro to do something concrete to improve their lives, like raise salaries. 
 ''His speech sounded more or less like more of the same,'' said Alberto, a veteran driver for the official government taxi service. ''There is a big gap between what is said and what is done.''
 Yoani Sanchez, who writes a political blog, said: ''In general there is a sense of frustration because we had expected more. There is talk of changes, but he puts off defining those changes.'' 
 Still, many Cubans took heart that Mr. Castro had promised in his speech to lift some regulations and restrictions that stifle economic growth. 
 For starters, he said it was time to revalue the Cuban peso, a step toward getting rid of the dual-currency system that has impoverished millions of Cubans. For years, the government has used a nearly worthless peso to pay government salaries while restricting the distribution of a so-called convertible peso that can be exchanged for foreign currency. 
 The system has led to a kind of economic apartheid. Cubans with access to convertible pesos live far better than their compatriots. Those who live solely on government salaries can barely survive, even with free health care and subsidized rations of some basic foodstuffs and tobacco.
 Restrictions on travel and access to the Internet also rankle many Cubans, who believe the rules are virtually imprisoning them on their island. University students recently clashed with the president of the National Assembly over travel rights, a scene that was filmed and distributed clandestinely. Some Cubans expect Mr. Castro might lift some travel restrictions as a crowd-pleaser. Others said they hoped they would be allowed to own cellphones and to stay at tourist hotels, small but symbolically important steps. 
 In the long run, however, his biggest challenge is revamping Cuba's centralized economy. Raul Castro said in his first speech to Parliament that the government needed to be streamlined and decentralized. No institution was safe from reforms, he said.
 Yet his appointees are themselves members of the old guard, mostly men in their 70s. That disappointed some here who had hoped a younger generation of technocrats might rise. 
 In some circles there is a feeling the veterans of the revolution can never dismantle the current economic system, which offers people little incentive to work. 
 ''Raul has to make the country more efficient and give incentives to for work because really no one works in Cuba now,'' said Juan, a man in his forties who acts as a consultant to importers. ''How do you put a country to work that isn't used to working? That is the trick.''

HEADLINE: Vladimir Putin's Russia

 BODY:
The eight years of Vladimir Putin's presidency have faithfully reflected his formative years in the Soviet secret police. Mr. Putin's term ends this spring, but he is nearly certain to become prime minister. That means, we fear, that little will change. The next American president will have to deal with a Russia that is not only nuclear-armed but increasingly wealthy and increasingly authoritarian. 
 Mr. Putin has not tried to reimpose the bankrupt Communist economic system or reopen Stalin's Gulag Archipelago. He has used the Kremlin's full powers to quash all serious political opposition, recreating a virtual one-party state. That was the depressing message reported this week by our colleague Clifford J. Levy in an account of December's parliamentary election contest in Nizhny Novgorod, a city once synonymous with Russia's brightest hopes for democratic renewal. 
 It was there that an elderly Andrei Sakharov emerged from internal exile to wage his final campaign of speaking truth to power and urging those who held power to finally tell the Russian people the truth. And it was there that Boris Nemtsov, one of the most promising leaders of a new generation of Russian reformers, tried to build a new model of democratic governance. 
 Things are very different these days in Nizhny Novgorod. Mr. Putin's allies have used threats of physical harm and other tactics -- chillingly reminiscent of Soviet days -- to crush rivals. A foreman warned workers that they risked punishment if they did not vote for Mr. Putin's party. Children were told by their teachers that their grades could suffer unless they encouraged their parents to vote correctly.
 Mr. Putin's party would have triumphed without these tactics. The goal was to create a climate of permanent political intimidation. How like the credo Mr. Putin learned in his old K.G.B. days. 
 President Bush, and soon his successor, will have to come to terms with the authoritarian Russia that is -- not the democratic Russia that recent American administrations had hoped would take root after Communism. They will have to deal pragmatically with the realities of Russian power, as the Nixon and George H.W. Bush administrations once did, seeking cooperation when possible over issues like Iran, Kosovo and arms control.
 And, as in the Carter and Reagan administrations, America will need to champion Russia's persecuted democrats, journalists and other embattled minorities: amplifying their voices and calling international attention to the very real dangers they face. Descending back into cold war rhetoric and reflexes will not help anyone. But neither will pretending that Mr. Putin and his allies are people of good will and democratic intentions.

HEADLINE: Ohioans Hear Populist Pleas By Democrats

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio 

 BODY:
For as long as anyone here can remember, presidential hopefuls have made this scrappy, blue-collar stronghold an obligatory pit stop on the Democratic stump.
 Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy breezed through when the steel plants still turned the night sky orange; decades later, after the smelters had gone cold, Bill Clinton and John Kerry came by promising jobs to those left idle by the mill closings.
 Now it is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton playing Dolly Parton's ''9 to 5'' at her rallies here, and Senator Barack Obama promising local residents middle-class tax breaks. Both campaigns are aware that winning the affection of Youngstown's lunch-bucket voters and the party faithful can make all the difference in taking Ohio, a swing state whose delegates almost always wind up in the pocket of the candidate who takes the White House.
 Although they view such speeches with a jaundiced eye -- and a good number dismiss such talk as little more than pandering -- many Youngstown residents say they are excited by pledges that speak to their anxieties. If there is any unanimity among voters here, it is that the Bush administration has fueled Youngstown's downward spiral by somehow encouraging corporate investment overseas. 
 Neil Buzzazzo, 75, a former steel worker who reinvented himself as a carpenter after the mills closed, described himself as a Clinton supporter but said he appreciated that both Democrats were actually talking about ways to revive Ohio's long-suffering manufacturing belt. 
 ''At least they're talking about the little guy,'' said Mr. Buzzazzo, whose son was forced to move to North Carolina to find work. ''I like the fact that they're talking about keeping jobs here, so the children don't have to leave.''
 But for every optimist here, there are two or three hard-bitten cynics who dismiss the pledges and resent the politicians for using Youngstown as a showcase for economic distress. They remember the day Mr. Clinton rode into town promising a Pentagon payroll-processing center with room for 7,000 workers (it went elsewhere), and the time Mr. Kerry set up his dais in front of a boarded-up building so the cameras would show Youngstown's ugly rump even though there was a new state office complex on the other side of the street. 
 ''We're sick and tired of the empty promises and the same old story line about Youngstown and the mills,'' said Phil Kidd, 28, a blogger and community activist who has sold 10,000 T-shirts that shout ''Defend Youngstown'' over the image of a steelworker wielding a sledgehammer. ''The problem is that this is a rubber-stamp Democratic area so they know it's almost a guarantee they're going to get our vote. We just have to hope that this time whoever wins won't forget about us.''
 Both Democratic candidates have promised to remember, kicking off their Ohio campaigns here with fiery populist speeches they hope will appeal to the 100,000 Democratic stalwarts who live up and down the Mahoning Valley, the cradle of the Ohio steel industry and a place that has been shedding union-wage manufacturing jobs for the last 30 years. 
 Although Mrs. Clinton enjoys widespread support among industrial unions and the state's Democratic establishment, including Ohio's popular governor, Ted Strickland, polls have shown that her early lead has shrunk. 
 ''Clinton clearly has an advantage in Ohio, but then again, Obama has done a good job at eroding those advantages in other states,'' said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron. ''Any little thing between now and March 4 could make all the difference and turn things around in Obama's favor.''
 For now, both campaigns are zeroing in on Ohio's urban areas, which hold most of the state's 141 delegates. Between the two of them, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have made nearly 20 appearances in Ohio in the last few weeks, including stops in Dayton, Toledo, Akron, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and, of course, Youngstown.
 Mrs. Clinton made two visits to the Youngstown area in February, starting with a speech at a General Motors plant, where she held aloft a pair of boxing gloves and pledged to rescind corporate tax breaks and renegotiate trade agreements that she said encouraged companies to move jobs outside the country.
 Two days later, as the Dolly Parton song blasted over a gymnasium sound system, Mrs. Clinton strode into a Youngstown high school and provoked the biggest cheers by promising to bring back manufacturing to a place that has lost 18,500 factory jobs since 1996. 
 ''You know, some people may call this the Rust Belt, but that's not what I see,'' she said. ''I see communities where young people should be able to find good jobs and no one should ever have to leave their family to earn their living.''
 Mr. Obama has also honed his message to tap into the anger and despair heightened by growing unemployment and the foreclosures that have felled 79,000 homeowners in the state. In a speech at Youngstown State University, he told the crowd he would give generous tax breaks to the middle class, establish a $10 billion fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure and provide incentives to companies that invest in struggling cities. 
 ''Everywhere I go -- not just in Youngstown, but everywhere -- you see people who have worked in a plant for 20 years, put their heart and soul into building profits for shareholders,'' he said. ''Suddenly, the rug's pulled out from under them; the job's shipped overseas. They don't have health care. They don't have a pension. They're trying to compete with their teenage kids for a job paying seven bucks an hour at the local fast-food joint.''
 If the after-work crowd at the Golden Dawn tavern is any guide, Mrs. Clinton still enjoys solid support from the men whose rough hands and plain-spoken ways put them in the coveted demographic that analysts say hold the key to winning Ohio next Tuesday. 
 Many of the men who were sitting at the bar and salting their goblets of beer had clearly absorbed Mrs. Clinton's contention that her opponent is too inexperienced to be president. 
 ''I like Obama's energy, but I don't think he has the muscle to do the heavy lifting,'' said Chris Vitello, 49, a self-employed contractor with arthritic knees who said his biggest concern was health care. Mr. Vitello said he struggled to pay a $1,300 monthly insurance premium and with ''Youngstown's economy in the toilet,'' it is getting increasingly hard to find home-improvement customers.
 ''Whoever can get a handle on health care and stop sending our jobs to China gets my vote,'' he said looking away from an Obama advertisement that played on the television over the bar.
 Conversations with a score of voters indicated that Mrs. Clinton seemed to benefit from the enduring popularity of her husband, whose presidency is largely associated with better times here, even if he pushed through Nafta, the trade agreement whose mere mention provokes as much ire as the name Osama bin Laden. 
 The Golden Dawn's owner, Ralph Naples, prompted hearty nods when he said the election of Mrs. Clinton would be akin to putting Bill Clinton back in office. ''She's been in the White House before,'' Mr. Naples, 88, shouted from behind the bar, to which his son, Johnny, added: ''Yeah, her husband has been on the ropes before, and she was there for all of that.'' 
 The best place to find Obama supporters is downtown, where lawyers who work at the county courthouse and students from Youngstown State fill the smattering of bars and restaurants that have begun to resuscitate the empty storefronts along Federal Plaza East. Scott A. Leonard, 49, an English professor at the university, said he had been astounded by the energy coursing through a student body that seldom shows interest in politics. 
 ''The excitement is contagious,'' said Professor Leonard, who became an enthusiastic Obama supporter after seeing him speak on campus. ''People in this valley have felt so defeated for so long that when Obama talks about fast-food jobs, it resonates. For me, this is the first time in my life I've encountered a candidate who makes me think substantial change is possible.''

Unions: Union membership remains high, although it is declining with layoffs. Union voters favored Mrs. Clinton by 51 percent to 44 percent in the contests on Feb. 5. But Mr. Obama may be gaining here as his winning streak gives him stature. ''Among white, blue-collar Democrats, the question of who is most likely to win in November is really important,'' said Paul Beck, an Ohio State University political scientist.
Conservatives: The conservative western part of the state, including Cincinnati, is mostly Republican. Mrs. Clinton has shown strength in the kind of rural, socially conservative counties that make up much of this part of the state. Non- Democrats in Ohio can change party registration at the polls.
In the Cities: The urban northeast holds about one-fifth of voters. Blacks in Cleveland are likely to vote in overwhelming numbers for Mr. Obama. In Columbus, a large college population could also be an advantage for him.
In the Suburbs, Smaller Cities Working-class whites in cities and suburbs are the state's biggest voting bloc, and such voters have been among Mrs. Clinton's most stalwart supporters. The Clintons have made numerous visits to Cleveland suburbs, as well as Akron, Youngstown and Canton.
Unemployment: The rural Appalachian counties in the southeast are struggling with the highest unemployment rates. Bill Clinton has made visits to Steubenville and Marietta.
 141 unpledged delegates 92 delegates are allocated proportionally based on the results in each of the state's 18 Congressional districts. 49 delegates will be divided among candidates based on the statewide results. (MAPS BY ERIN AIGNER)

HEADLINE: One of 5 Bidders Backs Off On Building Over Railyards

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
One of the five bidders for the development rights over the West Side railyards failed to submit a revised offer on Tuesday for the tract, the largest development site in Manhattan.
 The bidder, Brookfield Properties, said that it still believed in the viability of the West Side site, but that it was going to focus on a separate project, on Ninth Avenue.
 Four other companies submitted their second-round offers on Tuesday, although they expressed concerns about a softening economy and the difficulty in financing large real estate projects today. The companies are loath to talk publicly about their bids for fear of alienating the owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 ''We made the changes we had to make,'' one developer said, asserting that the value of his bid had remained unchanged. ''The economics remain the same.''
 But it was unclear what guarantees each developer provided the transportation authority that it would start and complete the project.
 The railyards, which sit on both sides of 11th Avenue, between 30th and 33rd Streets, represent both a huge 26-acre opportunity for developers and an enormous risk, because the winner must spend three years and $1.5 billion building a platform over the yards before erecting any tower.
 City and state officials view the project, which would take more than a decade to complete, as a key to transforming the once-industrial neighborhood into a vibrant commercial and residential district. The transportation authority has said that it wants to pick a winner by mid-March.
 Three of the bidders have said that they have agreements with anchor tenants that would presumably help ensure their ability to move forward regardless of the economy. To test the solidity of those agreements, the transportation authority has asked bidders to provide documentation on the terms of those deals.
 A partnership of the Durst Organization and Vornado Realty Trust has a tentative agreement with Conde Nast Publications, the magazine publisher whose headquarters are in Times Square. And Related Companies, one of the city's largest residential builders, has proposed building a headquarters complex for the News Corporation, which owns The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and the Fox television network.
 Tishman Speyer Properties has formed a partnership with Morgan Stanley, the global investment bank, to build new headquarters and to finance the project. But the investment bank wants to be able to move into a tower in the next couple of years; otherwise it may drop out.
 One other active developer, Extell Development Company, also submitted an offer.
 Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield, said yesterday that he hoped to continue a dialogue with the transportation authority. The move seemed to leave open the possibility, however faint, that Brookfield could form a partnership with one of the remaining bidders.
 In any event, Mr. Clark said that Brookfield was making a $600 million investment in building a three-acre platform over a site on Ninth Avenue, between 31st and 33rd Streets, where it plans eventually to build two large office towers.
 In January, the transportation authority told bidders that it would prefer to lease the development rights, rather than sell them outright as it had initially indicated. The change drew complaints from the bidders at a moment when some economists were predicting a recession.
 A lease would allow the M.T.A. to raise the rent periodically, but it might also make it more difficult to gauge the value of the offers, because each bidder could use a different set of variables to estimate the net present value of the lease.
 Depending on how the bidders arrange the sequence of payments, it may also be some time before the authority gets a substantial amount of money from the project. At one time, the authority had planned to raise $1 billion from the sale or lease of the property for its current capital budget.
 The transportation authority told bidders in January that their second bids would be used to eliminate proposals that did not fall within a competitive range and to commence negotiations with the remaining bidders.

HEADLINE: To G.E., a Chinese Olympics Is Just Made for a Global Message

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
SO, how do you say ''Imagination at Work'' in Chinese?
 Actually, that is easy enough to answer -- just check the Chinese characters next to the General Electric logo in the ads on billboards, in newspapers and in airports throughout Beijing and Shanghai. With its ''Imagination at Work'' ad campaign into its fifth year, G.E. has the nuances of both the language and the concept down pat.
 But now, with sales to emerging economies representing the fastest-growing chunk of the company's revenues, G.E. is tackling a more complex problem: How can it effectively prove to potential customers and shareholders in the developed world that G.E.'s creativity is translating into big sales in the developing one? 
 G.E.'s answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is to make the biggest splash it can at the Beijing Olympics. 
 The company is building an imagination center in the middle of the Olympic Green, a two-story building that is half fun house, half museum exhibit. And it is putting the finishing touches on a series of print ads and commercials that put an Olympic spin on its effort to bring desalination technology to the Middle East, X-ray technology to China and heart monitoring gear to India.
 ''We want to humanize G.E. even as we show worldwide investors that G.E. is a major player in the world,'' said Don Schneider, executive creative director at BBDO New York, the Omnicom unit that is G.E.'s longtime advertising agency. 
 This is not G.E.'s first effort to position itself as a global behemoth. Since most G.E. commercials use voice-overs instead of dialogue, it has always been relatively easy -- and relatively cheap -- to translate them into French or German or even Chinese, and for several years G.E. has done so. 
 But lately BBDO has been calling on sister agencies in Shanghai and Europe to help it incorporate actual foreign sensibilities into ads. The Shanghai group, for example, came up with a print ad for desalination techniques that features a school of goldfish swimming in the ocean, with words suggesting that oceans could be reservoirs. Goldfish are ubiquitous in China, and most Chinese know they are freshwater fish and could survive only in salt-free water. ''Americans would never get that,'' Mr. Schneider said. 
 The converse is true too, of course. G.E. has been running a commercial in the United States that shows a tree ''walking'' across a field to embrace a house that uses green technologies. A man watching the incident calls the tree a ''house hugger.'' Since environmentalists are rarely called tree-huggers in China, the humor would fall flat. 
 But such cultural segmentation will not wash during the Olympics. It is one of the true international events, as well as one attended by many executives, who often invite their companies' customers to come along. That means it gives G.E. access not only to the 2,000 people the company itself is bringing in, but to the people its competitors are bringing in. 
 ''On television the Olympics looks like an athletic event, but on location it's a big business convention,'' said Nicholas Donatiello Jr., president of the brand research firm Odyssey. 
 That is exactly the platform G.E. needs, said James R. Gregory, chief executive of the brand strategy firm CoreBrand. ''They don't have universal brand awareness outside of the United States, and the Olympics gives them the international forum to get it,'' he said. 
 In fact, the company is not waiting for the Olympics. It has developed several new print ads that use decidedly non-Western images and themes. A water purification ad observes: ''A camel can go without water for 30 days. A growing economy can't.'' A heart monitor ad notes that: ''The nearest heart hospital is three days away. The nearest heart monitor is just up the road.'' One solar energy ad in China depicts a flower holding a light bulb; Americans see a tulip, but the Chinese recognize it as a lotus flower.
 G.E. has a more serious video on its Web site, describing its desalination projects in Algiers. It also has two lighthearted streaming videos on the sites, using a young actor who tours its research centers in Germany. Those have also run on sites like Yahoo, MSN and AOL.
 Judy L. Hu, G.E.'s global executive director for advertising and branding, said that studies showed that viewers of the videos were more likely to see the G.E. brand as ''contemporary, dynamic and improving the quality of life.'' 
 Next month G.E. will begin showing two humorous commercials, one highlighting the inexpensive X-ray machine it developed for China, the other featuring the portable cardiac monitor it has built for India. Also in the pipeline is an ad depicting G.E.'s water recycling activities. 
 The ads are running in Europe and the United States. Although G.E. has not ruled out the possibility of running them in China, that is not on the media schedule right now. Marketing experts understand why.
 ''Power is concentrated in the hands of a few people in China, and you don't reach them through commercials,'' Mr. Donatiello said. Mr. Schneider said that G.E. executives could always give government officials a private viewing of the commercials, while Ms. Hu said that G.E. was working on Olympic-specific spots to run on Chinese TV. 
 G.E., as usual, will not disclose any aspect of its marketing budget. It has one built-in financial advantage: its television ads will, for the most part, run on NBC, MSNBC and various other cable stations that G.E. owns. But it is still clearly pushing a big chunk of money at the Olympics. It hopes to put Olympic-specific ads at local airports and on highway billboards. Even taxi riders are not safe: many taxis will come equipped with interactive G.E. games for passengers' amusement. 
 The Imagination Center, however, is the most daunting endeavor, particularly considering that the building will be dismantled after the Games.
 The exhibits are aimed at adults, with enough just-for-fun features so that a visiting executive need not feel guilty about dragging along the whole family. In the center's wind energy room, children -- or any adult whose inner child is clamoring for attention -- can wave their arms to make digital projections of objects sway in the wind they create. In the water purification room, they will walk on a video projection of water, with each step creating ripples. 
 The only exhibit tied directly to the Games is a digital replica of the Olympics aquatic center, where G.E. is supplying the lighting. The ads and billboards are much more event-specific. 
 The ads show a field tilled to look like a running track (with the tagline, ''Sometimes success is measured in green, not gold''); and windmills arranged in the form of the National Stadium, widely nicknamed the Birdsnest (''May the wind be at your back at the 2008 Beijing Games'') . 
 On the surface, those print ads, the imagination center and the commercials do not seem to coalesce into an integrated campaign. But Ms. Hu said that the lighthearted approach was the glue. ''We are addressing our audience as human beings,'' she said. ''We're not just treating them like execs in three-piece suits.''

HEADLINE: The Long Haul in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
 A whole post-cold-war European generation has grown up in peace, give or take ''some Balkan horror on television,'' which makes it hard to explain that ''it's a political and moral imperative to fight for our core values in the Hindu Kush.''
 The words are those of Jaap de Hoop Scheffer of the Netherlands, the NATO secretary general. As he utters them, he leans forward, insisting that he doesn't think ''Europe is becoming pacifist.'' But Afghanistan is testing European military resolve. It's the long war. It's Europe's Iraq. 
 Just back from Afghanistan, where NATO now has some 50,000 troops deployed, de Hoop Scheffer tells me it will be four to five years before international forces can pull back, taking a limited role in support of the emergent Afghan National Army.
 ''A window of four to five years from now is an interesting window to watch in terms of reaching a situation where our forces are in the background,'' he says. That takes us to 2013 or thereabouts. I wonder if a Europe more energized by carbon footprints than military footholds has the stomach for that.
 Robert Gates, the U.S. defense secretary, has not concealed his concern over European commitment to the better war -- better than Iraq, that is.
 He's had the honesty to say Iraq dampened European zeal to fight in Afghanistan. He's pleaded for more troops and materiel. He's warned that the alliance risks going ''two-tiered,'' with ''some allies willing to fight and die to protect people's security and others who are not.''
 De Hoop Scheffer is categorical: ''I am not overseeing a two-tier alliance.'' Then he pulls back -- ''NATO is not monolithic.'' Among the 26 members there are varying ''caveats.'' For that Latinism read limitations -- set by the German, Spanish, Italian and other governments -- on when, why and where soldiers will fight and die rather than do the soft-power, school-building, Euro thing.
 ''As secretary general, I will always advocate zero caveats and if zero is not achievable, I will fight for the least possible,'' he tells me. ''But I have to be realistic. If I must choose between forces with caveats or no forces at all, my choice is easily made.''
 That's understandable: 3,200 German troops in the quiet north are better than none. But as I've said before, it's time for some Bundesmacht, or German war-fighting commitment.
 Hauling Afghanistan from the Middle Ages and the Taliban's vestigial clutches will involve every lever of power -- economic, social, diplomatic and military. The last of these is not the least. If solidarity dissolves at the point of danger, the war's lost.
 Already, Canada, which does front-line stuff in the Afghan south, speaks of withdrawing its 2,500 troops if European allies don't do more. The United States just committed 3,200 additional marines. No better front exists for President Nicolas Sarkozy of France to demonstrate his increased alliance commitment. He should dispatch more French troops.
 ''We are missing 10 percent of the military requirement we have set ourselves,'' de Hoop Scheffer says. The shortfall includes close to two dozen training teams for the Afghan Army. ''I am not happy until I get what we need. I want 100 percent.''
 But if NATO gives more, so should President Hamid Karzai. ''He can do better in fighting corruption and seeing that noncorrupt police chiefs are appointed,'' de Hoop Scheffer says.
 In one measure of the political disarray, Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been getting daily calls from Afghan politicians urging him to run for president next year. He says he won't. Still, the impression is widespread that Karzai's office resembles a tea house.
 Karzai blames Pakistan for the Taliban's resurgence. He's not wrong. U.S. policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan has been all over the place. De Hoop Scheffer says: ''NATO must enter into a serious dialogue with a new Pakistani government soon because those destabilizing Pakistan are the same as those destabilizing Afghanistan.''
 I see Europeans yawning. Can Waziristan really be a threat to the West? O.K., the frontier regions are where Ayman al-Zawahiri and other Al Qaeda leaders are said to be hiding, but they're isolated. As for the Madrid and London bombings, bad stuff happens. Always did, always will.
 Such insouciance is an alliance failure. NATO has failed to prove its relevance to a post-modern European generation. NATO needs re-branding. It needs to be more hip in getting across where a precious peace came from.
 I'd start with an ad campaign in which Poles or Slovaks enthuse about locking in security and freedom through NATO membership. Ask the Macedonians, Albanians and Croats why they're banging on NATO's door. Ukraine and Georgia should also be welcomed one day: Let the Russians, who once subjugated them, bleat.
 Kabul is an unlikely Berlin, but as pivotal.

HEADLINE: William F. Buckley Jr.

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

 BODY:
When William F. Buckley Jr.'s ''God and Man at Yale'' appeared in 1951, the critic and conservative sage Peter Viereck dismissed it as jejune, a word much favored by Mr. Buckley in his later years to describe views he regarded as uninformed by experience. Mr. Buckley's fierce denunciation of collectivism and atheism on the Yale faculty was all to the good, Mr. Viereck said, but it fell far short of the ''profound'' conservative manifesto that needed to be written. 
 To do that, Mr. Buckley -- who was one year out of Yale, where he had thundered away on the editorial pages of the Yale Daily News -- would have to marinate in the paradoxes of the human condition and endure ''the dark night of the soul.'' Only then could he aspire to parity with great conservative thinkers like Edmund Burke, Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill. 
 When the news arrived Wednesday of Mr. Buckley's death at the age of 82, the image that jumped to mind was not of dark nights of the soul (though for all I know he may have endured them) but of a witty and gracious man who enjoyed sailing, skiing, writing, good food and drink, Latinate constructions and strenuous debate. He had a mischievous sense of humor and must surely have laughed when he heard himself mentioned in the same sentence as Burke or Disraeli.
 His views -- an amalgam of Friedrich Hayek's free-market economics, Russell Kirk's cultural conservatism and Whittaker Chambers's anti-Communism -- were hardly original. What was pioneering was his insistence on giving conservatism as he saw it a voice and a forum. That was National Review, the magazine that Mr. Buckley founded in 1955. There he fanned a very small flame that, over time, gave the country the Young Americans for Freedom, who gave it Barry Goldwater, who in turn laid the groundwork for Ronald Reagan. 
 There are not many issues on which Mr. Buckley and this page agreed or would agree -- except, perhaps, the war in Iraq, which Mr. Buckley regretted as ''unrealistic'' and ''anything but conservative.'' Yet despite his uncompromising beliefs, Mr. Buckley was firmly committed to civil discourse and showed little appetite for the shrillness that plagues far too much of today's political discourse. 
 For a time back in the 1960s and '70s, Mr. Buckley and the liberal columnist Murray Kempton were something of a traveling road show. And they were friends. Yale's angry young man turned out to be not so angry after all. He hated most of what the liberals stood for. He didn't hate them. ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.

HEADLINE: For 'A' Students in Some Brooklyn Schools, a Cellphone and 130 Free Minutes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
What's the cheapest way to text message your friends? For thousands of the city's middle school students, the answer now is to earn an ''A.'' 
 Education officials began doling out cellphones to 2,500 students on Wednesday as part of a closely watched experiment to try to change the way teenagers think about doing well in school. The pilot program, at three Brooklyn middle schools and four charter schools, is part of an effort by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein to motivate students to perform better academically -- and reward them when they do. 
 Each student is receiving a Samsung flip-phone in a package specially designed with the program's logo. The phones come loaded with 130 prepaid minutes. Good behavior, attendance, homework and test scores will be rewarded with additional minutes. Teachers and administrators will also be able to use a system to send text messages to several students at a time, to remind them, say, of upcoming tests and other school information. 
 Some critics say it is absurd for school officials to reward students with a device that is banned from the public schools. 
 Mr. Klein gamely tried to brush off such criticism during a press conference announcing the start of the program at Intermediate School 349 in Bushwick, Brooklyn. 
 ''Every kid in the city, if they could afford one, would have a cellphone,'' Mr. Klein said. ''They live a life outside of school. It's like anything else. You can play basketball when you're outside school, but you can't play it in the middle of math class.'' 
 As he pulled out a sample phone to show to reporters, Mr. Klein pointedly took the battery out to ensure that the phone could not be used in the school. 
 But no sooner had the press conference ended when one of the teenagers standing behind Mr. Klein proved that even ''A'' students break the rules when it comes to the cellphone ban. 
 Sherilyn Calvo, 12, a seventh grader, said she had brought her phone -- a Sidekick model issued by T-Mobile -- to school nearly every day in the last year. 
 ''I leave it off and never get caught,'' she said matter-of-factly. 
 Sherilyn, who said she was already an ''A'' student, said she was looking forward to getting the text messages reminding her to do her homework or a buzz with the news an upcoming test. 
 ''Sometimes we have five tests at a time,'' she said. ''It's hard to know and remember what you're supposed to study for.'' 
 Orielee Arias, a friend of Sherilyn's standing nearby, said that she forgot a science test a few weeks ago. ''Now that won't happen,'' she said cheerily. ''My teacher can text me.'' 
 The program, called ''Million,'' to refer to the city's 1.1 million students, is being designed and monitored by Roland G. Fryer, a Harvard economist who, as the city's chief equality officer, is also overseeing a project to reward students with cash for doing well on tests. 
 While some have criticized Mr. Fryer's incentive programs, saying they undermine the idea of learning simply for the sake of learning, Mr. Klein has ardently defended the experiments. 
 ''This is not about preaching, this is about reality,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We have an enormous set of challenges of student motivation in their education and finding ways to get those kids excited.'' 
 The $2 million for the pilot cellphone program was raised from private donors through the Fund for Public Schools. The program was substantially scaled back from a target of 10,000 to 15,000 students, in part because the department was unable to raise enough money for so many students. 
 Mr. Fryer is also trying to get celebrities to take part in the program, perhaps by recording messages for the students' phones or offering free concerts. He said he wanted the program to be more creative and extensive than a traditional public service effort.
 ''You can try messaging campaigns by putting up billboards; in my neighborhood back home it was 'Crack is whack, school is cool,' '' Mr. Fryer said, referring to a public service slogan from the 1980s. ''Basically, the message was whack.'' 
 He added, ''We want to reach kids where they are, and where they are is hanging out; they're texting.''

HEADLINE: The Terrible Toll of Art Anxiety

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
TEDDY GREENSPAN is a longtime art collector who does not suffer doubt. He is a bond salesman at Libertas Partners, in Greenwich, Conn., and he and his wife, Emily, recently created an art consulting company in Bedford, N.Y., called tag-arts. The pieces he sells average about $20,000, with a few selling for as much as $90,000; his clients, many of whom work in the financial fields, can well afford them. So you can imagine his frustration when dealing recently with a friend and potential client he calls ''Mr. No-Name Hedge Fund Manager.'' 
 ''He's in his 30s, probably worth 20-some million and feels poor because his personal net worth has gone down from 26 million since last summer,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''He buys a Park Avenue apartment for $7 million, spends another $7 million decorating it, and now he quibbles over $15,000 or $18,000 for a painting.'' 
 As an art consultant, Mr. Greenspan has encountered this kind of conflict before. 
 ''If you are in the process of decorating a home, you know what the sofa costs; you have a good idea of what wallpaper costs,'' he said, but art is different. ''People don't like spending big numbers on things they don't understand. They understand the boat, the fur, the car, but for lack of homework or lack of taste, they just don't understand art.''
 Art paralysis: It is a widespread and often crippling malady, striking everyone from the new college grad in his or her first apartment to the super-rich banker, lasting anywhere from a few months to a lifetime. How many are affected is not known, perhaps because the victims are often too embarrassed to come forth. Who wants to admit that ''I've had these posters since college, I know that as one of the American Top 10 Orthodontists I should get some real art, but I don't know what that means''? Or that ''It's not that I'm trying to make a minimalist statement with these empty white walls, I just don't know what to buy''? Or ''I walk into those snooty galleries in Chelsea and feel like I just don't belong''?
 The fact that there are so many more of these galleries now than there used to be, and that their prices are so much higher -- at least for the moment -- exacerbates the problem. ''Four or five years ago, Chelsea seemed like maybe 30 galleries,'' said Bernard Lumpkin, a producer at MTV News, who began collecting around that time. ''Now it's more like 300. Why would you want to jump in now, when it feels like you're going to drown?'' 
 Joseph Higgins, a 43-year-old portfolio manager in New York with a $900,000 mini-loft in west SoHo and a house in the suburbs, is one of the rare sufferers who will speak openly about his art paralysis. He blames it on galleries, and overcame it, he said, by breaking free of their grasp. 
 ''You're going into an intimidating space and having a curator or a gallery owner ask you 'Do you like this style or this art' when you have no idea what the price tag is,'' he said. ''It's hard to say, I'm browsing, after someone spends time with you in a gallery and tells you 'I'll put it under a light for you' and sets you up in a little room and brings you a cup of coffee.''
 Mr. Higgins started out by using paintingsdirect.com, a Web site that sells the work of hundreds of artists from around the world in categories ranging from landscape to ''fantasy.'' He has bought 14 paintings there and has little patience with those who would sneer at such a site. New York may be a world capital of modern and contemporary art, he said, but he finds the same ''edginess'' online that he does in the galleries of Chelsea, at much lower prices.
 Mitchell Gold, the co-founder of Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams furniture, shares Mr. Higgins's aversion. ''I can't stand going into galleries,'' he said. ''They don't put prices on, you get all worked up, you don't know the price is $20,000 and you think, Gee, I don't want to spend that.'' (His own stores sell photographs by Tipper Gore, for $750 to $2,950, and the prices, he pointed out, are right beside the work.) 
 James Danziger, who runs the Danziger Projects gallery in Chelsea, which specializes in photography, recently took a walk in the neighborhood and saw something he liked. When he asked to see a price list he was told there wasn't one, which happens to be a violation of the city's Truth in Pricing Law. 
 That, Mr. Danziger said, is a tactic you will find in most of the upper-end Chelsea galleries. ''They don't put out price lists,'' he said. ''I said, Can I ask the price of this work? They said it was $:2,500. I said, Oh, we're dealing in pounds now? It was a German artist based in London, but I think if you were a nervous Nellie and asked for a price, and they said no, and finally they gave you a price in pounds, you'd have every reason not to buy.''
 Art paralysis takes many forms. In addition to the would-be buyers who are intimidated by galleries, there are those worried about making an unfashionable choice; those obsessed with investment value; and those who return to a gallery for months, even years, never buying a thing. (Some of these suffer from a form of art paralysis that Stephen Nordlinger, the president of the Foundry Gallery in Washington, calls red dot syndrome -- a desperate longing only for those pieces bearing the red dots that show they've been sold.) And then there are the people whose reasons make no sense at all, at least to those doing the selling.
 ''I had a whole series of these great chocolates, 10-by-10 inches on boards, $900 a piece,'' said Armand Bolling, the director of Karen Lynne Galleries, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Beverly Hills, Calif., which specialize in large-scale figurative oil paintings. ''I held it up on the wall and this lady says, 'It makes me depressed.' I'm like, Is this lady out of her mind? It's a piece of chocolate.'' 
 Mr. Bolling warmed to his theme. ''You go in a house, you see 16 empty walls and two pieces, and one they probably got at an auction for Crohn's or colitis for $500, and the other was given to them. These people aren't buying art.''
 Amy Marx, a Maryland painter whose work features images of violent storms and tornadoes, and who currently has a show at OK Harris in SoHo, where her large pieces are listed at between $8,500 and $12,500, remembers protracted discussions with a family in Maryland a few years ago. ''I stretched all these paintings specifically for them,'' Ms. Marx said. ''He'' -- the man of the house -- ''said they love them, they want to buy them. Then he called up the next day and said, ''Well, since 9/11, you know.''' We're not talking Manhattan, we're not talking the Pentagon, we're talking Prince George's County in Maryland; nothing happened.'' 
 One major reason for art paralysis, many experts say, is the feeling that when buying art you are opening yourself to ridicule. ''Art has always been a barometer of class,'' said Jonathan Santlofer, a Chelsea painter and novelist. ''If you buy the wrong thing and people come to your house, you're exposed.''
 Are New Yorkers really that critical?
 Mr. Santlofer tells a story that sounds like the beginning of an art joke: an artist (himself), an art writer and a dealer visit the home of a collector. After they leave -- the period of time that is the most fraught with danger for New York hosts -- the guests tell each other what they really think. ''The art writer said, 'Now there's an obvious collection,' '' he said. ''I said, I could forgive that if the examples he bought were better.The art dealer said he liked 1 out of 40 -- and he would totally forgive that if he had sold them the art.''
 Even people who have been serious collectors in the past may suffer bouts of paralysis, particularly if they're looking at a large investment. Melissa Fink and her husband, Steven Fink, live in Bedford, N.Y., in ''a fabulous, contemporary, 6,000-square-foot house,'' as Ms. Fink described it. ''We just spent a fortune doing additions on this fabulous house, it's huge and beautiful and kind of like we have all these empty spaces.'' 
 They've worked with art consultants in the past, spending about $200,000, and are prepared to spend another $100,000, according to Ms. Fink.
 ''We had our art consultant come two different times,'' Ms. Fink said. ''When it comes to artwork, I don't know that I know the value. Are you buying it for enjoyment, or are you buying it for investment? If you buy some Yves Saint Laurent or Halston, you know that you are getting value.''
 Did she have a bad experience? Yes, she did.
 ''I was getting a manicure at Canyon Ranch, it was the end of seven days of manicures and hiking and there was this piece of art behind me and I said, It's so lovely, I'll take it.'' 
 She bought it impulsively without telling her husband and had it shipped. The moment it arrived, they agreed it was awful. It now lives in a storage room in the fabulous contemporary home. Cost of the painting: $12,000. Lesson, as explained by the art consultant: ''Whatever you do in your life, if you want to buy art on vacation, please call us and let us do some research.'' 
 Jonathan Arnold, a 45-year-old Chicago economist, also turned to a consultant for help. He dabbled with collecting in his early 20's, he said, and last year thought about starting again, but feared making a financial mistake. ''If you don't know what you're doing,'' he said, ''it's an invitation to be taken down.'' 
 Mr. Arnold asked friends whose collections he admired how they acquired their work, and came up with the name of an art consultant, Marcia G. Levine, of Levine Fine Art in Manhattan, who once sold a Modigliani to the Vatican Museums and creates collections for people around the world.
 Her commission, should you be new to this world, comes from the gallery, unless she is on retainer from a client. If you're not prepared to make a commitment to creating a collection -- which, for a young person, can start with a $5,000 drawing -- don't bother her. Ms. Levine arranged for Mr. Arnold to go to the Marlborough gallery in New York before an opening to see the work of an American artist named Michael Anderson. Mr. Arnold was especially taken with ''Strange Party,'' a collage created from torn bits of street posters. He bought it for $20,000. He also saw the work of another artist, Steven Charles, and liked it so much that he will be buying a piece that has not yet been finished, for a price he does not know. 
 ''Having just bought a piece that wasn't even hung, I was seduced into buying a piece that wasn't even made,'' Mr. Arnold said, laughing. His art anxieties, you might say, are over.

HEADLINE: Businesses, Worried About Economy, Invest Less

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Hesitant about the shaky economy, American businesses are cutting back on investments and equipment. And the housing industry, in its worst crisis since the early 1990s, is poised for several months of anemic sales.
 Government reports released Wednesday reinforced concerns that the economy was facing severe headwinds. 
 ''Businesses are reluctant to invest because they still have no clue about how the economy is going to shake out over the next six to 12 months,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm in Princeton, N.J. 
 Home builders are equally flummoxed. As buyers vanish, residential construction companies are slashing prices on unsold homes. In January, the median price of a new home fell to $216,000, down 15 percent from the previous January, according to the Commerce Department.
 But the discounts failed to fan interest. Last month, sales of new homes slowed to an annual rate of 588,000, the lowest in almost 13 years. It was the third consecutive monthly decline, and 2.8 percent below the sales rate in December.
 ''Another month, another disastrous U.S. new-home sales report,'' an economist at ING Bank, Dimitry Fleming, wrote. ''New home prices have not dropped this fast in over 35 years.''
 In an ominous sign for builders, inventories of unsold new homes continued to rise. At the current rate, it would take nearly 10 months to sell the backlog. 
 ''Prices will need to fall further to help clear the market,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. Would-be buyers are waiting for better deals, say economists, who predict that sales will remain light through at least the summer. 
 Sales have gone south amid a wave of foreclosures and more stringent lending standards for mortgages. The number of new homes on the market in January dropped as well.
 Toll Brothers, a leading luxury builder, said on Wednesday that first-quarter sales fell 23 percent, leading to a $96 million loss. The company was forced to write down $245 million in unsold properties, double the amount from a year ago. 
 ''Ceaseless talk of a recession continues to dampen the mood of consumers in general, whether or not a recession actually occurs,'' the company's chief executive, Robert I. Toll, said in a statement. ''We believe that revived buyer confidence is paramount to getting the market moving again.''
 In January, sales of new homes fell 10.3 percent in the Northeast; 7.6 percent in the Midwest; and 2.4 percent in the South. Sales rose 2.2 percent in the West.
 The weak housing data coincided with new evidence of other economic troubles. A separate Commerce Department report showed that businesses spent less on durable goods in January, a sign that companies were hesitant to make large purchases.
 Over all, new orders of durable goods -- those that last for several years -- fell 5.3 percent last month, dragged down by a sharp drop in transportation goods like aircraft. It was the first monthly decline since October. 
 ''It falls in with a lot of other economic indicators that are pointing to a weakening in the economy,'' Mr. Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, said of durable goods. ''That's the only way you can really portray it.''
 Japan's Factory Output Falls
 TOKYO (Bloomberg News) -- January factory production in Japan fell twice as much as economists had predicted as manufacturers anticipated a deepening slump in the United States would weaken demand.
 Companies cut output 2 percent from December, when it rose 1.4 percent, the trade ministry said Thursday. 
 A separate report showed retail sales increased 1.5 percent in January from a year earlier, though most of the gain was driven by higher gasoline prices.

HEADLINE: Easing the Pain Of Collecting

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
JEN BEKMAN'S apartment is hardly what you would expect from a woman who has made herself a force in the art world in the last five years, building a photography and fine arts Web site that draws international collectors and earning an innovator-of-the-year title from American Photo magazine.
 Then again, her narrow studio in the East Village vividly reflects the many unusual twists in her life -- a testament to a talent for reinvention.
 There's the storage closet in the middle of the apartment that replaced the loft-bed arrangement for two roommates who helped pay the rent in 1993, when Ms. Bekman, then 23 and a switchboard operator at the Paramount Hotel in Times Square, first moved in. 
 There's the collection of midcentury Heywood-Wakefield furniture purchased in her late 20s, during her flush dot-com days in San Francisco. 
 There are the neo-Classical-style white marble lamps she bought on eBay when she returned to New York jobless after the bust and could barely afford the $90. 
 And there are the photographs, paintings and drawings that fill walls that were bare until recently, accumulated during her latest incarnation: as an increasingly influential art world insider. 
 Few people in that world had heard of Ms. Bekman five years ago, when she used credit cards and the $20,000 in her 401(k) to open Jen Bekman Gallery, on Spring Street near the Bowery. 
 She had no experience to speak of -- she had never even bought a photograph or a painting -- but she did have two clear goals: to help emerging artists become more appreciated, and to encourage a broader swath of people to feel comfortable buying art.
 To further those aims, she initiated several online projects, including Hey, Hot Shot! (heyhotshot.com), a regular competition for emerging photographers that offers winners representation by the gallery; and personism.com, a blog about photography, design and current events. 
 In September Ms. Bekman introduced another Web site, 20x200.com, which sells limited-edition high-quality prints of photographs and fine art for as little as $20. Almost at once, the site was in the black and gaining attention. 
 Five and a half months later, it counts among its customers art collectors from around the world, dozens of magazine writers and editors, a MoMA executive and many artists, including well-established ones like Brian Ulrich and Alec Soth. 
 In May the Griffin Museum of Photography, in Winchester, Mass., will honor her with its Rising Star award, given, the museum says, to an emerging force that the photographic community is watching with great enthusiasm. 
 But unlike city dwellers who celebrate their success by moving to a nicer apartment or by upgrading their appliances, Ms. Bekman, now 38, is content to remain in her old space. She lives there with her dog, Ollie; a white vintage Chambers stove she bought at a thrift shop for $400 seven years ago; a goofy ceramic bulldog with glass eyes from Woolworth's; and a few new inexpensive furnishings, like brightly colored striped sheets.
 One reason for staying put, even though her first-floor apartment is off a noisy lobby and occasionally visited by centipedes, is that her success is so new and hard times so recent.
 ''I only started making money in September,'' she said of her work at the gallery, and she is only now figuring out how to draw a regular salary. 
 On several occasions over the last five years the only way she could keep the gallery and her other projects afloat was to sublet her apartment and spend nights on an air mattress in her mother's living room in Queens, where she grew up. ''A lot of people, including myself at times, couldn't help but wonder: when do you give up?'' she said.
 That question seemed particularly apt last spring, her lowest point, when she was eight months behind in rent at the gallery, four months behind in rent at home, and had tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt. ''The whole thing was crazy,'' she said. Opening the gallery ''was so impulsive,'' she continued. ''It was literally me sitting in my living room drinking Scotch with friends, and I was laughing -- wouldn't it be funny if someone picked up the phone and said Jen Bekman Gallery?'' 
 But once the dream became a reality, the financial burden felt like a massive hangover. ''I felt like the Willy Loman of the art world,'' she said. ''I was always about to get my big break.'' 
 Ms. Bekman, who spent the '90s riding the wave of the dot-com boom, had a hard time accepting the possibility that things would not eventually work out. 
 In 1994, seven years after graduating from Stuyvesant High School and three years after dropping out of Hunter College because she couldn't stand writing papers, she began spending time with a friend who ran an early Internet bulletin board system out of his apartment, and was fascinated with the Web's potential to connect people. She left a sales job at Ian Schrager's hotel group to help the friend run his bulletin board and to develop commercial Web sites. 
 The knowledge gained from those experiences carried her into the executive suites of West Coast companies like Netscape and Disney as a highly paid consultant and later a high-level staff member. 
 By 2000, at 31, she was the chief creative officer at earthnoise.com, an early video-sharing Web site, earning six figures, overseeing a staff of 30 people and working toward the promise of a huge stock windfall. Then the bubble burst, and Ms. Bekman watched her stock options, her identity and her future plans disappear overnight. 
 ''I thought I had it all figured out,'' she said. ''I thought I knew what my path was. But in January the company went out of business, owing me forty grand.''
 For nearly two years Ms. Bekman felt aimless, unable to find another Internet staff job and living off savings and unemployment. 
 ''I didn't know what I was going to do,'' she said. She enrolled in a poetry class, went to the gym and considered becoming a real estate or stock broker. 
 Then, in late 2002, her friend Dana Miller, a photographer, invited her to an exhibition of her work and that of nine others put on by a women's collective. 
 ''It was a one-night show in somebody's loft that they converted into gallery space,'' Ms. Bekman said. ''I walked into the event that night knowing what Dana put into it. I saw her spend a lot of money on printing and framing her work to get it ready. And when we walked in, there was a round table with plastic cups and big bottles of soda. I hated the way the show was produced.'' 
 Ms. Bekman was even more irritated when her friend Spencer became interested in a photo and could not get information about it. She found the artist and made the introductions herself. ''So suddenly I was brokering this conversation,'' she said. 
 As the friend and the artist talked, Ms. Bekman observed what she considers a very meaningful interaction. ''I saw Spencer,'' who then owned two small paintings, ''imagining himself as a collector,'' she said. ''And I saw how he had the potential to make a huge impact on this young artist. I just got a taste of how gratifying that process could be.''
 Convinced she could do better at bringing young artists and potential buyers together, Ms. Bekman set out to produce another show. After briefly considering holding it in her apartment -- the long white walls were bare, after all -- she decided she needed more space, which led to the Scotch-fueled brainstorm a few weeks later.
 But flipping through a Pottery Barn catalog, Ms. Bekman had another realization. Even though she had often longed to buy art, she had never bought anything from a gallery.
 ''I didn't know how to, I was completely intimidated,'' she said. ''The only opportunities I saw for people like me,'' she said, were the mass-produced stock pieces sold by places like Pottery Barn.
 What she wanted, it turned out, was not just to produce a show but to change the way art is sold and collected.
 Ms. Bekman immersed herself in the online world of art, did as much research as she could about the way traditional galleries functioned, and began reaching out to emerging photographers whose work caught her eye. 
 Today Ms. Bekman has relationships with hundreds of artists and photographers, represents 18 of them, employs a staff of four, and feels connected, she said, to every one of the 40 or so pieces on the walls in her apartment, like the large, provocative photograph of a woman brushing her hair given to her by Benjamin Donaldson, a photographer she represents. On March 15 her gallery will celebrate its fifth anniversary, and last week 20x200 shipped its 6,500th print.
 As for finding a new apartment, Ms. Bekman said she has never really considered it. ''I would love to be in a top-floor apartment with natural light,'' she said, but ''I definitely feel connected to my home -- I made it a home.''

In a snowswept trailer park, Emily Medina wakes each morning wondering whether she will be washed away by toxic water that local officials fear could burst from a decaying mine tunnel near her home. 
 Like many of the 2,800 people in this old mining town, where wealthy prospectors and infamous gunslingers once flocked, Ms. Medina, a housekeeper at a hotel in Vail, is afraid of losing her property, or worse. 
 ''They should get us out of here,'' she said. ''They need to do something before it's too late.'' 
 This month, Lake County commissioners declared a state of emergency over concerns that rising levels of contaminated water could burst from the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel and flood the town. 
 For years, the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the Environmental Protection Agency have bickered over what to do about the aging tunnel, which stretches 2.1 miles and has become dammed by debris. The debris is holding back more than a billion gallons of water, much of it tainted with toxic levels of cadmium, zinc and manganese.
 The threat posed by the tunnel is the latest misfortune for the town, which is grappling with the wreckage of more than a century of mining. 
 ''Everybody made a lot of money in Leadville,'' said Ken Olsen, a county commissioner. ''They left years ago, and we've had to clean up after them ever since.''
 In the late 1800s, a gold and silver boom made Leadville one of Colorado's most colorful places, drawing the likes of the Guggenheims. Legend has it that Doc Holliday fought his final gunfight here. 
 Gold and silver gave way to zinc and lead mining, encouraged by the federal government for the war effort during World War II and the Korean War. Molybdenum, used to fortify steel, was blasted out of the mountains for years at the Climax mine.
 In 1983, the E.P.A. listed the area as a Superfund site because of mine tailings and runoff. Three years later, after a sharp decline in the price of molybdenum, the Climax mine shut down, stripping Leadville of its heart. 
 ''So many people had to leave the community,'' said Bob Elder, a retired mining engineer. ''A lot of us felt lost. There was no life left here for quite a while.'' 
 The town has recast itself as a tourist destination -- North America's highest incorporated city, at 10,152 feet, where people can peruse its tiny Victorian-style main street, drink at the Silver Dollar Saloon or ride a scenic railroad. Miners have been replaced by Mexican immigrants, who commute over the mountains to work at ski resorts. 
 Abandoned mine shafts honeycomb the surrounding hillsides. The old drainage tunnel, built by the federal government in 1943 to drain hundreds of these shafts, began falling apart in the 1970s, causing water to pool. In 2005, the E.P.A. offered to start pumping the clogged water toward a Bureau of Reclamation plant, which treats the water flowing through the tunnel; but the bureau contended that the additional water was part of the E.P.A.'s Superfund cleanup responsibility. A plan for the state to take over the plant subsequently fell through.
 Last year, the warnings grew louder. Brad Littlepage, who manages the Bureau of Reclamation treatment plant, says he told supervisors, to no avail, about the tunnel's deterioration. The risk, as he and other experts saw it, was that pressure from the backed-up water had become so intense that it threatened to burst through the blockages and cascade out of the tunnel.
 A spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation, Peter Soeth, said that Mr. Littlepage's concerns had been considered but that the agency's experts had concluded that the tunnel's condition did not pose an immediate threat. 
 Last November, Robert E. Robert, a regional administrator for the E.P.A., sent a letter to the bureau warning of the possibility of a ''potentially catastrophic release of water'' from the tunnel.
 Since May 2005, the level of water has risen 50 feet, creating a pool that is now 150 feet deep, said Jord Gertson, a hydrogeologist who works for the E.P.A. 
 A substantial snowpack this winter has put even more pressure on the tunnel. 
 For the Lake County commissioners, the bureaucratic wrangling had gone on long enough. The commissioners' state of emergency declaration on Feb. 13 brought a visit from Senator Ken Salazar, a letter from Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. to President Bush and a hearing last week at the State Capitol. Despite the frustration, Mayor Bud Elliott worries that the attention will harm Leadville's economy. Two days after the county's declaration, the town was notified that its property and liability insurance would not be renewed because it had become too risky, Mr. Elliott said. 
 ''People are canceling vacations,'' he said. ''We've had two children withdrawn from school because their parents are afraid.'' 
 The E.P.A. has since agreed to spend $1.5 million to drill into the tunnel and begin pumping the water into the Bureau of Reclamation's treatment facility. 
 One frigid evening last week, a test of emergency sirens rang out through the trailer park where Ms. Medina and 300 other people live. Shania Sooter, 9, clasped her hands to her ears. ''They're going to show us what to do in case there's a flood from the mine,'' she said.
 As a muffled recording broadcast warnings in English and Spanish, a herd of elk wandered down from the mountains. Down the road, peering out from behind the peaks, the yellow lights from the old Climax mine continued to burn through the night.

HEADLINE: Contract Awarded for Newark Heliport

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
A $10 million contract for the construction of a heliport in Newark has been awarded to Air Pegasus Helicopters, a company that operates heliports in Manhattan and Washington. 
 The company recently announced that it planned to develop a heliport on Grafton Avenue in Newark, next to a police station house the city is constructing.
 Pegasus is led by Steven Trenk, a first cousin of Richard Trenk, a former partner with Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark at the law firm Booker, Rabinowitz, Trenk, Lubetkin, Tully, DiPasquale & Webster of West Orange, N.J.
 Information about the contract and the Trenks was not immediately available, Esmeralda Diaz Cameron, a spokeswoman for Mr. Booker, said Wednesday night.
 According to a news release from Pegasus, financing for the ''world-class heliplex'' would come from ''the Trenk family, institutional financing and governmental sources.''
 A Pegasus spokesman said he lacked details about the contract and could not immediately reach Steven Trenk. A message left Wednesday night at Steven Trenk's home was not returned. Richard Trenk declined to comment on Wednesday night.
 According to the news release, the heliport will accommodate the Newark Police Department's new aviation unit, and also serve corporate and other uses, including businesses in the city and the surrounding region.
 ''The strategic location of this facility will encourage economic growth and increase employment opportunities in Newark,'' Steven Trenk says in the release.
 The release hails Mr. Booker's ''laudable crime-reduction initiatives.''

HEADLINE: Council Vote for Good Health May Weaken Business at Groceries in Poor Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
They are fixtures of New York City life: sidewalk peddlers and the grocers who try to shoo them away from their storefronts. The City Council grudgingly added to that time-honored clash on Wednesday, approving a bill that will increase the number of fruit and vegetable carts in the city's poor neighborhoods.
 The Council voted 37 to 9 in favor of the measure, despite intense lobbying from independent supermarkets, bodegas and greengrocers who said the bill would steal their customers without increasing demand for fresh produce. 
 The final tally belied the division among council members over the bill and came only after a series of compromises, including a sharp reduction in the number of sidewalk vendors that would be licensed and a slight cut to the number of neighborhoods in which they may operate.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn proposed the measure in December in an effort to increase the supply of fruits and vegetables in neighborhoods with high rates of obesity, diabetes and other health problems. 
 In was the latest in a series of initiatives by the administration -- including a 2006 ban on trans fats and an ongoing fight to make chain restaurants post calorie counts on their menus -- to make New York City healthier. 
 This latest bill focuses on neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Harlem, where a paucity of supermarkets makes many residents rely on bodegas for food purchases. A 2006 health department survey found that only 20 to 40 percent of bodegas in those neighborhoods carried apples, oranges and bananas and that only 2 to 6 percent stocked leafy green vegetables.
 ''Our bill targets neighborhoods where existing businesses have been unable to fully bridge the health gap and sell fruits and vegetables,'' Ms. Quinn said, adding that the bill would help save lives.
 The measure had the backing of antihunger and child-advocacy groups, and when it was introduced it appeared to have strong support on the Council. But support began to waver amid heavy lobbying from the retail food industry, leading to a flurry of late changes and compromises. 
 Among them, the administration reduced the number of carts from 1,500 to 1,000 and dropped 9 of the 43 police precincts in which the vendors would be allowed to operate. One of those precincts dropped, the 50th in the Bronx, which includes Riverdale and Kingsbridge, where there are already numerous neighborhood grocers that offer fresh produce, was crucial to winning the swing vote of Councilman Oliver Koppell in moving the bill out of committee.
 Mr. Koppell, one of the bill's original sponsors, expressed the concerns of many council members when they learned that neighborhoods were targeted based on consumption rather than supply. Put simply, neighborhoods where more than 15 percent of residents said they had not eaten fruits or vegetables in the last 24 hours made the list, regardless of how many area stores offered fresh produce. 
 ''I think it's important to have these green carts where supply is really not available, and it's hard to say whether these consumption numbers are the best way of gauging this or not,'' Mr. Koppell said. 
 Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center of New York, said he applauded the spirit of the measure. ''It's the execution that's wrong,'' he said. He and other industry advocates said the city should identify neighborhoods where fresh fruits and vegetables were not available before deciding where to place vendors.
 Mr. Kim added that the bill was unfair to Korean-American vendors who since the 1970s have become part of the fabric of the city, selling fruits and vegetables in low-income and high-crime neighborhoods where other businesses often hesitate to go. Korean-Americans make up about 1,200 of the city's nearly 2,300 greengrocers, Mr. Kim said. 
 Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, who led a protest by 100 Korean-American business owners at City Hall on Monday, urged that the concept be tested with one or two vendors to see if demand increased. 
 ''Where do we have an example where increasing supply actually increases demand?'' Mr. Liu said. ''That is backwards voodoo economics. It doesn't work.'' 
 Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city's health commissioner, said that consumption data was used because it was reliable and available. Compiling reliable data on retailers that sell a proper variety of quality fruits and vegetables, at affordable prices, was much more complex, he said. 
 The consumption data also corresponded to maps showing neighborhoods with the highest rates of obesity and diabetes.
 ''This is not going to end the obesity epidemic,'' Dr. Frieden said, ''but it is an important step to increase access to healthy food in the communities that need it most.''

HEADLINE: I'm Not Running for President, but ...

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG. 
Michael R. Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.

 BODY:
WATCHING the 2008 presidential campaign, you sometimes get the feeling that the candidates -- smart, all of them -- must know better. They must know we can't fix our economy and create jobs by isolating America from global trade. They must know that we can't fix our immigration problems with border security alone. They must know that we can't fix our schools without holding teachers, principals and parents accountable for results. They must know that fighting global warming is not a costless challenge. And they must know that we can't keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals unless we crack down on the black market for them.
 The vast majority of Americans know that all of this is true, but -- politics being what it is -- the candidates seem afraid to level with them. 
 Over the past year, I have been working to raise issues that are important to New Yorkers and all Americans -- and to speak plainly about common sense solutions. Some of these solutions have traditionally been seen as Republican, while others have been seen as Democratic. As a businessman, I never believed that either party had all the answers and, as mayor, I have seen just how true that is. 
 In every city I have visited -- from Baltimore to New Orleans to Seattle -- the message of an independent approach has resonated strongly, and so has the need for a new urban agenda. More than 65 percent of Americans now live in urban areas -- our nation's economic engines. But you would never know that listening to the presidential candidates. At a time when our national economy is sputtering, to say the least, what are we doing to fuel job growth in our cities, and to revive cities that have never fully recovered from the manufacturing losses of recent decades?
 More of the same won't do, on the economy or any other issue. We need innovative ideas, bold action and courageous leadership. That's not just empty rhetoric, and the idea that we have the ability to solve our toughest problems isn't some pie-in-the-sky dream. In New York, working with leaders from both parties and mayors and governors from across the country, we've demonstrated that an independent approach really can produce progress on the most critical issues, including the economy, education, the environment, energy, infrastructure and crime.
 I believe that an independent approach to these issues is essential to governing our nation -- and that an independent can win the presidency. I listened carefully to those who encouraged me to run, but I am not -- and will not be -- a candidate for president. I have watched this campaign unfold, and I am hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.
 In the weeks and months ahead, I will continue to work to steer the national conversation away from partisanship and toward unity; away from ideology and toward common sense; away from sound bites and toward substance. And while I have always said I am not running for president, the race is too important to sit on the sidelines, and so I have changed my mind in one area. If a candidate takes an independent, nonpartisan approach -- and embraces practical solutions that challenge party orthodoxy -- I'll join others in helping that candidate win the White House.
 The changes needed in this country are straightforward enough, but there are always partisan reasons to take an easy way out. There are always special interests that will fight against any challenge to the status quo. And there are always those who will worry more about their next election than the health of our country. 
 These forces that prevent meaningful progress are powerful, and they exist in both parties. I believe that the candidate who recognizes that the party is over -- and begins enlisting all of us to clean up the mess -- will be the winner this November, and will lead our country to a great and boundless future.

HEADLINE: Cash-Rich, Publicity-Shy

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Abu Dhabi has about 9 percent of the world's oil and 0.02 percent of its population. The result is a surfeit of petrodollars, much of which is funneled into a secretive, government-controlled investment fund that is helping to shift the balance of power in the financial world.
 After decades in the shadows, the fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is turning heads on Wall Street and in Washington by making high-profile investments in the United States and elsewhere. 
 Known as ADIA (pronounced ah-DEE-ah), the fund recently formed a small team that is now buying big stakes in Western companies. This unit masterminded ADIA's $7.5 billion investment in Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, in November. It has also taken a large position in Toll Brothers, one of the country's biggest home builders. 
 ''There is an idea that Abu Dhabi should not be the underdog of the map,'' said Frauke Heard-Bey, a historian who has written a book about the political emergence of the United Arab Emirates. ''They have the money to buy companies that are ailing, and why should they not? Why not make a mark?''
 ADIA is the largest of the world's sovereign wealth funds, giant pools of money controlled by cash-rich governments, particularly in Asia and Middle East. But Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the seven Arab emirates, says little about its fund. Few outsiders know for sure where ADIA invests -- or even how much money it controls. And secrecy breeds hyperbole; some estimates of the fund's size surpass $1 trillion. 
 Before long, ADIA will certainly reach that mark. But for now bankers, former employees and analysts familiar with the fund peg it at $650 billion to $700 billion -- an amount that is still over 15 times the size of the Fidelity Magellan Fund. In all, sovereign wealth funds in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Singapore, China and Russia control more than $2 trillion, a figure that could approach $12 trillion by 2015, analysts say. 
 Such riches, coupled with the more aggressive stance being taken by ADIA and other sovereign funds, has raised concern that these investors will wield their wealth for political as well as financial reasons.
 ADIA's secrecy is also drawing scrutiny. The fund has no internal communications department, although it says it is in the process of setting one up. When sovereign fund leaders from around the world descended on Davos, Switzerland, last month for the World Economic Forum, no one from ADIA saw fit to show up.
 Executives at ADIA declined to comment for this article.
 Last week Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on security and international trade and finance, who has raised concerns about sovereign fund transparency, traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with senior ADIA executives. 
 Also last week, a delegation led by Clay Lowery, a top Treasury official, met with ADIA executives as part of a move to formalize investment guidelines for sovereign funds.
 In many ways the tension between ADIA's elephantine size -- the fund is twice as big as Norway's, the second-largest sovereign fund -- and its demure aspect is underscored by its investment in Citigroup.
 Since ADIA's genesis in 1976, the fund has followed a conservative investment approach. It has farmed out its assets to foreign money managers and taken stakes in companies based upon their weighting in benchmark stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500. ADIA is also one of the largest institutional investors in hedge funds and private equity funds. This approach has served ADIA well and reflects the strongly felt notion that the fund's ultimate purpose is to serve as a financial reserve for Abu Dhabi in times when oil revenues are less robust. 
 Nevertheless, guided by the advice of a stream of foreign bankers who worked at ADIA in the 1970s and 1980s, the fund has allocated a large portion of its assets to equities. It now has about 65 percent of assets, or about $450 billion, invested in stocks, according to bankers. Currently, the fund averages a yearly return of 10 to 20 percent, say people who have been briefed on the fund's investment strategy.
 With oil about $100 a barrel, bankers and analysts estimate Abu Dhabi produces a surplus of at least $50 billion a year. Given the emirate's small population, 80 percent of which is foreign born, even the most expansive investment and welfare policies make it hard to put a dent in such a sum.
 The United States is not a big buyer of Abu Dhabi's oil, most of which goes to Asia, but the surplus is a vivid reminder of the American economy's own fiscal imbalance, to say nothing of its diminishing global stature, a theme that underpins much of the political worry surrounding sovereign fund investments. 
 ''In the short run, that they are investing here is good,'' Senator Bayh said. ''But in the long run it is unsustainable. Our power and authority is eroding because of the amounts we are sending abroad for energy and consumer goods.''
 In the past, much of Abu Dhabi's cash surplus has gone to ADIA, although the formation two years ago of a smaller sister fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has resulted in a lesser amount flowing to ADIA, analysts say.
 But ADIA's new strategic investment group represents the clearest sign that the fund is taking steps to leverage its size and influence. The division was set up in the summer of 2006 and is overseen by Saeed Mubarek Rashid al-Hajiri, a young Western-educated portfolio manager who also heads the fund's considerable investments in emerging market economies. 
 In addition to Citigroup and Toll Brothers, in which ADIA took a 4.5 percent position last summer, other companies in the group's portfolio include EFG Hermes, one of the leading investment banks in the Arab world, and Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats, a Tunisian bank.
 Instead of passively tracking indexes, this unit actively picks investments in hopes of generating market-beating returns. It is a method of stock picking practiced by most hedge funds and asset management companies, and the Citigroup investment, with its size and attendant risk, is a good example of this approach. 
 Compared with the overall fund, the assets within this group are small at about $30 billion, according to people who have been briefed on ADIA's strategy. As with all its investments, ADIA adopts a long-term, passive approach and does not seek board seats. These people say that outsiders still manage 80 percent of ADIA's assets, proof that the fund's commitment to making direct investments is only in its early stages. 
 This hesitation partly reflects the lack of a strong individual within the organization who has the combination of investment experience, trust of the royal family and a bit of international swagger to assume a larger public presence.
 The fund's chairman is Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi. He has a cautious and reserved disposition and does not take an active role in ADIA. When Citigroup's chairman, Robert E. Rubin, traveled to Abu Dhabi last November, his courtesy call was made to Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the point person for the United States-Abu Dhabi relationship.
 The fund's managing director is Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a half-brother of Sheik Khalifa who maintains a full-floor office in ADIA's sleek 40-story headquarters. People familiar with ADIA management, however, say the sheik, who has worked at ADIA for 10 years, delegates significant authority to Jean-Paul Villain, a publicity-shy French money manager who directs investment strategy and asset allocation.
 Mr. Villain, the most senior foreign-born executive at the fund, joined ADIA in the early 1980s from the French bank Paribas. While other expatriates have come and gone, Mr. Villain has stayed, except for a brief period in the mid-1980s. More so than the other foreigners, Mr. Villain, whose wife is Syrian-born, has gained the royal family's trust.
 One view is that ADIA's penchant for secrecy stems from its experience during the scandal at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the early 1990s, during which ADIA is said to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars. The al-Nahyan family became embroiled in regulatory investigations, although no charges were ever brought against them.
 But people who worked at ADIA from its earliest days in the late 1970s and 1980s say that the fund's reticence dates to its formation. Some see this as a reflection of Abu Dhabi's small size, insular culture and geographical vulnerability, a sense that the less that is known about the specifics of ADIA's hoard, the better.
 ''ADIA does not answer to a wide public at home,'' said David L. Mack, a former United States ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. ''They are a small country in an area with some nasty countries like Iran that can make trouble for them. They don't like to advertise.''

HEADLINE: Viacom's Profit Up, Aided by MTV Ad Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Viacom, the cable network and movie studio owner, said Thursday that fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent on higher advertising sales at its MTV Networks and strong sales of its ''Rock Band'' video game and ''Transformers'' DVDs. 
 Viacom said it had seen no impact from a weaker United States economy, echoing similar statements from some of its big media peers.
 The company, which owns the Nickelodeon Network and Paramount movie studios, posted a net profit of $559.5 million, or 86 cents per share, up from $480.8 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier.
 Revenue rose 19 percent to $4.25 billion, beating analyst expectations of $4 billion in revenue.
 Excluding items the company's profit of 84 cents beat Wall Street expectations of 82 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Financial results were boosted by an 18 percent jump in cable networks revenue and 19 percent rise in film studios revenue.
 New businesses such as its growing video games division, which developed one of last holiday season's big sellers its ''Rock Band'' game, contributed $460 million, up 72 percent from a year ago.
 Global advertising revenue rose 9 percent to $1.39 billion.
 Viacom's advertising sales growth in the United States in the current quarter is expected to be similar to fourth-quarter levels, the chief executive, Philippe Dauman, told analysts on a conference call. 
 The company said it expects low, double-digit percentage annual growth in diluted net profit from continuing operations for the three year period from 2008 through 2010.

HEADLINE: Europe to Review Rules After Bailouts of 2 German Banks

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
European Union regulators on Wednesday said they would investigate whether bailouts of two German banks hit by the subprime lending crisis had violated rules on state aid for ailing enterprises. 
 The rescues involved credit lines of about 26 billion euros, or $39 billion. In one, the state-owned bank KfW chipped in to cover potential losses at IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a corporate lender. In another, SachsenLB, a state-owned regional bank, was aided by other regional banks and the state of Saxony. 
 Both banks had bet on securities linked to the subprime mortgage market in the United States. The European commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, said taxpayers should not be required to cover the resulting losses. 
 ''It is hard for European citizens to understand why they have to suffer from the economic downturn, while taxpayers' money is poured into once-profitable banks that took excessive risks and might now avoid paying for their risky strategies,'' Ms. Kroes said in a statement. 
 Under European rules, the companies can be required to repay any aid if the European Commission concludes there was a violation. Sanctions could also involve a forced sale of the banks. 
 But it was unclear how effective the threat of a forced sale could be, since SachsenLB has already been sold to a stronger regional bank and IKB would probably end up with the same fate. 
 The German government has argued that the assistance conformed to the ''market economy investor principle,'' that is, that the state merely provided what any private investor would have, according to the commission.
 The government could also argue that the bailouts were necessary to avoid a broader financial crisis at a time of acute distress on global markets. But Simon Tilford, a single-market specialist at the Center for European Reform in London, said both banks were probably too small to cause widespread problems. ''Neither of those cases posed any serious systemic threat,'' he said, ''so you have to wonder whether these bailouts made sense.'' 
 The European Commission's action, though expected, did illuminate the uncomfortable circumstances facing governments that might intervene to ease the impact of the subprime crisis. 
 This month, the British government nationalized Northern Rock, a mortgage lender whose business model collapse last fall. Financial markets seized up, preventing it from securitizing and selling the mortgages it had granted to borrowers. 
 London had rejected two buyout proposals, and the fate of the bank was politically fraught because it is based in Newcastle, a city that has suffered considerable decline and had considered Northern Rock a bright spot. 
 The European Commission said Wednesday that it might review the British case as well. 
 ''If the U.K. restructuring plan involved substantial amounts of state aid, the commission would be likely to open a formal investigation procedure,'' Ms. Kroes said in her statement.

HEADLINE: U.S. and India to Strengthen Security Ties

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI and SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
With a landmark nuclear energy pact between the United States and India stalled, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Wednesday that the nations would nonetheless strengthen their security ties as India looked to embark on a closer -- and still contentious -- level of military cooperation with the United States. 
 With its booming economy and a strong desire to upgrade Soviet-era weaponry, India has emerged as one of the world's most prosperous arms markets. 
 During two days of meetings with Indian officials, Mr. Gates pressed the case of American defense companies competing for multibillion-dollar contracts with the Indian government, including a coveted $10 billion fighter jet deal. 
 But beyond the economic benefits of Indian military modernization, American officials contend that India can be an important stabilizing force in Asia and a critical counterweight to China's regional ambitions. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Gates denied that the Bush administration's effort to strengthen ties to India and other Asian nations was planned specifically with China in mind. 
 But Pentagon officials said that during Mr. Gates's meetings with Indian officials, more time was spent discussing China than Pakistan, India's longtime rival. 
 Mr. Gates has logged thousands of miles on stops around Asia to deepen military ties and pave the way for future arms deals with three of Asia's most important democracies: India, Indonesia and Australia. 
 A senior defense official traveling with Mr. Gates said that, given China's military ambitions, it was essential to cement security relationships with other powers in Asia ''not in an aggressive sense, but certainly as a hedge.'' The official spoke on the condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to talk publicly about American defense policy.
 During a stop in Indonesia, Mr. Gates pledged more active Pentagon support for the Indonesian military, after more than a decade of estrangement over the Indonesian military's past human rights abuses. 
 In Canberra, Australia, Mr. Gates promised to investigate whether a Congressional prohibition on foreign nations from buying the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet could be lifted. Australian officials have expressed interest in buying the high-tech fighter. 
 India and Australia are formidable naval powers in the Indian Ocean, a vital strategic corridor for oil supplies as well as for terrorist organizations and trafficking groups. 
 Security analysts predict that India's spending for weapons could grow to as much as $40 billion over the next several years, more than its entire annual armament budget today. India is trying to upgrade its arsenal of submarines, tanks, jet fighters and transport aircraft. It has conducted several military exercises with the United States in recent years.
 India announced last month that it would buy six C-130 cargo planes from the American military contractor Lockheed Martin, a deal worth about $1 billion. Earlier, the Indian Navy bought an American warship, the Trenton, which it renamed the Jalashva. The vessel increases India's capacity to project its power in the Indian Ocean region. 
 Lockheed and Boeing are among the companies competing for the $10 billion contract to supply India with 126 fighter jets, to upgrade an aging fleet of Russian-built MIGs. 
 The Indians want to expand their strategic relationship with the United States, but not necessarily at the expense of traditional military partners, like Russia. 
 India has also insisted on high-technology transfer, which would have been unimaginable even a decade ago, when mutual distrust lingered from the cold-war era. India traditionally relied on Russia for its military hardware. In recent years, Israel has become a more important partner, and now so has the United States.

PERSON: William F. Buckley Jr. 

HEADLINE: William F. Buckley Jr., 82, Dies; Sesquipedalian Spark of Right

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William F. Buckley Jr., who marshaled polysyllabic exuberance, arched eyebrows and a refined, perspicacious mind to elevate conservatism to the center of American political discourse, died on Wednesday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 82.
 Mr. Buckley suffered from diabetes and emphysema, his son, Christopher, said, although the exact cause of death was not immediately known. He was found at his desk in the study of his home, his son said. ''He might have been working on a column,'' Christopher Buckley said. 
 William Buckley, with his winningly capricious personality, his use of ten-dollar words and a darting tongue writers loved to compare to an anteater's, was the popular host of one of television's longest-running programs, ''Firing Line,'' and founded and shepherded the influential conservative magazine National Review.
 He also found time to write more than 50 books, varying from sailing odysseys to spy novels to dissertations on harpsichord fingering to celebrations of his own dashing daily life. He edited at least five more. 
 In 2007, he published a history of the magazine called ''Cancel Your Own Goddam Subscription'' and a political novel, ''The Rake.'' His personal memoir of Senator Barry M. Goldwater is scheduled to be published this spring, and he was working on a similar volume on President Ronald Reagan at his death.
 The more than 4.5 million words of his 5,600 newspaper columns, titled ''On the Right,'' would fill 45 more medium-size books. His collected papers, which were donated to Yale, weigh seven tons. 
 Mr. Buckley's greatest achievement was making conservatism -- not just electoral Republicanism, but conservatism as a system of ideas -- respectable in liberal postwar America. He mobilized the young enthusiasts who helped nominate Mr. Goldwater in 1964 and saw his dreams fulfilled when Mr. Reagan and the Bushes captured the Oval Office.
 President Bush said Wednesday that Mr. Buckley ''brought conservative thought into the political mainstream, and helped lay the intellectual foundation for America's victory in the Cold War.'' 
 To Mr. Buckley's enormous delight, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian, termed him ''the scourge of liberalism.''
 In remarks at National Review's 30th anniversary in 1985, President Reagan joked that he picked up his first issue of the magazine in a plain brown wrapper and still anxiously awaited his copy every two weeks -- ''without the wrapper.''
 ''You didn't just part the Red Sea -- you rolled it back, dried it up and left exposed, for all the world to see, the naked desert that is statism,'' Mr. Reagan said.
 ''And then, as if that weren't enough,'' the president continued, ''you gave the world something different, something in its weariness it desperately needed, the sound of laughter and the sight of the rich, green uplands of freedom.''
 War on Liberal Order
 The liberal primacy Mr. Buckley challenged had begun with the New Deal and so accelerated in the next generation that Lionel Trilling, one of America's leading intellectuals, wrote in 1950: ''In the United States at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation.''
 Mr. Buckley declared war on this liberal order, beginning with his blistering assault on Yale, from which he graduated with honors in 1950, as a den of atheistic collectivism.
 ''All great biblical stories begin with Genesis,'' George Will wrote in National Review in 1980. ''And before there was Ronald Reagan, there was Barry Goldwater, and before there was Barry Goldwater there was National Review, and before there was National Review there was Bill Buckley with a spark in his mind, and the spark in 1980 has become a conflagration.''
 Mr. Buckley wove the tapestry of what became the new American conservatism from libertarian writers like Max Eastman, ''free market'' economists like Milton Friedman, traditionalist scholars like Russell Kirk and anti-Communist writers like Whittaker Chambers. He argued for a conservatism based on the national interest and a higher morality.
 He found his most receptive audience in young conservatives who were energized by Barry Goldwater's emergence at the Republican convention in 1960 as the right-wing alternative to Nixon. Some met in September 1960 at the Buckley family home in Sharon, Conn., to form Young Americans for Freedom. Their numbers -- and influence -- grew.
 Nicholas Lemann observed in Washington Monthly in 1988 that during the Reagan administration ''the 5,000 middle-level officials, journalists and policy intellectuals that it takes to run a government'' were ''deeply influenced by Buckley's example.'' He suggested that neither moderate Washington insiders nor ''Ed Meese-style provincial conservatives'' could have pulled off the Reagan tax cut and other policy transformations.
 Speaking of the true believers, Mr. Lemann continued, ''Some of these people had been personally groomed by Buckley, and most of the rest saw him as a role model.''
 Mr. Buckley rose to prominence with a generation of talented writers fascinated by political themes, people with names like Mailer, Capote, Vidal, Styron and Baldwin. Like the others, he was a magnet for controversy. Even people on the right -- from members of the John Birch Society to disciples of the author Ayn Rand to George Wallace to moderate Republicans -- frequently pounced on him.
 People of many political stripes came to see his life as something of an art form -- from racing through city streets on a motorcycle to a quixotic campaign for mayor of New York in 1965 to voicing startling opinions like favoring the decriminalization of marijuana. He was often described as liberals' favorite conservative, particularly after suavely playing host to an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'' on public television in 1982.
 Norman Mailer may indeed have dismissed Mr. Buckley as a ''second-rate intellect incapable of entertaining two serious thoughts in a row,'' but he could not help admiring his stage presence.
 ''No other act can project simultaneous hints that he is in the act of playing Commodore of the Yacht Club, Joseph Goebbels, Robert Mitchum, Maverick, Savonarola, the nice prep school kid next door and the snows of yesteryear,'' Mr. Mailer said in an interview with Harper's Magazine in 1967.
 Mr. Buckley's vocabulary, sparkling with phrases from distant eras and described in newspaper and magazine profiles as sesquipedalian (characterized by the use of long words), became the stuff of legend. Less kind commentators preferred the adjective ''pleonastic'' (using more words than necessary).
 And, inescapably, there was that aurora of pure mischief. In 1985, David Remnick, writing in The Washington Post, said, ''He has the eyes of a child who has just displayed a horrid use for the microwave oven and the family cat.'' 
 William Francis Buckley was born in Manhattan on Nov. 24, 1925, the sixth of the 10 children of Aloise Steiner Buckley and William Frank Buckley. His parents had intended to name him after his father, but the priest who christened him insisted on a saint's name, so Francis was chosen. 
 When the younger William Buckley was 5, he asked to change his middle name to Frank and his parents agreed. At that point, he became William F. Buckley Jr.
 The elder Mr. Buckley made a small fortune in the oil fields of Mexico and Venezuela and educated his children with personal tutors at Great Elm, the family estate in Sharon, Conn. They also attended exclusive Roman Catholic schools in England and France.
 Family's Deep Catholicism
 Young William absorbed his family's conservatism along with its deep Roman Catholicism. At 14, he followed his brothers to the Millbrook School, a preparatory school 15 miles across the New York line from Sharon.
 In his spare time at Millbrook, young Bill typed schoolmates' papers for them, charging $1 a paper, with a 25-cent surcharge for correcting the grammar.
 He graduated from Millbrook in 1943, then spent a half a year at the University of Mexico studying Spanish, which had been his first language. He served in the Army from 1944 to 1946 and managed to make second lieutenant after first putting colleagues off with his mannerisms.
 In his 1988 book, ''William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives,'' John B. Judis quoted Mr. Buckley's sister Patricia as saying that the Army experience changed Mr. Buckley. ''He got to understand people more,'' she said.
 Mr. Buckley then entered Yale, where he studied political science, economics and history; established himself as a fearsome debater; was elected chairman of The Yale Daily News; and joined Skull and Bones, the university's most prestigious secret society.
 As a senior, he was given the honor of delivering the speech for Yale's Alumni Day celebration, but was replaced after Yale's administration objected to his strong attacks on the university. He responded by writing his critique in the book that brought him to national attention, in part because he gave the publisher, Regnery, $10,000 to advertise it.
 Published in 1951, ''God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of 'Academic Freedom,' '' charged the powers at Yale with having an atheistic and collectivist bent and called for the firing of faculty members who advocated values out of line with what he saw as Yale's traditional values. 
 After a year in the Central Intelligence Agency in Mexico City (his case officer was E. Howard Hunt, who went on to participate in the Watergate break-in), Mr. Buckley went to work for the American Mercury magazine, but resigned to write on his own.
 Over the next few years, Mr. Buckley worked as a freelance writer and lecturer and wrote a second book with his brother-in-law L. Brent Bozell. Published in 1954, ''McCarthy and His Enemies'' was a sturdy defense of the senator from Wisconsin, who was then at the height of his campaign against communists, liberals and the Democratic Party. The book made the New York Times best-seller list.
 In 1955, Mr. Buckley started National Review as a voice for ''the disciples of truth, who defend the organic moral order,'' with a $100,000 gift from his father and $290,000 from outside donors. The first issue, which came out in November, claimed the publication ''stands athwart history yelling Stop.''
 It proved it by lining up squarely behind Southern segregationists, saying that Southern whites had the right to impose their ideas on blacks who were as yet culturally and politically inferior to them. After some conservatives objected, Mr. Buckley suggested instead that both uneducated whites and blacks should be denied the vote.
 Mr. Buckley did not accord automatic support to Republicans. For President Dwight D. Eisenhower, whom National Review was founded in part to oppose, the magazine ultimately managed only a memorably tepid endorsement: ''We prefer Ike.''
 Circulation increased from 16,000 in 1957 to 70,000 at the time of Goldwater's candidacy in 1964, to 115,000 in 1972. It is now 166,000. The magazine has always had to be subsidized by readers' donations, supplemented by Mr. Buckley's lecturing fees.
 Along with offering a forum to big-gun conservatives like Russell Kirk, James Burnham and Robert Nisbet, National Review cultivated the career of several younger writers, including Garry Wills, Joan Didion and John Leonard, who would shake off the conservative attachment and go their leftward ways.
 National Review also helped define the conservative movement by isolating cranks from Mr. Buckley's chosen mainstream.
 ''Bill was responsible for rejecting the John Birch Society and the other kooks who passed off anti-Semitism or some such as conservatism,'' Hugh Kenner, a biographer of Ezra Pound and a frequent contributor to National Review, told The Washington Post. ''Without Bill -- if he had decided to become an academic or a businessman or something else -- without him, there probably would be no respectable conservative movement in this country.''
 Mr. Buckley's personal visibility was magnified by his ''Firing Line'' program, which ran from 1966 to 1999. First carried on WOR-TV and then on public television, it became the longest-running program with a single host -- beating out Johnny Carson by three years. He taped 1,504 programs, including debates on scores of topics like ''Resolved: The women's movement has been disastrous.''
 There were exchanges on foreign policy with Norman Thomas, feminism with Germaine Greer, and race relations with James Baldwin. Not a few viewers thought Mr. Buckley's toothy grin before he scored a point resembled nothing so much as a switchblade.
 To the New York City politician Mark Green, he purred: ''You've been on the show close to 100 times over the years. Tell me, Mark, have you learned anything yet?''
 At age 50, Mr. Buckley crossed the Atlantic Ocean in his sailboat and became a novelist. Eleven of his novels are spy tales starring Blackford Oakes, who fights for the American way and beds the Queen of England in the first book.
 Others of his books included a historical novel with Elvis Presley as a significant character, another about the Nuremberg trials, a reasoned critique of anti-Semitism and journals that more than succeeded in dramatizing a life of taste and wealth -- his own.
 Mr. Buckley's spirit of fun was apparent in his 1965 campaign for mayor of New York on the ticket of the Conservative Party. When asked what he would do if he won, he answered, ''Demand a recount.'' He got 13.4 percent of the vote.
 In retrospect, the mayoral campaign came to be seen as the beginning of the Republican Party's successful courtship of working-class whites who later became ''Reagan Democrats.''
 Unlike his brother James, who served as a United States senator from New York, Mr. Buckley generally avoided official government posts. He did serve from 1969 to 1972 as a presidential appointee to the National Advisory Commission on Information and as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations in 1973.
 In his last years, as honors like the Presidential Medal of Freedom came his way, Mr. Buckley gradually loosened his grip on his intellectual empire. In 1998, he ended his frenetic schedule of public speeches, about 70 a year over 40 years, he once estimated. In 1999, he stopped ''Firing Line,'' and in 2004, he relinquished his voting stock in National Review. He wrote his last spy novel (the 11th in his series), sold his sailboat and stopped playing the harpsichord publicly.
 But he began a new historical novel and kept up his columns, including one on the ''bewitching power'' of ''The Sopranos'' television series. He commanded wide attention by criticizing the Iraq war as a failure.
 On April 15, 2007, his wife, the former Patricia Aldyen Austin Taylor, died. Mr. and Mrs. Buckley called each other ''Ducky.''
 He is survived by his son, Christopher, of Washington; his sisters, Priscilla L. Buckley of Sharon, Conn., Patricia Buckley Bozell of Washington, and Carol Buckley of Columbia, S.C.; his brothers, James L., of Sharon, and F. Reid, of Camden, S.C.; a granddaughter; and a grandson.
 In the end it was Mr. Buckley's graceful, often self-deprecating wit that endeared him to others. In his spy novel ''Who's on First,'' he described the possible impact of his National Review through his character Boris Bolgin.
 '' 'Do you ever read the National Review, Jozsef?' asks Boris Bolgin, the chief of KGB counter intelligence for Western Europe. 'It is edited by this young bourgeois fanatic.' ''

HEADLINE: A Little Nuke Music

 BODY:
The New York Philharmonic's concert in Pyongyang was a tantalizing taste of what might be in America's relationship with North Korea. It was also a reminder of the missteps and dangerously wrongheaded judgments that have kept the two countries apart and at saber-point for more than a half century. 
 The Philharmonic drew sustained applause and even some tears, playing Gershwin, a beloved Korean folk song and the two countries' national anthems. The concert would have had even more significance if it could have celebrated continuing progress toward shuttering North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
 That effort unfortunately has stalled, and the fault -- at least this time -- is undeniably Pyongyang's. It would take a serious diplomatic push by the Bush administration and the leaders of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea to ensure that it does not fall apart.
 North Korea agreed last year to disable its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and produce a ''complete and correct'' accounting of all its nuclear activities, facilities and weapons-usable material by the end of last year. In exchange, it was to get 950,000 tons of heavy fuel oil and start down the road toward normalizing diplomatic and economic relations with the United States and others.
 While North Korea is disabling the reactor, it has not turned over the promised list. That has revived serious doubts about whether it would ever abandon a program that has already tested a nuclear device and produced fuel for 10 or more weapons. Russia's delay in delivering some of the promised fuel oil may be a factor, but there are more serious disputes as well.
 North Korea has said it would produce the accounting, but first it wants Washington to remove it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and lift certain sanctions. Washington says the sequencing can be worked out if Pyongyang is prepared for full disclosure.
 The Bush administration has a long history of using any excuse to scuttle any diplomatic deal, but in this case it is right. Pyongyang clearly agreed to full disclosure and the deadline. Since then serious questions have also arisen about Pyongyang's nuclear cooperation with Syria. That must also be disclosed. 
 President Bush wasted years refusing to deal with North Korea, and that expanded stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium is the result. Having belatedly embraced diplomacy, the president deserves credit for not overreacting -- for continuing negotiations and fuel deliveries -- despite fierce criticism from members of his party, including former members of his administration. 
 The United States and its partners should continue to explore creative solutions to the impasse and stand ready to lift sanctions and quickly take North Korea off the terrorism list if it fulfills its obligations. China, North Korea's chief benefactor (and frequent enabler), must press Pyongyang to keep its commitments. Plans by South Korea's new president to link economic integration to nuclear progress could be important leverage. 
 If the stalemate drags on, the United States and its partners may have to get tougher and implement United Nations sanctions that they are now choosing to ignore. North Korea needs to know that the international community has patience -- but that such patience has limits.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Warning

 BODY:
It is hard to remember when any governor used the sort of desperate language that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine chose this week to describe his state's fiscal crisis. His words should be a sober warning to other states to get their fiscal houses in order before they face a crisis of Trenton's magnitude. 
 In his annual budget address to the Legislature, Mr. Corzine declared that unless New Jersey made hard choices, it would fall into a ''deeper fiscal swamp.'' He outlined deep budget cuts -- ''cold-turkey therapy'' -- that would eliminate three cabinet departments, 3,000 state jobs and squeeze aid to hospitals, colleges and universities. Even if the Legislature agreed to all of the cuts, Mr. Corzine asserted, it would still have to find a way to bring in more money. 
 More than 20 states, including New York, are facing budget shortfalls next year, due at least in part to the economic downturn, according to an analysis released this week by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The report said a few states -- most notably, Arizona and California -- face even bigger deficits than New Jersey.
 New Jersey's problems are magnified by a long history of irresponsible borrowing and spending. In a self-destructive gimmick, the state seriously underfunded its pension plan and used the money to pay for current spending programs. As a result, Mr. Corzine said, the state's annual debt service now exceeds what it invests in higher education. 
 Mr. Corzine and legislators of both parties have ruled out increasing the state's income or sales taxes. But there is no way New Jerseyans can escape real pain. Mr. Corzine has called for a significant jump in turnpike and parkway tolls. Several legislative leaders have suggested a combination of raising the state's gas tax -- one of the lowest in the nation -- a more modest increase in tolls, and a merger of some of the state's tiniest towns. 
 The Garden State's woes should serve as a warning to other states, whose lawmakers might be inclined to use budget gimmickry to deal with shortfalls in revenue and get through immediate fiscal troubles. As New Jerseyans are learning the hard way, that is likely to lead to much bigger trouble in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: New Louisiana Governor Pierces Brazen Style of Business as Usual

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La. 

 BODY:
Downstairs, legislators gnashed their teeth, while upstairs at the Capitol here this week, the new governor claimed victory against the old customs down below.
 Six weeks into the term of Gov. Bobby Jindal, an extensive package of ethics bills was approved here this week, signaling a shift in the political culture of a state proud of its brazen style. Mr. Jindal, the earnest son of Indian immigrants, quickly declared open season on the cozy fusion of interests and social habits that have prevailed among lobbyists, state legislators and state agencies here for decades. Mostly, he got what he wanted. 
 Mr. Jindal, an outsider to that rollicking if sometimes unsavory banquet, a Republican with a missionary's zeal to smite Louisiana's wickedness at one of its presumed sources, called on the Legislature to reform itself and its high-living ways. 
 Grudgingly, pushed by public opinion and business pressure, it went along. When the legislative session ended Tuesday, lawmakers had passed bills aimed at making their finances less opaque, barring their lucrative contracts with the state -- some have been known to do good business with them -- and cutting down on perks like free tickets to sporting events. The bills, which advocates say will put Louisiana in the top tier of states with tough ethics rules, now await Mr. Jindal's signature, which should come early next week. 
 Mr. Jindal overcame resistance by convincing lawmakers that no job growth would occur in the state until it cleaned up its act and brought its ethics laws into the national mainstream.
 ''I've talked to C.E.O.'s in New York, even the president of the United States,'' Mr. Jindal said in an interview, and when ''you ask them for more investment, more help on the coast and other areas, their first reaction always is: 'Well, who do you need to know? Who do I have to hire? Is this money going to end up in somebody's pocket?' '' 
 That had to change, the governor said, and he was using his ''narrow window'' -- his honeymoon at the Capitol -- to do it.
 The volume of grumbling suggested real change was afoot. 
 ''This is huge,'' said D. W. Hunt, a veteran lobbyist at the Capitol. ''This is a sea change. This will seriously, dramatically change things. The meta-theme is the transparency.''
 Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a good-government watchdog group, described the new bills as ''a major change in the culture.''
 ''It's a world of difference, particularly on the disclosure side, and the same thing with conflict-of-interest,'' he said. 
 The new requirements will force all state legislators, as well as most other elected and appointed officials around the state, to disclose all sources of income, real estate holdings and debts over $10,000. (Judges are exempted.) Lawmakers and executive branch officials will no longer be able to get contracts for state-financed or disaster-related work. Lobbyists will also have to disclose their sources of income and will be limited to spending no more than $50 per elected official, per meal; splitting the tab, say among other lobbyists or legislators, will also be prohibited. 
 The new income disclosure requirements for legislators are comparable to those of Washington State, ranked first in the country by the Center for Public Integrity.
 Mr. Jindal was unable to persuade lawmakers to pass another bill that would have ended retirement benefits for public officials convicted of crimes related to their state work.
 Similar indulgences, of course, have gone on in other state capitals, though Louisiana does rank low nationally on state ethics charts. Here, however, they are carried out with particular frankness: lawmakers are known to scour the chambers for willing lobbyists when a day's session ends, hoping to cadge a dinner invitation. They need not look far.
 Mr. Jindal took that penchant on as well, effectively aiming a blow at the Capitol's de facto sister institution, Ruth's Chris Steak House, where business is transacted nightly, courtesy of lobbyists (''sponsors,'' in legislators' parlance).
 The governor, ignoring cries of pain and going against the unswerving devotion to Louisiana's food culture, pushed for the $50-a-meal cap, at any restaurant. No more unlimited spending. 
 In a town where legislators have been known to proclaim paid-for meals a principal draw to public service, this was an especially unpopular move. Last week, State Representative Charmaine L. Marchand of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans said the limit would force her and her colleagues to dine at Taco Bell, and urged that it be pushed to $75 per person, to give them ''wiggle room.'' 
 No public groundswell took up her cause, and the $50 limit held. 
 Meanwhile, the mood is feverish but still merry at Ruth's Chris. A recent night found it packed with lobbyists and legislators. With the Capitol five miles away, its popularity will be threatened when the new rules go into effect on March 30. But the lavish springtime banquets held by lobbyists, where tables groan with choice Louisiana seafood, do not appear to be immediately endangered. 
 In the legislative chambers, the votes for this ethics makeover were mostly unanimous, though the sarcastic commentary suggested that enthusiasm might not have been what was motivating legislators. Mr. Jindal has public opinion on his side, however. 
 ''I want to know who's doing the corrupting,'' a state senator, Francis Thompson, said, mock-seriously, to Mr. Jindal's principal ally in the State Senate, its president, Joel T. Chaisson. ''Any time there's some abuse, I wish you would let us know, as our leader,'' he said to Mr. Chaisson, as other senators chuckled.
 The point was not lawbreaking, though, but what has long been permitted under existing loose laws, say reform advocates like Mr. Jindal.
 Four stories up, in the skyscraper Capitol built by Huey Long, Mr. Jindal is unconnected to the slow-moving rural Louisiana of Long and those who followed him. At 36, he appears to be a young man in a hurry, acutely conscious of Louisiana's poor national image, aware of his own rising star among Republicans and analytical about the historic missteps that have led Louisiana to coast on its mineral wealth, straight to the bottom of national rankings in ethics and a host of economic and social indicators. 
 In an interview in his office, words and prescriptions come shooting out in a rapid-fire nonstop monologue. Inside of a half-hour, Mr. Jindal shoehorned a brief history of Louisiana's political and economic problems, a historical excursion on the office he was sitting in, an agenda for his remaining four years, an analysis of why the state's government had failed, a recapitulation of his recent campaign, a paean to his father, an explanation of why he pushed the ethics bills, and other topics.
 Mr. Jindal said Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had presented him with a unique moment in his state's history to enact reforms; as he put it, the storms ''caused people to rethink how they wanted their social institutions to be designed, how they wanted services to be delivered, what kind of state they wanted to call home.''
 What follows could be much tougher, given the scope of Mr. Jindal's ambitions -- detractors grumble that they are limitless -- the bruised feelings among legislators and the scope of Louisiana's challenge: a poorly educated work force, bad roads and infrastructure, a persistent stream of residents leaving the state, and little business investment. He has already talked of cutting taxes on business, prompting questions about whether he will move beyond such traditional Republican economic strategies.
 ''My biggest concern is, we'll run out of time,'' Mr. Jindal said. ''There are so many things we need to do in our state. It's like being in this endless buffet and having this incredible appetite, but knowing there's no way you're going to be able to eat everything you want to eat, or taste everything that's out there.''

HEADLINE: House Passes Renewable Energy Credits

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House on Wednesday approved a bill to extend more than $17 billion in tax credits and other incentives to encourage the production of energy from solar, wind and other renewable sources, and to promote energy conservation. The bill would be financed by ending tax incentives for oil and natural gas producers.
 Democratic leaders in the House hailed the legislation as a step toward energy independence and a moral victory for protecting the environment, by encouraging production of clean alternative fuels. But the White House threatened to veto the bill, saying it would be a mistake to increase the tax burden on American oil companies. 
 Similar legislation has failed to pass the Senate on three occasions over the last year, including an effort in December when the package of tax credits for renewable energy fell just one vote short of the 60 needed to advance it. 
 Senate Democrats say they still hope to get it approved. But Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has opposed any effort to end the tax incentives for domestic production of oil and gas.
 ''Why would you tax oil when we are having troubles, when we aren't producing enough; we are importing it all?'' Mr. Domenici said this month. ''A tax on oil production in the United States? It seems kind of dumb to me.'' 
 In a statement after the House vote, Mr. Domenici denounced the bill and said Democrats were hurting the chances of extending the tax credits for alternative energy by tying them to ending the tax incentives for oil and gas. 
 ''These tax credits for wind, solar, biomass and other technologies are set to expire at the end of this year,'' he said. ''It is clear to me that America must pursue all its available resources if we are to meet our energy challenges.'' 
 During debate on the House floor, however, Democrats sought to frame the issue around the steep increase in gasoline prices and record profits for oil companies, a theme that they intend to focus on through this election year, along with their criticism of the Iraq war.
 ''Gasoline at the pump has gone up 75 cents, 75 cents since we first took up this legislation,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a speech supporting the bill. ''Imagine what that means to a household income.'' 
 ''The price at the pump increased 17 cents just in the past two weeks,'' Ms. Pelosi, of California, continued. ''Just yesterday oil prices reached another new record at $101 per barrel. This is at a time when oil companies are making record profits. Last year, ExxonMobil earned $40.6 billion in profits, the largest corporate profit in American history, and yet the administration refused to repeal billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil.'' 
 Democrats have insisted on eliminating the tax breaks for oil and gas companies to pay for the alternative energy incentives and thereby adhere to the Democrats' pay-as-you-go rule, which require any new spending to be offset by cuts or tax increases. 
 House Republicans countered that ending the tax incentives for big oil companies would only lead to further increases in the cost of gasoline. And some said that the main beneficiary of the bill would be Venezuela and its state-owned oil company, Citgo. 
 ''Apparently the majority is more interested in scoring political points than in providing anything close to an energy plan,'' said Representative Wally Herger, Republican of California. 
 ''When our constituents ask us to do something about gas prices, they don't want us to raise them,'' Mr. Herger said. ''Yet by increasing taxes on U.S. energy manufacturers by more than $17 billion, this bill creates a significant disincentive for domestic production, decreasing our energy security and increasing our overreliance on uncertain foreign supplies.'' 
 The Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, called Democrats irresponsible for pursuing the legislation. 
 Environmental groups, however, cheered the plan. ''This bill is an important and effective step in strengthening America's clean energy economy,'' Anna Aurilio, the Washington director of Environment America, said in a statement, adding that the bill ''would help solve global warming and promote and retain long-term development and growth in the clean energy technology industry.''

HEADLINE: New Mortgage Rules Give Wall Street a Small Lift

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street finished mixed in another seesaw session Wednesday after regulators allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more mortgages and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the central bank would continue to shore up the economy. 
 As Mr. Bernanke made his comments in testimony on Capitol Hill, the dollar plunged to a record low against the 15-nation euro. That sent oil and gold prices further into record high territory, and raised the prospect of accelerating inflation.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest sources of financing for American home loans, helped give the market some ballast after the government removed restrictions on the size of their portfolios, offering a chance to ease an extremely tight mortgage market.
 Fannie Mae shares rose 30 cents, to $27.27, while Freddie Mac shares fell 12 cents, to $25.09.
 ''The government is trying to do their part,'' said Todd Leone, managing director for equity trading at Cowen & Company. ''Together, this helps put a little more faith in the economy.''
 Both developments initially bolstered confidence, and major indexes moved higher before investors, following a pattern set in recent weeks, cashed in their profits in afternoon trading. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.36, or 0.07 percent, to 12,694.28, its fourth consecutive gain.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.27, or 0.09 percent, to 1,380.02, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 8.79, or 0.37 percent, to 2,353.78.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.88, or 0.12 percent, to 716.44.
 The euro climbed to a record high of $1.5120 against the dollar as sentiment increased that the Fed would continue cutting rates. That drove more money into commodities, especially into oil and gold.
 Oil prices broke through a new intraday high of $102 a barrel in overnight trading, then fell $1.24 to settle at $99.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Gold futures set a new high of $961.30 an ounce.
 In economic news, a government report showed weaker-than-expected business investment in durable goods, and the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell in January for the third consecutive month. New-home sales are down to the slowest pace in nearly 13 years.
 Harry Clark, president of Clark Capital Management in Philadelphia, said an economic slowdown that avoids recession could create a moderate drop in demand and help ease pressure from rising prices.
 ''Rising prices aren't a big deal if everyone is employed and the economy is growing,'' he said.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to 97 4/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.85 percent, from 3.86 percent.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: BERNANKE SAYS SAGGING GROWTH IS CHIEF CONCERN

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, signaled his readiness on Wednesday to bolster the economy with cheaper money even though inflation is picking up speed.
 The Fed chairman acknowledged that the central bank faced increasingly contradictory pressures of slowing growth and rising consumer prices. But his bottom line was that, for now, the top priority would be fighting a recession rather than fighting inflation. 
 Mr. Bernanke's view of the state of the economy, part of his semiannual appearance before Congress, came as the dollar sank to a historic low against other major currencies, introducing a possible third dimension to the economic problems the Fed chairman must tackle all at once.
 Having already cut short-term interest rates by almost half since September, Mr. Bernanke painted a grim picture of consumers reluctant to spend, businesses reluctant to invest and banks reluctant to lend. On top of it all, housing prices keep falling. 
 ''The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable'' since last summer, he told the House Financial Services Committee. In words that investors immediately recognized as a hint of lower rates, he vowed to ''act in a timely manner'' and ''provide adequate insurance against downside risks.''
 The Fed's decision to err on the side of faster growth poses risks. Ever since the wrenching experience with stagflation in the late 1970s, the rule of thumb in monetary policy has been that revving up a slow economy is far easier than slowing inflation once it becomes entrenched.
 The hope is that lower interest rates will encourage consumers and businesses to spend more, while the risk is that the spending will aggravate inflation.
 But the success or failure of the Fed's strategy could depend on something outside Mr. Bernanke's immediate control: foreign confidence in the American dollar and foreign willingness to keep financing the United States' huge external debt.
 The dollar has plunged 24 percent against a basket of six major currencies in the last four years, and on Wednesday it slipped to its lowest level yet since the United States let the dollar float freely in 1973.
 A weak dollar can be both good and bad for the United States economy. It tends to bolster American exports by making them cheaper in foreign markets, but it also pushes up inflation by raising the cost of foreign imports. And while the United States pays for foreign oil in dollars, many analysts contend that part of the recent run-up in oil prices was tied to the steadily declining value of the dollar.
 Over the long haul, the bigger worry for Mr. Bernanke may not be import prices as much as interest rates and the dollar's value. Huge inflows of cheap foreign capital helped keep interest rates for mortgages and businesses low even as the Fed raised its benchmark overnight rates from 2004 to 2006.
 If foreign investors become more wary, in part because of the dollar's declining value, some economists worry they will not invest in the United States unless they get higher long-term interest rates -- even as the Fed lowers its overnight rate.
 ''I don't think there is any great danger of hitting a trigger point where people cut and run from the dollar,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former director of research at the International Monetary Fund. ''But there are hidden costs. The dollar's pre-eminence in the international financial system provides a huge bonanza to the United States. We pay lower interest rates than we would otherwise. We can probably borrow money on short notice more easily than we could otherwise.''
 Mr. Bernanke did not mention the dollar's falling value on Wednesday, but he has said on previous occasions that he saw no sign that the dollar was in danger of losing its status as the world's leading reserve currency.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke carefully acknowledged that inflation had accelerated in recent months and would make the Fed's job much more difficult if it became ingrained in public expectations.
 ''Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded would greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the F.O.M.C,'' Mr. Bernanke warned, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. 
 ''Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to closely monitor inflation and inflation expectations,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 But Mr. Bernanke made it clear that Fed officials are more worried about a sharp slowdown and rising unemployment than they are concerned about inflation. 
 The Fed's assumption is that slower economic growth will reduce inflationary pressure in the months ahead, because debt-laden consumers will be far more wary of spending money and businesses will be more cautious about investing in plant and equipment.
 Though the Fed is still predicting that the economy will narrowly escape a recession, policy makers have sharply cut their forecasts for growth in 2008 to less than 2 percent and expect almost no expansion during the first six months of this year.
 At the hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke cautioned that even the newer bleaker forecast could prove optimistic. He predicted that the housing downturn would continue to slow the economy ''in the coming quarters,'' noting that financial markets are still in turmoil and that credit has become more difficult to get. 
 Consumer spending has ''slowed significantly,'' he said, in part because of rising gasoline prices, slowing job growth and the decline in household wealth as a result of falling home prices.
 On Wall Street, investors and analysts expressed relief that the Fed was indeed ready to lower rates again. It has already reduced the Federal funds rate to 3 percent from 5.25 percent since September, and investors had already been betting that Fed officials would lower it to 2.5 percent at its next meeting on March 18.
 ''We think Bernanke is (finally) right on'' in placing top priority on fighting a recession, wrote Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J.
 But some experts were sharply critical.
 ''They're doing the same stupid things they did in the 1970s,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and the leading historian of Fed policy. ''They were always saying that we're not going to let inflation get out of hand, that we're going to tackle it once the economy starts growing, but they never did it.'' 
 Even some economists who have warned about a recession for more than a year now expressed worry that the Fed's policy of lower interest rates, combined with slowing growth and credit market problems, could undermine foreign confidence in the dollar, driving up both interest rates and inflation.
 ''I'm still of the view that the downside risks to the economy are more important than the inflation risks, but at some point the ability of the Fed to cut rates will be limited by the willingness of the rest of the world to finance the current account deficit,'' said Nouriel Roubini, president of Roubini Global Economics in New York, referring to the broadest measure of the nation's trade and investment balance.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Efforts on Ethanol Overlap Her Husband's Interests

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
To big rounds of applause, three of the world's richest men -- Richard Branson, Ronald W. Burkle and Vinod Khosla -- trooped onto a New York ballroom stage with former President Bill Clinton to pledge support for renewable energy projects to combat global warming and create jobs.
 It was September 2006, and the Clinton Global Initiative, the annual star-studded networking event for philanthropists and investors, had generated commitments to spend billions on ethanol and other alternative fuels. Cast as good works, many were also investments by businessmen hoping for a profit.
 And sitting in the audience was an influential public official who had also taken an active interest in renewable sources of fuel: Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 Several months earlier, Mrs. Clinton had sponsored legislation to provide billions in new federal incentives for ethanol, and, especially in her home state of New York, she has worked to foster a business climate that favors the sort of ethanol investments pursued by her husband's friends and her political supporters. 
 One potential beneficiary is the Yucaipa Companies, a private equity firm where Mr. Clinton has been a senior adviser and whose founder, Mr. Burkle, has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mrs. Clinton's campaigns. Yucaipa has invested millions in Cilion Inc. -- a start-up venture also backed by Mr. Branson, the British entrepreneur, and Mr. Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist -- that is building seven ethanol plants around the country. Two are in upstate New York. 
 A Cilion executive said Mrs. Clinton's office had been helpful to the company as it pursued its New York projects. More broadly, by steering federal money, organizing investor forums and offering the services of her staff, she has helped turn the upstate region into an incubator for ventures like Cilion's, while providing a useful showcase for her energy proposals on the campaign trail.
 Certainly Mrs. Clinton is doing what would be expected of a senator trying to stimulate a sagging rural economy in her home state, not to mention a presidential candidate mindful of the importance of ethanol in corn-producing places like Iowa. But her actions take on an added dimension when they intersect with Mr. Clinton's philanthropic and profit-making endeavors, which have periodically raised questions as Mrs. Clinton seeks the Democratic nomination for president. 
 Yucaipa's partnership with the rulers of Dubai and its investment in a Chinese media company drew attention to Mr. Clinton's connection to the fund when his wife was preparing her presidential run last year. In December, aides to Mr. Clinton said he was taking steps to end his relationship with Yucaipa to avoid potential conflicts of interest or political imbroglios for his wife, should she become the Democratic nominee.
 Representatives of the Clintons declined repeated requests for comment that included a detailed set of questions submitted to Mrs. Clinton's campaign more than a week ago.
 Because Mr. Burkle's Yucaipa funds are private, and the Clintons have refused to release their tax returns, details of Yucaipa's investments and Mr. Clinton's potential to profit from them are not publicly available. Last year, after Mr. Clinton published a book on philanthropy that extols the virtues of investing in renewable energy and contains a reference to Cilion, a spokesman for the former president told New York magazine that he consulted for Yucaipa on renewable energy investments but was not involved in Cilion.
 On Wednesday, a spokesman for Yucaipa declined to say how much it had invested in Cilion, but said it amounted to less than 5 percent of the company's equity -- small by Yucaipa standards, but enough for it to be represented on Cilion's board. He said Mr. Clinton did not stand to profit from Yucaipa's investment in Cilion.
 Under an agreement with Mr. Burkle in 2002, Mr. Clinton was to provide advice and find investment opportunities for several domestic and foreign funds in Yucaipa's portfolio, and would receive a share of the profits from those funds. On a financial disclosure report that Mrs. Clinton filed as a presidential candidate last year, Mr. Clinton listed several direct investments through Yucaipa, including one in a Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol company founded by Mr. Khosla, but Cilion was not among them.
 Mrs. Clinton is far from alone in proposing increased federal incentives for renewable energy -- her opponent, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, backs even greater spending on biofuels -- and not all of her actions on ethanol would benefit the interests of Mr. Clinton and his associates. She has voted to preserve a tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports, which helps domestic ethanol producers but works against investors in Brazilian facilities.
 In fact, Mrs. Clinton had long opposed ethanol subsidies, but in May 2006, she switched gears and introduced a bill to create a $50 billion ''strategic energy fund'' to expand the use of ethanol and other alternative fuels. The bill, which was reintroduced last year, would direct billions of dollars to develop cellulosic ethanol, an experimental fuel made from organic materials other than corn.
 In addition to the legislation, Mrs. Clinton has spent an increasing amount of time in upstate New York, promoting the region as fertile territory for renewable energy projects. In Lockport in July 2006, she said she was working with the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry -- which has offered technical assistance to Cilion and other companies in the region -- to support locally produced ethanol, rather than ''just relying on corn in the Midwest.''
 ''Because I want New York farmers, I want farmers around the country, to participate in this,'' she said. ''It's going to take building production facilities, and we're starting to do that.''
 Several business and academic leaders in the region said they had crossed paths more than once with Mr. Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Khosla on the issue of biofuels, specifically cellulosic ethanol.
 Cornelius B. Murphy Jr., president of the environmental college, said Mrs. Clinton became very active in assisting the school's renewable energy projects starting in late 2005, and has since been involved in about eight events with the college. In 2006, the college also heard from Mr. Clinton, who wanted to talk to experts there about cellulosic ethanol and the concept of using forest products in place of corn.
 ''I'm amazed at how much her husband has picked up on this,'' Dr. Murphy said of the former president. ''He was very interested in the growth of energy feed stocks and how that could be worked into an integrated biorefinery.''
 One of the biggest champions of cellulosic ethanol is Cilion's founder, Mr. Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems who has grown close to Mr. Clinton in recent years through a mutual interest in renewable energy. In November, at a renewable energy forum in Iowa that was attended by some of the presidential candidates, Mr. Khosla opened his PowerPoint presentation with a quote from Mr. Clinton on the economic benefits of green investments.
 Mr. Khosla provided seed money to create Cilion in June 2006, and shortly before the Clinton Global Initiative that September, Cilion announced it had received $160 million more, including an unspecified amount from Yucaipa. He is also backing another company, the Mascoma Corporation, which wants to build a plant in the Rochester area that will convert forest products, like wood chips and switch grass, into cellulosic ethanol.
 Mr. Khosla did not respond to a request for comment.
 Although Cilion uses corn, it hopes to eventually make cellulosic ethanol once the technology becomes commercially viable, said Jerry Wilhelm, the company's executive vice president. Mr. Wilhelm said Cilion, which also has projects in California, Pennsylvania and Washington State, picked New York because of its large potential ethanol market, the availability of farmland and local support.
 Mr. Wilhelm said that the New York projects were at an early stage, but that Mrs. Clinton ''definitely has been helpful,'' not only in writing letters but also in her general support of renewable energy initiatives in the region.
 ''We've gotten some letters of support from her that we've used in the permitting process,'' he said in an interview. ''We haven't asked for a lot, but what we've asked from her, she's responded.''
 Late Wednesday, Yucaipa disputed that Mrs. Clinton had written any letters on behalf of Cilion. Efforts to reach Mr. Wilhelm to clarify the matter were unsuccessful.
 Cilion's efforts to set up a base of operations in upstate New York included joining the board of the Greater Rochester Enterprise, a nonprofit group that promotes business opportunities in the region. The group, which provided Cilion with office space and made introductions to key people, has worked closely with Mrs. Clinton on several renewable energy initiatives.
 Mrs. Clinton arranged for the group to work with the U.S. Green Buildings Council to produce a report on the economic benefits of renewable fuels and energy conservation in the Rochester area, where both of Cilion's ethanol projects are. The report concluded, among other things, that there should be more incentives to use locally generated renewable energy, and it cited a Cilion project, along with several others, as an example of available resources.
 The 17-page report, which devotes a full page to Mrs. Clinton and mentions her eight times, ''would not have happened without the senator,'' said Dennis M. Mullen, president of the Greater Rochester Enterprise.
 ''We have met with the senator on numerous occasions, not only on ethanol but also other issues,'' Mr. Mullen said. ''She has helped us promote that in numerous ways.''
 Cilion, meanwhile, recently revamped its Web site and added comments from Mrs. Clinton and other presidential candidates to illustrate the depth of political support for ethanol. The new site quotes Mrs. Clinton saying the country needs ''an Apollo-like effort'' to invest in renewable energy, and it provides a link to her strategic energy fund at hillaryclinton.com.

HEADLINE: Despite Nafta Attacks, Clinton and Obama Haven't Been Free Trade Foes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Patrick Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As they have tussled for votes in economically beleaguered Ohio, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton have both excoriated the North American Free Trade Agreement while lobbing accusations against their opponent on the issue.
 Lost amid the posturing, however, is that both have staked out nuanced positions in the past on Nafta and have supported similar trade deals. Although their language has become much more hostile to free trade as they have exchanged charges and countercharges, neither of them would have been mistaken in the past for an ardent protectionist or a die-hard free trader. 
 Instead, both appear to have been part of the conflicted middle ground within the Democratic Party that is groping for a proper balance between being friendly to free trade agreements, believing they are beneficial to the economy, but also seeking to level the playing field for the United States when it comes to labor and environmental standards and addressing job losses that come with globalization. 
 ''The bottom line,'' said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch division of Public Citizen and a fierce free trade foe, ''is neither of the current Democratic candidates were in the category of leaders fighting for improving U.S. trade policy to try to come up with different terms for globalization, but in the course of their campaign they have come to see both the political necessity and the substantive problems, pushing them to some interesting new thinking.''
 There is clearly a large dose of politics behind the vigor with which the Democratic contenders are attacking each other on Nafta, full of parsed quotations and misrepresentations. Mr. Obama has accused Mrs. Clinton of full-throated support for Nafta in the past, while Mrs. Clinton has leveled the same charge against Mr. Obama. 
 In the minds of hard-core opponents of free trade, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have checkered records in the Senate on trade agreements. Both voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement but supported a trade pact with Peru last year, citing the inclusion of labor and environmental provisions that were not part of Nafta.
 Opponents, however, said crucial provisions in Nafta that led to jobs being shipped overseas were also part of the Peru agreement. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were also among only a dozen Senate Democrats who voted for a trade agreement with Oman in 2006. 
 ''They're hedging their bets,'' said Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat whose district in the northern part of the state has been decimated by job losses. ''They're trying to have it both ways, and you can't.''
 For Mrs. Clinton, her past on the issue poses a special dilemma as she stumps for votes in Ohio, where Nafta is extremely unpopular, given that it was her husband, President Bill Clinton, whose administration pushed through the trade agreement, making it a top priority and counting it as one of his legislative triumphs.
 She now says that she supported the trade agreement as a loyal member of the administration but had reservations in private, although there is scant evidence of this in her public statements because she typically espoused Nafta's benefits. 
 But Mickey Kantor, who is a friend and supporter of Mrs. Clinton's and was the United States trade representative when the agreement was pushed through, said in an interview in December that Mrs. Clinton raised concerns about the lack of provisions for labor and environmental standards and wanted to tackle health care instead.
 David Gergen, a senior adviser in the Clinton administration, recalled Mrs. Clinton being ''extremely unenthusiastic'' about Nafta. Her feelings did not necessarily flow directly from her objections to the agreement, he said, although Mr. Gergen said he remembers her being dissatisfied with aspects of it. Rather, he said, Mrs. Clinton badly wanted to move on to health care and worried the Nafta fight would alienate constituencies like organized labor that she needed for that battle. 
 The Obama campaign has seized on past statements Mrs. Clinton made about the positive effects of Nafta, including one from 2004 when she said ''on balance Nafta has been good for New York and America'' during a news teleconference. But she said in the same teleconference that past trade deals needed to be revisited with an eye to enforcing labor and environmental standards.
 Similarly, the Obama campaign sent out a mailer in Ohio that drew the ire of Mrs. Clinton that quoted her as saying in Newsday that Nafta had been a ''boon'' to the economy, a word she had not used directly but was part of the newspaper's assessment of her position on the trade agreement.
 For its part, the Clinton campaign has sent out its direct mail piece that quotes Mr. Obama in 2004 while he was running for the Senate praising Nafta, declaring, ''Ohio needs to know the truth about Obama's position on protecting American workers and NAFTA.''
 The mailer, however, selectively quotes from a pair of news articles on statements made by Mr. Obama about Nafta. It said, for example, that he declared that the United States should pursue similar agreements but leaves out comments he made about the importance of protecting American interests and workers. 
 The mailer also quotes Mr. Obama as saying that the United States ''benefits enormously from exports'' under Nafta but again fails to mention that he also stressed the importance of fighting for ''fair trade,'' as well as free trade.
 At Tuesday's Democratic debate, Mr. Obama struck a similar balancing act, saying he did not believe it was possible to ''draw a moat around us.'' 
 But he also echoed promises made by Mrs. Clinton during the debate that he would be ''an advocate on behalf of workers as president.''

HEADLINE: Black Ohioans Backing Clinton Feel the Pressure to Switch

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
The way Eugene R. Miller was hemming and hawing about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, you would have thought he was trying to sell igloos in the Sahara. 
 Mr. Miller, a state legislator who represents a solidly black wedge of this majority-black city, was standing before a roomful of silver-haired constituents and making a semi-heartfelt pitch for Mrs. Clinton. He talked about her political skills, her commitment to urban America and her promise to address the mounting foreclosures that are turning swaths of his East Side district into ghost towns. 
 But, nervously shifting his feet, Mr. Miller was also moved to explain how he -- a young African-American who won office two years ago after finishing first in a primary election by fewer than 200 votes -- could have the gumption to make a case against Senator Barack Obama, the man who stands to become the nation's first black president. 
 ''I believe in sticking to my word,'' he said, adding that he had cast his lot with Mrs. Clinton long before Mr. Obama's candidacy became viable. ''And there is something to be said for courage.'' 
 With less than a week before Ohioans go to the polls in the Democratic primary, Mr. Miller and a small group of other black elected officials who are stumping for Mrs. Clinton are nothing if not courageous. Spending eight-hour days talking up his candidate, Mr. Miller finds himself besieged by disbelief, disapproval and at times ridicule from blacks who maintain that he is betraying his race.
 ''Some people call me an Uncle Tom,'' said Mr. Miller, who, up for re-election, faces an opponent next week whose literature includes a picture of Mr. Obama. ''There's a lot of pressure to switch sides. There's a lot of emotion. All I can say is thank God it's winter and no one is outside, because there would be more than angry words on the street.'' 
 Although recent polls suggest that Mrs. Clinton still enjoys the support of one in four black voters here, most pollsters and political consultants doubt that she will retain that much of Ohio's black vote, which makes up at least 20 percent of the state's Democratic electorate.
 In many other primaries, including those in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland and Wisconsin, Mr. Obama won more than 80 percent of black voters. Some experts here say that if he can increase that percentage in Ohio, he has a good chance of taking the state and putting an end to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy.
 Arnold Pinkney, a Cleveland political consultant who ran the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign, said that while his assessment was based largely on his gut, he believed that Mr. Obama, whom he supports, could capture as much as 90 percent of Ohio's black vote.
 ''In the street, at church, everywhere I go, Barack is all anyone is talking about,'' Mr. Pinkney said. ''I think the turnout is going to be huge.''
 Despite Mr. Obama's popularity here, there remain plenty of black voters who say they are standing by Mrs. Clinton. Gale Johnson, 49, a former steelworker who now, as a social worker, earns half her old salary, said Mrs. Clinton was best equipped to turn around the state's stricken economy. 
 ''To me, it's not about race,'' said Ms. Johnson, her jacket festooned with ''Hillary'' buttons. ''It's about having a president who knows what she's doing. Besides, I think it's time for a woman to be president.''
 Then there are those whose loyalty is inseparable from their affection for Mrs. Clinton's husband. Anita Watkins, 71, a retired nurse, said her devotion to former President Bill Clinton trumped her desire to see a black man in the White House.
 ''My children are mad at me,'' Ms. Watkins said, ''but I love Bill Clinton, and that's who needs my help right now.''
 With Mr. Obama enjoying the support of much of the black establishment -- including prominent church leaders, the mayor of Cleveland and the City Council speaker -- the Clintons are counting heavily on a local congresswoman, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, whose 11th District takes in much of the East Side, to keep black voters from defecting.
 More delegates are at stake in Ms. Jones's district than in any other in Ohio. A national co-chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, she has been visiting black communities throughout the country. In Cleveland, she recruited Mr. Miller, the state representative, and a handful of other African-American officials to be Clinton surrogates.
 For some Clinton supporters, the heat has been too much to bear. In recent weeks, two black city councilmen, Robert J. White III and Kevin Conwell, have jumped ship to the Obama campaign, saying they could not take the heckling and the scolding stares. At his weekly community meeting at a local library, Mr. Conwell said, a few people wept when he tried to persuade those present to back Mrs. Clinton. 
 ''They said I was on the wrong side of history,'' he recalled. ''They said I was getting in the way of an African-American becoming president.''
 He was harangued at the barbershop and at the dry cleaner, and calls from the discontented poured into his office. 
 ''I felt like the stepchild of the community,'' he said. 
 Two weeks ago Mr. Conwell gave way. 
 ''Now everyone is patting me on the back,'' he said. ''It feels good to be loved again.''
 Mr. Miller spent Sunday stumping across the East Side with Laura Richardson, a black freshman congresswoman from California who was unapologetic about her support for Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Richardson said she found that many voters had doubts about Mr. Obama's job readiness but were embarrassed to say so. 
 ''People need to hear that it's O.K. to choose the best-qualified person,'' she said, ''and that they don't have to feel ashamed or be guilty about that.''
 With that in mind, she breezed into Sanctuary Baptist Church here on Sunday, Bible in hand, and stood in front of 100 parishioners. She spoke of Mrs. Clinton's credentials, the importance of ending the war in Iraq and the urgency of electing a president who ''doesn't need a couple of years getting up to speed.'' 
 The crowd appeared unmoved.
 Then, as the tease of an organ signified that it was time to wrap up, Ms. Richardson made a final appeal.
 ''I'm going to challenge you to go home and pray about it, and ask God who would be best for us at this time,'' she said. ''Let's trust God to lead us to who that person should be.''

HEADLINE: McCain and Obama Trade Jabs on Al Qaeda in Iraq

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and ELISABETH BUMILLER; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Elisabeth Bumiller from Tyler, Tex. Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting from Zanesville, Ohio.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain opened a new line of attack against Senator Barack Obama on Wednesday, accusing him of being willing to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda.
 Mr. McCain, the likely Republican nominee for president, previewed a possible general election contest with Mr. Obama, the Democratic front-runner. Seizing on a comment from Tuesday night's Democratic debate, Mr. McCain said that Mr. Obama's plan to withdraw American troops rapidly from Iraq would leave the country in the hands of Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups.
 In that debate, Mr. Obama had said in response to a hypothetical question that although he intended to withdraw American forces as rapidly as possible, he reserved the right to send troops back in ''if Al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq.'' 
 Mr. McCain pounced on the remark. ''I have some news,'' he said at a town-hall-style meeting in Tyler, Tex. ''Al Qaeda is in Iraq. It's called 'Al Qaeda in Iraq.' My friends, if we left, they wouldn't be establishing a base. They'd be taking a country, and I'm not going to allow that to happen.''
 Mr. Obama, campaigning in Columbus, Ohio, responded soon after. ''I have some news for John McCain,'' Mr. Obama said at a large rally at Ohio State University. ''There was no such thing as Al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq.''
 An insurgent group operating in Iraq, called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, is actually a homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign led. The extent of its links to Osama bin Laden's network is not clear. Some leaders of the group have sworn allegiance to Mr. bin Laden, but the precise links and extent of affiliation are unknown, and it was created after the American invasion.
 In the exchange of charges between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, both essentially ignored Mr. Obama's Democratic rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was campaigning in Ohio on economic and trade issues. Mrs. Clinton, speaking to reporters Wednesday morning, said she was pleased with her debate performance and indicated that she intended to pursue the nomination even if she loses the Ohio and Texas primaries on Tuesday.
 ''I think what's important is that we have a lot of people yet to vote,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters traveling on her plane.
 Later, in Zanesville, Ohio, Mrs. Clinton said she remained optimistic about the race because she was raising $1 million a day online. ''People have just been really rallying to my candidacy,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Clinton had been asked at Tuesday's debate about the public release of her tax returns and thousands of pages from the archives of Bill Clinton's presidency, and offered assurances that both would be forthcoming. On Wednesday, a Clinton campaign spokesman said she would release them ''as the Democratic nominee'' in April, at tax time.
 As for the archives, Mrs. Clinton had suggested that she was waiting for the White House to complete its part of the process. However, on Wednesday a White House spokeswoman kicked the issue back to Mrs. Clinton, saying there were no requests pending for the release of records.
 Mr. Obama's campaign said Wednesday that it had received campaign contributions from more than a million people, most of them relatively small donors. The Obama campaign has been raising considerably more money than the Clinton campaign since the beginning of this year. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign had not released the total number of its donors.
 In Columbus on Wednesday morning, Mr. Obama delivered one of his sharpest critiques yet of Mr. McCain. For several minutes, Mr. Obama mocked his potential Republican rival as he answered Mr. McCain's charge that he lacks sufficient foreign policy experience for the presidency.
 ''I've been paying attention, John McCain,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to a crowd of 7,000 in the St. John Arena on the Ohio State campus. ''So John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, but so far, all he's done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq.''
 He added, ''I respect John McCain, but he's tied to the politics of the past -- we are about the policies of the future. He's the party of yesterday. We want to be the party of tomorrow.''
 Meanwhile, Tennessee Republican officials defended a press release issued Monday that said Mr. Obama was anti-Israel and was supported by anti-Semites like Louis Farrakhan, founder of the Nation of Islam. The release uses Mr. Obama's middle name, Hussein, and includes the widely distributed photo of Mr. Obama in native Somali garb on a trip to Africa in 2006.
 Mr. Obama, responding to a question at Tuesday's debate, rejected Mr. Farrakhan's support and proclaimed his support for Israel.
 Bill Hobbs, spokesman for the Tennessee Republican Party, said the party issued the release because ''Barack Obama has surrounded himself with people who do not have the best interests of Israel at heart.'' He said the party had gotten complaints from Democrats and some Republicans, but had not heard from the McCain campaign.
 Mr. McCain said he could not control the activities of such groups until he was the nominee.

HEADLINE: Hillary, Buckeye Girl

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

DATELINE: ZANESVILLE, Ohio 

 BODY:
 If Hillary Clinton were a state, she'd be Ohio. 
 This is a no-frills kind of place, suspicious of glamour. Barack Obama's promise to make politics cool again doesn't necessarily resonate here. Eight presidents came from Ohio, and the coolest was William McKinley.
 When I grew up in Cincinnati, we always rooted for the players who worked really, really hard, not the ones who were so talented they made everything look easy. If Hillary were a baseball player, she'd be Pete Rose. Minus, of course, the unfortunate gambling issues and the tendency to scratch inappropriate places while standing in the infield. 
 So there she was Wednesday here in Zanesville, holding an economic summit in a gymnasium with a huge table stuffed full of participants, including the founder of Weight Watchers; former Senator John Glenn, the heroic astronaut who once put the entire Democratic presidential convention to sleep with his keynote speech; and the governor of Ohio, a vice presidential hopeful who looks like an unidentified passer-by.
 ''We have to start acting like Americans again, and roll up our sleeves and start solving our problems,'' Clinton said, launching one of the least-exciting discussions of economic development in memory. 
 There she sat, one of the best-known human beings on the planet. The first woman ever to be a serious United States presidential contender; the face that launched a thousand books; a former first lady, current U.S. senator and survivor of the most famous sex scandal of the century. And yet she has managed to become the boring candidate in this primary. 
 This is one of the great anti-glamour stories in history. How could Ohio not relate? 
 If Hillary can win this one -- and if she doesn't, she is as cooked as reheated risotto -- it will be because people here worry that Barack Obama is getting show-offy. 
 It's not his fault. Contrary to rumor, he is not planting those people who faint from excitement at his rallies. Nevertheless, they continue to topple, and by now Barack is so used to this particular crisis that it has become almost a part of the rally routine. ''If we have an E.M.T. in the house, I think somebody got faint,'' he said calmly when a woman keeled over in front of the stage in Cincinnati. ''They just need a little water and some juice.''
 At the debate on Tuesday, Clinton followed through on her promise to hit Obama hard on campaign fliers that she said mischaracterized her positions on trade and health care. She had been billing this confrontation in terms usually reserved for professional wrestling grudge matches. But earlier that day, a right-wing radio commentator at a John McCain rally denounced Obama in terms so over the top that McCain felt obliged to apologize. After that, a sloppy quotation mark in a Nafta pamphlet sounded pretty petty.
 What's the Clinton campaign come to when she can't get equal denunciation time from a right-wing nut job? 
 Back around Debate 10 -- lo those many debates ago -- Hillary routinely wiped the floor with Barack. He was reluctant and stumbling. She was confident and presidential. Then, as Adam Nagourney pointed out in The Times this week, he suddenly evolved. Now, he's better than she is -- calm and witty at crucial junctures, always to the point, never obsessing on the small stuff. After this week's Debate 20, Hillary's people gloated over the fact that Barack had said he agreed with her entirely on several key points, as if this was an admission of weakness rather than the key to his campaign -- the promise to find whatever consensus there is and build on it. 
 If Hillary is stumbling, it may be because there just isn't any good path to take. Nobody wants a bloodbath, and fighting against the first possible African-American president can be as tricky as going after the first possible woman. Still, she might have been able to handle all that, and the fact that he is a product of Kansas and Hawaii and Kenya, of Christians and Muslims, of a single mom on food stamps and Harvard Law, if he didn't also turn out to have the best learning curve in political history.
 You don't often see a candidate on a trajectory like Obama's, and at some point it will inevitably head down again. But until it does, even the original Bill Clinton would have a hard time beating him. 
 If things don't go well for Hillary over the next few weeks, some of her consultants may need retraining for a promising new career in, say, motel management, but here's what I hope she understands. She's done fine. And she'd probably have won the nomination walking away if Barack hadn't picked this moment to mutate into BARACK!
 You do your best, and if things don't work out, it just wasn't your time. Life isn't always fair. 
 All of which Ohio understands very well.

The commander of American forces in the Middle East says he will endorse a brief pause in troop reductions from Iraq this summer, but then will seek a resumption of withdrawals to ease stress on the overall military and allow him to balance deployments across the volatile region.
 Those comments by Adm. William J. Fallon, leader of the military's Central Command, added to indications that American troop levels in Iraq would hold at about 140,000, at least temporarily, after the departure by July of five additional combat brigades ordered to Iraq last year by President Bush. 
 But Admiral Fallon, in an interview on Tuesday at his headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base here, made clear his appraisal that the halt in reductions should be temporary -- and brief -- just long enough to allow ''all the dust to settle'' and to provide an opportunity for ''a clear-eyed view'' of the way ahead.
 Admiral Fallon's comments struck a somewhat different tone from the one voiced privately by Bush administration officials who have said they advocate holding to troop levels before the ''surge'' for some months, perhaps even until the end of the administration. Some ground commanders in Iraq also support a delayed timetable for further reductions, to maintain security advances earned by the troop increase.
 Admiral Fallon said he advocated a strategy that would ''transfer more and more responsibility for security in Iraq to Iraqi security forces and, at the same time, withdrawing a substantial amount of our combat forces.'' American military personnel remaining in Iraq, he said, would mostly be in the ''supporting, sustaining, advising, training and mentoring role.'' 
 The admiral did not offer a specific timetable for reducing troop levels in Iraq, which is expected to be a central part of the recommendations presented to President Bush over coming weeks by Admiral Fallon, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior commander in Iraq, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Senior military officers already say it is quite possible that no specific timetable for troop withdrawals beyond July will emerge from the commanders' sessions with the president this spring, and that instead a series of monthly reviews will be put in place for assessing, and ordering, troop levels beyond the summer.
 The monthly reviews would allow the military to manage troop levels in Iraq more efficiently, reshaping the force to fit an evolving security situation -- instead of the current system, in which General Petraeus, Admiral Fallon and the Joint Chiefs reported to the president last September and are set to return six months later.
 Achieving success in Iraq has ''gone a little slower than I anticipated,'' Admiral Fallon said. ''Nonetheless, it is progressing.''
 In the interview on Tuesday, Admiral Fallon also revealed that as American forces were reduced in Iraq, he hoped to increase deployments to Afghanistan by adding ''a couple of thousand'' military trainers to support Afghan Army and police forces.
 In previewing his stance on force levels in Iraq, Admiral Fallon appears to be in step with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, the Joint Chiefs and General Petraeus, at least in the sense that all are determined to avoid a repeat of tensions among commanders overseas and at the Pentagon over the allotment of limited numbers of troops to Iraq, Afghanistan and other trouble spots around the world.
 Pentagon planners confirmed this week that the American troop level in Iraq when the five additional brigades returned home would be about 8,000 more than when the surge began. That is because some of the support, logistics and aviation troops that joined the extra combat brigades will remain, keeping the total at about 140,000.
 Even so, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, said Tuesday that he planned to reduce combat tours to 12 months from the current 15 months by the end of summer.
 General Casey told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he would not endorse sustaining 15-month tours even if the president ordered a halt to troop reductions after the fifth additional brigade returned home in July. 
 ''The cumulative effects of the last six-plus years at war,'' he said, ''have left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight and unable to do the things we know we need to do to properly sustain our all-volunteer force and restore our flexibility for an uncertain future.''
 The debate over future force levels in Iraq has a direct and immediate effect on operations in Afghanistan, which civilian and military officers concede has been ''an economy of force'' mission because of the overwhelming demand for troops in Iraq. Admiral Fallon's area of command includes Afghanistan.
 Previewing the top-to-bottom review of Afghan strategy he ordered late last year, Admiral Fallon said that the United States, NATO and other allies currently had sufficient combat forces in Afghanistan to carry out the security mission. 
 ''All the talk about how many guns and how many troops are there -- we are O.K.,'' he said. ''Could we do better with a few more folks? Of course. But the real challenge is: Where is the economic viability for this place?''
 The goal of NATO commanders in Afghanistan, he said, should be to get more effective results from the combat forces already deployed. He specifically declined to echo recent criticism of NATO combat troops expressed by several administration officials, including Mr. Gates. But Admiral Fallon did acknowledge, ''If we could get the right results from not a significant difference in number of people, we would be well on the way.''
 As American troop levels are reduced in Iraq, and Army and Marine Corps ground forces are given time to rest and retrain, Admiral Fallon said he would move to order ''a substantial investment in training a very nascent Afghan Army and police.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft Gets Record Fine and a Rebuke From Europe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The European antitrust regulator imposed a record $1.35 billion fine against Microsoft on Wednesday in a ruling intended to send a clear message to the world's largest software maker -- and to any other company -- of the dangers of flouting Europe's competition rulings.
 The size of the penalty, which surprised lawyers and legal experts, was a clear assertion of the power of the European Commission and its main antitrust regulator, Neelie Kroes, who is its competition commissioner. She has emerged from a lengthy legal battle with Microsoft as possibly the world's most activist regulator. 
 The dispute with the commission has cost Microsoft more than $2.3 billion in fines.
 The commission's willingness to enforce vigorously its interpretation of what constitutes unfair competition potentially raises the costs of running a successful business in Europe for many American companies. It might pose problems for companies like Apple, Intel and Qualcomm, whose market dominance in online music downloads, computer chips and mobile phone technology is also being scrutinized by the European Commission. 
 Google, which has a dominant share of the market for Internet search and its related advertising, also faces a tough examination of its proposed acquisition of Doubleclick, an Internet advertising company. 
 In announcing the fine, Ms. Kroes expressed her irritation at what she said was Microsoft's failure to carry out the changes ordered by the commission in 2004 when it ruled that the market dominance of the company's Windows software was abusive. The ruling was upheld in September by one of the highest European courts. 
 ''Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of E.U. competition policy that the commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision,'' Ms. Kroes said in a statement. ''I hope that today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of noncompliance with the commission's March 2004 decision.''
 Heike Schweitzer, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, said the high penalty ''can only be understood as a reaction to a behavior by Microsoft.''
 She added that the commission interpreted it as ''a blatant circumvention of the rules it imposed, and as a strong signal that, under such conditions, the commission will go close to the limits in order to provide for effective deterrence.''
 Last Thursday, Microsoft published 30,000 pages of previously secret software code for the Windows operating system on its Web site. The company called the move a significant concession toward greater openness and compatibility with competitors. The commission greeted that news coolly, noting that Microsoft had made ''at least four similar statements'' in the past.
 Microsoft said it was reviewing the commission's action. It added that the fines were ''about the past issues that have been resolved.''
 While the fine closes this chapter of the commission's dispute with Microsoft, the company has other pending matters before the commission. The commission is examining whether the bundling of Internet Explorer into Microsoft Windows has unfairly excluded competitors from the Web browser market. It will also investigate whether Microsoft withheld essential information from companies that wanted to make products compatible with its ubiquitous software, including the Office word processing and spreadsheet programs.
 Ms. Kroes, in her comments, scarcely sought to disguise her annoyance with Microsoft. Her actions also appeared to end any hope Microsoft might have entertained that it was entering a new era of cooperation with Ms. Kroes.
 Rapprochement seemed to be possible after Microsoft agreed in October to fall into line with the 2004 decision. Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, agreed to do so after meeting Ms. Kroes in a restaurant near her home north of The Hague. But on Wednesday, Ms. Kroes underlined how little trust she had in Microsoft.
 ''I can remember four times when, if you were naive, you could have thought everything was fixed,'' Ms. Kroes said. ''This didn't seem to be the reality. They have to deliver and implement.''
 The decision in March 2004 required Microsoft to disclose within 120 days information that would allow rival vendors to interoperate with the Windows system. European antitrust officials said the royalties and patent fees the company sought for use of the data were excessive.
 Ms. Kroes said the fine was calculated based on the fact that Microsoft was in breach of the commission's order for 488 days. It represented 60 percent of the maximum $2.25 billion that the commission could have imposed, she said. (The dollar amount of the fines, which were levied in euros, have been converted using the exchange rates that then prevailed.) The commission had already fined Microsoft more than $600 million at the time of the 2004 ruling, and more than $350 million in July 2006 for failing to comply with a requirement that it license network communications technology.
 Ms. Schweitzer, the law professor, said the amount of the fine Wednesday was striking given the nature of the issue -- a ruling that royalty pricing should be reasonable.
 ''I am surprised that they have imposed such a high penalty over such a vague and difficult concept as reasonable pricing,'' Ms. Schweitzer said, ''although the difference between the royalties originally charged by Microsoft and the one ultimately found to be reasonable is indeed significant.''
 Adam Collinson, a partner at the Eversheds law firm in Britain, said that Ms. Kroes's ''personal irritation at the Microsoft situation is palpable.'' He added, however, that the situation may not have been straightforward for the corporation because ''Microsoft had to make a judgment as to what levels of royalty would be regarded as reasonable for supply of the interoperability information.''
 Thomas Vinje, a spokesman for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a group including several Microsoft competitors, praised the decision.
 ''Commissioner Kroes is to be commended for her perseverance over the last three years in the face of Microsoft's foot-dragging and appeals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Leaving Las Vegas, for the Suburbs

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

 BODY:
WHEN Bob Carson set out last year to find a second home in the Las Vegas area, his list of must-haves was short but sweet. 
 He wanted to be close to golf courses. He wanted a pick of fine restaurants. Perhaps most important, he wanted to be a comfortable distance from the hubbub of Las Vegas, without keeping it too far out of reach. 
 Mr. Carson found all of these things in and around Summerlin, a booming community about 12 miles northwest of downtown Vegas. Mr. Carson, a retired shopping-center developer, spent nearly $2 million on a 10th-floor condominium at One Queensridge Place, a new two-tower Art Nouveau high-rise on the outskirts of Summerlin with commanding views of the Las Vegas Valley. 
 ''Being here is the best of both worlds,'' said Mr. Carson, who expects to visit from his primary home in Del Mar, Calif., roughly once a month. 
 Despite a sagging real estate market across the country (including in Las Vegas itself), real estate agents say second-home owners are still attracted to this area in the shadow of the fire-red Spring Mountains and the 196,000-acre playground known as Red Rock National Conservation Area. 
 While nobody keeps specific figures on secondary residences in the Summerlin area, Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis, a real estate economics consulting firm in Las Vegas, said that over the last five years Summerlin had become one of southern Nevada's top destinations for vacation homes. 
 ''Summerlin offers many different things to many different people,'' he said, noting that home prices range start in the high $200,000s and go up to more than $10 million. 
 Real estate growth in this part of the West certainly is nothing new; according to data from Home Builders Research, a Las Vegas research firm, there have been nearly 257,000 new housing units since 1998 in Clark County, a 55 percent increase overall. 
 On the Las Vegas Strip, many of these properties have been planned expressly with the second-home buyer in mind -- urban retreats for people tired of frittering $300 a night for hotel rooms. In the Summerlin area, some of which is in Clark County and the rest in Las Vegas, the vibe is much more residential, and development is accelerating. 
 First there's Summerlin itself, where crews recently broke ground on a 107-acre urban core named Summerlin Centre, which eventually will house department stores, offices and restaurants. Adjacent to One Queensridge Place, construction also is moving forward on the Village at Queensridge, a 700,000-square-foot mixed-use facility with offices, restaurants and more. Both spaces are scheduled to open next year. 
 Other projects in the Summerlin area are already complete. The Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa, the flagship property of Station Casinos, opened in 2006, and now includes a 16-screen movie theater and 72-lane bowling alley. 
 Elsewhere, Boca Park Fashion Village, a 97-acre shopping mall, opened a few years ago and now contains such high-end boutiques as Talulah G, Pink and Von Dutch. 
 Top-notch dining options have sprouted, too, including a number of chic wine bars with tapas-style menus and Marche Bacchus, an upscale Mediterranean bistro with a menu that attracts Damien Dulas (of Guy Savoy) and other top chefs from the Strip on their days off. 
 Summerlin has endless options for outdoor recreation; the area is home to more than 100 public parks, nearly 150 miles of manicured trails and nine golf courses, including the Tournament Players Club at Summerlin, which was designed by the golf greats Fuzzy Zoeller, Bobby Weed and Raymond Floyd. 
 Add these to the hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing and horseback riding available in Red Rock National Conservation Area, and even the most committed coach potatoes can't stay slothful for long. 
 For Howard Cohen, a local second-home owner who spends half of the year in Aspen, Colo., all of this was irresistible. ''We bought here because of all the things to do,'' said Mr. Cohen, who paid $1.5 million for his 3,400-square-foot, single-story home in Summerlin. ''The area is new, exciting, convenient and has all the comforts of home.'' 
 Mr. Cohen added that there are financial benefits to buying a home in southern Nevada: the state has some of the lowest property taxes in the country at less than 1 percent of assessed value, and (for those second-home owners who end up staying for more than six months a year) is one of seven states that do not levy personal income tax. 
 THE area surrounding Summerlin wasn't always such a hot spot; as recently as 25 years ago, it was nothing but sand. In the 1950s, Howard Hughes purchased 25,000 acres for 25 cents per acre. He named the parcel after his grandmother, Jean Amelia Summerlin, and sat on it for decades. In the late 1980s, as Vegas established itself as one of the 30 largest cities in the United States and the Howard Hughes Corporation started building, people arrived in droves. 
 Today, this land comprises a 22,500-acre master-planned community with a combined full- and part-time population of nearly 100,000. Tom Warden, vice president of community and government relations for the Howard Hughes Corporation, said an additional 120,000 residents are expected in the next 10 to 20 years. 
 Many residents live in tract-house neighborhoods with names like the Mesa, the Willows and the Trails. Most of these neighborhoods have European roundabouts, walking paths and easy access to a new I-215 freeway, dubbed the Bruce Woodbury Beltway after a politician on the Clark County Commission, which governs unincorporated portions of Clark County. 
 A handful of neighborhoods, including Red Rock Country Club, Eagle Rock, the Ridges and Aventura, are gated -- a feature that has appealed to second-home owners concerned about securing their investments between visits. 
 ''For these people, knowing that their homes will be safe and looked after if they don't get back to Summerlin for a month or two offers great peace of mind,'' said JoAnne Federico, an agent with Prudential Americana Group in Las Vegas. 
 Still, life in a master-planned community can have its drawbacks. 
 After adding up fees for the community's master plan fund and the individual neighborhood homeowners' association, most buyers must shell out about an additional $1,000 a year. What's more, a number of local homeowners' associations have adopted strict regulations, such as limitations on when cars can park on certain streets, requirements that homeowners put portable basketball hoops away at night and restrictions on the colors that homes can be painted. 
 Michael Chorna, who has owned a home in the Sun City neighborhood since 1998, said the codes present challenges for those who frequently come and go. 
 ''It's not like you can just buy a second home in Summerlin and do whatever you want,'' said Mr. Chorna, who also owns homes in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Century City, Calif. ''For someone who is new to the rules and regulations of a master-planned community homeowners' association, it can be tough to keep up.'' 
 Perhaps the biggest concern for all homeowners in the high desert is water. Lake Mead, the area's main water source, has dropped to 48 percent of capacity, and drought conditions have forced the Las Vegas Valley Water District to prohibit use of sprinklers between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. from May through September. Violations during drought alerts result in water-waste fees starting at $40 a pop, but the water district also doles out credits to homeowners who rip out grass and plant desert landscaping. 
 ''Dealing with the ongoing water shortage is just part of life here,'' said Jason Ekus, an agent with ReMax Central in Summerlin and president of the homeowners'association for the Casa Rosa neighborhood. 
 With so many housing options, perhaps the biggest challenge for prospective second-home buyers in the Summerlin area is figuring out where to buy. Mr. Warden, the vice president of community and government relations for the Howard Hughes Corporation, said new homes in the master-planned community are still sprouting almost daily. 
 On the outskirts, with projects like One Queensridge Place and the brand-new C2 Lofts, alternative living options are adding up as well. 
 For all of these reasons, Tricia Reilly Johnson and her husband, Matthew, are getting acquainted with the Summerlin second-home market slowly. 
 Mr. Johnson is the owner of the Sushi Samba restaurant chain, and the couple came to the Vegas area from New York City in late January to open one of his restaurants at the Palazzo, a new hotel on the Strip. Knowing they'll spend the better part of the next two years here, the Johnsons opted to lease a second house, instead of buying one, until they find the perfect spot. 
 ''We've identified certain neighborhoods as ones we like, but at this point, we're just waiting to see what's available and what's coming onto the market next,'' said Ms. Johnson. ''Things are growing so quickly here that it's possible the home we want hasn't even been built yet.''

PERSON: C. Steven Duncker 

HEADLINE: Letting His Racing Colors Show

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
CONSIDERING that C. Steven Duncker is a master-of-the-universe type who is arguably addicted to action -- be it at the track, on the trading floor, or across a poker table like the 2004 Main Event of the World Series of Poker -- a monumental stillness emanates from his Upper East Side apartment. There is no sound of pounding hooves, though he has an oft-enjoyed home library of audio replays of his racehorses' finer finishes. 
 Mr. Duncker is the unpaid chairman of the New York Racing Association, which last month struck a hard-nosed deal with the state -- at one juncture, Mr. Duncker threatened to shut down the tracks -- to retain control of New York's debt-and-scandal-scarred thoroughbred horse-racing franchise. 
 There is no sound of megadollar derivatives transactions being finessed by conference call. Mr. Duncker retired young -- at 43 in 2001 -- from Goldman Sachs & Company, which he joined straight out of Northwestern University in 1982. He made partner at 38 and was co-head of its Global Credit Derivatives department, managing a risk position of derivatives with exposure in excess of $20 billion. 
 He left high finance for greener pastures (more time to breed racehorses) and a different challenge (reconfiguring and destigmatizing the foundering association) alongside another racing enthusiast, Peter Karches, a former Morgan Stanley executive, who died in 2006. 
 No, this afternoon Mr. Duncker, 49, is home alone -- his wife, Melinda, and their 9-month-old son, Teddy, are evading winter at the Duncker domicile in Palm Beach -- with his collection of jockey statuary, the first of which greets visitors as they step off the elevator. Waist-high, it guards the hallway in shocking pink-and-black silks, Mr. Duncker's racing colors (he has poor vision, and pink stands out in an equine scrum), and resembles the retired jockey Pat Day, his favorite. It looks quite at home.
 So does the rail-thin Mr. Duncker, despite his elegant business attire: dress shirt, nifty cuff links, and a pale green tie that echoes the shadow stripe of the living room sofa. 
 He pronounces himself ''quite proud'' that the association was able to convince Gov. Eliot Spitzer, whose damning report on it five years ago as attorney general led to its indictment on charges of money laundering and tax evasion, and other state officials that it is the best candidate to run racing for the next 25 years. The proposed deal, yet to be finalized, gives the association $105 million in state money to shore up its infrastructure; in return, the association withdrew its ownership claim for the land beneath the state's three thoroughbred tracks, at Saratoga Springs, Belmont and Aqueduct. 
 Mr. Duncker estimates the worth of the property at $1.5 billion. ''So you can't call the $105 million a bailout. If you're the state, it looks like a pretty good deal for you. Let's just say that if I was at Goldman Sachs and made that trade, they wouldn't like it. But the bottom line is, if N.Y.R.A. hadn't cleaned up its act, none of this would ever have happened,'' he says.
 Mr. Duncker, who became the association's sole chairman at the close of 2005, intends to serve for four more years. He is drinking coffee from a ceramic Hadley mug with this insignia: 120th Running of the Kentucky Derby. He has never owned a Derby contender, but one can always hope. ''There's this saying among racehorse owners that nobody ever committed suicide that had a couple of 2-year-olds in training.''
 Mr. Duncker has six horses, none superstars, on the track and another six broodmares churning out future winners in Kentucky. He figures he has bred 100 horses and sold five prospects at a significant profit. A photograph of the best of the lot, Lucifer's Stone, hangs among many others on the walls of his home office.
 ''I bred him, but he won for somebody else; it's a bad economic event to own a horse,'' he adds. ''Horse racing is a very inefficient form of gambling.'' 
 Not that that stopped him from participating in it as a handicapper (he taught a course in it while at Duke University when he was an undergraduate there), owner, and later as an association trustee (1999). Mr. Duncker was in high school in St. Louis when he and a couple of buddies purchased their first horse for $3,500. The seller was Mr. Duncker's father, an investment manager. The mare, a dud for the father at Kentucky tracks, was a star for the son on the track in East St. Louis. 
 The best horse he ever owned? Bates Motel, an underachiever Mr. Duncker won a piece of during a backgammon game as an economics undergraduate at Duke. The horse turned out to be very successful, and Mr. Duncker and his co-owners pocketed profits of several hundred thousand dollars when they sold him. Talk about dumb luck.
 ''But I think I know less about the sport of horse racing this year than I ever have because I've been up to my eyeballs in the politics and business aspect of it and not the fun part of it,'' he says. 
 The deal to retain the nonprofit association, which has run the three tracks since 1955, had been a rougher sell than he and Mr. Karches anticipated, he said. He remains irked that a deal he brokered with MGM in 2002 to run the video lottery terminal franchise expired from governmental gridlock. 
 ''This whole thing has been a bare knuckles fight,'' he says. ''There is no agenda here other than giving New York a healthy racing industry.'' Which mandates, in his opinion, a revamp of the Off-Track Betting Corporation and its ''crazily redundant'' six-region system. ''It's a broken business model; even Jack Welch couldn't run OTB in New York and make it turn a profit.''

HEADLINE: World Group Tells Banks to Beware Deals With Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a move that strengthens the American-backed effort to isolate Iran, a leading international organization responsible for combating financial crimes called Thursday for all countries to be wary of Iran's banking system because of concerns over money-laundering and aid to terrorists.
 The action, by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, was welcomed by the Bush administration as likely to help its drive to punish Iran economically for its nuclear activities and its support of Hezbollah and other militant groups. 
 A separate American effort to get the United Nations Security Council to impose mild sanctions on Iran is proceeding slowly, and European countries are planning to offer new incentives to Iran if it agrees to halt its uranium-enrichment program.
 In a separate development on Thursday, the Bush administration imposed penalties on four Syrians accused of easing the flow of money, weapons and people involved in terrorism through Syria into Iraq. The action had the effect of freezing their assets in the United States, a largely symbolic step because the Syrians are not thought to have such assets.
 On Iran, the language of the Financial Action Task Force's statement is indirect, in that it simply calls on banks and other institutions to take into account the risk of the Tehran government's ''deficiencies'' in controlling money-laundering and financial support for terrorists, and to exercise ''due diligence'' in dealing with Iran.
 But experts at the Treasury Department said the statement would have a powerful effect at a time when many American and European banks have already started to pull back from transactions with Iran in response to pressure from the United States.
 In a statement, the Treasury Department said the action ''sends a clear message to governments and financial institutions worldwide that the threat Iran poses to the international financial system continues unabated.''
 The Bush administration has been trying to persuade banks in the Persian Gulf and Asia to follow the lead of European and American banks in withdrawing from Iran. The number of foreign branches operating in Iran has dropped to 20 in two years, from 46, according to American and Western diplomats.
 The American hope is that the financial task force will strengthen the case for isolating Iran, especially because Russia and China are members and both countries have resisted sanctions on Iran at the United Nations.
 Sir James Sassoon, president of the task force, said its action, adopted at a board meeting in Paris, ''increases the pressure on Iran'' to ''urgently'' address its shortcomings in controlling money-laundering and terrorist financing. 
 ''In view of the continued risks emanating from Iran, the F.A.T.F. is calling on all countries around the world to advise their financial institutions to pay special attention to financial dealings with Iran,'' he said. 
 The financial task force has 32 member countries, as well as the European Union and the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. Iran is not a member; few Middle East countries are. 
 Administration officials said it was significant that China and Russia, which recently joined the financial task force, supported the move on Thursday, in part because the task force is a technical body affiliated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 A task force official in Paris, speaking anonymously under ground rules used for anyone explaining the group's public statements, said Iran had made a major effort to head off Thursday's action. The move was threatened in a statement last October, which warned Iran to change its laws or face difficulties.
 Last week the Bush administration announced that a senior Treasury Department official, Daniel L. Glaser, had attended a meeting of the group in Paris along with representatives from Iran, who were trying to persuade the task force that Iran would correct the shortcomings in its banking system.
 Since then, the task force official said, Iran changed some of its laws but made only minimal progress in reducing the chances of money-laundering and no progress in setting up restrictions on aiding terrorists.

HEADLINE: A New Miracle on Ice: Russia Is Luring Back N.H.L. Stars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: YAROSLAVL, Russia 

 BODY:
When Alexei Yashin moved to this worn-out, provincial city 4,500 miles and seemingly centuries away from his former home in New York, he left behind his plush Western lifestyle, multimillion-dollar salary and the home base of his supermodel wife. He also ended a career in the National Hockey League, turning his back on a dream shared by nearly every young Russian with a stick and skates for the last 15 years. 
 Yet, when Yashin and several other N.H.L. returnees took the ice for the local Lokomotiv squad recently before a capacity crowd of 10,000 ebullient hockey fanatics wrapped like candy canes in the team's red and white, those old aspirations seemed not to matter. 
 ''Less and less players are going to the N.H.L. and more and more are coming back here,'' Yashin said in an interview in English after the game. ''From my perspective, there is a competition between Russian clubs and the N.H.L. for the best product on the ice.'' 
 Yashin's N.H.L. experience had soured when the Islanders bought out the final four years of his contract in June, handing him $17.63 million. Whether motivated by enmity toward the N.H.L. because of his stormy final years there, or a sense of Russian pride, Yashin joined a growing movement among Russian players, government officials and business leaders. They are seeking to reclaim a sport viewed here as a national tradition that has been crippled, many say, by the pilfering of hockey stars over the last decade and a half by the N.H.L. 
 Now, say these hockey patriots, it is Russia's turn to have the best. The country's professional league expects to catch and surpass the N.H.L. as the world's premier hockey league. To do that, it must keep its best homegrown talent at home -- or lure it back home.
 Yashin, 34, left Russia for North America shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a hockey superpower for decades that was bleeding talent profusely. The sport had all but disintegrated there by the early 1990s as the empire that spawned one of the most successful sporting industries in the world melted into decrepitude. Most hockey players of international merit left Russian clubs, which began to fester in an atmosphere of poverty, gangsterism and occasional violence. 
 Today's stratospheric energy prices have helped return a semblance of Russia's former pre-eminence, and large state companies like the natural gas behemoth Gazprom, the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport and others with hockey fans and former players on their boards have started pumping money into Russia's professional hockey league, the Superliga. They are luring back players from leagues abroad, while persuading others to remain with the teams that groomed them from childhood. 
 Lokomotiv now boasts increasing profits from ticket sales and advertising and has financial backing from the Russian Railroads, a large, wealthy state company. The team's modern arena, equipped with luxury boxes, a rinkside restaurant and its own microbrewery, offsets Yaroslavl's centuries-old monastery and crumbling Soviet apartment blocs. 
 ''Sooner or later, the National Hockey League is going to have to reckon with our league, because, despite everything, we are getting stronger, not only in terms of players but in terms of our legal and financial protections,'' Yuri Yakovlev, Lokomotiv's president, said in an interview in Russian. 
 ''We already have the ability to gather players from the N.H.L.,'' he said.
 Bill Daly, the N.H.L.'s deputy commissioner, acknowledged a strain in relations with Russia and expressed hope that ties would improve, but he denied that Russia's burgeoning assertiveness in the sport could somehow threaten his league. 
 ''The best players in the world are going to want to continue playing in the greatest hockey league in the world,'' he said in an e-mail message. 
 Mr. Yakovlev, who has been the president of the Yaroslavl club since 1989 and was a player here before that, acknowledges that Russian hockey still faces many obstacles. Russian national teams have not won a major international title since 1993, trainers are in short supply and popular support is still lagging in a country where soccer, as in much of the rest of the world, is king. 
 The Superliga is still unable to retain stars like Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin, who are thriving in the N.H.L. And Yashin's salary with Lokomotiv is a small fraction of the 10-year deal worth $87.5 million he signed with the Islanders in 2001. But other Superliga players can now earn wages and benefits approaching those of many in the N.H.L., making Russian teams more attractive to Russian and foreign players. Former N.H.L. stars like Darius Kasparaitis and lesser-known N.H.L. veterans like Oleg Tverdovsky and Oleg Petrov have also settled in the league.
 Lokomotiv's roster includes five former N.H.L. players and four from the American Hockey League. There are also four foreign players, and the team's coach, Kari Heikkila, is from Finland. 
 The trend has injected a little extravagance into even the most desolately gritty Russian towns, as wealthy players along with the occasional famous wife try to build lives in obscure regions unaccustomed to celebrity. 
 ''That three-hour ride up to Yaroslavl after a 15-hour flight after shooting all day long -- not fun,'' said Carol Alt, Yashin's wife and a New York-based model, looking a shade too glamorous even for Yaroslavl's one upscale hotel, where she was dining with her husband. 
 Although bothered by the city's remoteness and the long distance from her husband and more than a little indignant over the limits of her celebrity in this Volga River city of about 650,000, Alt along with Yashin remains generally optimistic about hockey's future here.
 At the recent game, Yashin scored the final goal of a 4-1 Lokomotiv victory over Moscow's TsSKA, as a raucous crowd, under the influence of stadium-brewed beer, heckled and hollered at every cheap shot, glove save and goal. 
 ''Games are becoming more and more enjoyable,'' Yashin said after the game, adding that fans had become more numerous and impassioned as the country's economic troubles had dimmed and money had appeared for little luxuries like a Friday night hockey game. 
 ''It's great,'' he said. ''It shows that the country is going in the right direction.''
 For those vested in its promotion, Russian hockey is not just a commercial endeavor, but also a point of national pride, tinged with competitive animosity for the bigger, more profitable N.H.L. 
 ''Hockey is a Russian sport -- though Canadians think it's theirs,'' Sergei Naryshkin, a deputy prime minister and a major hockey promoter, said at a lavish hockey benefit party in Moscow recently. ''It is not just a sport, but a part of our great history, our national consciousness, and a part of our pride.'' 
 Vyacheslav Fetisov, the head of Russia's national sports agency, makes no secret of his bitterness regarding the N.H.L.'s penchant for Russian players, although his animosity belies his own history as Russia's first hockey immigrant to the league and his successful career there that included two Stanley Cup victories with the Detroit Red Wings. 
 ''We need to create an understanding of a fair game,'' he said. ''We must protect our clubs from the N.H.L.'' 
 Under his watch, Russia refused to sign a transfer agreement with the N.H.L., preventing the league from acquiring players under contract with Russian clubs, and putting an end to an N.H.L. practice of scooping up young Russian players who often ended up languishing in the North American minor leagues. 
 Fetisov has also signed off on plans to create a Russian-controlled, pan-Eurasian league, a venture backed by the Russian Hockey Federation, the government and Gazprom that officials hope will one day become the N.H.L. of the East. 
 Daly, from the N.H.L., said the new league would not ''result in any diminution in the quality of play in the National Hockey League,'' although he said his league was interested to watch its development.
 Fetisov, emboldened by the selection of Russia to play host to the 2014 Winter Olympics and by Russian successes in other sports, particularly in basketball and tennis, is unequivocal about his vision for Russia's hockey future. 
 ''We will be No. 1 regardless,'' he said. ''We have everything for this: talented people, government support, money, desire and great traditions.''

ART
 'YEAR OF THE RAT' Kim Jones's war-torn, fluently hybrid art is more germane than ever, as proved by his latest exhibition at Pierogi. His primary theme, directly or indirectly, is war and its toxic effects, a subject inspired partly by his experiences as a marine in Vietnam. 
 Mr. Jones erupted on the Los Angeles performance-art scene in the mid-1970s in the persona of Mudman, a shaman-warrior-penitent covered in mud and harnessed with a bristling mass of sticks. In the first room several stick apparatuses hang far apart on the walls, part forbidding traps, part power figures. Wavy-lined wall drawings flow between them like currents of attract-repel energy. Their dates reflect Mr. Jones's tendency to mend, resurface and refresh continually. The much-painted ''Rat Dog'' (1973-1980-1986-1998-2008), above, is at once a headdress, an effigy and a figure in a prison stock; it belongs to a rodent art tradition stretching from Disney's Mickey Mouse to Art Spiegelman's Maus. 
 In the second gallery drawings build on documentary photographs of the Mudman performances. (Two feature ''Rat Dog.'') Heightening their sense of alienation and oppressiveness with ink and acrylic, they recast Mudman as an underground comic character while showcasing Mr. Jones's draftsmanship. 
 ''Rat House,'' dated 1973-2008, is a large white dollhouse -- light-handed yet exact -- originally built for Mr. Jones's mother. Now it teems with dozens of black plastic rats -- constants in his art that recall his Vietnam experience. While politically apt, this piece will doubtlessly improve as the artist revisits it. 
 Like war or memories of war, Mr. Jones's artworks may never be entirely finished. He will continue to adjust and refurbish them, exorcising demons that, much as we might think otherwise, are not only his. (Through March 10, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-599-2144, pierogi2000.com.) ROBERTA SMITH

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'GILDED LIONS AND JEWELED HORSES: THE SYNAGOGUE TO THE CAROUSEL,' through March 23. Skills and motifs used in sacred art resurface in a surprisingly secular place: the carousel. In this exhibition, models of elaborate wooden synagogues and photographs of Jewish cemeteries with intricately carved gravestones in Eastern Europe are alongside paper cuts, which look like giant, precision-cut snowflakes mounted on colored paper. The lineage from synagogue to carousel is made explicit in a display that juxtaposes carved Torah arks with carousel horses fashioned in the baroque Coney Island Style. The show reveals a vibrant Jewish visual culture, where Judaism is often seen as text-oriented. It is also a great immigrant story in which skills learned in the shtetls of Europe made their way to the New World and, for a brief moment, flourished. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) 
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'PARMIGIANINO'S ''ANTEA'': A BEAUTIFUL ARTIFICE,' through April 27. Exhibitions don't come any smaller than ''Parmigianino's 'Antea': A Beautiful Artifice'' at the Frick Collection. A painting, a wall text, a nugget of a scholarly catalog, and that's it. It's enough. Certain pictures, like certain performers, don't need troops of extras to make a large effect. Solo suits them. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Holland Cotter)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows pin-cushion snarling tigers (stuffed), carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 HISPANIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA: 'FRANCIS AL$(YUML$)S FABIOLA,' through April 6. The first of three collaborations between the Dia Foundation for the Arts and the Hispanic Society of America is an astutely site-specific display of 300 Fabiola paintings collected by the artist Francis Als, who is based in Mexico. Made by devout amateurs worldwide, all are based on a lost original from 1885 and show Fabiola, the fourth-century saint, in profile, wearing a vibrant red veil. Mr. Als's 300 examples pepper dark-wood-paneled galleries with smoldering color and are consistent with the collaborative, subversive and open-ended nature of his art. North Building Galleries on Audubon Terrace, Broadway between 155th and 156th Streets, Washington Heights, (212) 926-2234, diaart.org. (Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ARCHIVE FEVER: USES OF THE DOCUMENT IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' through May 4. You need no grounding in art theory to understand the messages generated by this powerful brain-pincher of a theme show. The archive of the title is less a thing or a place than a concept, an immersive environment: the sum total of documentary images, mostly photographic, circulating in the culture, on the street, in the media and finally in what is called the collective memory. From an Andy Warhol silk-screen of a black civil rights demonstrator attacked by police dogs, to a gallery wallpapered with the front pages of international newspapers reporting on the destruction of the twin towers, truth, untruth and their consequences make up the riveting story here. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045, icp.org. (Cotter)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'THE COLLECTIONS OF BARBARA BLOOM,' through May 4. Instead of the walk-in installations for which Ms. Bloom is best known, this survey displays pieces from different phases of her career as discrete works of sculpture, assemblage, collage, photography and design. This is confusing, but attentive viewers will profit from studying her ideologically subversive, dryly humorous and formally inventive play with many different forms of representation, from faux-antique plaster self-portrait busts to a found-object sculpture in the form of a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (See above.) (Ken Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'FROM THE NEW YORKER TO SHREK: THE ART OF WILLIAM STEIG,' through March 16. Children may know William Steig as the creator of Shrek, but their grandparents can trace that ornery green ogre's roots through a body of children's books, New Yorker cartoons and drawings dating to the Depression. Neither group will be disappointed by this exhibition. With reading and activity nooks alongside drawings of contentious and alienated grown-ups, the show is a child pleaser that does not stint on the adult biography of the thrice-divorced, periodically depressed Steig. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEPTH OF FIELD,' through March 23. The Met's recently acquired large-scale photographs finally have some room to breathe in the new Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography, a high-ceilinged, gray-carpeted sanctuary on the second floor. Curators at MoMA need not worry: The inaugural installation (a sampler rather than a thematic slice) is dominated by white, mostly male Europeans and heavily weighted with references to history and landscape painting. Despite its limitations, ''Depth of Field'' is not a bad debut. We can also expect more from future installations, which will explore themes like ''photography about photography.'' (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'JASPER JOHNS: GRAY,' through May 4. Since his paintings of targets and American flags took the art world by storm 50 years ago, Jasper Johns has been a cultural fact and the subject of numerous museum exhibitions. But this is one of the best. Moody, opulent and eloquent, it singles out his many paintings in gray, the color at the core of his sensibility, along with numerous sculptures, drawings and prints that are inherently gray. Together they chronicle his maturation from brilliant, methodical young artist to a deeper, more lyrical, less predictable one. And frankly, it is almost a relief to follow the incessant unfolding of this singular career without the brightly colored, better-known masterpieces. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS,' through May 11. If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 THE MET: 'SILVERSMITHS TO THE NATION: THOMAS FLETCHER AND SIDNEY GARDINER, 1808-1842,' through May 4. Blending neo-Classical kitsch, patriotic flair and superb craftsmanship, the Philadelphia silversmiths Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner pumped up the genre of the commemorative cup to works of awesome, small-scale monumentalism. Standing almost 30 inches from its hairy paw feet to the furrowed brow of a bellicose eagle mounted on the lid of its soup tureen bowl, an urn made in 1813 to honor Capt. Isaac Hull was at the time the heaviest, tallest and most complex work in silver ever produced in North America. It is still pretty impressive. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'ART OF TIME: EUROPEAN CLOCKS AND WATCHES FROM THE COLLECTION,' through April 27. This enthralling, compact show presents about 90 European timepieces, ranging from pocket watches to grandfather clocks and dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries. There are traditional mantel clocks in wooden, peaked-roofed houses and extravagantly fanciful forms like one from 1579 that has a revolving globe engraved with star charts and figures of the zodiac held up on the wingtips of a flying horse, all beautifully fashioned in silver. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: IRVING PENN PORTRAITS OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS,' through April 13. Last spring, in its first foray into modern photography, the Morgan Library & Museum acquired 67 of Irving Penn's portraits of artists, writers and musicians. (Thirty-five were donated by Mr. Penn.) The entire group is temporarily on view in an exhibition that complements the library's collection of 20th-century drawings, manuscripts, books and musical scores. Organized by a guest curator, Peter Barberie, ''Close Encounters'' encompasses work from the 1940s, when Mr. Penn first started to work for Vogue, through portraits published in The New Yorker in 2006. Mr. Penn's subjects, including Marcel Duchamp, Arthur Miller and Truman Capote, emerged from their portrait sessions with their carefully shaped personas profoundly shaken. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'MICHELANGELO, VASARI AND THEIR CONTEMPORARIES: DRAWINGS FROM THE UFFIZI,' through April 20. Michelangelo, with a couple of spectacular drawings, is the marquee name here, but many of the 16th-century Florentine artists he influenced fill the space, beginning with the extreme polymath Giorgio Vasari. A handful of drawings by Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino will knock your socks off, as will work by a few less familiar artists, all working to make the Medici rulers of Florence look good. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: 'PRICKED: EXTREME EMBROIDERY,' through April 27. The second in a series of exhibitions (following last year's ''Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting''), ''Pricked'' makes another case for needlecraft without the ''craft.'' The show places widely known contemporary artists like Laura Owens and Ghada Amer alongside Elaine Reichek and others who have been working with thread and textiles since the '70s. In the best works historical and technical concerns overlap, just as they do in traditional embroidered samplers. 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JAN DE COCK: DENKMAL 11, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, 11 WEST 53 STREET, NEW YORK, 2008,' through April 14. The word denkmal translates from German as monument or memorial. In Dutch it is a mold for thought. Both definitions fit the work of Jan De Cock, a 31-year-old Belgian artist who appropriates and arranges photographs in what might be viewed as an open-ended yet ultimately conservative encyclopedia. Overflowing with references to modern art, experimental film, photography and architecture, the project pulls most of the museum into its orbit. It incorporates elements of De Stijl, Russian Constructivism and Kurt Schwitters's collage/studio Merzbau, among other things. It is also the starting point of a yearlong project called ''American Odyssey,'' for which Mr. De Cock will travel to various and document cultural landmarks around the country. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LUCIAN FREUD: THE PAINTER'S ETCHINGS,' through March 10. It would be simplifying things to say that the density, plasticity and color of oil paint provide Mr. Freud, if not the people he paints, with a place to hide. But by combining a life's worth of prints with selected canvases, this riveting exhibition suggests that his prints may be even starker. They resemble transparent scaffoldings partly draped with often hallucinatory nets of lines, gouges, hatching and cross-hatching that somehow also depict varying degrees of flesh, features and expression. The show gives a fascinating if partial account of how his etched line, like his painting surface, was liberated. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'JOHN SLOAN'S NEW YORK,' through Mar. 23 Etchings by the Ashcan School artist Sloan suggest he was a better draftsman than painter. Few of the 34 prints on view are much bigger than postcards, but teeming as they are with affectionate, finely detailed observations of old, young, poor and rich people on sidewalks, in parks and in subways, they have a Dickensian amplitude. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PICTURING NEW YORK: THE ART OF YVONNE JACQUETTE AND RUDY BURCKHARDT,' through April 13 (Burckhardt); through May 4 (Jacquette). This dual exhibition displays photographs by Burckhardt, who died at 85 in 1999, alongside paintings by Ms. Jacquette, his widow and 20 years his junior, who is still working. Burckhardt's black-and-white images approach the city from several angles, descending from rooftops to street level and even into the subways. Ms. Jacquette's works peer down into the canyons between high-rises. This pair of shows does not establish either artist as an unjustly overlooked talent, but it reveals the competing visions of the city behind a romantic and creative partnership. (See above.)

 NEUE GALERIE: 'GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I.'' Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt's most famous painted mural, the ''Beethoven Frieze''; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist's signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'UNMONUMENTAL: THE OBJECT IN THE 21ST CENTURY,' through March 30. The New Museum has eked as much exhibition space as possible out of its new, elegantly bare-bones building and is devoting almost all of it to a raucous, polemical first show. The premise, as reflected in the work of 30 artists (among them, Rachel Harrison, Isa Genzken, Eliot Hundley, Carol Bove, Jock Bock and Sarah Lucas), is that assemblage sculpture is the most viable art form of the moment. Lo-tech, cheap, portable and rough around the edges if not actually falling apart, it reflects our fractured times and also resists easy absorption by the art market. While visually messy, way too hip and a tad monotonous, the show is a gauntlet thrown down to other New York museums. It says: Get your nerve on. Take a stand. Do something that inspires true argument, not just endless kvetching. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through May 25. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION,' through May 12. This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'NEW YORK STATES OF MIND,' through March 23. Organized for the House of World Cultures in Berlin, where it appeared last fall, this show is too narrow, uneven and ideologically tendentious to represent truly the spirit of New York art. Nevertheless, it is an interesting, provocative exhibition, featuring high-profile artists like David Hammons, Terence Koh, Josephine Meckseper, Patty Chang and about two dozen others. If you want to have a lively argument about the real nature of New York art, it's a good place to start. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 SCANDINAVIA HOUSE: 'ARS FENNICA: FINNISH ART NOW,' through April 12. Finland has its own version of the Turner Prize in Britain: the $50,000 Ars Fennica Prize. This sleepy show presents works by 2007's four finalists. It includes gimmicky sculptures by Markus Kahre; fairy-tale-like images painted and drawn by Elina Merenmies; Anna Tuori's brushy, mock-kitsch paintings of vaguely Asian landscapes; and, by Elina Brotherus, large, bland landscape photographs and a relaxing video triptych of people skinny dipping in peaceful, outdoor waters. 58 Park Avenue between 37th and 38th streets, (212) 879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KORI NEWKIRK: 1997-2007,' through March 9. The Bronx-born artist Kori Newkirk, now based in Los Angeles, first came to New York's attention in the 2001 group show ''Freestyle'' at the Studio Museum. He is now having a solo at the museum, organized by its director and chief curator, Thelma Golden. This 10-year survey devotes plenty of room -- nearly the entire double-height main gallery -- to the shimmering pony-bead curtains for which Mr. Newkirk is best known. It also finds him pursuing more oblique forms of expression, particularly in his recent forays into video. It all adds up to a kind of maxed-out minimalism or, as Mr. Newkirk has described it, a ''ghetto-fabulous conceptualism.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: Uptown
 FRANZ KLINE Full advantage should be taken of any chance to tangle within the beams and rigging of Franz Kline's black-and-white abstractions, and to ponder their relationship to contemporary sculptors like David Smith and Mark Di Suvero. The works here span from 1951 to 1960 and include two small, sprightly ink studies. The standouts are the complexly balanced, calligraphic ''Ninth Street'' (1951), made just before Kline's beams straightened out, and ''Heaume'' of 1958, a skewed, four-square hulk that evokes the artist's affection for all things railroad, including locomotives and ties. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com, through March 15. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 NAYLAND BLAKE: 'WHAT THE WHISKEY SAID, WHAT THE SUN IS SAYING' This solo show of recent work includes a set of terse, diaristic, cartoonlike drawings prompted by the death of a partner, as well as several small sculptures assembled from found materials, including wall pieces made from pins, wires, beads and little swags of filigreed chains that suggest antique jewelry, sexy punk accessories, carnival trinkets and rosaries. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com, through March 8. (Cotter)
 SARAH PICKERING: 'FIRE SCENE' As an artist in residence at the Fire Service College in Moreton-in-Marsh, England, from 2006 to 2007, Sarah Pickering took pictures of ''burn units,'' set-dressed interiors set on fire to educate forensic teams and crime scene investigators. The blazes in these photographs provoke an immediate adrenaline response. More interesting, however, is the carefully orchestrated clutter of the imaginary households. In ''Electric Radiator,'' a space heater brushes up against a chintz sofa; in ''Makeshift Cooking,'' a similar device is being used to warm a teakettle. It all amounts to a broken-windows theory of disorder as the root of disaster. Daniel Cooney Fine Art, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 255-8158, danielcooneyfineart.com, through March 15. (Rosenberg)
 SETH PRICE A resourceful and influential young conceptualist presents clunky, flat wall sculptures apparently illustrating a thesis about the obsolescence of the human and the natural. They revolve around photographs of hands downloaded from the Internet. The images have been blown up and abstracted into empty silhouettes surrounded by areas of printed color or by laser-cut sheets of transparent plastic backed by exotic wood veneers. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com, through March 8. (Johnson)
 XU ZHEN For his New York solo debut, this young artist from Shanghai, who contributed to Performa 07, demonstrates that truth and fiction, if not entirely identical, can at least be comparably amusing. In videos and photographs he and his intrepid team remove the top of Mount Everest, invade Myanmar from China, and cast serious doubt on the United States's claim to have landed the first man on the moon, the point in each case being a sly commentary on competitive imperialism. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through March 8. (Cotter)

 'DIEBENKORN IN NEW MEXICO' In graduate school in Albuquerque at the beginning of the 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn put his own spin on the drawing-painting fusion of Willem de Kooning's black-and-white paintings, interjecting an elegant, waggish sense of line borrowed from George Herriman's Krazy Kat cartoons, along with brushy, glowing layers of color. He would later go on to make grander, more complex works, but in many ways his painting was never freer, less predictable or more full of the future than in New Mexico. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through April 5. (Smith)
 KLARA LIDEN This super-talented Swedish artist continues to explore the malleability of space in its social, material and architectural aspects. She has turned most of the gallery into a giant birdhouse for the neighborhood pigeons. Visitors are limited to a small, dark room where intimacy and even romance seem unavoidable and the proximity of the birds is palpable (soundwise). You may find yourself wondering about light conditions in actual birdhouses. Don't miss the artist's pristine yet world-weary poster-paintings. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, at Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, reenaspaulings.com, through March 9. (Smith)
 'UNDER PAIN OF DEATH' This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including ''The Last Supper,'' an Errol Morris-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrom, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org, through May 10. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART: 'NOTATIONS/WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: TAPESTRIES,' through April 6. This uneven show of not-so-lively collages, sculptures and prints, and 11 large and much livelier tapestries based on the collages, confirms that the work of this South African artist is best in translation, filtered through a second process. In this case it is the craft of expert weavers; the degree to which their increase in scale, texture, intricacy and color improves on the collages is more than striking. The subject here is displacement, refugeeism and survival, conveyed by the imposing silhouettes of ''Porters'' that either carry or oddly merge with objects while seeming to move across 19th-century maps of Europe and other continents. The style is a kind of send-up of Baroque art, but the images point metaphorically and painfully toward the future. Benjamin Franklin Parkway, at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 JAMES LEE BYARS: 'FIVE POINTS MAKE A MAN' With the usual devotional yet deadpan fastidiousness usual to this artist, this performance piece, executed by a graceful young actress (although it could also have been done by a man) turns the simple acts of sitting, walking and placing drops of water on the floor into a ritual that is at once medieval and Zen-like -- and either way makes 21st-century time briefly stand still. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH While his commercially successful vision was honed in the studio, this 19th-century American painter traveled extensively and made many sketches on location. This exhibition of 35 paintings, which includes a number of large-scale museum loans, is a lavish postcard book. Downstairs, large canvases show foreign landscapes, like the Magdalena River in Colombia and the Ecuadorean volcanoes of Pichincha and Cotopaxi. The smaller sketches in the upstairs hallway show a humbler, more local side of Church. They include the satisfyingly seasonal ''View From Olana in the Snow'' (1870-75) and the cloud study ''Sunset on July 26, 1870,'' an eyewitness account of divine radiance. Adelson Galleries, 19 East 82nd Street, (212) 439-680070, adelsongalleries.com; closes on Saturday. (Karen Rosenberg)
 RACKSTRAW DOWNES Working on location, Mr. Downes paints subjects that would seem mundane, drab or sadly desolate by calendar-art standards: street scenes in Brooklyn with subway bridges looming overhead and an abandoned racetrack in the Texas desert, for example. But he paints them so attentively and with such a lovingly sensuous touch that the images have a breathtaking lucidity. They project an infectious, spiritually gratifying feeling of being extraordinarily alive to the moment. Betty Cunningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-2772, bettycuninghamgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 LUIS GISPERT ''Smother,'' which has a script by Mr. Gispert and the artist Orly Genger and a soundtrack by the experimental duo Phoenicia, is the throbbing, flamingo-pink heart of Mr. Gispert's two-gallery show at Mary Boone and Zach Feuer. With its tropical palette and episodic magical realism, it can seem less like a film than like a tenuously linked series of Mr. Gispert's stills. Dialogue is sparse, and as melodramatic as a telenovela's. The camera lingers over the spectacular stucco-mansion setting, which Mr. Gispert has aptly described as ''narco-nouveau-riche.'' At Zach Feuer Gallery, a sculptural installation echoes the film's lurid scenery. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, lflgallery.com, through Feb. 16. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)
 KATI HECK In her energetic New York debut, this young German painter operates on all pistons, slightly to the right of the frenetic realist painter Ashley Bickerton. She leavens her exacting, sometimes grotesque realism, which evokes Neue Sachlichkeit, with regular doses of neo-Expressionist extravagances a la Martin Kippenberger and occasional bits of art-historical quotation (from van Gogh, for example). The results are entertaining, outlandish and ambitious, but as yet distinguished more by skill and aplomb than by genuine originality. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 729-4949, maryboonegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 LOREN MACIVER: 'THE POETRY OF OBJECTS' Of the dozen paintings in this luminous Loren MacIver survey, one titled ''The Poet'' depicts a single, bust-length female figure. Her slender shoulders are accentuated by a scoop-neck dress, as is her vaselike neck. Above that, though, flesh is exchanged for a cloud of flowers and stars. MacIver's art is like this: head in the clouds, feet on the ground; a pixilated edition of everyday. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, alexandregallery.com; closes on Friday. (Cotter)
 CHRIS MARTIN This painter, an underground favorite, works in the gap between the comical and the visionary, enlivening his colorful, sometimes boisterous works with plastic foam discs, collaged paper and casual construction. As much objects as paintings, they reflect the synthesis of multiple cultural sources and exude a formal ease and indifference to refinement that translate into something like real-life tolerance and wisdom. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ETERNAL ANCESTORS: THE ART OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN RELIQUARY' This beautiful show has a universal theme: life as a cosmic journey homeward, with parental spirits, embodied in charismatic materials and images, counseling and chiding us every step of the way. European, Asian and African reliquaries sit side by side in the first gallery; then some of the world's greatest Fang and Kota sculptures take over and sweep through to the end. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'FOCUS: ELLSWORTH KELLY' Few artists of the so-called Minimalist persuasion have made the principle of less is more seem as capacious as Mr. Kelly. His penchant for drawing inspiration from a complex interplay of lived experience, plane geometry and other art is confirmed by a large gallery devoted to more than two dozen paintings, reliefs and works on paper from the museum's collection (including several recent acquisitions). The combination of ''classic'' Kelly and new, less familiar arrivals is revelatory. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)
 LEON POLK SMITH: TORN PAPER DRAWINGS, 1956-1964 This little-known series of quasi collages was made by tearing sheets of soft paper finished in bright monochromes or black and exposing fuzzy white edges that function as drawn, sometimes calligraphic lines, spirals and arabesques. Japanese and Chinese ink-brush painting comes to mind, as do Henri Matisse and Jean Arp's well-known excursions into cut or torn paper. But mainly these works reveal a tender, playful side to Mr. Polk Smith, an early proponent of glossy, rigorous, hard-edge Minimalist painting. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, eighth floor, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 LARRY POONS: 'THROW, POUR, DRIP, SPILL & SPLASH' When they were made -- with paint thrown at or poured down vertical canvases -- 30 years ago, these paintings seemed to thumb their noses at the Minimalists and the Color Field painters alike. Today their heavy downpours and feathery splashes look implacable, extravagantly rich in color and surface, and slightly mad, like wilding Pollocks made with Monet in mind. Jacobson Howard, 33 East 68th Street, (212) 570-2362, jacobsonhoward.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 JUDIT REIGL Born in Budapest in 1923, Ms. Reigl fled Hungary in 1950 for Paris. There her fantastic figurative work caught the eye of Andre Breton. But Surrealism held little interest for her, and she moved on to do remarkable series of abstract paintings, changing her style to avoid settling into a routine. The examples in this small, beautiful survey run through the 1970s, and they document a career that fruitfully took alternative paths every step of the way. Janos Gat Gallery, 195 Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212) 677-3525, janosgatgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)

 KEELY GARFIELD At a recent rehearsal for her latest dance, ''Limerence,'' Keely Garfield recounted a conversation with her fellow choreographer Reggie Wilson about how unnerving it is to make and perform her emotionally intense works. ''Why don't you make a happy dance?'' Mr. Wilson asked, and then the good friends dissolved into giggles. 
 ''I still have really high expectations that I'll make a happy dance one day,'' Ms. Garfield says. ''Limerence,'' a duet for her and Omagbitse Omagbemi, is not that dance, though this dark, prayerful meditation on affairs of the heart is shot through with her subtly mordant wit. Both women are fluid, smart movers, and Ms. Garfield is capable of producing tautly structured dances. Yet what captivates here is the awkward, uncomfortable space these dancers inhabit as they alternately minister to and grapple with each other. Ms. Garfield, left, gives her ideas a lot of space, and much of the action takes place in the loaded gazes the two level at each other; thankfully, the West End Theater is small, so viewers can get a close look. 
 Another major aspect of the work is Jonathan Belcher's lighting, which Ms. Garfield describes as ''flashes of light in the mind, very psychological and technically rough.'' Ms. Garfield's technique is silky, but otherwise this could be an account of the quietly devastating, cryptic body of work she has been producing for the past few years, a line of inquiry begun with the political, sexually charged ''Disturbulance'' in 2005. These works can be hard to take; they're even harder to forget. (Thursday through March 8 at 8:30 p.m., March 9 at 5 p.m., West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, second floor, Manhattan, 212-337-9565, keelygarfield.org; $15.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO 
 NINA ANANIASHVILI AND THE STATE BALLET OF GEORGIA (Friday through Sunday) This newly revitalized classical ballet troupe, from the Georgian Republic and not Atlanta, will perform George Balanchine's ''Duo Concertant'' and ''Chaconne'' in the first of two programs, which also includes Alexei Ratmansky's new ''Bizet Variations'' and Yuri Possokhov's ''Sagalobeli,'' set to traditional Georgian music (Friday). In the second program, on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Ratmansky's ''Dreams About Japan'' replaces ''Chaconne.'' Ms. Ananiashvili, the company's director, and Sergei Filin of the Bolshoi Ballet will perform with the company. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $70. (Jennifer Dunning) 
 BLUM DANCE THEATER AND JENNIFER WRIGHT COOK (Thursday) Sometimes descriptions of dances seem like a weird minor art form of their own. Such is Danspace's account of Wendy Blum's ''String of Exquisite Distortions'': ''a nonlinear world of economy and rigorous mischief, where rhythms persist and scents linger.'' But wait, there's more. ''Repetition that undercuts expectation unfolds in an environment of disembodied limbs.'' What more is there to say? Ms. Blum shares a double bill with Jennifer Wright Cook, who has a work with a title of equally breathless pedigree: ''Every artist is a narcissist after all: bring back the boo & other short selected self-indulgences.'' But the description -- ''a celebration of the things she loves and a requiem of things she fears'' -- is all plain speaking. And apparently a gold unitard is involved. (Through March 8.) Ms. Cook's preperformance installation begins at 8:05 p.m.; the performance is at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15; $10 for members. (Roslyn Sulcas)
 DANCE CONVERSATIONS @ THE FLEA (Tuesday) This month's free program of talk and dance will feature the choreographers Mari Hieronimus, Daniela Hoff, Sasha Welsh and Kristen Hollinsworth and Monica Gillette, with Blondell Cummings as moderator. At 7 p.m., the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Dunning) 
 EMERGENCY FUND FOR STUDENT DANCERS (Saturday and Sunday) New York City is no longer an affordable mecca for young artists. Those who manage to struggle along are in dire straits if crises arise. This fund raises money to help them, through performances this year by fellow students from the Ailey School, the Merce Cunningham Studio, the Dance Theater of Harlem School, the Martha Graham School and the schools of the Limon Institute and Houston Ballet. The program includes work by Graham, Robert Garland, Keith Saunders, Mr. Cunningham, Jose Limon, Alan Danielson 
 and Ronald K. Brown. At 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, efsdancers.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) 
 FLAMENCO VIVO CARLOTA SANTANA (Tuesday through Thursday) This United States-based company has long been popular with audiences for its vivid performances, which tend toward the less tortured aspects of the art of flamenco. This season ''Carmen: El Baile'' (''Carmen: The Dance'') makes its New York debut (is there a secret law that obliges a certain percentage of dance companies to have one ''Carmen'' or one ''Rite of Spring'' in their repertories?) alongside the new ''Estilos Flamenco,'' a traditional, non-narrative flamenco piece for the company's nine dancers and five musicians. (Through March 9.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40; $30 for members. (Sulcas)
 LEILA HADDAD AND THE GYPSY MUSICIANS OF UPPER EGYPT (Thursday) Ms. Haddad will perform traditional dances of the Ghawazee Gypsies of southern Egypt, accompanied by an ensemble drawn partly from the Musicians of the Nile. (Through next Friday.) At 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, worldmusicinstitute.org; $35; $15 for students. (Dunning) 
 HEATHER HARPHAM AND CASSIE TERMAN (Friday and Saturday) The two create a landscape that is navigated by guides like a clothesline, broken teacups, tiny blackbirds, tattered envelopes and a 30-year friendship. At 8 p.m., Center for Remembering & Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, near 12th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, crsny.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) 
 ISRAEL NON-STOP FESTIVAL 2008!: BATSHEVA DANCE COMPANY (Sunday and Tuesday) Produced by the JCC in Manhattan, this festival celebrates the performing arts -- as well as food, photographs and literature -- in Israel. Dance will be represented by the Batsheva Dance Company in Ohad Naharin's ''Kamuyot,'' created for schoolchildren as well as adults. Sunday at 12:30 and 2:30 p.m.; Monday at 10 a.m.; and Tuesday at noon; JCC in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646) 505-5708, jccarts.org; $20; $12 for ages 16 and under. (Dunning) 
 'NO STRANGERS HERE TODAY' (Friday through Sunday) This theater-dance piece by Susan Banyas, set to music by David Ornette Cherry, is drawn from the 19th-century diaries of Elizabeth Edwards, a Quaker farmwoman whose family helped slaves fleeing on the Underground Railroad. Friday and Saturday at 10 p.m.; Sunday at 5:30 p.m.; La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. 
 (Dunning) 
 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The festival continues with performances by nathantrice/Rituals (Saturday and Sunday), followed by ''Out of Israel,'' a program of new works presented by LeeSaar/The Company and Netta Yerushalmy (Wednesday and Thursday). LeeSaar's ''Geisha'' plays with notions of femininity, silence, fear, loneliness and control. Ms. Yerushalmy, who specializes in asymmetrical, occasionally awkward movement, will present ''Bilocale -- come closer please.'' Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/harknessfestival; $20. 
 (Dunning) 
 PEAK PERFORMANCES: COIS CEIM DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) This modern-dance company from Ireland will perform ''Knots,'' drawn from the psychoanalytical theory of R. D. Laing and choreographed by Liam Steel, formerly with England's DV8 and Stan Won't Dance troupes. (Through March 9.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $15. (Dunning) 
 MARCO PELLE (Friday) This Italian choreographer will present dances set to music by composers including Bizet, Rachmaninoff and Brahms. At 7:30 p.m., New York Theater Ballet Dance Gallery, 30 East 31st Street, Manhattan, (212) 679-0401; $10. 
 (Dunning)
 RICHMOND BALLET (Saturday) Founded in 1957, this company will perform three dances by Jessica Lang, set to music by composers including Philip Glass, John Cage, Henryk Gorecki and Handel, Mozart and Corelli.

HEADLINE: Economic Fears Put End To 4-Day Winning Streak

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks sank Thursday as investors fretted over a rise in unemployment claims and the prospect of more bank failures. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112 points, ending a four-day winning streak. 
 The dollar closed at $1.5215 to the euro, extending a decline that began Tuesday after the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald L. Kohn, said that the slowing American economy posed a bigger threat than inflation.
 As the sinking dollar pushed investors further into commodities, crude oil rose $2.95 to settle at a record $102.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its fourth increase in the last five sessions. Gold, corn and soybeans also hit or approached new highs on Thursday, with gold closing at $970.74 an ounce.
 In testimony to Congress, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday that large American banks would probably recover from the recent credit crisis, but other banks were at risk of failing. Three small banks have failed since the summer, when the lending industry started losing billions of dollars as mortgage defaults soared.
 His testimony increased the anxiety on Wall Street, where stocks had fallen earlier in response to a Labor Department report that first-time unemployment claims rose last week by 19,000, to 373,000, the highest level since late January.
 After four consecutive days of gains in the Dow -- its longest such run this year -- the blue-chip index sank 112.10, or 0.9 percent, to close at 12,582.18.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 12.34, or 0.9 percent, to 1,367.68, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 22.21, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,331.57.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.72, or 1.5 percent, to close at 705.72.
 Corporate news was gloomy. Sprint Nextel posted a $29.5 billion loss in the fourth quarter after losing customers and writing down the remaining value of its purchase of Nextel Communications. It also cut its dividend. Sprint tumbled 86 cents, or 9.6 percent, to $8.09.
 The lender Thornburg Mortgage plunged after it said it had received calls for immediate repayment of debt on a portfolio of securities backed by Alt-A mortgages. Alt-A loans are given to customers with little credit history or minor credit problems.
 Thornburg fell $1.78, or 15.4 percent, to close at $9.76.
 And investors remained jittery about the prospect of more problems emerging in the financial sector. A few weeks after the French bank Societe Generale revealed a $7 billion loss that it said stemmed from the unauthorized actions of a single trader, the New York futures and options broker MF Global said Thursday that it had lost $141.5 million after a broker traded more wheat contracts than permitted.
 MF Global dropped $8.09, or 27.6 percent, to $21.19.
 Bonds rose sharply as stocks sank. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 1 16/32, to 98 20/32. Its yield, sank to 3.66 percent from 3.85 percent.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auctions for 14-day cash management bills and five-year notes:

HEADLINE: More Than 1 in 100 Adults Are Now in Prison in U.S.

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
For the first time in the nation's history, more than one in 100 American adults are behind bars, according to a new report. 
 Nationwide, the prison population grew by 25,000 last year, bringing it to almost 1.6 million, after three decades of growth that has seen the prison population nearly triple. Another 723,000 people are in local jails. 
 The number of American adults is about 230 million, meaning that one in every 99.1 adults is behind bars. 
 Incarceration rates are even higher for some groups. One in 36 adult Hispanic men is behind bars, based on Justice Department figures for 2006. One in 15 adult black men is, too, as is one in nine black men ages 20 to 34. 
 The report, from the Pew Center on the States, also found that one in 355 white women ages 35 to 39 is behind bars, compared with one in 100 black women. 
 The report's methodology differed from that used by the Justice Department, which calculates the incarceration rate by using the total population rather than the adult population as the denominator. Using the department's methodology, about one in 130 Americans is behind bars. 
 The increase in the number of prisoners over the last 18 months, the Pew report says, pushed the national adult incarceration rate to just over one in 100.
 ''We aren't really getting the return in public safety from this level of incarceration,'' said Susan Urahn, the center's managing director.
 But Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former federal judge, said the Pew report considered only half of the cost-benefit equation and overlooked the ''very tangible benefits: lower crime rates.''
 In the past 20 years, according the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rates of violent crimes fell by 25 percent, to 464 per 100,000 people in 2007 from 612.5 in 1987.
 ''While we certainly want to be smart about who we put into prisons,'' Professor Cassell said, ''it would be a mistake to think that we can release any significant number of prisoners without increasing crime rates. One out of every 100 adults is behind bars because one out of every 100 adults has committed a serious criminal offense.''
 The United States imprisons more people than any other nation in the world. China is second, with 1.5 million people behind bars. The gap is even wider in percentage terms. 
 Germany imprisons 93 out of every 100,000 people, according to the International Center for Prison Studies at King's College in London. The comparable number for the United States is roughly eight times that, or 750 out of 100,000. 
 Ms. Urahn said the nation could not afford the incarceration rate documented in the report.
 ''We tend to be a country in which incarceration is an easy response to crime,'' she said. ''Being tough on crime is an easy position to take, particularly if you have the money. And we did have the money in the '80s and '90s.''
 Now, with fewer resources available, the report said, ''prison costs are blowing a hole in state budgets.''
 On average, states spend almost 7 percent of their budgets on corrections, trailing only health care, education and transportation.
 In 2007, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers, states spent $44 billion in tax dollars on corrections. That is up from $10.6 billion in 1987, a 127 percent increase when adjusted for inflation. With money from bonds and the federal government included, total state spending on corrections last year was $49 billion. By 2011, the Pew report said, states are on track to spend an additional $25 billion.
 It cost an average of $23,876 dollars to imprison someone in 2005, the most recent year for which data were available. But state spending varies widely, from $45,000 a year in Rhode Island to $13,000 in Louisiana. 
 ''Getting tough on crime has gotten tough on taxpayers,'' said Adam Gelb, the director of the public safety performance project at the Pew center. ''They don't want to spend $23,000 on a prison cell for a minor violation any more than they want a bridge to nowhere.''
 The cost of medical care is growing by 10 percent annually, the report said, and will accelerate as the prison population ages. 
 About one in nine state government employees works in corrections, and some states are finding it hard to fill those jobs. California spent more than $500 million on overtime alone in 2006.
 The number of prisoners in California dropped by 4,000 last year, making Texas' prison system the nation's largest, at about 172,000. But the Texas Legislature last year approved broad changes to the state's corrections system, including expansions of drug treatment programs and drug courts and revisions to parole practices.
 ''Our violent offenders, we lock them up for a very long time -- rapists, murderers, child molesters,'' said State Senator John Whitmire, Democrat of Houston and the chairman of the Senate's Criminal Justice Committee. ''The problem was that we weren't smart about nonviolent offenders. The Legislature finally caught up with the public.''
 Mr. Whitmire gave an example.
 ''We have 5,500 D.W.I offenders in prison,'' he said, including people caught driving under the influence who had not been in an accident. ''They're in the general population. As serious as drinking and driving is, we should segregate them and give them treatment.''
 The Pew report recommended diverting nonviolent offenders away from prison and using punishments short of reincarceration for minor or technical violations of probation or parole. It also urged states to consider earlier release of some prisoners.
 Before the recent changes in Texas, Mr. Whitmire said, ''we were recycling nonviolent offenders.''

 NINA ANANIASHVILI AND THE STATE BALLET OF GEORGIA (Friday through Sunday) This newly revitalized classical ballet troupe, from the Georgian Republic and not Atlanta, will perform George Balanchine's ''Duo Concertant'' and ''Chaconne'' in the first of two programs, which also includes Alexei Ratmansky's new ''Bizet Variations'' and Yuri Possokhov's ''Sagalobeli,'' set to traditional Georgian music (Friday). In the second program, on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Ratmansky's ''Dreams About Japan'' replaces ''Chaconne.'' Ms. Ananiashvili, the company's director, and Sergei Filin of the Bolshoi Ballet will perform with the company. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $70. (Jennifer Dunning) 
 BLUM DANCE THEATER AND JENNIFER WRIGHT COOK (Thursday) Sometimes descriptions of dances seem like a weird minor art form of their own. Such is Danspace's account of Wendy Blum's ''String of Exquisite Distortions'': ''a nonlinear world of economy and rigorous mischief, where rhythms persist and scents linger.'' What more is there to say? Ms. Blum shares a double bill with Jennifer Wright Cook, who has a work with a title of equally breathless pedigree: ''Every artist is a narcissist after all: bring back the boo & other short selected self-indulgences.'' But the description -- ''a celebration of the things she loves and a requiem of things she fears'' -- is all plain speaking. And apparently a gold unitard is involved. (Through March 8.) Ms. Cook's preperformance installation begins at 8:05 p.m.; the performance is at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15; $10 for members.

 FLAMENCO VIVO CARLOTA SANTANA (Tuesday through Thursday) This United States-based company has long been popular with audiences for its vivid performances, which tend toward the less tortured aspects of the art of flamenco. This season ''Carmen: El Baile'' (''Carmen: The Dance'') makes its New York debut (is there a secret law that obliges a certain percentage of dance companies to have one ''Carmen'' or one ''Rite of Spring'' in their repertories?) alongside the new ''Estilos Flamenco,'' a traditional, non-narrative flamenco piece for the company's nine dancers and five musicians. (Through March 9.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40; $30 for members. (Sulcas)

Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/harknessfestival; $20.

HEADLINE: Modern Pool For Public Is Opening In Flushing

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In an era of private grandeur, New York City has built a temple for the public in Queens: the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink -- it does not even have a corporate name -- which is to open on Friday.
 It is the largest and, at $66.3 million, the costliest recreation building ever constructed in a city park, said Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation. Mr. Benepe, who recalled running on dismal public tracks with ''swampy locker rooms'' as a youth in the 1970s, said the new pool gave him goose bumps. 
 ''This is an international, competition-level pool,'' he said. And one that can be used free by youths 18 and under. Adults under 55 will pay $75 annually. Anyone older will pay $10 a year.
 At the building's heart is a 50-by-25-meter swimming pool, divisible by bulkheads into three swimming and diving areas, with a total of one million gallons of 80-degree water. A sweeping arched roof is held up by a bridgelike cable-stayed suspension system. Visible through the expansive window wall are the 1964-65 World's Fair grounds.
 ''This pool is an anchor in the community,'' said the first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris. ''It brings all different neighbors together. It is in line with our interest in exercise and public health. Why shouldn't it be a first-class facility?''
 Next to the pool, but not yet open, is an 85-by-200-foot hockey rink. The city has constructed the rink, including the network of copper brine piping needed to make ice. The finishing work will be done by a concessionaire, which has not yet been chosen. The pool is operated under contract to the city by USA Pools of Roswell, Ga.
 Mr. Benepe said the pool and rink would operate simultaneously and year-round. They are both ''completely accessible'' to the disabled, he said. For instance, there is a section of transparent plastic wall around the rink, close to the ice, so that sled hockey players, who have limited mobility and whose heads are closer to the ground, can watch what is happening on the ice from rinkside while waiting their turn in the rink. 
 The 130-foot-high twin masts from which the roof is suspended form a new counterpoint to the Unisphere and the towers of the abandoned New York State Pavilion. Handel Architects, which designed the building in association with Kevin Hom & Andrew Goldman Architects, said it was ''inspired by the 1939 and 1964 World's Fair pavilions.''
 The pool has not been gestating since Unisphere days, but it did take almost a decade to complete.
 Financing was laid out in 1999 under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The first step was to drive 758 pilings about 60 feet into the marshy ground. After construction bids came in higher than budgeted, the project was postponed. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg revived it in 2004 as a more ambitious undertaking: a pool that could serve as a water polo venue in the 2012 Olympics, for which New York was then competing.
 The construction job was given to the city's Economic Development Corporation.
 ''Evident from the beginning, from the Parks Department and City Hall, was that this was to be a signature piece of public work,'' said David Kane, the senior vice president in charge of the corporation's capital program.
 To accommodate Olympic spectators, the structure was designed so that two walls could be removed around the pool, permitting the addition of temporary bleachers. The tiled pool deck was also enlarged, to 25 feet at each end.
 Mr. Benepe now envisions it as the setting for swimming competitions between public, private and parochial high schools. ''You could actually see whether you're the best in New York City,'' he said, expectantly.

HEADLINE: Facing Default, Some Abandon Homes to Banks

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
When Raymond Zulueta went into default on his mortgage last year, he did what a lot of people do. He worried.
 In a declining housing market, he owed more than the house was worth, and his mortgage payments, even on an interest-only loan, had shot up to $2,600, more than he could afford. ''I was terrified,'' said Mr. Zulueta, who services automated teller machines for an armored car company in the San Francisco area. 
 Then in January he learned about a new company in San Diego called You Walk Away that does just what its name says. For $995, it helps people walk away from their homes, ceding them to the banks in foreclosure.
 Last week he moved into a three-bedroom rental home for $1,200 a month, less than half the cost of his mortgage. The old house is now the lender's problem. ''They took the negativity out of my life,'' Mr. Zulueta said of You Walk Away. ''I was stressing over nothing.'' 
 You Walk Away is a small sign of broad changes in the way many Americans look at housing. In an era in which new types of loans allowed many home buyers to move in with little or no down payment, and to cash out any equity by refinancing, the meaning of homeownership and foreclosure have changed, economists and housing experts say. 
 Last year the median down payment on home purchases was 9 percent, down from 20 percent in 1989, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors. Twenty-nine percent of buyers put no money down. For first-time home buyers, the median was 2 percent. And many borrowed more than the price of the home in order to cover closing costs. 
 ''I think I could make a case that some borrowers were 'renting' (with risk), rather than owning,'' Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said in an e-mail message.
 For some people, then, foreclosure becomes something akin to eviction -- a traumatic event, and a blow to one's credit record, but not one that involves loss of life savings or of years spent scrimping to buy the home. 
 ''There certainly appears to be more willingness on the part of borrowers to walk away from mortgages,'' said John Mechem, spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association, who noted that in the past, many would try to save their homes.
 In recent months top executives from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia have all described a new willingness by borrowers to walk away from mortgages. 
 Carrie Newhouse, a real estate agent who also works as a loss mitigation consultant for mortgage lenders in Minneapolis-St. Paul, said she saw many homeowners who looked at foreclosure as a first option, preferable to dealing with their lender. ''I've had people say to me, 'My house isn't worth what I owe, why should I continue to make payments on it?' '' Mrs. Newhouse said.
 ''You bought an adjustable rate mortgage and you're mad the bank is adjusting the rate,'' she said. ''And sometimes the bank people who call these consumers aren't really nice. Not that the bank has the responsibility to be your friend, but a lot are just so uncooperative.'' 
 The same sorts of loans that drove the real estate boom now change the nature of foreclosure, giving borrowers incentives to walk away, said Todd Sinai, an associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
 ''There's a whole lot of people who would've been stuck as renters without these exotic loan products,'' Professor Sinai said. ''Now it's like they can do their renting from the bank, and if house values go up, they become the owner. If they go down, you have the choice to give the house back to the bank. You aren't any worse off than renting, and you got a chance to do extremely well. If it's heads I win, tails the bank loses, it's worth the gamble.'' 
 In the boom market, homeowners took their winnings, withdrawing $800 billion in equity from their homes in 2005 alone, according to RGE Monitor, an online financial research firm. 
 Since the Depression, American government policy has encouraged homeownership as an absolute good. It protects people from increases in rent and allows them to build equity as they pay off their mortgages. And it creates stability in communities, because owners are invested in their neighbors. 
 But new types of loans like interest-only mortgages and cash-out refinance loans mean buyers do not pay down their mortgages. And adjustable rate mortgages, which accounted for 39 percent of mortgages written in 2006, expose owners to rent-like rises in their housing costs.
 The value of homeownership, then, has increasingly shifted to the home's likelihood to rise in value, like any other investment. And when investments go bad, people tend to walk away. 
 ''When people don't have skin in the game, they behave like they don't have skin in the game,'' said Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, who conducts regular surveys of borrowers as a founding partner of Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate research firm.
 Though many states give banks recourse to sue borrowers for their losses, Mr. Case said, in practice it's not often done ''It's tough to do recourse,'' he said. ''It's costly, and the amount of people's nonhousing wealth tends to be pretty slim.''
 Christian Menegatti, lead analyst at RGE Monitor, said the firm predicted more homeowners would walk away from their homes if prices continued to drop, regardless of their financial circumstances. If home prices drop an additional 10 percent, Mr. Menegatti said, 20 million households will owe more than the value of their homes.
 ''Will everyone walk out?'' he said. ''No. But there's been a cultural shift. Buying a house used to be like entering a marriage, a commitment for life. Now, if you see something better, you go back into the dating market.'' 
 When homeowners see houses identical to their own selling for much less than they owe, Mr. Menegatti said, ''I wouldn't be surprised to see five or six million homeowners walk away.''
 For Raymond Zulueta, the decision to go into foreclosure, and to hire You Walk Away, brought him peace of mind. The company assured him that in California he was not liable for his debt, and provided sessions with a lawyer and an accountant, as well as enrollment with a credit repair agency. He stopped paying his mortgage and used the money to pay down other debts. 
 Consumer advocates and others question the value of You Walk Away's service. 
 ''We are more interested in servicers and borrowers coming to mutual resolutions through loan remediation,'' said Kevin Stein, associate director of the nonprofit California Reinvestment Coalition. ''Even though we are not seeing good outcomes, we're not willing to throw up our hands and say people should walk away from their homes based on the advice of a company that stands to profit from foreclosure.'' 
 Jon Maddux, a founder of You Walk Away, said the company's services were not for everybody and were meant as a last resort. The company opened for business in January and says it has just over 200 clients in six states.
 ''It's not a moral decision,'' Mr. Maddux said of foreclosure. ''The moral decision is, 'I need to pay my kids' health insurance or my car payment so I can get to work.' They made a bad decision, but they shouldn't make more bad ones just because they have this loan.'' 
 Mr. Zulueta said he felt he had let down the lender, himself, and his family.
 ''But you got to move on,'' he said. ''I know in a few years my credit's going to be fine. If I want to get another house, it's going to be there. I'm not the only one who went through this. I know I'm working the system, but you got to do what you got to do. There's always loopholes.''

 ESPRESSO ENTHUSIASTS WORKSHOP A clock, a bathroom scale and a thermometer? I had signed up for a class on how to become a barista, but these were not the tools of the trade I expected.
 The session, held one Sunday a month in an industrial space in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, seemed like an enjoyable way to indulge my love of caffeine, and it started off promisingly: a sort of coffee klatsch with my fellow students as we drank rich espressos dashed off by our instructor, Rowan Tuckfield. His roasting company, Kitten Coffee, sells beans to restaurants and teaches professionals and civilians alike how to make a demitasse that's up to Italian standards. 
 But then it came time to drive, as Mr. Tuckfield called the operation of the professional-grade espresso makers, and my classmates and I quickly ran off the road. 
 The Italian method, above, is surprisingly precise: the extraction should last 30 seconds and result in a one-ounce jolt with a quarter-inch of crema on the surface. It turns out there are reasons for such precision. Less than an ounce, for instance, and you taste only burnt beans, as I did. Repeatedly. 
 With an eye on the clock, I came closer to the magic mark. Similarly, the scale helps measure the pounds of pressure needed to hand-tamp the grounds into the filter, and the thermometer indicates the best moment to tilt the milk jug during frothing. 
 As we made cup after cup that improved from shockingly bitter to not entirely hopeless, Mr. Tuckfield told us to watch for the coda di topo, the thin stream of extracted coffee that, as its name suggests in Italian, should resemble the tail of a mouse, and urged us to treat beans the way we do food. (You don't want to know about the grease from whole beans left in the hopper too long. Don't be the first customer of the day at your local coffee place, Mr. Tuckfield advises.)
 After I heated the milk for my final cup (wield the frothing wand so you hear a shy hiss, not loud slurps), I received a certificate attesting to barista abilities worthy of a Roman caffeinista. And right after the class was over, I headed straight to the nearest cafe. All that coffee had me jonesing for more.

HEADLINE: Law Firms Follow Banks to the Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By KAREN DONOVAN

 BODY:
At Latham & Watkins, the international law firm, William H. Voge is the resident whiz on Dubai. And Abu Dhabi. And Qatar. 
 Mr. Voge, who heads the finance practice, can recite when each of the firm's investment banking clients opened offices in the Middle East. And he knows how many law firms have established outposts there too: 20 since 2005. 
 ''This is the Silicon Valley, if you will, of the world,'' Mr. Voge said. ''It's just beginning to take off, where clients have an increasing need for sophisticated legal advice on the ground.''
 Latham & Watkins plans to open three offices in the Middle East by the end of the first quarter. A competitor, Dewey & LeBoeuf, said in January that it had opened an office in Dubai. And Clifford Chance, a London law firm that has been in Dubai since 1975, plans to open an office in Abu Dhabi in late April. 
 The rush to the cash-rich Persian Gulf is easy to explain: Law firms are following the money. 
 ''Where there are investment banks, you will find lawyers,'' said Graham Lovett, Clifford Chance's managing partner for the gulf. ''I am pretty certain that some firms arrived here and don't know why they were not here already.'' 
 Consider Latham & Watkins. The Qatar Investment Authority, one of its clients, has been asking the firm to open a local branch for five years. 
 Latham is coming off a banner year. It took in more than $2 billion in gross revenue in 2007, a first for a United States law firm, driven by its international focus. 
 About 20 percent of Latham's business comes from its finance practice, and Latham interviewed 14 financial institution clients, among them Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, before making the plunge in the Middle East. 
 ''They all view the gulf region as becoming an increasing player in the global economy,'' Mr. Voge said. 
 Some of Wall Street's top law firms, however, have not yet joined the race to the gulf. Davis Polk & Wardwell, for example, has no plans to open a Middle East office. 
 ''Of our peer group of American firms, there has not been a rush, and I'm not sure there is going to be one,'' said Thomas J. Reid, a partner with Davis Polk's London office. India is Davis Polk's top international priority right now. 
 Shearman & Sterling, by contrast, has maintained an office in Abu Dhabi since 1975, mainly driven by its project finance practice. But capital markets are becoming increasingly important. 
 Shearman represented the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority when the sovereign wealth fund bought into Citigroup last November. 
 Latham, meantime, plans to have three partners in Dubai, and a total of 20 lawyers in the region, by the year's end. 
 Dubai, with its night life and amenities, is a big draw for the firm's young lawyers. Mr. Voge describes Dubai as a combination of New York, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla.

HEADLINE: Giant Write-Down at Sprint Results in $29 Billion Loss

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint Nextel's new chief executive, tells it like it is -- but on Thursday, investors did not like what they heard.
 Sprint's stock slid more than 9 percent after the company announced a $29.45 billion fourth-quarter loss because of a huge write-down related in part to its merger with Nextel Communications. The company also said it was suspending the payment of its dividend and had borrowed $2.5 billion through a revolving credit facility. Mr. Hesse, a former AT&T executive, took over the troubled company only two months ago. When asked if he feared the prospect of bankruptcy, he said, ''We have plenty of cash on hand.'' Sprint borrowed the $2.5 billion, he said, because it ''allows us to focus exclusively on fixing the business'' and mitigates the potential financial risk of outstanding loans. 
 Sprint has $1.25 billion in bonds maturing in November, as well as $600 million coming due in 2009. 
 Many of Sprint's peers have warned recently of weak earnings amid a slowing economy. But Mr. Hesse put the responsibility for the company's situation squarely with Sprint's management. 
 The $29.45 billion loss, which works out to $10.36 a share, contrasted with a profit of $261 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sprint's fourth-quarter revenue was $9.85 billion, down from $10.44 billion in the period in 2006.
 With one-time items like the $29.7 billion write-down excluded, operating income was down 69 percent, to $235 million in the quarter. For the year it was down 43 percent, to $1.78 billion.
 Sprint has been struggling to keep its 53.8 million customers happy. Mr. Hesse said it expected to lose another 1.2 million subscribers this quarter, about the same amount it lost in all of 2007. He said it could lose even more customers in the second quarter. 
 Analysts were not surprised by the company's poor showing or the prospect of more defections. 
 ''No one expected Sprint's results to be anything other than poor today, which makes the fact that they have managed to miss on virtually every metric a performance of some heroism,'' wrote Craig E. Moffett, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Further, he wrote, ''the near-term contrarian argument of a turnaround -- or, better, a strategic acquisition -- remains highly speculative.''
 Accepting the chief executive job, which few industry executives expressed interest in, may have been a form of heroism in itself for Mr. Hesse. The company has had a revolving door of executives in the corporate suite.
 In August 2006, Sprint lost Len J. Lauer, the chief operating officer, who said he was leaving because of a change in organizational structure. Timothy M. Donahue, the executive chairman, also resigned earlier than expected. Last October, Gary D. Forsee, the chief executive, resigned after news reports that Sprint's board was looking to replace him.
 Analysts attribute much of Sprint's management problems to the poorly executed merger between Sprint and Nextel, a deal struck in 2005. The two companies' networks did not share the same technology, which made it difficult to merge operations, and also had clashing marketing strategies. With the company in a tenuous state, rivals swooped in and courted dissatisfied customers.
 Mr. Hesse, who became chief executive two months ago, said he took the job because ''Sprint is an iconic brand.'' But even he underestimated the severity of Sprint's challenges. Last month Mr. Hesse announced more layoffs and the departure of three senior executives. ''Like a lot of things, it is tougher than I thought it would be,'' he said. ''It's not a quick fix. I had hoped I could turn it around faster. But I have confidence in the long term.''
 To stem further customer losses, Mr. Hesse said Sprint would begin offering a service plan that gives customers unlimited calls, text messages, Web access and G.P.S. navigation on their mobile phones. Priced at $100, the offering is aimed directly at AT&T and Verizon, which announced similarly priced wireless plans last week. The rivals' plans only include voice calls, not Web access or text messaging, which both pump up revenue for wireless companies.
 Mr. Hesse recalled his days running AT&T Wireless Services and how it began offering simple one-rate plans to customers frustrated by confusing prices on long distance and roaming fees.
 Sprint customers now spend about $58 a month on average on their wireless plans, he said.
 ''This is about simplicity,'' Mr. Hesse said. Still, he warned that the new plan would not cure Sprint's ills.
 Sprint's stock fell 86 cents, to close at $8.09.

HEADLINE: Strike at Auto Parts Supplier Stops Work at a G.M. Plant

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
General Motors halted production at one of its pickup truck plants Thursday afternoon when it ran out of some parts because the workers who make them are on strike.
 There are no signs that the three-day-old strike at the parts supplier, American Axle and Manufacturing, is near an end, meaning that G.M. could be forced to idle other factories in the coming days. No talks have been held or scheduled since the United Automobile Workers union sent 3,650 workers in Michigan and New York to the picket lines at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. 
 G.M. closed its truck plant in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac after Thursday's first shift, putting 2,500 workers on temporary layoff. Analysts say that at least eight of the automaker's factories may soon run out of parts if the strike continues. G.M. officials would not discuss any additional actions they might take.
 ''We're not going to speculate on the duration of the Pontiac shutdown or what other facilities will be affected,'' said a company spokesman, Tom Wickham.
 The plant in Pontiac is one of five that build the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, two of G.M.'s newest and most profitable models. A brief halt in production of the trucks is not expected to cause any shortages, as high gas prices and a weak economy have left G.M. dealers with about five months' inventory.
 ''Even if there wasn't a strike, my bet is that they would have had to idle some of those plants for a while anyway to bring those inventories down to more manageable levels,'' said Erich Merkle, vice president for auto industry forecasting at the consulting firm IRN in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But if this thing drags on, and those plants are down for four weeks, you start getting into some real problems.''
 G.M. is American Axle's largest customer, accounting for nearly 80 percent of its business. Chrysler also buys a large number of axles and other parts from the company, and its inventories are also high. 
 American Axle wants to cut workers' wages by as much as half and eliminate retirement benefits. The company has been profitable, though only slightly, but says it cannot compete with rivals that now pay considerably less for labor.
 Strike Closes Canadian Plant
 The Canadian Auto Workers called a strike on Thursday at a TRW Automotive Holdings plant in Windsor, Ontario, forcing the idling of a nearby Chrysler plant that assembles the automaker's top-selling minivans.
 Chrysler suspended work at its Windsor Assembly plant about 6 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday and canceled overnight and Friday morning shifts at the plant, which employs about 4,400 hourly workers.
 The Windsor Assembly Plant makes the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan, a pair of redesigned minivans that Chrysler needs to hold its own in a slumping auto market.

HEADLINE: New Line's Leaders Are Ousted as Warner Studio Takes Control

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Time Warner announced Thursday that New Line Cinema, one of its marquee movie studios, would become a unit of Warner Brothers, ceasing to operate as a full-service, stand-alone unit. 
 In the process, New Line will shed an unspecified but substantial number of its 600 employees, including Robert Shaye, the studio's founder, and his co-chairman, Michael Lynne. 
 New Line, which Mr. Shaye founded in New York in 1967, became famous for promoting the work of independent directors while minting box-office gold like the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series and later the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. In recent years, the studio had been battered by poorly performing movies and legal wrangling over ''Lord of the Rings.'' 
 The consolidation -- the first far-reaching decision by Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's new chief executive -- could double New Line's earnings, according to analysts. The company said it expected to record a ''fairly sizable'' revamping charge tied to discontinuing some operations at New Line in 2008, and cautioned that earnings would not reflect the full benefit until 2010.
 ''We are moving quickly to improve our business performance and financial returns,'' said Mr. Bewkes, who is under pressure to lift Time Warner's share price. Its shares have recently traded at about $16.
 In addition to cutting costs, another reason behind the move was the increasing importance of the international box office, Mr. Bewkes said. New Line has largely relied on the advance sale of foreign rights to bankroll its pictures. But Mr. Bewkes said that strategy leaves too much money on the table.
 ''The Golden Compass,'' the recent fantasy epic starring Nicole Kidman, is a prime example. The movie was a hit overseas, generating some $260 million in ticket sales, but New Line had sold off most of the foreign rights.
 Mr. Bewkes will now decide what to do with the company's two other boutique movie studios, Picturehouse and Warner Independent Pictures. 
 While it had struggled, New Line was hardly moribund. It is releasing the movie version of ''Sex and the City'' this spring and recently resolved its legal dispute with the director Peter Jackson, clearing the path for him to make ''The Hobbit.'' 
 Indeed, the consolidation may be as much about egos as economics. Mr. Shaye and Mr. Lynne -- whose aggressive style and loyalty to offbeat projects like ''The Last Mimzy'' have raised eyebrows -- have long resisted combining New Line with Warner Brothers, leading to a running soap opera for the company.
 Mr. Shaye, 68, and Mr. Lynne, 66, declined to be interviewed. In an internal memorandum, they said they intended to remain ''actively involved in the industry in an entrepreneurial capacity.''
 Barry M. Meyer, chairman of Warner Brothers, and Alan F. Horn, the studio's president, also declined to comment. In an internal memo, they wrote, ''We want to take our time to make sure that we understand New Line's business and properly align this valuable asset that's now affiliated with the studio.''

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Spirit Falters In Fights on Debt Relief

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Just a month after President Bush and Democratic leaders hailed their bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus plan, the two sides went to war on Thursday over how to prevent widening damage from the housing crisis.
 Senate Republicans, lining up with President Bush, blocked a Democratic bill that would provide more money for homeowner counseling programs and let bankruptcy judges reduce the terms of a mortgage for people about to lose their houses through foreclosure.
 Meanwhile, the Bush administration flatly rejected Democratic proposals to rescue hundreds of thousands of borrowers, as well as their mortgage lenders, by having the government buy up and restructure billions of dollars in delinquent home loans. Instead, the president called on Congress to extend indefinitely his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which expire at the end of 2010. 
 With new data showing that the economy may be even weaker than previously thought, Republicans and Democrats plunged back into a partisan, ideological clash over whether the government should try to stabilize home prices, prevent foreclosures and perhaps even bail out lenders.
 The battle played out as Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that he did not expect a recession or a return of stagflation. But he reiterated his prediction of very slow growth this year and rattled investors by warning that some smaller banks might fail.
 ''I expect there will be some failures,'' he told lawmakers. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 112 points.
 In Congress, Democratic lawmakers have begun to push ahead with an agenda aimed at shoring up the housing market with federal money, giving delinquent homeowners more bargaining power with their lenders and having the government buy troubled mortgages.
 About 20 percent of subprime mortgages, which are made to people with low credit scores or low incomes, are delinquent and in danger of default. Moody'sEconomy.com recently estimated that three million subprime borrowers were likely to default over the next several years. 
 Delinquencies are also climbing sharply among people with good credit who took out risky mortgages, often with no down payment, and are now watching the resale value of their homes sink to less than the amount of the outstanding mortgage.
 The bill drafted by Senate Democrats would have provided $4 billion for state and local programs to rehabilitate abandoned housing; $10 billion for states to raise low-cost mortgage money through tax-free revenue bonds; and another $200 million for counseling services to help homeowners renegotiate their loans.
 The Bush administration opposed most of those provisions, but the biggest fight was over allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce the total owed or the interest rate on mortgages as part of a broader debt restructuring.
 That provision, supported by a wide range of consumer and civil rights groups, drew intense opposition from the mortgage industry, whose lobbyists argued that it would increase risks for lenders and drive up mortgage rates in the future.
 Republican lawmakers blocked the bill, voting almost entirely along party lines to defeat a ''motion to proceed'' that required 60 votes. 
 Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who is from Kentucky, called the Democratic bill a ''hastily concocted political exercise.'' 
 But in presenting what they described as their own proposal to protect homeowners, Mr. McConnell and other Republican lawmakers resorted to a grab bag of longstanding Republican initiatives, like making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent and reducing ''frivolous litigation,'' that had little direct connection to the mortgage mess.
 Democrats, knowing that they could not muster 60 votes to pass their bill, charged that Mr. Bush and the Republicans were protecting banks and Wall Street firms while doing little for people trapped in mortgages they cannot afford and houses they cannot sell.
 ''Their do-nothing leadership will cause this crisis to spiral farther out of control,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. Mr. Durbin, who had drafted the provision to let bankruptcy judges modify mortgages on a person's primary residence, said his measure could have helped as many as 600,000 people avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, promised to bring up the housing bill again but declined to say when.
 ''The bankers on Wall Street and the big lenders are high-fiving tonight,'' Mr. Reid said after failing to get enough votes to bring the bill up on the Senate floor. ''It is becoming increasingly clear that Republicans either have no interest in turning around our sinking economy, or no ideas on how to do so.''
 President Bush, who met with his top economic advisers at the Labor Department on Thursday, brushed aside the need for new government rescue efforts.
 ''I don't think we're in a recession, but no question we're in a slowdown,'' he told reporters at a news conference. ''One way Congress, if they really want to make a substantial difference in creating certainty during uncertain times, is to make the tax cuts we passed permanent.''
 The next big fight could be over proposals, which the Bush administration strongly opposes, that would allow the federal government to buy up billions of dollars in troubled mortgages.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, proposed a bill this week that would provide $10 billion for the Federal Housing Administration to help refinance as many as one million distressed subprime loans with cheaper government-insured loans. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has proposed creating a government agency that would buy troubled mortgages at a discount and restructure them into more affordable loans.
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, said such proposals appeared to be a taxpayer-funded bailout and saw no need for them. ''While some in Washington are proposing big interventions, most of the proposals I've seen would do more harm than good. I'm not interested in bailing out investors, lenders and speculators,'' Mr. Paulson said in prepared remarks to the Economic Club of Chicago.
 But unlike other Democratic proposals, the idea of a government-funded mortgage buyout has considerable support among banks and mortgage lenders. Lobbyists for the mortgage bankers have circulated a detailed proposal, though company executives said they were merely providing ''technical information'' requested by Democratic lawmakers. 
 Stephen O'Connor, chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, which fought intensely to prevent bankruptcy judges from having the power to change mortgage terms, said this week that the administration and Congress should have a ''conversation'' about mortgage buyout proposals.

HEADLINE: Report to Senators Says Many States Are Lax in Funding Their Pension Plans

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Congressional auditors said Thursday that many states have been failing to set aside enough money for the pensions they owe public workers, and are likely to face fiscal distress, particularly those states that have also promised to help cover retiree health costs.
 The Government Accountability Office looked at a sample of about 70 public retirement systems at the request of Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman and ranking Republican member of the Finance Committee, respectively. The request was somewhat unusual, because Congress has little authority over the way states handle their pension funds. 
 The two senators said they wanted to step up their monitoring of public pensions because they knew that if anything went wrong, Washington would probably be asked to help. 
 ''We don't want a fund collapsing and looking to the federal government for a bailout,'' Senator Baucus said. 
 He said he was heartened to learn that many state pension funds were, in fact, staying on top of their obligations, but he found the state of public retiree health plans ''troubling.''
 State and local governments are not covered by a federal law that dictates how employers must handle retirement plans. Instead, governments typically hire an actuary, who sets up a detailed funding program. Then, each year, the actuary calculates a required contribution. 
 As long as the actuary's assumptions are realistic, and the government makes the required annual contributions, the plan will succeed -- all the benefits will be paid for by the generation of taxpayers who received those workers' services. 
 But the G.A.O. noted that there was heated debate over the validity of the assumptions of public pension actuaries, especially those concerning future investment returns. Even as that debate goes on, there is little question about whether states are following their actuaries' instructions on contributions -- about half are setting aside less than their required yearly amounts, the G.A.O. reported. The auditors warned that this would force future generations to pay for the government services being performed today.
 The report did not identify which states were flouting the instructions of their actuaries, but public records suggest that one of the worst offenders has been New Jersey, where the state pension fund has been shortchanged since the early 1990s. By now, New Jersey is so far behind that Gov. Jon S. Corzine is finding it difficult to catch up. 
 Records show that other states that have been failing to contribute what their actuaries said was required include Illinois, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. 
 The G.A.O. said it had interviewed state officials and learned that some were falling behind because they did not have enough money, and others because they did not consider pension contributions a priority. There are few ways to force derelict states to put in the required amounts, because federal law does not apply. When companies shortchange their pension funds, by contrast, regulators can impose harsh penalties. 
 In some states, including California and New York, public employees have successfully sued to force governors and legislatures to appropriate the required amounts. In other states, among them New Jersey, such lawsuits have failed. 
 Taxpayers, meanwhile, tend to be unaware of the problem -- though they are ultimately on the hook -- because pension funds are shrouded in jargon, and politicians often play down the risks of skipping contributions. When the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey sharply reduced pension contributions in 1994, officials announced with fanfare that they were running the fund in a more businesslike way. 
 The G.A.O. reported that no state pension funds are about to run out of cash. But it warned of a looming problem in some places, where states have also promised to provide health care benefits for retirees. 
 Unlike pensions, which are funded in advance, health care for retired public workers is generally handled on a pay-as-you-go basis. Rather than setting aside money, most states simply pay whatever it costs to provide that year's worth of care. 
 At the moment, the G.A.O. said, the cash outlays for retiree health care are smaller than each year's required pension contributions. But with health costs rising much faster than the general inflation rate, the G.A.O. predicted that health costs could start to snowball, causing ''daunting fiscal challenges.'' 

GRAPHIC: GRAPH: UNDERFUNDED PUBLIC PENSIONS: The Government Accountability Office reviewed the funded level of about 70 public pension plans. A growing number were less than 80 percent funded, which many authorities consider the minimum. The 80 percent means that for every $100 of benefits owed, the plan has $80 on hand. The G.A.O. also found that only about half of the public pensions it reviewed were receiving their full annual contributions, as calculated by the plans' own actuaries.

HEADLINE: Albany Suspends Sale Of Block at Javits Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Spitzer administration said on Thursday that it was suspending a plan -- opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and trade show officials -- to sell an entire city block owned by the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 The block in question, between 39th and 40th Streets, from 11th to 12th Avenue, had been part of a long-stalled, $1.8 billion expansion program for the Javits Center. Its sale would have precluded any possibility of expanding the complex, and, critics said, doomed the trade show industry in the city. 
 Instead, state officials said on Thursday, a task force of city officials; the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn; state legislative leaders; and hotel and tourism executives is to address the future of the convention and trade show industries. 
 The Spitzer administration spent 13 months reviewing the expansion plan before it abruptly announced in January that it was killing the proposal and selling the parcel, at the north end of the Javits Center, as well as a second one at the south end of the center, between 33rd and 34th Streets, to plug gaps in the state budget. State officials said they would spend $1.6 billion to renovate the Javits Center and add a small amount of meeting and exhibition space.
 The Spitzer administration's announcement came during a public hearing on the state's plans for the convention center; it was held in Lower Manhattan by State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and the chairman of the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions. 
 ''We have made commitments to the city to temporarily suspend efforts to sell the northern parcel until an agreement can be worked out with the mayor and the City Council speaker,'' Patrick J. Foye, co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said at the hearing. 
 ''We are committed to working with our partners in government on a task force to evaluate what needs the convention industry will face in the future, identify potential locations for a more modern convention center, and determine how such a project can be funded,'' Mr. Foye said. ''We need to responsibly prepare for the future, and look forward to envisioning an appropriate site for a real world-class convention center in New York City.''
 The state's plan to sell the northern parcel came under fire from Mr. Bloomberg, Ms. Quinn and trade show and tourism executives as shortsighted. Some trade show producers said the state's plans for the Javits Center would lead to a reduction in business. Ms. Quinn said on Thursday that the governor's move to suspend the sale was a very big step forward.
 The Spitzer administration is proceeding with the sale of the development rights of the southern parcel. Over all, the once-ambitious goal of a major expansion has shrunk to a plan for renovation.
 The Spitzer administration had expected to reap as much as $900 million from the sale of development rights for the two parcels. At the time, state officials said $25 million from the proceeds would go to the development of Governors Island, $20 million for Hudson River Park, and $300 million for downstate housing. The remainder, they said, would be devoted to transportation projects, including the extension of the No. 7 subway line to the West Side of Manhattan.
 The newly convened task force will consider, among other things, whether simply to renovate the Javits Center and later build a new convention hall near Shea Stadium in Queens. Some economists, however, contend that the cost of building a new convention hall would exceed the value of additional hotel and restaurant bookings, especially in a city like New York, where the hotel industry already enjoys record-breaking occupancy rates.
 The Partnership for New York City, a business group, came out on Thursday in favor of the Spitzer administration's plan for the renovation of the Javits Center and a very modest expansion.
 Testifying at the hearing on Thursday, Kathryn Wylde, president of the partnership, noted that that the growth in convention space nationally had left many supersize convention centers ''underutilized.''
 ''New York's airports, hotels and tourist attractions are already experiencing near-capacity crowds without the expansion of Javits,'' she said. ''Scarce public funds might be better invested in the development of hotel, conventions and conference facilities in other boroughs, where private development would not otherwise happen.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Embrace Of Musharraf Irks Pakistanis

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE; Jane Perlez and Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's continued backing of President Pervez Musharraf, despite the overwhelming rejection of his party by voters this month, is fueling a new level of frustration in Pakistan with the United States. 
 That support has rankled the public, politicians and journalists here, inciting deep anger at what is perceived as American meddling and the refusal of Washington to embrace the new, democratically elected government. John D. Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state, said Thursday during a Senate panel hearing that the United States would maintain its close ties to Mr. Musharraf.
 Pakistanis say the Bush administration is grossly misjudging the political mood in Pakistan and squandering an opportunity to win support from the Pakistani public for its fight against terrorism. The opposition parties that won the Feb. 18 parliamentary elections say they are moderate and pro-American. By working with them, analysts say, Washington could gain a vital, new ally. 
 The American insistence that Mr. Musharraf play a significant role, they say, will only draw out a power struggle with the president and distract the new government from pushing ahead with alternatives to Mr. Musharraf's policies on the economy and terrorism, which are widely viewed here as having failed. 
 ''I've never seen such an irrational, impractical move on the part of the United States,'' said Rasul Baksh Rais, a political scientist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. ''The whole country has voted against Musharraf. This was a referendum against Musharraf.''
 Over the last week, more than a dozen editorials and commentaries have appeared in Pakistan's leading newspapers accusing the United States of ''meddling'' in the country's affairs. Many have taken particular umbrage at statements by President Bush and other senior officials praising Mr. Musharraf, despite his lack of support among voters.
 A series of postelection meetings between American Embassy officials and Asif Ali Zardari, the head of the victorious Pakistan Peoples Party, have also been criticized. 
 American officials have met three times with Mr. Zardari since the election. They have met twice with Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister whose own opposition party won the second most seats in Parliament.
 In the meetings, American officials urged both leaders to work with moderate forces and Mr. Musharraf, according to officials from the two parties and the United States. It is the insistence to include Mr. Musharraf that rankles Pakistanis.
 American officials said the meetings were routine. ''This is standard diplomacy,'' said an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 But Pakistani observers called the request that the parties work with Mr. Musharraf inappropriate, given his sweeping defeat. Typical of the outrage was an editorial published Sunday by The News, an English-language newspaper, with the headline ''Hands Off, Please!'' 
 ''No further efforts must be made to intervene in the democratic process in Pakistan,'' the editorial read. ''The man who the U.S. continues to back has in many ways become a central part of Pakistan's problems.''
 A senior American official in Washington acknowledged that there was worry within the Bush administration about being seen as meddling. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, conceded that American attempts last year to construct a power-sharing deal between Mr. Musharraf and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ''didn't really work out quite as we'd hoped.'' Differences remained between the president and Ms. Bhutto, who was killed Dec. 27. 
 ''The last thing we need is to be seen by the Pakistanis as interfering again,'' he said.
 But while American officials have sought to portray the United States as neutral, their statements underscore that Mr. Musharraf remains at the center of the United States policy here.
 On Monday, Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman, said President Bush continued to support Mr. Musharraf for ''all of the work that he's done to help us in counterterrorism.''
 ''Now it will be up to the people of Pakistan to see what their new government will look like,'' she said. ''But the president does certainly support him.''
 During his Senate hearing on Thursday, Mr. Negroponte said, ''I think we would, as a general proposition, urge that the moderate political forces work together, and of course President Musharraf is still the president of his country, and we look forward to continuing to work well with him as well.''
 Mr. Negroponte refused to call for the reinstatement of the judges dismissed last year by Mr. Musharraf when he imposed emergency rule. ''We have been silent on this subject,'' he said. Then he added, ''to the best of my knowledge.''
 That silence by American officials has led Pakistanis to accuse the United States of ignoring the will of voters, analysts say. The issue fueled anger against Mr. Musharraf and the protest vote against him. 
 In Pakistan, each American statement has been dissected in the media and widely perceived as overt American pressure. 
 In an editorial on Monday, the Daily Business Recorder, a leading English-language newspaper, criticized a call Mr. Bush made to Mr. Musharraf after learning of what it called his allies' ''electoral debacle.'' It also cited Richard A. Boucher, an assistant secretary of state, as saying after the election that Mr. Musharraf ''remains important to Washington.''
 Mr. Bush and other administration officials still regard Mr. Musharraf as a significant player and as a force for stability in Pakistan, and one who could regain his standing, said an official involved in the policy deliberations.
 The official said that American officials were waiting to see if the opposition could form the two-thirds majority needed to render Mr. Musharraf a powerless, ceremonial president, or even impeach him. The Americans recognize that the opposition parties have long feuded and think they could fail to unite.
 ''Musharraf still thinks he has options, which he does,'' said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''The administration thinks so as well, but only so long as he does not overplay his hand.''
 Over the last year, American assessments have repeatedly proven wrong. Before the Feb. 18 elections, a senior American intelligence official predicted in a briefing to journalists that no party would win a clear majority and that Mr. Musharraf would remain the strongest political figure in the country. 
 Wamiq Zuberi, chief editor of the Daily Business Recorder, said Washington ''obviously doesn't have the correct appreciation of the environment here.'' He and others said the American backing for Mr. Musharraf had generated consternation among analysts who believe that Mr. Musharraf is not only deeply unpopular but also that he has performed poorly of late in the campaign against terrorism, polarizing Pakistan and striking a series of truces with militants. 
 ''I've followed this for years, and I've never seen it so clear, apparent and continuous,'' Nasim Zehra, a Pakistani analyst and writer, said of what she considered the American interference. ''It's not surprising, given the mindset in Washington.''
 Central to the Bush administration's support is the feeling that Mr. Musharraf retains the loyalty of the Pakistani Army, even though he stepped down as army chief in December. Current and former administration officials say they fear that withdrawing American support from Mr. Musharraf would alienate Pakistan's military, country's most powerful institution.
 ''He is still valuable for his relationship with the army,'' said Daniel Markey, who helped coordinate Pakistan policy in the State Department from 2003 to 2007. ''He is someone who the United States should work with -- and will work with -- for fear of alienating that important partner.''
 Western military officials say Pakistan's armed forces -- Mr. Musharraf's last potential bastion of support -- have shifted loyalty to his chosen successor, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. 
 And they say General Kayani will choose stability over saving Mr. Musharraf. ''If Kayani and Musharraf were diametrically opposed,'' said a Western military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, ''I think Kayani would prevail.''
 Ms. Zehra, the analyst, said that General Kayani had distanced himself from Mr. Musharraf by issuing a surprise order in January barring all officers from holding government posts or engaging in politics. 
 The move effectively prevented Mr. Musharraf from using Pakistan's military intelligence agencies to manipulate the election. The loyalty of Pakistan's military is irrevocably shifting behind General Kayani, she said. ''The army will be led by its chief always,'' she said. ''The former chief is always the former chief.''

HEADLINE: Time and Time Again

 BODY:
The Bush administration has tried repeatedly to kill or shortchange government surveys. Motivated in part by pound foolishness, but also by a disdain for information that might upset partisan or ideological agendas, the attempts have had mixed results. Taken together, however, they amount to an assault on reliable data that's necessary to judge the effectiveness of existing government programs and the need for new ones. 
 The most recent example of this siege is in President Bush's latest budget, a proposal to eliminate the American Time Use Survey, the only government survey that tracks how Americans spend their time outside work. Initiated in 2003, the survey serves as a gauge of the usefulness of government policies, as well as a tool for identifying needs and challenges that confront both government and business. 
 How much time do people spend commuting, and what does that tell us about the need for transportation alternatives or flexible work schedules? 
 Do parents spend enough time reading to their children, and if not, what can be done to encourage them and to expose more children to books?
 Does the time adults spend caring for elderly relatives warrant more help from the government and private sector? 
 How much time do teenagers spend on homework versus video games? More homework, anyone? 
 The time-use survey can illuminate current debates, as well as broad issues. Soon, Congress is likely to debate whether to extend the duration of unemployment benefits. Democrats tend to favor extensions. Republicans are likelier to argue that extensions foster laziness. Using the time-use data, researchers are learning how unemployed people actually spend their time and how government benefits affect the job-search process. 
 Time-use data are also needed to develop an accurate picture of the economy. The National Academy of Sciences and many economists acknowledge that today's economic statistics -- basically, measures of consumption and investments in assets -- are incomplete. In a global economy, investment in people is also essential, and to measure that, how people spend their time is as important as how they spend their money. 
 The American Time Use Survey is smart and, and at $4.3 million a year, affordable. Getting rid of it would be a step backward. In the days and weeks to come, as committees in Congress weigh in on the next budget, funding for the survey must be restored.

HEADLINE: After Enron, Surprises Still Lurk

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Should we blame the accountants?
 Surprises multiplied as the subprime problem of 2007 grew into the credit disruption of 2008. It is one thing to have a bank report losses because some of the loans on its balance sheet went bad. That is part of the business of banking. It is something else, however, for a bank to report a multibillion-dollar loss from taking some risk that had never been mentioned in its financial statements.
 Haven't we seen this movie before, involving a company called Enron? Didn't Congress pass a law requiring that the problem of off-balance-sheet mysteries be solved? 
 ''After Enron, with Sarbanes-Oxley, we tried legislatively to make it clear that there has to be some transparency with regard to off-balance-sheet entities,'' Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee, said this week. ''We thought that was already corrected and the rules were clear and we would not be discovering new things every day.''
 Senator Reed has sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets United States accounting rules, and the International Accounting Standards Board, which does the same for most of the rest of the world, asking detailed questions about what went wrong and how it should be fixed. Getting together answers to his questions could provide the S.E.C. with a road map to determine where the rules failed, as well as where companies failed to apply the rules properly. 
 One rule that needs scrutiny now -- called 46-R -- was passed after Enron. Essentially, it says companies can keep ''variable special purpose entities'' off their balance sheets if they conclude that the bulk of the rewards, and risks, lie with others.
 But companies are supposed to evaluate those estimates regularly, and change the accounting if the conclusions change. A risk that seemed remote last year can seem all too real now, and that explains a lot of the surprising write-offs. 
 Suddenly, losses are booked. Investors learn that a company has taken a risk only after the risk has gone bad.
 That should not happen. The rules require that companies make some disclosures about off-balance-sheet vehicles even if they do not put them on their financial statements. They should discuss factors like the nature of the risk they face and the maximum loss that is possible.
 But those disclosures have often not been made, or have been made in such a general way as to be meaningless. The S.E.C., and perhaps the Congress, should ask some companies to explain their earlier lack of disclosures.
 They will hear that companies thought the amounts involved were unimportant -- ''not material'' in the jargon of accounting. They may find out that some managements did not understand all the risks that were being taken. And they may find that some companies failed to disclose risks that they should have disclosed.
 The 2007 annual report of the State Street Corporation, a Boston bank, is a model of what disclosures should be, in laying out the risks of some special purpose entities it set up to hold assets. Those entities, known as conduits, borrowed money to pay for the assets, with State Street promising to come up with the cash if the conduits could not find other lenders.
 In the report, State Street explains why it has not taken any write-off on those conduits, which contain $28.8 billion in what the bank believes to be high-quality assets. 
 It can avoid consolidation because other investors would suffer the first $32 million of losses -- about one-tenth of 1 percent of the assets. After that, State Street would be on the hook. But State Street says its model indicates defaults on the underlying assets will not cost that much.
 So long as the conduits stay off its balance sheet, State Street does not have to adjust them to reflect the market value of the assets in the conduits. But if State Street ever concludes that defaults are likely to be a little higher -- say $100 million, only three-tenths of a percent of assets -- it will have to put the assets on its balance sheet. And if it does that, it will have to write them down to market value.
 At the end of last year, State Street estimates that market value was about $850 million below face value. Had it been forced to consolidate the conduits, that loss would have been posted, leaving a write-down of about $530 million after taxes. About 40 percent of the bank's 2007 profits would have vanished.
 As those assets eventually came due, State Street might have been able to recoup some or all of those losses if there were few defaults. But that could happen years later.
 The basic strategy with these conduits was to borrow at lower short-term commercial paper rates and lend at higher long-term rates. That has long been one way banks make money, and sometimes lose it if credit markets move in the wrong direction. 
 This accounting rule let those risks vanish from the balance sheet because somebody else would suffer the first one-tenth of 1 percent of losses if any of the securities went bad. A rule that allows that to happen needs revision.
 At least State Street investors now know about those risks, and have an explanation of why State Street thinks the market value of those assets is unreasonably low. Investors in many other banks, including some that have taken big write-offs, know much less about the risks those banks face.
 There are many other issues in bank accounting, some stemming from the nature of market value estimates. JPMorgan Chase pointed out this week that it has taken reserves of 4.9 percent against the value of the leveraged loans on its books -- twice that of some of its competitors. Maybe that means JPMorgan's loans are not as good, but maybe it means that other banks are simply using more optimistic estimates. In a market where there are observable market values, the S.E.C. might want to ask how such disparities come to exist.
 There are no perfect accounting rules, and forcing banks to consolidate everything might be unreasonable. But banks should have done more to let investors know the nature of the risks that were being taken. If the accountants had forced better disclosures, it is at least possible that managements would have spent more time evaluating the risks they were taking, and then made wiser business decisions.

HEADLINE: Viacom Profit Rises 16% On Strong Ad Revenue

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The owner of MTV, Viacom Inc., reported a 16 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings Thursday and said its advertising business had not been hurt by the economic slowdown. 
 The chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, told analysts that the company also benefited from a shift of ad dollars to cable from broadcast during the writers' strike, which sent many prime-time dramas and late-night talk shows into reruns.
 Mr. Dauman said Viacom met its goal of increasing ad revenue in the United States by 7 percent in the quarter, and expected about the same results for the current quarter.
 In the fourth quarter, Viacom earned $559.5 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $480.8 million, or 69 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
 Excluding discontinued operations, the earnings came in at 83 cents a share, in line with the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Fourth-quarter revenue rose 19 percent, to $4.25 billion, from $3.57 billion.
 In addition to MTV, Viacom, owns VH1, Nickelodeon, BET and the Paramount movie and television studio.
 Video games performed well again for Viacom, as ancillary revenue jumped 72 percent, to $460 million in the fourth quarter, largely because of higher royalties from Rock Band and the Guitar Hero series.
 Home video revenue grew 12 percent on the strength of sales of the hits ''Transformers'' and ''Shrek the Third.'' 
 For the year, Viacom earned $1.84 billion, or $2.72 a share, up from $1.59 billion or $2.22 a share in 2006. Revenue rose 18 percent, to $13.42 billion.

HEADLINE: Profit Down at Sears and Kohl's; Gap Gains on Cost-Cutting

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
More evidence of a downturn in consumer spending was apparent Thursday as Sears Holdings and Kohl's reported double-digit drops in fourth-quarter profit.
 Gap, meanwhile, closed out its third consecutive year of declining sales with a 21 percent earnings increase in the period, reflecting gains from cost-cutting that had been prompted by the economic slump, the worst in the company's history.
 ''The consumer is retrenching, and retailing is three steps behind,'' said Patricia Edwards, a retail analyst with Wentworth, Hauser & Violich of San Francisco. ''There is a real tough path that retailing is going to have to tread.'' 
 Gap and Wal-Mart, she said, ''are further down that path.''
 Last week, Wal-Mart Stores reported a 4 percent profit gain in the fourth quarter as its renewed focus on low prices paid off.
 As the retailers reported results, it was clear that a top priority this year will be cutting inventory and other expenses to better manage the downturn in spending downturn. Sears is considering even more drastic measures to turn its business around, possibly letting other stores sell some of its brands.
 In a letter to investors, the chairman, Edward S. Lampert, said Sears might expand locations where its house brands like Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard are sold outside Sears and Kmart stores.
 Mr. Lampert's letter, which was released along with fourth-quarter earnings results, marked a year of disappointing sales at the chain's 3,800 stores and showed how Sears was trying to revive itself even at the risk of losing shoppers to other retailers.
 Profit at the company, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., skidded to $426 million, or $3.17 a share, in the three months ended Feb. 2, down 47 percent from $811 million, or $5.27 a share, in the corresponding period last year.
 Revenue declined to $15.07 billion from $16.18 billion. 
 Kohl's chief executive, R. Lawrence Montgomery, called the retail environment ''difficult'' and said fourth-quarter profit fell about 15 percent as shoppers continued to pull back on their spending.
 The department store chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., said it earned $411.7 million, or $1.31 a share, in the quarter, compared with $484.6 million, or $1.48 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial has forecast earnings of $1.30 a share.
 Gap, which is in the midst of a companywide restructuring under its new chief executive, Glenn K. Murphy, said it earned $265 million, or 35 cents a share, up from $219 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Revenue totaled $4.68 billion, a 5 percent drop from $4.92 billion the previous year. 
 Although Gap's sales are still declining, tighter controls on spending and clothing inventory have helped lift profits in each of the last two quarters.
 In an effort to placate investors while the new management team seeks to engineer a turnaround, Gap announced plans to spend $1 billion buying back its stock and raised its quarterly dividend 6 percent, to 34 cents a share.
 Kohl's and Gap released their results after the stock closed. Gap's shares surged $1, or 5.1 percent, in extended trading after dropping 42 cents, to end the regular session at $19.45. Kohl's stock fell $1.65 in regular trading, and then 35 cents more after hours, to $44.89
 Sears shares fell 20 cents, to $101.40, and were unchanged after hours.

HEADLINE: Movie Review : Beyond Belief

BYLINE: By MATT ZOLLER SEITZ

 BODY:
This documentary feature by Beth Murphy follows Susan Retik and Patti Quigley, 9/11 widows from suburban Boston, as they try to raise money to help war widows in Afghanistan. 
 Their rationale: Afghan poverty is a major reason the Taliban government built a symbiotic relationship with Al Qaeda; therefore, raising Afghan families' standard of living might reduce the possibility of future attacks.
To this end, Ms. Retik and Ms. Quigley embarked on a fund-raising bike ride from ground zero to Boston just before the third anniversary of 9/11, then followed up by visiting Afghanistan: a trip that affirmed their empathy for Afghan war widows and revealed the enormity of the economic gap between their country and ours.
 Was the sentiment of these widows naive? Some of the police and military personnel to whom they describe their plan seem inclined to think so, and stray quotations from Afghan widows suggest that some Afghans don't know about Al Qaeda and the Taliban's connection to 9/11 or choose not to believe it. 
 Throughout, Ms. Murphy hangs back, privileging no political viewpoint but respecting the emotions of all who pass before her lens -- particularly Ms. Retik and Ms. Quigley, who were both pregnant when their husbands, David Retik and Patrick Quigley, died, and who still struggle to maintain their composure when reminiscing about them. 
 BEYOND BELIEF
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Produced and directed by Beth Murphy; directors of photography, Kevin Belli and Sean Flynn; edited by Mr. Belli and Ms. Murphy; music by Evren Celimli; released by the Film Sales Company. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes. This film is not rated.
