HEADLINE: Electronic Arts Posts Decline In Revenue

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, reported lower revenue for the third quarter on Wednesday as the video game industry continued to struggle with flagging sales in a weak holiday quarter. 
Electronic Arts' revenue fell amid an ''extremely soft'' console game business as the industry waited for new versions of Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox to increase software sales, said Blake Jorgensen, the chief financial officer.
''Also just a soft economy in Europe and America, that in combination with a weak title in 'Medal of Honor' dragged down our revenue for the quarter below what we thought it would be,'' Mr. Jorgensen said.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company posted net revenue of $922 million, compared with $1.06 billion a year earlier. It reported a net loss of $45 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $205 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
Adjusted revenue fell 28.5 percent, to $1.18 billion, short of analyst estimates of $1.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents were slightly above Wall Street's expectation of 56 cents.
Shares of Electronic Arts, which is based in Redwood City. Calif., were down in after-hours trading after closing up 0.9 percent at $15.08.

HEADLINE: Syria's Kurds Look to Iraqi Minority for Support

BYLINE: By BEN GITTLESON

 BODY:
ERBIL, IRAQ -- As war rages across the border in Syria, the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq has emerged as a lead backer of Syrian Kurds , hoping another empowered Kurdish entity like itself will emerge should the Syrian regime fall.
Iraqi Kurdistan's embrace of the Syrian Kurdish cause has expanded its regional clout and may promote the Kurdish nationalist credentials of its president, Massoud Barzani, among the millions of Kurds spread across Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. 
Iraqi Kurdistan has given humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish refugees, played host to leading Syrian Kurdish political groups, and trained hundreds of Kurdish defectors from the Syrian Army.
Northeast Syria, where many Kurds live, has stayed largely quiet compared with the rest of the country. With the Syrian Army busy in other parts of the country, Kurdish groups have taken over security in parts of the region. The crisis presents a historic opportunity for Syria's 2 million Kurds, who have long suffered state-sponsored discrimination. Syria's Kurds live near the Iraqi and Turkish borders and in major cities across the country.
The leaders of Iraqi Kurdistan, which in the last decade has gained an unprecedented amount of autonomy from Baghdad, hope Syrians will emulate what they see as their success with federalism. The northern Iraqi region boasts its own security force, social services and diplomatic missions around the world, though tensions with the central Iraqi government remain high over oil, territory and security disputes.
''We want the Kurds to have a role in formulating a future Syria,'' said Hamid Darbandi, a deputy minister in charge of the Syria portfolio for Kurdistan's president. While Syrian Kurdish leaders say the Iraqi Kurds have not pressured them to choose a certain system of governing, the Kurdish Regional Government has made clear it favors applying its own experience to Syria. Federalism gives Syrians ''the opportunity to stay together,'' Mr. Darbandi said.
With scars of inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq still fresh and signs of the same emerging in Syria, in July Mr. Barzani pushed for the formation of the Supreme Kurdish Committee, a power-sharing body that consists of the two leading Syrian Kurdish political groups. In doing so, Mr. Barzani raised Turkey's ire by accepting the participation of the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., a Syrian Kurdish group affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, the P.K.K. For decades the P.K.K. has waged an insurgency against Turkey, which along with the United States and European Union considers it a terrorist organization.
The P.Y.D. holds the most military clout and popular support on the ground, analysts say, and Mr. Barzani showed pragmatism in bringing it to the table even though his party's views align more with the other half of the Supreme Kurdish Committee, a coalition of groups known as the Kurdistan National Council, or K.N.C.
Over the last several years, Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan have built flourishing economic and diplomatic relations, despite Turkey's strained relations with its own large Kurdish population. Energy-starved Turkey aims to benefit from an oil boom in Kurdistan, while the Kurdish Regional Government has used trade with Turkey to increase its economic independence from Baghdad.
''We hope that those relations, economic relations, won't affect the politics or relations between southern Kurdistan and western Kurdistan,'' said the P.Y.D.'s leader, Salih Muslim, referring to Iraqi Kurdistan and northeast Syria. ''Until now, we haven't seen anything.''
While both Turkey and Kurdistan back the Syrian opposition, they see different endgames for the Syrian Kurds, with Turkey worried that autonomy for Syrian Kurds might inspire a push for autonomy among its Kurdish population, analysts say.
The K.N.C. supports a federal system for Syria, while the P.Y.D. calls that idea unfeasible since the country's many ethnic groups are geographically mixed. Both parties praise Mr. Barzani's leadership.
''He's helping us politically. Wherever he goes, he says the Kurds in Syria have their own rights,'' Abdul Hakim Bachar, secretary of the Syrian affiliate of Mr. Barzani's party, a member of the K.N.C., said in his office in Erbil. ''Wherever he has negotiations with other countries, a part of what he says is about the Syrian Kurds.''
Turkey's and Kurdistan's shared embrace of the Syrian Kurds runs afoul of Tehran and Baghdad, who have backed the ruling Syrian regime to different degrees. The Syrian Kurdish issue has further strained already tense relations between the Iraqi central government and Kurdistan.
As regional powers jockey for influence among the Syrian Kurds, though, deep distrust persists between Syrian Kurdish political leaders, and the extent of their influence on the ground is dubious as they try prevent potential clashes between Arabs and Kurds.
Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdistan is grappling with a flood of refugees that could soon overwhelm the Kurdish Regional Government and international groups providing aid to refugees.
Nearly 80,000 Syrians have fled to Iraq, the vast majority Syrian Kurds; most live in a refugee camp near the border. The regional government has allocated millions of dollars in aid to the refugees and allowed them freedom of movement and access to jobs.
A sense of kinship with fellow Kurdish ''brothers and sisters'' has compelled the Iraqi Kurds to offer aid and has opened their communities to refugees at the risk of upsetting the social balance.
To try to slow the daily flow of hundreds of refugees into Kurdistan, in recent weeks the Kurdish Regional Government started sending food and fuel across the border into Syria. While aid workers said the regional government's support is not ostensibly politicized, refugees in Kurdistan praised Mr. Barzani as a role model.
Farhan Hassan Mahmoud, a Syrian Kurd who fled to Iraq three months ago, last week watched volunteers from a local refugee-aid group unload donations in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Erbil, home to a recent influx of Syrian refugees. Volunteers distributed bags of winter clothes, blankets and food in front of the local office of Mr. Barzani's party.
''We thank President Barzani andJalal Talabani,'' the Kurdish president of Iraq, said Mr. Mahmoud, who like many Kurds born in Syria has been deprived of citizenship by the Syrian government.
Mr. Barzani is setting an example for Kurdish-majority areas in Syria, Mr. Mahmoud added. ''God willing,'' he said, ''they will become like Iraqi Kurdistan.''

HEADLINE: Proud South Korea Launches Satellite Into Orbit for First Time

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea succeeded in thrusting a satellite into orbit for the first time on Wednesday, joining an elite club of space technology leaders seven weeks after the successful launching of a satellite by its rival, North Korea. 
South Korea has attached an intense national pride to the 140-ton, 108-foot-tall Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or KSLV-1, which was built with the help of Russian technology. Feeling behind China and Japan, both of which have successful space programs, South Korea has sought a technological prowess of its own.
That task gained more urgency after North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Dec. 12 that put a satellite into orbit, after earlier failures. Only a handful of countries have succeeded in independently launching satellites into orbit, with Iran also recently joining the club. After studying the debris of the North Korean rocket, which splashed into South Korean waters, officials here determined that North Korea, despite its backward economy, had built key parts of its rocket.
With all major South Korean television stations broadcasting live, the two-stage rocket blasted off from the newly built Naro Space Center in Goheung, 200 miles south of Seoul.
''After analyzing the data, we determined that our satellite entered its intended orbit,'' Lee Ju-ho, the minister of education, science and technology, said during a nationally televised news conference. ''Today, we took a leap toward becoming a power in space technology.''
Although part of the two-stage rocket was built by the Russians, South Korea sees the successful launching as having given it an important toehold in space technology, the latest high-tech market where the country has decided to become a player.
The successful launching comes at a delicate time on the Korean Peninsula, as North Korea, stung by new international sanctions over its own rocket launching, has promised a nuclear test. The United Nations has banned North Korea, which has an active nuclear arms program, from ballistic missile tests; the West considers the launching a test of that technology.
South Korea previously fired a KSLV-1 rocket twice from Goheung, first in 2009 and again in 2010, but each time, the rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit. This was the third effort, initially scheduled for October, but it had been twice delayed at the last minute because of technical glitches.
For years, South Korea's space ambitions have languished under the constraints of agreements with the United States, which feared that a robust rocket program might be transferred to the building of missiles and help accelerate a regional arms race.

HEADLINE: Edward M. Kresky, 88; Calmed Fiscal Panic

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Edward M. Kresky, an investment banker who was an architect of the debt refinancing plan that saved New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on Jan. 23 at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
The cause was heart disease, his wife, Mary, said.
Mr. Kresky, a former aide to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, was among the first appointments made in June 1975 to the newly formed Municipal Assistance Corporation, a money-borrowing state authority cobbled together that spring by the Legislature and Gov. Hugh L. Carey to calm a spreading, and mostly justified, panic in the financial markets about the city's solvency. 
The new corporation, which would soon be known as ''Big Mac,'' was authorized to borrow billions of dollars to pay the city's short-term debts, keep services going and restructure the financial burden it had accumulated over decades. In hopes of quelling the panic, the state packed the board with financiers of the highest standing on Wall Street. Further reassurance came in the form of a novel financing proposal made by Mr. Kresky.
The plan was to sell bonds on the tax-free municipal bond market, even though investors were risk-averse by nature and repelled by the city's crisis. Mr. Kresky, who headed the municipal bond department at his banking firm, Wertheim & Company, became the M.A.C.'s unofficial ambassador to those most important, and skittish, of Big Mac's customers.
At Mr. Kresky's suggestion, the M.A.C. secured its loans, and overcame market fears, with a guarantee considered fairly unusual at the time: M.A.C. bondholders were promised that city sales tax revenues would be used to pay them first, before any other city expense was addressed. Eugene J. Keilin, the authority's executive director in the 1970s and '80s, said Mr. Kresky had seen the strategy applied successfully in other municipal crises, though not in one of such magnitude.
Serving on the board for 12 years, the last eight as vice chairman of the M.A.C., under Felix G. Rohatyn, Mr. Kresky was also a kind of point man in the state capital, drawing on his experience there under Governor Rockefeller as he negotiated for legislation to keep the M.A.C. afloat, said Mr. Keilin.
By 1987, when Mr. Kresky resigned from the M.A.C., the authority had sold more than $4 billion in bonds. The city was on the mend, though Big Mac would borrow a total of $10 billion before it was shuttered in 2008.
''They were a brain trust, the most intelligent finance minds of their time,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University who has studied the history of the M.A.C. ''When they were appointed, remember, the term 'investment banker' carried an aura of great integrity and respect.''
Edward Mordecai Kresky was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 15, 1924, one of three sons of Henry and Celia Kresky. His father was a physician. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, he attended Cornell University, but left to serve with the Army in Europe, as an infantryman during World War II. He later completed his course work for a bachelor's degree at Cornell and received his Ph.D. in political science at New York University in the 1950s.
Mr. Kresky was twice a deputy to William J. Ronan, the former dean of the graduate school of public administration at N.Y.U.: first when Mr. Ronan was named Governor Rockefeller's chief of staff in 1959, and later when Mr. Ronan was made chairman of the agency that was a precursor of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Mr. Kresky is survived by his wife, who worked in the Rockefeller administration as an intergovernmental assistant; their daughters, Ann Banegas and Susan Gallwey; and five grandchildren.
Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services under President Bill Clinton and now president of the University of Miami, served with Mr. Kresky on the M.A.C. board in the 1970s, while she was teaching political science at Columbia University. Like many of the others on the board, she said, Mr. Kresky was defined by his generation.
''They were all from a generation of financial leaders who grew up in New York,'' Ms. Shalala said. ''In the crisis, the reason they were able to calm the rest of the financial community wasn't just their expertise. It was because they clearly loved the city. They had a real passion for it. They were going to save it.''

HEADLINE: Meet The Champs

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
You see America and its education system in all their glorious, exhilarating, crushing, infuriating contradictions in our national high school chess champion team.
Chess tends to be the domain of privileged schools whose star players have had their own personal chess coaches since elementary school. Yet the national champion team comes from a high-poverty, inner-city school, and four-fifths of its members are black or Hispanic.
More astounding, these aren't even high school kids yet. In April, New York's Intermediate School 318 in Brooklyn, where 70 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, became the first middle school team ever to defeat kids about four years older and win the national high school championship. 
The champs are kids like Carlos Tapia, a Mexican-American in the eighth grade, whose dad is a house painter and mom a maid. The parents can't play chess and can't afford to give Carlos his own room, but they proudly make space for his 18 chess trophies.
''Chess teaches me self-control'' that spills over into other schoolwork, Carlos said in the I.S. 318 chess room, as a rainbow of students hunched over their boards, brows furrowed.
This will be my last column for a number of months, as I'm taking a leave to work on a new book with my wife. So I asked my Twitter followers what they'd like me to write about in this column, and one suggested I address: How do you do your job without getting incredibly depressed?
I promise, I'm not the Eeyore of journalists. The truth is that covering inequality, injustice and poverty can actually be inspiring and uplifting because of kids like Carlos. Just sprinkle opportunity around, and dazzling talents turn up.
This isn't about chess. It's about investing in kids in ways that transform their trajectories forever. The returns on capital would make Wall Street jealous.
Take Rochelle Ballantyne, who was raised by a single mom from Trinidad and soared on the I.S. 318 chess team. Rochelle, now 17 and aiming to become the first African-American woman to become a chess master, has won a full scholarship to Stanford University. She's planning to attend even though she has never visited the campus.
''We were meant to break stereotypes,'' Rochelle told me. ''Chess isn't something people are good at because of the color of their skin. We just really work very hard at it.''
That seems to be the secret. A part-time chess tutor named Elizabeth Spiegel arrived at I.S. 318 in 1999 and parlayed a tiny budget into a team that drills tirelessly. A dynamic, passionate teacher who volunteered much of her time, she nurtured a team that since 2000 has won more middle school championships than any other in the country.
One way of assessing what she has accomplished: Based on estimated chess ratings, Albert Einstein would rank third on the I.S. 318 team.
I wish the column could end on this triumphant note. But if these extraordinary kids are a reminder of what can happen when we invest in creating opportunity, they are also a reminder that budget cuts fall disproportionately on the needy.
''Funding for extracurricular activities has dried up,'' said John Galvin, an assistant principal who oversees the 95-member chess team. The kids run bake sales, candy sales and walkathons to raise the $50,000 needed to attend tournaments each year, but on trips they sometimes survive on peanut butter.
Galvin has tried approaching corporations and hedge funds for donations but has had little luck. Budget cuts have already trimmed the after-school chess club to three days a week from five.
A moving documentary about the team, ''Brooklyn Castle,'' is scheduled to air on PBS later this year, and that may help with fund-raising.
But similar cutbacks are playing out all across America. In 35 states, inflation-adjusted school financing is below 2008 levels, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As of July, school districts have slashed 328,000 jobs since 2008, and budget cuts have devastated early childhood education that lays the foundation for children's lives.
Affluent kids continue to enjoy nursery school and chess tutors, even as programs for poor kids are eliminated. Education is the best escalator out of poverty, but for too many kids it's creaking to a standstill.
As we make historic fiscal decisions in the coming months, let's not balance budgets by slashing investments in our future. That would be like economizing on heating bills by feeding the front door into the fire.
While on leave, I'll be rooting for kids like Carlos to soar to another national championship -- and far beyond. Given the returns, the question isn't whether we can afford to invest in opportunities for kids but how we can possibly afford not to.

HEADLINE: Weak Economic Report Sends Markets Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A report on growth served as a reminder on Wednesday that the American economy remained a long way from being healed, and it put the brakes on a January rally that pushed stocks close to record levels.
Stocks started the day lower after a report showed that the economy had unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, leading the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest drop of the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,910.42, logging only its second decline in nine days. The S.& P. fell 6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,501.96, its biggest decline since Dec. 28. The Nasdaq composite fell 11 points to 3,142.31. 
The Commerce Department report covered the quarter from October through December, when the economy was hurt by the biggest cut in military spending in 40 years, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles.
The Federal Reserve acknowledged that the economy was still struggling to regain momentum in a statement Wednesday afternoon after its two-day meeting. The Fed said that growth had ''paused in recent months.''
The central bank took no new action and said it would continue spending on bonds as part of its plan to keep borrowing costs low to spur growth.
''The Fed didn't really say anything out of the ordinary, so you got the reaction you should've had in the morning,'' said Joseph Saluzzi, a co-founder of the brokerage firm Themis Trading. ''When you've spent this much money trying to prop up an economy and you still come up with a negative print, that's bad news.''
Still, stocks remain on track for a great January over all.
The Dow Jones average has surged 6.2 percent since the start of the year, climbing close to 14,000 and within touching distance of its record level. The S.& P. 500 has gained 5.3 percent this month, close to its highest level in more than five years. Investors bought stocks after lawmakers reached a deal on taxes and spending and on optimism the American housing market was recovering and the jobs market was slowly getting better.
United States gross domestic product, the volume of all goods and services produced, contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the growth report showed, a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate for the quarter from July through September.
''To ignore this is folly,'' said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. ''Certainly, this market could continue to move forward, but ignoring the fundamentals is not something I'd counsel my clients to do.''
Positive reports of company earnings helped offset the disappointing news about the economy and stemmed a bigger decline on Wednesday.
Amazon jumped $12.41, or 4.8 percent, to $272.76 after the world's biggest online retailer showed improving profit margins when it posted fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday.
Boeing, currently trying to fix battery problems that have grounded its 787 Dreamliner passenger jets, gained 94 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.59 after it reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Rising profits from commercial jets offset a smaller profit from defense work.
A private survey showed Wednesday that United States businesses increased hiring in January compared with a revised December reading. The payroll processor ADP said that employers added 192,000 jobs in January.
Inflation rates were steady. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32 to 96 24/32, and the yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.00 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Nudge for an Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
The newfound urgency among Republicans to improve their standing among Hispanic voters is not the only reason that an immigration policy overhaul may have a better chance this year than in 2007, when Congress last tried to confront the issue and failed.
By some key measures, the problems underlying illegal immigration - the economic and demographic pressures that have drawn Mexicans north for decades in search of jobs and a better life, and the challenges for the United States of securing its borders - have diminished over the past six years. 
The Mexican economy, while still riddled with inefficiency and inequality, is nonetheless humming along, providing many more job opportunities for Mexican workers. And in Mexico, the source of about 6 in 10 illegal immigrants in the United States, the birthrate has plummeted over the last few decades, shrinking the pool of potential emigrants.
"We are at a moment when the underlying drivers of what has been persistent, growing illegal immigration for 40 years have shifted," said Doris Meissner, a commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a research group. "There are some fundamental new realities." At the same time, one of the most contentious elements in previous battles over the issue - border security - has also become less of a partisan flash point. Even among border-state Republicans, there is optimism that the billions of dollars spent in recent years on fences, additional agents, surveillance drones and other measures is having a real effect.
"Yes, there's been improvement in border security, and, yes, it helps a lot," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a leader of the bipartisan group seeking compromise legislation, said when asked whether the politics of getting a deal this time around would be easier because of stepped-up enforcement.
There is still debate about whether the changes are permanent or would be reversed in the event of another sharp economic downturn in Mexico or across Latin America - or a strong rebound in economic growth and demand for labor in the United States.
But for now the population of illegal immigrants in the United States shows little sign of growth. It fell to 11.1 million in 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, from a peak of 12 million in 2007, the Pew Hispanic Center said in a report on Tuesday. By one new estimate, the number of people who managed to cross the Mexican border illegally into the United States fell to 85,000 in 2011, down from 600,000 five years earlier.
With the scale of the problem stabilizing for the moment, or even shrinking, some experts say, there is more room for political compromise than the last time around.
"The immigration debate in recent years, as it has played out in the last two presidential campaigns, has not kept pace with the facts on the ground," said Paul Taylor, the director of the Pew Hispanic Center. "I do sense that the nature of the debate is changing and catching up with the reality."
Mexico's population growth has fallen to an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first decade of this century from 3.2 percent in the 1960s, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The number of people under 15 years old is declining in Mexico, and the number of people ages 15 to 29 will start doing so in the coming years, an important shift given that most illegal immigrants arrive in the United States before age 30.
Children are staying in school longer, an indication of an intention not to emigrate in search of low-skill employment, and the development of a middle class has further depleted the numbers of Mexicans compelled to seek a livelihood in the United States.
The statistics at the border are also striking evidence of a diminished flow of people seeking to cross into the United States illegally. Reflecting in part the deterrent effect of tighter border patrols, as well as the economic and demographic shifts, the number of apprehensions along the border has fallen sharply. Those people who have gotten through are being caught and deported at record-high rates.
Some analysts say the drop in apprehensions reflects not so much greater control of the border as a recognition by potential immigrants that the chances of finding a job in the United States have fallen over the past few years. And in any case the decline does not alter the most compelling fact of the debate to both sides, which is that there are 11 million undocumented people already living in the United States whose status must be addressed in any comprehensive legislation.
But even though the economic and demographic changes have remained largely in the background of the debate, analysts say they could offer more reassurance to conservatives in particular that giving legal status to those immigrants would not simply produce another wave of them.
Still, some skepticism about changes to immigration policy remains. Mexico continues to suffer from social instability, and the prolonged weakness in the American labor market makes it harder to draw long-term conclusions about the relative attraction of coming to the United States. Many Republicans continue to view Mexico warily, seeing in the government's difficulties in controlling the violence and general lawlessness created by drug cartels a dangerous instability that could create deeper cross-border troubles.
"Mexico is on fire and about to blow up," said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a supporter of the bipartisan package, expressing concern about whether the positive trends in illegal immigration were permanent.

HEADLINE: Israel: Tax Revenue to Go to Palestinians

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel has decided to transfer to the Palestinian Authority the tax and customs revenue that Israel collected last month on the authority's behalf, to help ease the authority's economic crisis, a senior Israeli government official said on Wednesday. 
The decision reversed an earlier one to withhold the revenue and use it to offset some of what the Palestinians owe to Israeli utility companies. That step was meant to punish the Palestinians after their successful bid in November to upgrade their status at the United Nations to that of a nonmember observer state.
The Israeli official said the decision to release the blocked money was ''a one-time event'' and was ''not an indication of what Israel might do next month.''
It came after a meeting on Monday between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, who is now a joint Middle East peace envoy for the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia, known as the quartet. In a statement after the meeting, Mr. Blair and Mr. Netanyahu pledged to work on peace and security issues.
Nour Odeh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Authority, said that Palestinian and Israeli officials were scheduled to hold a regular technical meeting on Wednesday where they would calculate the amount of revenue collected and owed. The transfer from Israel was expected to be about $100 million.
The Palestinian Authority, a self-rule body with limited control over parts of the West Bank, has been in a financial crisis for about two years, largely because of a drop in support from donor nations. It has been struggling to pay its 150,000 government workers their full salaries on time, leading to growing restiveness and strikes.
Israel's decision to withhold the revenue after the United Nations move was expected. Arab nations promised to help tide the authority over with additional donations, but those funds have yet to materialize.
Israel has withheld transfers of Palestinian tax revenue at least five times before, sometimes for weeks and in one case, after the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in 2000, for two years. But the latest instance was the first time that Israel said it would use the withheld money to defray Palestinian debts to the Israel Electric Corporation and other Israeli providers without the consent of the authority. Avigdor Lieberman, who was Israel's foreign minister at the time, said in December that it would take four months of withheld tax revenues to clear up the authority's arrears, and he said no money would be released until the debts were paid. Mr. Lieberman has since resigned.
Palestinian leaders responded by calling the Israeli policy ''piracy'' and calling for a boycott of Israeli goods, which seemed to have little impact.
Israel is engaged in a delicate balancing act, since it has no interest in seeing the Palestinian Authority collapse, officials have said. In the weeks before the United Nations action, they said, Israel advanced money to the Palestinian Authority in response to calls for help.

HEADLINE: Law Schools' Applications Fall As Costs Rise and Jobs Are Cut

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
Law school applications are headed for a 30-year low, reflecting increased concern over soaring tuition, crushing student debt and diminishing prospects of lucrative employment upon graduation.
As of this month, there were 30,000 applicants to law schools for the fall, a 20 percent decrease from the same time last year and a 38 percent decline from 2010, according to the Law School Admission Council. Of some 200 law schools nationwide, only 4 have seen increases in applications this year. In 2004 there were 100,000 applicants to law schools; this year there are likely to be 54,000.
Such startling numbers have plunged law school administrations into soul-searching debate about the future of legal education and the profession over all.
''We are going through a revolution in law with a time bomb on our admissions books,'' said William D. Henderson, a professor of law at Indiana University, who has written extensively on the issue. ''Thirty years ago if you were looking to get on the escalator to upward mobility, you went to business or law school. Today, the law school escalator is broken.'' 
Responding to the new environment, schools are planning cutbacks and accepting students they would not have admitted before.
A few schools, like the Vermont Law School, have started layoffs and buyouts of staff. Others, like at the University of Illinois, have offered across-the-board tuition discounts to keep up enrollments. Brian Leiter of the University of Chicago Law School, who runs a blog on the topic, said he expected as many as 10 schools to close over the coming decade, and half to three-quarters of all schools to reduce class size, faculty and staff.
After the normal dropout of some applicants, the number of those matriculating in the fall will be about 38,000, the lowest since 1977, when there were two dozen fewer law schools, according to Brian Z. Tamanaha of Washington University Law School, the author of ''Failing Law Schools.''
The drop in applications is widely viewed as directly linked to perceptions of the declining job market. Many of the reasons that law jobs are disappearing are similar to those for disruptions in other knowledge-based professions, namely the growth of the Internet. Research is faster and easier, requiring fewer lawyers, and is being outsourced to less expensive locales, including West Virginia and overseas.
In addition, legal forms are now available online and require training well below a lawyer's to fill them out.
In recent years there has also been publicity about the debt load and declining job prospects for law graduates, especially of schools that do not generally provide employees to elite firms in major cities. Last spring, the American Bar Association released a study showing that within nine months of graduation in 2011, only 55 percent of those who finished law school found full-time jobs that required passage of the bar exam.
''Students are doing the math,'' said Michelle J. Anderson, dean of the City University of New York School of Law. ''Most law schools are too expensive, the debt coming out is too high and the prospect of attaining a six-figure-income job is limited.''
Mr. Tamanaha of Washington University said the rise in tuition and debt was central to the decrease in applications. In 2001, he said, the average tuition for private law school was $23,000; in 2012 it was $40,500 (for public law schools the figures were $8,500 and $23,600). He said that 90 percent of law students finance their education by taking on debt. And among private law school graduates, the average debt in 2001 was $70,000; in 2011 it was $125,000.
''We have been sharply increasing tuition during a low-inflation period,'' he said of law schools collectively, noting that a year at a New York City law school can run to more than $80,000 including lodging and food. ''And we have been maximizing our revenue. There is no other way to describe it. We will continue to need lawyers, but we need to bring the price down.''
Some argue that the drop is an indictment of the legal training itself -- a failure to keep up with the profession's needs.
''We have a significant mismatch between demand and supply,'' said Gillian K. Hadfield, professor of law and economics at the University of Southern California. ''It's not a problem of producing too many lawyers. Actually, we have an exploding demand for both ordinary folk lawyers and big corporate ones.''
She said that, given the structure of the legal profession, it was hard to make a living dealing with matters like mortgage and divorce, and that big corporations were dissatisfied with what they see as the overly academic training at elite law schools.
The drop in law school applications is unlike what is happening in almost any other graduate or professional training, except perhaps to veterinarians. Medical school applications have been rising steadily for the past decade.
Debra W. Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, said first-time enrollments to master of business degree programs were steady -- a 0.8 percent increase among Americans in 2011 after a decade of substantial growth. But growth in first-time foreign student enrollments -- 13 percent over the same period -- made up the difference, something from which law schools cannot benefit, since foreigners have less interest in American legal training.
In the legal academy, there has been discussion about how to make training less costly and more relevant, with special emphasis on the last year of law school. A number of schools, including elite ones like Stanford, have increased their attention to clinics, where students get hands-on training. Northeastern Law School in Boston, which has long emphasized in-the-field training, has had one of the smallest decreases in its applicant pool this year, according to Jeremy R. Paul, the new dean.
There is also discussion about permitting students to take the bar after only two years rather than three, a decision that would have to be made by the highest officials of a state court system. In New York, the proposal is under active consideration largely because of a desire to reduce student debt.
Some, including Professor Hadfield of the University of Southern California, have called for one- or two-year training programs to create nonlawyer specialists for many tasks currently done by lawyers. Whether or not such changes occur, for now the decline is creating what many see as a cultural shift.
''In the '80s and '90s, a liberal arts graduate who didn't know what to do went to law school,'' Professor Henderson of Indiana said. ''Now you get $120,000 in debt and a default plan of last resort whose value is just too speculative. Students are voting with their feet. There are going to be massive layoffs in law schools this fall. We won't have the bodies we need to meet the payroll.''

HEADLINE: Egypt's Big Businesses Feel Neglected Amid Turmoil

BYLINE: By FARAH HALIME

 BODY:
CAIRO -- In the haze around Egypt's latest bout of turmoil, the nation's largest companies are struggling to adapt as the Islamist government is once again forced to focus on a fast-changing political crisis rather than the economy.
Some of Egypt's biggest employers have criticized the government for undermining the economy and the role of larger multinational companies in the country's political stability. 
Although the Muslim Brotherhood and President Mohamed Morsi have promised a ''Renaissance Project'' to address Egypt's economy, a new cast of Islamists has emerged at the lead of business, leaving many of the country's big business owners out in the cold.
This week, the country was thrust into another round of violence, prompting the president to declare a state of emergency in three Egyptian cities and give the army the power to arrest civilians. At least 45 people have died in fighting between the police and protesters.
But the heads of some of the country's largest listed companies say that tackling the fragile economy should happen in tandem with viable political solutions rather than in isolation, especially if the country expects to sign a long-awaited $4.8 billion loan package with the International Monetary Fund.
''While continuing any kind of political dialogue, it is of absolute urgency that economic-policy shaping moves to the front line,'' said Nassef Sawiris, chairman and chief executive of Orascom Construction Industries, Egypt's largest listed company. ''The political shocks of the last two years have paralyzed economic policy-shaping.''
Orascom and a group of American investors, among them Bill Gates of Microsoft, have begun a $2 billion transaction in which Orascom will transfer its listing to NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. Investors holding 80 percent of OCI shares have agreed to exchange their stakes for stock in OCI NV.
Many Egyptians have interpreted the move as a ''flight to safety'' after two years of political upheaval and the installation of an Islamist government.
While the company's transfer to Amsterdam will open access to capital markets, including the Eurobond market, increase share liquidity and attract a new type of shareholder, OCI's departure from the Cairo stock market will have an impact on liquidity and trading volume at home.
Tarek Kamhawey, a research analyst at Beltone Financial in Cairo, said that OCI was the largest company by market capitalization, at $8.5 billion, and comprises almost a quarter of market capitalization on the Egyptian exchange, followed by Egypt Telecom, which is worth less than half, at $3.7 billion.
Mr. Sawiris said that while the ''economic rationale'' of the move to Amsterdam was important, ''it does not belittle our main production assets in Egypt, Algeria and the U.S.''
The company is working on keeping a presence on the Cairo exchange, either directly or through a depositary receipts program. Its 45,000 Egyptian employees will not be affected, the company said.
''We have repeatedly said we are working on alternatives to give our Egyptian following of shareholders venues to invest in the company,'' Mr. Sawiris said.
OCI has had to face a number of challenges in Egypt, including a delay on a demerger of its construction and fertilizer unit, which was meant to take place last year but is still subject to approval by the government. According to Bloomberg, OCI is also reportedly in negotiations with the tax authority over outstanding taxes.
For many in the business community, these developments represent a failure by the government to support big employers, which often pay the highest taxes and employ thousands of people.
Hisham Fahmy, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, said that the government ''is taking large companies for granted'' while becoming ''fixated on small and medium-sized enterprises, because that's the biggest problem at the moment.''
''The informal sector and small companies are really unable to cope with instability, and, rightly so, they need a lot of help,'' he added.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by concentrating its efforts on grass-roots companies often run by fledgling entrepreneurs, has neglected the wider economic framework needed to support large companies.
The signs of a muddled economy are clear. EFG Hermes, Egypt's biggest investment bank, said its sale to Qatar's QInvest had been delayed as regulators scrutinized the takeover. The deal, announced in March, was expected to be concluded in November.
Qatar's regulator has given the necessary approvals, Mona Zulficar, EFG Hermes's nonexecutive chairwoman, told Bloomberg, indicating that it is the Egyptian regulator that is slowing the process.
An ongoing currency crisis is also trickling down to critical businesses for Egypt. Venus International, a major importer of wheat, has said it is struggling because of pressure on the pound.
''The erosion of the Egyptian pound and its scarcity in the market increases the foreign exchange risk on one side, and slows down dramatically our cash flow'' as the company and its customers ''must find U.S. dollars to pay the imports,'' said Sadri Marathi, chief financial officer at Venus.
''Sooner or later we will feel that the Egyptian population will be massively suffering from the economic crisis,'' he added, signaling that it will become more expensive to feed the population.
The president and the prime minister, Hesham Kandil, called for a ''National Economic Dialogue'' earlier this year, but that has been quietly delayed as the political crisis overshadows the economy.
Reserves have plunged to about $15 billion as the central bank has attempted to prop up the currency.
Investors who looked to come to Egypt do not believe the crisis will end quickly, said Mr. Fahmy of the American Chamber, while investors who already have a presence in Egypt have had to reassess their expectations for the current financial year.
Shafik Gabr, a billionaire industrialist and chairman of Artoc, an Egyptian conglomerate with interests in automobiles, real estate and publishing, said the lack of economic stability was having ''serious transition costs'' linked to the economic stability in Egypt.
Although in the last financial year he invested $23 million to create 400 jobs, Mr. Gabr said that a variety of problems ''not limited to the deficit, significant subsidies, inelasticity of exports, heavy costs due to disruptions, exchange rate, inflation and unemployment'' had contributed to ''multiple stresses'' on the economy.
''Egypt has the potential,'' he added. ' ''The question now is does it have the political, economic and social will to make the best of that potential.''

HEADLINE: Real Estate Losses Weigh On Santander

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Banco Santander's net income rose to $544 million in the fourth quarter of last year, but the Spanish bank continued to set aside billions of euros to cover losses in its domestic real estate market. 

 BODY:
 6:10 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON - Banco Santander, the largest bank in the euro zone, reported an increase in fourth-quarter net profit on Thursday even as it continued to set aside billions of euros to cover loan losses in its domestic Spanish market.
Santander, based in Madrid, said net income rose to 401 million euros ($544 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31. The bank posted a net income of 47 million euros in the period a year earlier, when it set aside 1.8 billion euros to offset exposure to Spain's troubled real estate market. 
Net profit for 2012, however, plunged 59 percent, to 2.2 billion, compared with the year-earlier period, as Santander was required to make provisions of billions of euros because of an increase in faulty real estate loans.
In total, Santander set aside 18.8 billion euros in 2012 to cover delinquent mortgages in Spain and an increase in other troubled loans across its businesses, particularly in struggling European markets. 
While the bank now generates half of its earnings in Latin America's emerging economies, a slowdown in Brazil and Mexico, combined with financial troubles in Europe, weighed on Santander's earnings last year.
The bank's management said it hoped the worst of the financial crisis was now behind it.
"In 2013, with the exceptional write-offs behind us, we should see a marked recovery in results," Santander's chairman, Emilio Botín, said in a statement.
Shares in Santander fell 2.3 percent in morning trading in Madrid on Thursday after the bank's fourth-quarter earnings fell below analysts' expectations. 
The bank's stock price has rallied more than 50 percent since July, after European policy makers gave renewed support to the struggling euro zone.
Despite growing confidence that the euro zone will survive its financial troubles, Spanish banks will continue to be hampered by weak domestic growth and potential further provisions to cover faulty loans, according to Citigroup analysts.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, Santander has been shifting its focus away from its domestic market in search of growth. Yet as Europe's debt troubles have continued to affect global markets, some of Santander's new markets, particularly in Latin America, have also suffered.
Last year, Santander's net income for its combined Latin American unit, excluding certain provisions, fell 8 percent, to 4.3 billion euros, compared with 2011, while its British operations reported an 11 percent drop in profit before provisions, to 1.1 billion euros. Santander raised $4.2 billion in September, after a dual listing of its Mexican subsidiary in New York and Mexico to increase its own cash reserves.
In Spain, Santander said it had cut its net exposure to the domestic real estate market by half last year, to 12.5 billion euros, after it sold almost 34,000 properties owned by the bank and real estate developers. The turnaround is likely to take some time. The bank's ratio of delinquent loans in Spain rose 1.25 percentage points, to 6.74 percent, compared with 2011.
Santander also said deposits in its domestic market now exceeded loans, as the bank reduced lending to cash-strapped Spaniards. In December, the bank had announced that it would absorb Banesto, its main domestic subsidiary, as part of its plans to close 15 percent of its retail network in the southern European country. 
The cutback in domestic lending comes despite a huge influx of cheap money from the European Central Bank at the end of 2011 aimed at easing institutions' ability to raise money in the financial markets. 
European policy makers had hoped that firms would inject the cash into domestic economies to stimulate growth. Many banks have instead hoarded the money in case Europe's debt crisis further hurts their operations.
As fears over Europe's future have waned, many of Europe's largest banks have been able to tap wholesale markets for new financing. The European Central Bank said last week that 278 banks would now return a combined 137 billion euros of short-term loans to the European Central Bank.
On Thursday, Santander confirmed that it had returned 24 billion euros to the European Central Bank, adding that it still had 11 billion euros of outstanding loans from the agency.
By the end of last year, Santander said its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, had increased to 10.3 percent, which is above targets set by regulators.

HEADLINE: India's Prime Minister Asks Developed Nations to Use Less Energy and Water

BYLINE: JOHN UPTON


HIGHLIGHT: The world's poor will be more affected as resources grow scarce, Mr. Singh said. 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday called on developed nations to strive for gains in energy efficiency and to reduce their environmental impact to help protect the world's poor from a growing paucity of electricity and water.
"There are genuine concerns that in an unequal world, scarcity of resources would affect the poor more adversely," Mr. Singh said at the inaugural session of the three-day Delhi Sustainable Development Summit, an annual international conference. "Key resources will become accessible only to a small selection of people on the planet, leading to the exclusion of a large number of people who live in poverty and persistent deprivation."
In India, an estimated 30 percent of people lived in poverty in 2010, according to the World Bank. That was down from the World Bank's estimate of 37 percent in 2005. 
Mr. Singh said India was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions per rupee of gross domestic product by at least 20 percent between 2005 and 2020.
"We in India are fully conscious of the need to conserve our resources for their utilization in a truly sustainable manner," Mr. Singh said.
But if developed countries fail to adhere to environmental agreements struck in Kyoto and other cities in recent decades, Mr. Singh warned that it "will be difficult to persuade governments, industry and the general public in India and other developing countries to step up the pace at which they are moving on this front."
Delegates attending this year's conference at the Taj Palace Hotel include the presidents of Guyana, Kiribati and Seychelles, according to organizers. Ministers from Nigeria, Poland, Norway, Canada and the United Arab Emirates are also attending. More than 40 nations are represented, with many of the delegates coming from developing countries.
The conference is taking place in a country where gross domestic product, while it has slowed in recent years, is still steadily rising, and where the government is targeting 8 percent annual economic growth. But electricity and clean water already are in short supply, and pollution levels are dangerously high, threatening to choke economic growth. Northern India was crippled by widespread power outages last summer that affected half of the country.
"We certainly have some major challenges in energy security in the future," Rajendra K. Pachauri, director general of The Energy and Resources Institute, an influential Indian nongovernmental organization that organizes the annual summit meeting, said in an interview. "There's a whole range of areas where, for a variety of reasons, we need to bring about an improvement in the efficiency of use of resources."
The efficient use of water, power and other resources is the major theme at this year's conference, which features a series of panel discussions between government officials, scientists and thought leaders. Other themes include climate change, which is an important issue in a country where annual monsoons are arriving later than they used to and dumping less of the summer rainfall that is stored for year-round use by farmers, households and hydropower operators.
Most Indians endure periodic blackouts, while hundreds of millions live without any electricity supply. But demand for power is growing with the economy.
Each Indian used about 6 percent as much electricity as an American on average in 2009, according to an analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration figures. The United States' per-capita energy use is falling while India's is growing. In 1999, each Indian was using 3.8 percent as much electricity as an Americans on average.
In a country of more than a billion people, even small per-capita increases in energy consumption quickly add up.
A study by The Energy and Resources Institute and the Indian government found that under a "business-as-usual" scenario of 8 percent annual economic growth, demand for energy by the nation's commercial sector would roughly quadruple from 2012 to 2032.
A deepening energy shortfall throughout the country has prompted political and business leaders to propose building a large nuclear power plant, solar farms, new coal-fired facilities and 292 dams to produce hydropower through the Indian Himalayas. They are seeking to open coal mines domestically and abroad, in such far-flung places as the United States, Canada, Australia, Indonesia and South Africa.
"Ours is a large population," Mr. Pachauri said. "We have to look at the future and see that we are able to bring about improvements in the well-being of people with much lower levels of inputs."
But Mr. Pachauri said the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit is about more than just India - it's about tackling problems of energy waste worldwide.
"We're getting leaders from civil society, leaders from defense, from government coming together, so hopefully they'll take back some messages," he said. "The average person on the street has to start worrying and taking some action on these issues."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Opponents Invoke Solyndra

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Critics raise the prospect that the expansion of Plant Vogtle in Georgia could rely on a federal loan guarantee. So far the builders have not negotiated one, however. 

 BODY:
Are new nuclear power plants a good bet for taxpayers? Congress evidently thought so in 2005, when it set aside $17.5 billion in loan guarantees to help restart nuclear construction in this country after a three-decade drought.
The theory at the time was that nuclear power was essential to maintaining diversity in the nation's electric power system and to cutting carbon dioxide emissions by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The program was signed into law by President George W. Bush, and President Obama later proposed expanding that program to more than $50 billion. 
Eight years later, no actual loans have been made, and opponents of one nuclear project in Georgia are now arguing that none should be, because the risk of default is too high. 
The loan guarantee program has in fact already been blamed for the demise of one project as a result of disagreement over the risk of default. Calvert Cliffs 3, a proposed new reactor in Maryland, was canceled in 2010 because, the builders said, the Energy Department was asking for an upfront payment that was .

That fee was supposed to compensate the government for taking on the risk of a loan default, and the government set that fee higher than the builders thought was reasonable. (With natural gas prices still low, however, the decision to pull the plug may been wise in any case.)
How to set such fees haslong been a matter of uncertainty and debate, even for Congressional experts, because at this point the United States has no recent experience in completing nuclear construction. 
While no nuclear loan guarantees have been granted, one has nonetheless been promised to the companies now building the Vogtle 3 and 4 reactors, near Augusta, Ga. It is not clear whether those builders, led by the Southern Company, will actually accept a federal guarantee; Southern says it has been shopping in the private market. 
Nonetheless, two groups that oppose the construction of the Vogtle reactors are arguing that the proposed loan guarantee for the project is "Solyndra-like," a reference to the scandal over a solar panel manufacturer in California that went bankrupt in 2011 after receiving a $535 million federal guarantee. 
On Wednesday, the opponents, Synapse Energy Economics and Earth Track, based on the Department of Energy's responses to four Freedom of Information Act requests over three years. The report argues that Vogtle might not go forward without the loan guarantees and that the department is poorly set up to evaluate the risk of default and set an appropriate upfront fee. 
Furthermore, they argue, with new setbacks for nuclear power, including the persistence of very low prices for natural gas and the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant, the loan package should be revised. By some measures, the Vogtle project is more than a year behind schedule, they noted. And the owners and the contractor are enmeshed in a $900 million dispute on costs. 
At the Southern Company, Tim Leljedal, a spokesman, said that loan guarantee negotiations with the Department of Energy were continuing. "We are committed to financing options that will serve the best interests of our customers, and - as long as the terms and conditions of D.O.E. loan guarantees serve those interests - we will continue pursue that option,'' he said. 
Last year, he noted, Southern borrowed $4.3 billion from commercial sources at an average rate of 2.8 percent. 
One of the report's authors, Doug Koplow of Earth Track, argued that this comparison was irrelevant. That was senior secured debt to be used for other purposes, he said, and "it didn't have any of stigma or risk like a large nuclear project.'' 
But proponents of Vogtle argue that its prospects are sound. For one thing, its builders note, it is fundamentally different from a project like Calvert Cliffs 3. 
Calvert Cliffs, about 50 miles south of Washington, would have been a "merchant" plant, meaning that it would pay back its loans by selling energy at whatever the prevailing rate was, and that rate is subject to market risks like shifts in overall demand and a decline in the price of competing sources like natural gas. 
Vogtle is being built with the approval of the utility regulators, with its costs paid by ratepayers as long as the regulators consider the money to be spent appropriately. In other words, it could be a poor choice or a great choice, depending on future trends like the price of natural gas and the overall demand for electricity, but the builders will have the revenue to repay the loans. 
The Department of Energy has extended the deadline for Southern and its partners to decide on the loan guarantee offer until this June. 
Meanwhile,
 An earlier version of this post misidentified a critic of nuclear power who dismissed the relevance of a $4.3 billion debt arrangement secured by the Southern Company last year. It was Doug Koplow of Earth Track, not Max Chang of Synapse Energy Economics.

HEADLINE: White House Discontinues Jobs Council

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: The panel, known as the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, had a two-year mandate, which expired on Thursday. The administration chose not to renew it, saying that the president would find new ways to reach out to business executives. 

 BODY:
President Obama has said creating jobs remains his No. 1 priority as he begins his second term. But on Thursday, the White House shut down an outside panel of corporate chieftains who advised Mr. Obama on ways to reinvigorate the job market. 
 The panel, known as the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, had a two-year mandate, which expired Thursday. The administration chose not to renew it, saying that the president would find new ways to reach out to business executives.
 "The work of the job council was very valuable," said Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, at his daily briefing. "While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them." 
 Mr. Carney said the White House has spoken directly to business executives about the need to reach a fiscal deal, as well as about the campaign to overhaul the nation's immigration laws. Mr. Obama will hold more calls on those matters next week, Mr. Carney said.
 Critics, however, said the White House never made use of the council. It met only four times in two years, the last time more than a year ago. They also noted that the White House was discontinuing it even though the nation's jobless rate remained at 7.8 percent and the economy contracted slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 "To understand the abysmal nature of our economic recovery, look no further than the president's disinterest in learning lessons from actual job creators," Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, said in a statement. "Whether ignoring the group or rejecting its recommendations, the president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation."
 Mr. Carney disputed that characterization, noting that the administration had acted on proposals by the council to retrofit government buildings for commercial purposes. The council, he said, also set in motion a plan to give businesspeople streamlined access to information about how to obtain financing from the Small Business Administration.
 The chairman of the council was Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Its members included Steve Case, the media investor; Kenneth I. Chenault, the chairman of American Express; Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook; and Penny Pritzker, a Chicago philanthropist who was a major fundraiser for Mr. Obama's campaign and whose name has recently surfaced as a possible candidate for commerce secretary.

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts, House Democrats Vie to Replace Kerry in Senate

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Stephen Lynch began his Senate campaign by casting himself as a workingman of humble origins who could connect with average voters better than his fellow Democrat, Representative Edward J. Markey. 

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Representative Stephen Lynch began his first day as a candidate for the Senate on Thursday by casting himself as a workingman of humble origins who could connect with average voters better than his fellow Democrat, Representative Edward J. Markey, whom he will face in a primary in April.
 A new 60-second campaign video introduces Mr. Lynch, 57, a former ironworker from South Boston, to voters as someone who pulled himself up by the bootstraps. 
 "He has never forgotten where he came from," the narrator says, noting that Mr. Lynch voted against the Wall Street bailout. The video ends with this tag line: "He'll go to Washington to stand up, not fit in."
 In advance of a three-city announcement tour Thursday, Mr. Lynch indicated in a radio interview with WBUR that the workingman image was a central part of his campaign strategy. 
 He said he was running because he could bring that perspective to the exclusive Senate club. He described himself as having "slapped on a pair of work boots" and growing up in housing projects.
 "I've struggled with a lot of the things that average people struggle with," Mr. Lynch said, suggesting that Mr. Markey, 66, had not.
 Mr. Lynch, who started in Congress in 2001, suggested that Mr. Markey's 38 years in Washington had distanced him from average people.
 "I'm not sure he's ever had a connection with the private sector or worked at a job that most people relate to, and I think there's something missing," Mr. Lynch said of Mr. Markey. "I don't think electing someone who's been in Washington for 38 years is going to provide that connection to average people."
 Mr. Markey has about $3 million saved up for the race as well as the backing of much of the Democratic establishment, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mr. Lynch enters the race with about $750,000 on hand and no major endorsements. 
Mr. Lynch indicated that he would try to use Mr. Markey's "advantages" against him.
 "I'm not going to try to purchase the election," he said, "I'm going to try to earn it."
 As for Mr. Markey's backing by the national Democrats, Mr. Lynch said he thought the people of Massachusetts would want to pick their own senator rather than have the Washington establishment pick it for them.
 "Shame on us to allow someone to clear the field, box out all the other candidates and buy the election," Mr. Lynch said in Springfield on Thursday morning as he began his announcement tour.
 Mr. Lynch is the most conservative member of the state's Congressional delegation and has a record of voting against abortion rights. Aware that most voters in deep-blue Massachusetts support abortion rights, Mr. Lynch suggested he would not try to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. "I've never viewed attacking Roe v. Wade as part of any solution, and I certainly wouldn't do that in the United States Senate," he said. He said he supported the use of birth control.
 Mr. Markey released a statement in the afternoon, saying, "I welcome Stephen Lynch into the race for U.S. Senate." He said he hoped Mr. Lynch would join him in a pledge to discourage outside special interests from running expensive ads in the campaign.
 He also indicated that his strategy against Mr. Lynch would be to emphasize his own more liberal voting record, which he believes is more in line with the state's Democratic tradition.
 "We need a senator who continues to stand up for the progressive values that John Kerry and Massachusetts believe in and who's focused on creating the jobs our economy needs," Mr. Markey said in his statement. "That's why I'm running for Senate."
 The primary is set for April 30. So far, no Republican candidate has announced for the Senate seat, which was vacated this week by John Kerry upon his confirmation as secretary of state. Former Senator Scott P. Brown could be the Republican candidate for the special election, set for June 25, but he has not indicated his intentions.

HEADLINE: Report Highlights Challenges to Press Freedom in Asia

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: In its Press Freedom Index 2013, the media group Reporters Without Borders finds that Myanmar is surging in Asia, Taiwan is the most free, and Thailand is performing badly. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - If the world were divided into six regions where the press is most free and where it's least free, Asia, where nearly 60 percent of the world's people live, would come in fourth, Reporters Without Borders says in its Press Freedom Index 2013.
That's ahead of the nations in the former Soviet Union, and the Middle East and North Africa (which comes last), but behind Europe (first), the Americas and Africa, in that order. 
The assessment is one of several new pieces of information in the just-out index, which tells us other interesting facts: China, as before, is in the bottom 10 of 179 countries; the United States's position is far lower than many might think at 32 (behind Suriname); and Thailand, popularly viewed as one of the most freewheeling countries in Asia, comes in at a very low 135.
As my colleague Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok last week, a recent case there highlighted a problem facing the media: powerful laws protecting the reputation of the royal family which led to the sentencing of the activist and editor Somyot Pruksakasemsuk to 10 years in prison for insulting Thailand's king, "the latest in a string of convictions under the country's strict lèse-majesté law," Thomas wrote. (Somyot was given an additional year in jail for libeling a general.)
Just how severe Thailand's laws are is illustrated by the fact that Somyot didn't even write the two articles that got him jailed (though he was editor of the magazine where they appeared), nor did they mention the king, Thomas wrote.
The sentencing drew a rebuke from the United Nations human rights chief, Navi Pillay, who criticized the "extremely harsh" sentence as a setback for protection of human rights in Thailand and expressed her support for moves to amend the lèse-majesté laws.
Overall, democracies protect freedom of press better than dictatorships, the group said. But the report pointed to problems in democracies too.
There, "news providers have to cope with the media's economic crises and conflicts of interest," said its secretary-general, Christophe Deloire.
The situations of a dictatorship and democracy are "not always comparable," but "we should pay tribute to all those who resist pressure whether it is aggressively focused or diffuse," he said.
So where is the press doing well? As usual, western democracies such as Finland, the Netherlands and Norway lead the table.
In Asia, outside of Australia (at 26th place), the freest press is in Taiwan, which ranks 47. South Korea is next, then Japan - though the report calls that country one of the "big falls," having dropped a startling 31 places.
Japan "has been affected by a lack of transparency and almost zero respect for access to information on subjects directly or indirectly related to Fukushima," the nuclear plant disaster in 2011, Reporters Without Borders wrote. The Guardian reports that, according to the European Environment Agency, "the Fukushima disaster in 2011 may have released twice as much radiation as the Japanese government admitted."
"This sharp fall should sound an alarm," Reporters Without Borders said.
Myanmar was the brightest spot in terms of improvement, climbing 18 places to 151, "thanks to the Burmese spring's unprecedented reforms."
Yet other places in Asia dragged the region down to fourth in the world: Malaysia, dropping 23 places to 145, "its lowest-ever position because access to information is becoming more and more limited," the group said. India, at 140, is "at its lowest since 2002 because of increasing impunity for violence against journalists and because Internet censorship continues to grow."
And China, long a very poor performer, "shows no sign of improving. Its prisons still hold many journalists and netizens, while increasingly unpopular Internet censorship continues to be a major obstacle to access to information."

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Posts Surprise $3 Billion Loss

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: The bank's fourth-quarter loss reflected efforts to clear its books of bad assets and set aside more than $1 billion to cover legal proceedings and investigations. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, reported a surprise quarterly net loss of $3 billion on Thursday, as new management tallied the cost of past mistakes and tried to draw a line under the bank's troubled past.
The fourth-quarter loss of 2.2 billion euros included about 1 billion euros the bank set aside to cover legal proceedings and investigations, including accusations that Deutsche Bank was among institutions that rigged global benchmarks used to set rates on trillions in loans. The bank also booked losses in recognition of the diminished value of acquisitions going as far back as its purchase of Bankers Trust in the United States in 1998. 
While the loss partly reflected problems peculiar to Deutsche Bank, it was a reminder of the weak state of European banking more than four years after the beginning of the financial crisis. Deutsche Bank is considered relatively healthy by European standards. Hesitant action by national regulators means that many other banks have not yet been forced to recognize the full scope of bad investments and depend on the European Central Bank for cash they need to operate.
The loss at Deutsche Bank contrasts with strong earnings recently by competitors like JPMorgan Chase. Still, its shares rose 2.9 percent in Frankfurt trading as investors apparently concluded that the German bank's relatively new co-chief executives, Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, were front-loading the bad news. Investors were also rewarding the bank's efforts to increase the size of the reserves it holds as insurance against losses.
The two men took over the reins less than seven months ago and have declared their intention to deal more severely with the legacy of the financial crisis. The new approach includes raising the amount of capital the bank keeps in reserve compared with the amount of money it lends to customers or otherwise puts at risk. Deutsche Bank has suffered from the perception that it is among the most highly leveraged banks in Europe.
The bank said on Thursday that it had raised its so-called core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of the size of the reserves in relation to the amount of money at risk, to 8 percent from less than 6 percent a year ago. Some analysts questioned whether the bank really had become safer or whether the improved ratio simply reflected changes in the way the bank calculates risk.
For now, though, investors are willing to give Deutsche Bank the benefit of the doubt, analysts said.
"The new management under co-C.E.O. Anshu Jain is starting to deal with D.B.'s legacy issues," analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove said in a note to clients.
Capital is also an issue for Deutsche Bank in the United States, where the Federal Reserve is proposing that foreign banks hold more capital at their local operating units. Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts that Deutsche Bank was prepared to allocate more capital to the United States in 2015, adding that the rules "were really not very helpful in terms of helping global financial markets."
The quarterly results showed the bank was clearing its books of bad assets and reducing risk, its executives said. Late last year Deutsche Bank created a "noncore operations unit" to dispose of bad investments or holdings that did not produce an adequate return.
"We are willing to take pain," Mr. Jain said at a news conference. "That is the real story of the fourth quarter. We are willing to take losses."
Deutsche Bank said revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent, to 7.9 billion euros, from the period a year earlier. The bank warned in December that it would incur major charges in the quarter, but most analysts had not expected the loss to be nearly so big. Before taxes, the loss was 2.6 billion euros.
For the full year, Deutsche Bank reported a net profit of 665 million euros after subtracting 3.5 billion euros related to legal problems or diminished value of assets.
The bank's problems are far from over. Deutsche Bank continues to cope with the consequences of behavior by some employees, including a tax evasion inquiry that led to a raid on company headquarters last month involving hundreds of police officers. Executives acknowledged on Thursday that the bank could face additional lawsuits related to its sale of securities tied to the United States subprime mortgage market.
"Although they have taken some chunky provisions, litigation is an ongoing drag on the industry," said Jon Peace, a bank analyst with Nomura in London. "There is probably going to be more litigation drag in 2013."
Deutsche Bank is among institutions accused of helping to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is used to set rates on trillions of dollars of mortgages and other debt. Mr. Jain said on Thursday that during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, he and other bankers discussed whether it would be possible to work out a global settlement with authorities and complainants. While the bankers did not make any decisions, Mr. Jain said, they agreed that a comprehensive settlement might make sense and would discuss it further.
In response to lapses of the past, executive bonuses have been curtailed, and employees have undergone mandatory ethics training which stresses integrity in trading and dealing with clients, Mr. Fitschen said.
"If you cannot commit yourself to those values without reservation," he said, "Deutsche Bank is not the place for you."

HEADLINE: Doubt Is Cast on Firms Hired to Help Banks

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Federal authorities are scrutinizing the private consultants hired by banks to clean up financial misdeeds like money laundering and foreclosure abuses, taking aim at a conflict-riddled, billion-dollar industry. 

 BODY:
Federal authorities are scrutinizing private consultants hired to clean up financial misdeeds like money laundering and foreclosure abuses, taking aim at an industry that is paid billions of dollars by the same banks it is expected to police.
The consultants operate with scant supervision and produce mixed results, according to government documents and interviews with prosecutors and regulators. In one case, the consulting firms enabled the wrongdoing. The deficiencies, officials say, can leave consumers vulnerable and allow tainted money to flow through the financial system.
"How can you be independent if you're hired by the entity you're reviewing?" Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said.
The pitfalls were exposed last month when federal regulators halted a broad effort to help millions of homeowners in foreclosure. The regulators reached an $8.5 billion settlement with banks, scuttling a flawed foreclosure review run by eight consulting firms. In the end, borrowers hurt by shoddy practices are likely to receive less money than they deserve, regulators said. 
On Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, announced that they would open an investigation into the foreclosure review, seeking "additional information about the scope of the harms found."
Critics concede that regulators have little choice but to hire outsiders for certain responsibilities after they find problems at the banks. The government does not have the resources to ensure that banks follow the rules. Still, consultants like Deloitte & Touche and the Promontory Financial Group can add to regulators' headaches, the government documents and interviews indicate. Some banks that work with consultants continue to run afoul of the law. At other times, consultants underestimate the extent of the misdeeds or facilitate them, preventing regulators from holding institutions accountable.
Now, regulators and lawmakers are rethinking their relationship with the consultants. Officials at the Federal Reserve, which oversees many large banks, are questioning the prudence of relying on consultants so heavily, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency penalized JPMorgan Chase last month for breakdowns in money-laundering controls, it imposed stricter requirements, ordering the bank to hire a consultant with "specialized experience" in money laundering and to ensure that the firm "not be subject to any conflict of interest." In a separate action against the bank related to a $6 billion trading loss last year, the agency opted not to mandate an outside consultant at all.
While the comptroller's office will continue requiring consultants in certain cases, some agency officials are worried about the quality of the work, as well as the consultants' independence, according to three government officials briefed on the matter.
Since the financial crisis, regulators have increasingly relied on consultants. The comptroller's office ordered banks to hire consultants in more than 130 enforcement actions since 2008, or nearly 15 percent of the cases.
It can be a lucrative business. In 2011, regulators mandated that 14 banks employ consultants to determine whether homeowners were wrongfully evicted. Over 14 months, the consultants collected about $2 billion in fees, according to regulators and bank officials.
Those fees amounted to more than half of what homeowners will receive under the $8.5 billion settlement that ended the review. As part of the deal, officials will disburse $3.3 billion to 3.8 million borrowers in foreclosure.
According to consultants and regulators, the broad review was plagued with inefficiencies. For example, Promontory initially instructed employees to calculate lawyers' fees for each loan, to assess if borrowers were overcharged. Later, it scrapped the original procedure, only to reverse the policy again two weeks later, according to two reviewers who worked for Promontory.
"From Day 1, Promontory strove to conduct its review work as thoroughly and independently as possible," a spokesman for the firm, Christopher Winans, said in a statement. "Our overarching concern at all times was to serve the best interests of borrowers."
Some lawmakers question whether a consultant's regulatory connections helped it secure contracts. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has a stable of former Securities and Exchange Commission officials, won much of the foreclosure review work, signing deals with four banks, including Citigroup. Promontory, the firm examining loans for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and PNC, was founded in 2000 by the former head of the comptroller's office, Eugene A. Ludwig.
When the contracts were initially awarded, some housing advocates complained that consulting firms could not objectively evaluate banks with which they had pre-existing business relationships. The comptroller's office said it vetted the firms to spot such potential conflicts, and argued that the process provided swifter relief for homeowners than if the government had hired the companies directly through a lengthy contracting process.
But concerns persisted. Deloitte, which won the contract to review JPMorgan's loans, had previously audited Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two firms JPMorgan acquired during the financial crisis. In May, the comptroller's office replaced Allonhill, the consultant for Aurora Bank, after the firm disclosed that it had already reviewed some "of the same pool of loans" as part of an earlier contract.
"It's clear from the foreclosure settlement that oversight over consultants was inadequate and the review process was deeply flawed," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who recently pressed regulators to detail how consultants were paid. People close to the review say consultants relied on a process that the comptroller's office designed in 2011, under previous leadership.
"This was a very complex process," a spokesman for the comptroller said. "Throughout the process, regulators provided continuous oversight, guidance and were available to discuss issues." The agency also performs spot checks on the consultants.
Still, the foreclosure review highlighted broader concerns about the role consultants play.
Since the financial crisis, the comptroller's office has issued nearly 20 enforcement actions against banks that had already hired consultants to help iron out problems, according to government documents. While consultants cannot be expected to remedy every last issue at the banks, the actions raise questions about the effectiveness of their work.
When HSBC, the British bank, was sanctioned in 2003 over porous money-laundering controls, the bank turned to Deloitte to review its compliance, an official briefed on the matter said. Deloitte also worked for HSBC from 2006 to 2008, the person said, building a system to monitor money flows more effectively. But the bank ran into trouble in 2010 over similar issues, as highlighted in a recent scathing report by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
As part of a regulatory order, HSBC again hired Deloitte, this time to assess the number of times the bank failed to report suspicious transactions. Deloitte, three officials said, generously bundled hundreds of missed transfers into a single report. That helped save the bank from some government fines.
Despite the undercounting, HSBC still paid a record $1.9 billion last year to settle accusations that it enabled drug cartels to move money through its American subsidiaries.
In a statement, a spokesman for the firm said, "Deloitte fully stands behind the quality and integrity of its work on behalf of regulatory authorities."
Deloitte has also been suspected of helping institutions cloak illicit transfers of money to rogue nations around the globe. In August, New York's top banking regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, accused Deloitte of helping the British bank Standard Chartered flout American sanctions.
The consulting firm was hired to flag suspicious transfers routed through Standard Chartered's New York branches. Instead, it instructed bankers on how to escape regulatory scrutiny, according to state court documents.
Deloitte turned over "highly confidential information" from which the bank gleaned insight into "regulators' concerns and strategies," the court documents said. The firm later doctored its report to regulators, Mr. Lawsky said, deliberately removing some illegal transfers on behalf of Iranian clients. In an e-mail, a Deloitte partner admitted that a report on the transactions was a "watered-down version."
The authorities never took legal action against Deloitte, and federal officials noted in a separate settlement agreement that Standard Chartered employees withheld critical information from the consulting firm.
Despite these concerns, regulators are turning to a familiar source to help Standard Chartered. As part of a $327 million settlement last year, the bank is required to hire "an independent consultant."

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank's Lonely Fight With the Fed

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve has proposed rules aimed at making sure that the American operations of foreign banks have the financial strength to absorb losses. Deutsche Bank executives, however, apparently feel the rules are unnecessarily restrictive. 

 BODY:
It was supposed to be an uneventful conference call for senior executives at Deutsche Bank, one of Europe's largest lenders. But a nerve was clearly struck as the executives took questions from analysts on Thursday. 
The source of the provocation? A set of new rules proposed in December by the Federal Reserve, a primary bank regulator in the United States. The regulations aim to make sure that the American operations of foreign banks have the financial strength to absorb losses. Deutsche Bank executives, however, feel the rules are unnecessarily restrictive - and spent part of the call complaining about them. 
Deutsche Bank's chief financial officer, Stefan Krause, said the regulations "are really not very helpful in terms of helping global financial markets to properly work." Because of the flaws he perceives in the rules, Mr. Krause said he was confident they would be revised. However, if the Fed institutes tough rules for foreign banks, he said "retribution" by European regulators was possible. 
Deutsche Bank's co-chief executive officer, Anshu Jain, also let his fears be known. "I think this will rapidly escalate into an industry issue and indeed with very significant global G.D.P. and growth consequences," he said. 
Deutsche Bank's opposition to the Fed's rules does not sit well with American lawmakers who have pushed for strong regulation, particularly since the bank benefited from government financial support during the crisis. "Instead of complaining about the Fed's entirely appropriate actions, Deutsche should be thanking it and U.S. taxpayers for saving it from its own mistakes," said Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio.
Other European banks haven't been anywhere near as critical about the Fed's rules. But that's because the rules may hit Deutsche Bank a lot harder than others. 
Banks are required to protect themselves against losses by having a financial buffer called capital. The Fed's proposed rules would effectively force banks with large operations in the United States to comply with the same capital rules as domestic lenders. So, if a big American bank had to have regulatory capital that was equivalent to 7 percent of its assets, so would the operations of a large foreign bank. 
But Deutsche Bank likely has little capital in its American operations. The last time the bank reported a crucial regulatory capital ratio for its American unit, then called the Taunus Corporation, was at the end of 2011. Then, a crucial regulatory measure of capital was actually in the red. The deficit was equivalent to 6.13 percent of its assets. A bank normally doesn't get to operate with negative capital. Indeed, regulators start to think about taking tough action against a bank if its capital ratios dip below 3 percent. 
But foreign bank operations were allowed to have low capital because it was assumed that their parent companies would supply capital if the subsidiary got into trouble. The financial crisis showed that this might not happen, though. A troubled parent bank may get seized or collapse, leaving its subsidiaries dry. With its new rules, the Fed wants to guard against that by making foreign bank operations hold the same capital as American ones. 
"I support the Fed's approach," said Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a primary bank regulator. Ms. Bair was concerned by Deutsche Bank's negative capital ratios when she was at the agency.
A person familiar with Deutsche Bank's thinking said the bank wasn't against holding more capital in its American operations. 
But this person felt the Fed's rules were too blunt, and could be improved if they were applied to distinct American entities, like Deutsche Bank's Wall Street operations. This person also said that the combined capital ratio for Deutsche Bank's operations in the United States has improved, but didn't quantify the improvement. 
Deutsche Bank may find few sympathizers, however. 
One reason is that it revamped its American operations last year, a move that led analysts to deduce that it was trying to skirt United States regulations. 
"That reorganization was a slap in the face to the Fed, the regulators and the U.S. taxpayers," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a lobbying group that supports robust financial regulation. 
The person familiar with the workings of Deutsche Bank's American operations said the reorganization was done to avoid having to report financials under both United States and German accounting rules. 
Deutsche Bank's rivals on Wall Street may not support the bank's position. Deutsche Bank's low capital in the United States may have allowed it to operate at a competitive advantage (capital effectively costs a bank, so the more it has, the harder it is to make an overall profit). 
Getting capital ratios at American operations up to the required levels could be far more expensive for Deutsche Bank than other European banks, said Andrew Lim, a bank analyst with Espírito Santo Investment Bank in London. "Barclays has a similar issue but nowhere near as bad in terms of magnitude," Mr. Lim said. 
One mystery is why Deutsche Bank, a huge lender, didn't just raise the capital and put it in the American operations many months ago. A crucial part of the Dodd-Frank legislation, passed in 2010, made it clear that foreign banks couldn't operate in the United States on thin capital. 
Deutsche Bank may have hoped to operate for as long as it could with low capital, to increase returns. But it may simply not had sufficient capital at the parent level. 
"The irony is that Deutsche may end up better capitalized in the U.S. than anywhere else," said Marty Leary, deputy director of research at Unite Here, a union that represents employees in casinos owned by Deutsche Bank.

HEADLINE: Two Cities in One

BYLINE: LATOYA PETERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Do you live in Washington or in D.C.? 

 BODY:
Washington, D.C., is a city of divides. There are racial divides, most notably a black D.C. and a white D.C. There are ethnic enclaves, with a Salvadoran D.C. sharing space with the Ethiopian D.C. There are the geographic boundaries that came to represent economic boundaries, like "east of the river" and "west of the park," or the image divides between the tony Northwest section of the city and the formerly gritty Southeastern quadrant.
But to me, the most telling divide is a verbal one - does one live in D.C. or Washington? 
Calling the city "Washington" reveals a certain experience. There are thousands of people who live and work in Washington - people with high-powered jobs, the transient class, the chattering class, the politicos, the folks who watch (or are guests on) "Meet the Press." They rotate in and out of the White House or spend years bouncing through various continents before settling into an N.G.O. or nonprofit. Often, these are the people who refer to the city as a revolving door. Many have told me they've never met anyone "from here" before. (See aforementioned racial divide.)
Seemingly a world away are the lifelong residents, the multigenerational city dwellers, the folks who staff federal offices. This is D.C.: the city and surrounding suburbs are the site of the nation's most visible and vocal black middle class. In D.C., people listen to go-go and jazz and look for long-term stability in a government job that will not change with administrations. This D.C. is where I grew up. 
These two cities exist in the same space, but often hold completely different lives. 
In some ways, the boundaries can feel stark and unyielding. I remember trying to meet up with a new friend of mine, an editor I'd worked with once or twice, somewhere near the U Street Corridor. As often as we both hung out around U Street, that should have been a simple task. Yet as we volleyed the names of different bars and lounges, it was almost as if we were describing two different places. She wasn't familiar with my regular hangouts: Jin lounge, Lounge of Three. I hadn't heard a thing about hers; since when was there a cowboy bar on U Street? We finally decided to go to one of her favorites, a low-key spot called Axis Bar (which no longer exists in a rapidly changing city). I was stunned to see it was next door to Tabaq, one of my haunts. We'd been partying next door to each other, and yet our worlds had stubbornly refused to overlap.
Other times, the boundaries are more porous. Close to a decade ago, Columbia Heights, a neighborhood in the north of the city where I now live, boasted not much more than houses, some small, run-down local businesses, and a large field that announced it was the impending site of a new Target. Strolling around the streets revealed the scars left from the riots in the late 1960s and the crack-fueled chaos of the 1980s and '90s. But the complicated mix of Spanish, English and Amharic and the friendly corner stores also revealed the camaraderie of a small neighborhood. One day, my then-boyfriend and I were cruising around the area and were shocked to see an outcropping of young white people at an outdoor restaurant, a strange oasis in a mostly black and brown neighborhood. Their presence was jarring, not simply because of the racial dynamics but because it foretold a more dramatic shift to come. 
Now that change has come to pass. Washington has crept into much of D.C. Last summer, I brought my dog out to play with our neighbors' dog. My little mutt bounced around with their little purebred and we looked out at the bars and restaurants of the new Columbia Heights, filling with people out for a good time. We talked about the petty annoyances the newcomers brought, the peeing on the streets, the drunken screaming, the smashed Cîroc bottles. Our neighborhood was changing, we agreed, for better or for worse. The outsiders we spoke of were white. But so were my neighbors. The boundaries had shifted yet again.
What does it mean to have these conflicting, overlapping, imagined dividing lines? Is there an us and them? How can a city change every four to eight years, yet still remain fundamentally the same? Time washes over the old boundaries and creates new ones. Fresh alliances are forged. 
All I can do is smile every time I pass Sunshine, the first Ethiopian-Tex Mex fusion restaurant I've ever seen. Yet there is also a sadness in that smile - lately the Ethiopian community has been expanding around 9th Street and down Georgia Avenue toward the suburbs of Silver Spring, in pursuit of more reasonable rent and a better quality of life.
 [#x202a]My block today looks completely different from the way it did when I moved in just a few years ago. Italian wine bars and trendy street food arrived, bringing a diversity-lite mix of patrons. Washington is taking over, yet vestiges of D.C. remain. Grown men still jump the fence of the local elementary school to play soccer on sunny days, women still sell sliced fruit by the road and children still play in the public fountain, which continues to be more of a neighborhood gathering place than any of the five coffee shops that vie for that position.[#x202c]
Is this place Washington or D.C.? The question reveals the indelible truth: which city you live in depends on who you are.

HEADLINE: Philosopher Kings and Fiscal Cliffs

BYLINE: JASON STANLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Exploiting the public's confusion about fiscal policy for political advantage is a danger not just to the economy, but to democracy. 

 BODY:
Plato had a famously dim view of democracy. He regarded politics as a craft, and thought that understanding the essence of a craft is to have expertise. Plato argues that we cannot hope the multitude to achieve expertise in the craft of governing. They are too easily misled by sophists. It followed, for Plato, that democracy must be rejected as a just system of governance. It is "probable that the origins of tyranny are found nowhere else than in the democratic regime." ("The Republic"). A just system of government must have a philosopher king, who understands the essences of things. Translated into the modern context, Plato's view is that the only just system of government is one that is run by one or several experts in economics and public policy. The multitude is too easily swayed by propaganda. 
Plato was right to regard his views as inconsistent with democracy. His view that citizens are not competent to make judgments about public policy, that economics and policy are areas of expertise like the physician's, is profoundly undemocratic.

So what is required for a democracy to avoid the threat of "ending in tyranny"? Many theorists have argued that democracy requires an informed citizenry that can engage in reasoned public debate about policy issues. That's a high standard. A weaker view of the requirements of democracy is defensible, namely that citizens must have a reasonable expectation to recognize when a policy is in their own interests. Plato's view is undemocratic, because he thinks that even this bar is too high. The multitude will always be tricked by propaganda and false rhetoric into voting against their interests.
In previous columns, I have explored how language is used to sway public opinion and evade reasoned debate. Naming a bill "The Patriot Act" is a simple example, the thought being that voters would want to re-elect politicians who supported a bill called "The Patriot Act," even if it went against the public's actual interests. This is a clear example in which we are confronted with Plato's problem with democracy. Such uses of rhetoric pose clear dangers to our democracy that are not justified by the situation.
In the arena of contemporary fiscal policy, very much in the news now, Plato's problem is particularly perplexing. Here, the analogy between someone competent to engage in decision making and a physician seems apt. It is natural to think that competent judgment about fiscal policy requires expert training in economics akin to a physician's training in medicine. But if only experts can make the judgments here, it isn't clear that democracy is possible.
Reasonable thought and discussion over fiscal policy faces an additional obstacle. The vocabulary to describe some of the most important notions is misleading. It follows that democratic decision making about fiscal policy faces additional hurdles over and above the complexity of the subject matter. As a result, it is much less clear whether it is wrong to mislead the public in a fiscal crisis. For these reasons, the recent debate about the "fiscal cliff" therefore raises a particular worrisome version of Plato's problem.
The expression "the fiscal cliff," though in use to some extent before, was introduced to the broader public by Ben Bernake, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in February, 2012 to describe the threat to the recovering economy posed by the confluence of two events. First, Congress was again facing their repeated promise to restore income taxes to their levels during the Clinton presidency in order to reduce the deficit. Secondly, Congress was simultaneously facing large self-imposed spending cuts (the so-called "sequester"). Curiously, however, a recent poll found that 47 percent of the public thought that it was going over the "cliff" that would result in higher deficits. Only 14 percent understood that it would reduce deficits. (In fact, it would have reduced them drastically, effectively eliminating the deficit problem).
The poll suggests that the multitude was quite misled. If so, it is not unreasonable to pin the blame on the expression "fiscal cliff." Going over cliffs is clearly a bad thing, possibly resulting in death. Also, the major parties seem to agree that deficits are a terrible thing. The Democrats invoke the awfulness of deficits when discussing additional tax cuts for the wealthy, and the Republicans invoke it when confronted with additional entitlement programs or additional spending on existing ones. A widening government deficit also seems similar to personal borrowing, an excess of which leads to reduced credit scores, calls from bill collectors, and possibly foreclosure. So it was natural to assume that a 'fiscal cliff' is simply a metaphorical warning of an especially threatening increase in the deficit.
Let's assume (speculatively but not unreasonably) that Bernake's introduction of this expression to steer the debate about this issue was intentional. If so, then it was the first manufactured and linguistically misrepresented fiscal crisis of the year. It will not be the last. Soon we'll see the "sequester" crisis, which is to spending what "the fiscal cliff" was to taxation. Congress has agreed to large cuts in both defense and domestic (non-entitlement) spending in order to reduce the deficit, but is now in a frantic effort to undo those promises so spending can continue. We can also expect an upcoming "crisis" about passing a budget (featuring the threat of a government shutdown), and despite the recent three-month extension the so-called "debt limit" still lurks in the background.
All of these exercises have at their core the problem of speaking clearly about deficits. Passing a coherent budget is difficult because it requires politicians to explicitly vote for deficit spending, and of course the "debt limit" is about refusing to borrow to pay for spending that you've already committed to do and have refused to fund by any other means.
One reason speaking clearly about deficits is hard is because of the entrenched language that is used to speak about the process by which a government funds its activities, a process which is described as "borrowing." A second reason is that both major parties are invested in using deficit fear strategically.
Describing the process by which the United States government funds its activities as involving "borrowing" suggests a false analogy between government borrowing and the borrowing an individual or a family does. The analogy makes some sense for a public entity that does not print its own currency - for example, the state of California, or (the Euro-employing) country of Greece. And the analogy also made much more sense during the true gold standard era in this country. For these reasons, and because the government does issue bonds that look like corporate bonds, the vocabulary is entrenched. But a government borrowing in a currency it controls (and can print) has little in common with the borrowing we experience as ordinary citizens. Its benefits - creating jobs and income that prevent a self-perpetuating downward spiral in a slack economy - are not benefits associated with private borrowing. Likewise, its risks - the possibility of inflation, "crowding out" private investment in capital markets, or changing exchange rates - are not factors any individual has experience with through their private borrowing.
Sadly even many experts do not precisely understand the benefits and risks of government financing through deficits. The short-term benefits in terms of jobs and income are clear (just ask any lobbyist who wants to maintain spending on their priorities, or avoid taxation of their clients). But while there are certainly risks to excessive government debt, controversy continues to rage about when or how these risks would occur, or what level of debt will create them.
Politicians understand this well, and that's why for decades both parties have subordinated deficit reduction to short-term policy goals. Republicans are willing to put deficit reduction second to tax reduction, and Democrats are willing to prioritize preserving key entitlements or reducing unemployment. Behind the scenes, we have Dick Cheney's famous comment that "Reagan proved deficits don't matter." But in front of the camera, both parties cooperate in generating periodic deficit "crises" to cudgel their opponents and get them to give way on their more central priorities.
A great deal of maneuvering on domestic policy can be understood as the strategic deployment of the "deficit" charge against your opponent while working behind the scenes to keep the debt machine going for your own purposes.
Deciding on the right economic course is already difficult. What will happen in an economy is affected very deeply by widely-held beliefs about what will happen, to such a degree that philosophical notions of objective reality do not smoothly apply to the domain of economics. We can add to that complexity the fact that there is entrenched vocabulary that has proven to be misleading, as well as strategic pretense by both major parties to exploit the resulting false beliefs. The fact that our experts may need to rely on intentionally misleading vocabulary to sway us to act in an emergency is understandable.
There are nevertheless clear dangers in continuing to exploit the public's confusion about fiscal policy when it is useful, and using rhetoric and propaganda to steer public opinion when it is not.
First, there are dangers to the economy. The 2011 debt limit showdown almost resulted in a totally unnecessary default on government debt, something that could significantly increase government borrowing costs and trigger a real crisis to replace the fake one. Secondly, there are risks to our democracy. A "tyrant" may lead the public to vote for him, making up for obvious flaws by playing up the risks of an already exaggerated threat. Perhaps even in difficult situations, avoiding the risks of democracy that were clear even to the ancients requires us to discourage politicians from treating the multitude as fools.

HEADLINE: Jacob Lew, Mary Jo White and Dunbar's Number

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: It is important for the president's nominees to head the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission to have sufficient ties outside banking circles, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Jacob J. Lew, the president's nominee for Treasury secretary, and Mary Jo White, the nominee for chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, are making financial reformers nervous. The issue is not so much their track record, because neither has worked directly on financial-sector policy issues; it is much more about whom they know.
Specifically, how many people do they know and trust outside the financial sector, away from the sphere of influence of the very large banks? More pointedly, when it comes to thinking about financial-sector policy, who exactly is in their inner circle? 
Nobody knows a huge number of people, at least not well. In the language of anthropology and biology, the limit to a person's social network is known as Dunbar's Number - which is 147.5, although people often round it to 150. Our brains do not support the interactions required by larger social groups.
More precisely, the predicted size for most human groups, based mostly on the characteristics of our brains, is 100.2 to 231.1 people. For details and caveats, look at Robin Dunbar's 1993 paper, "Co-evolution of neocortical size, group size and language in humans," published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (Issue 16, Pages 681-735). Or just think about the number of people you know well and would rely on for advice, particularly with complex and sensitive issues. When you get to know new people, you often lose track of your previous close colleagues or even good friends.
And what applies to ordinary mortals most definitely applies to the people elected or appointed to run the country. Whenever the world gets complicated - for example, because the financial sector has turned nasty - policy makers need trusted sources and established confidants in order to figure out which way is up and what needs to be done.
If most financial experts you know work at, for example, Citigroup, then you are more likely to see the financial world through their eyes. What is good for Citi (and its executives) will, in your mind, become close to what is good for the United States.
One of the most serious concerns about Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was that even though he had never worked in a bank, his social network was full of bankers, mostly because of his time at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and his close connection with Robert Rubin, a former Treasury secretary and then a director of and senior adviser to Citigroup. In this network, many of Mr. Geithner's deepest financial-sector connections appear to have been with people who were working at Citigroup in 2007-8. (See, for example, a 2009 article by Jo Becker and Gretchen Morgenson.)
This observation lines up remarkably well with the devastating critique of Mr. Geithner in Sheila Bair's book, "Bull by the Horns." The main concern of Ms. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is that Mr. Geithner was too close to Citigroup and saw the world as its senior executives did.
As Treasury secretary, Mr. Geithner hired people from Citigroup - particularly people who had worked closely with Mr. Rubin (in government or in the private sector or both). Now Mr. Lew, a Citi alum with a central position in the Rubin network, is on the verge of becoming Treasury secretary. How likely is Mr. Lew to confront the risks created by unstable global megabanks? Does he personally know anyone who is concerned about the damage that Citigroup is likely to do in the future - or even has a critical view of what it has done in the past?
While Ms. White's reputation as a prosecutor is second to none, as a defense lawyer she represented executives at several of the largest banks and knows many prominent financial-sector executives. Her husband, John W. White, now a corporate lawyer, had a senior role at the S.E.C. when Christopher Cox was its chairman, a time when the S.E.C. was aiding and abetting excessive deregulation at every opportunity; Ms. White will need to step aside in actions against companies her husband has advised. To whom will Ms. White turn when she wants to understand how to make the financial sector safer?
If confirmed, Mr. Lew and Ms. White face formidable policy agendas. They need to demonstrate both an impressive grip of the details of what works in financial sector reform, as well as the ability to ignore a great deal of whining and to resist other pressure from the megabanks.
The most prominent and urgent case-in-point is that regulators need to complete the Volcker Rule. Mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, this rule will limit the risk-taking of very large banks.
The hitch at this point is primarily the S.E.C. All kinds of excuses can be and have been offered. These have no merit. Congress passed Dodd-Frank more than two years ago, and the regulators have issued draft rules and considered all the comments imaginable. The banking side of the equation - the Federal Reserve, the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency - is on board. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will not stand in the way. Everyone is waiting for the S.E.C. to pull the trigger.
If Ms. White cannot get the S.E.C. unstuck, the issue will fall to Mr. Lew, who as Treasury secretary is chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The legislative intent of Dodd-Frank on this point is clear; I've confirmed this by asking legislators what they intended. If a single regulator gets hung up on an issue, the oversight council can override that regulator - to prevent the kind of impasses and lacunas that previously created vulnerabilities in the regulatory system.
Even Mr. Geithner, not the world's most dynamic reformer, used the power of the oversight council to press the S.E.C. forward on changing the rules for money-market funds. (Interestingly, the Fed has long wanted these rules changed - and Mr. Geithner's social network obviously includes some top Fed officials.)
Is Mr. Lew willing to push the S.E.C. - perhaps by supporting Ms. White in a forceful fashion - on issuing and implementing the Volcker Rule? Hopefully, this will be a central question in both their confirmation hearings (with the Senate Finance Committee for Mr. Lew and the Senate Banking Committee for Ms. White).
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, writing recently for Politico, made the most important point: the administration will only get serious about financial reform when it appoints officials with different attitudes - and, I would say, different social networks - from those who were at Treasury and the S.E.C. over the last four years.
"Personnel is policy," people in Washington often remark. The next round of appointments, including those at the deputy and under secretary level, is very important. At this point, I am not optimistic about who will get these jobs.
Is the second Obama administration hiring people who understand and can implement financial reform? Or is it again merely promoting people whose social networks are disproportionately tilted toward the big Wall Street banks?

HEADLINE: Right Flight

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The commentators of the extreme right wing are still talking, but, increasingly, it's to themselves. 

 BODY:
In early January, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin made another scary appearance in Drudge Report, the Internet aggregator known for recasting all things ho-hum into something breathless and apocalyptic. Pictures of the two worst mass murderers ever were used above a headline: "White House Threatens 'Executive Orders' on Guns."
Oh, my. And the executive orders? Well, the president called for a safe and responsible gun owner campaign, better coordination and tracking of sales, and research into the causes and prevention of firearms violence, among other small steps. 
The Hitler hit was so over-the-top that it prompted the Anti-Defamation League to issue a plea to stop comparisons that are "historically inaccurate and offensive, especially to Holocaust survivors and their families."
Rush Limbaugh, who sits atop the right-wing media food chain along with Drudge, has compared the president to Hitler for years. On Fox News, Hitler allusions are less overt, but crazy talk about Obama -- dating to a 2008 suggestion that Michelle Obama's playful knuckle bump with her husband may have been "a terrorist fist jab" -- is the stock in trade.
The good news is that these people are talking mostly to themselves, from inside the much-ridiculed bubble that burst in spectacular fashion last November, while fewer and fewer voters are listening to them.

Yes, the pyramid of political dissemination is still in place: from Drudge, to Rush, to Fox, to Republican politicians in green rooms, trickling down to all the lesser Drudges and Rushes in the wacko-sphere.
They wheeze and whiff and hyperventilate. They claim there is a war on this, and a war on that (Christmas, God, golf pros). They have one mode: outrage, designed to get the pulse up, to generate a flight or fight reaction. But for all their huffing and puffing, the bloviators of the far right can no longer blow any houses down; most Americans couldn't care less. 
Thus, after a month of gun proposals, an Inaugural Address touting mainstream liberal values and yet another showdown with Republicans in Congress, President Obama just posted a 60 percent favorable rating in the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll -- his highest numbers in three years. Other polls have him lower, but he's still more popular than any of the major players active in Washington.
All of which is to say Obama should have saved his breath for stronger targets when he went after the influence that kooks with microphones have on kooks in Congress. We might be able to solve more of our problems, Obama said last week, "if a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest."
There followed the predictable faux outrage on a certain news network, under accompanied by the chyron: "War on Fox?"
The lash, Mr. President, is now a straw. Witness Limbaugh this week, trying to gin up opposition to bipartisan immigration reform. "It's up to me and Fox News" to stop it, he said. Drudge did his bit as well, posting a picture of a manacled man, brown-skinned and convict-looking, his exposed abs tattooed with an Obama image, and the headline "Let My People Go." 
Over the last year, Limbaugh has lost significant advertisers and whatever respect he still had among a handful of decent Republicans after he called the Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke "a slut" and "a prostitute." Many in the press and on the political stage are still afraid of him, but they should remember the words of the late Molly Ivins: being attacked by Limbaugh, said the bard of Texas, "was an experience somewhat akin to being gummed by a newt. It doesn't actually hurt, but it leaves you with slimy stuff on your ankle."
In January, Fox suffered its worst prime-time ratings since 2001 among the coveted age 25 to 54 demographic. And Drudge, even though he's followed hourly by Beltway obsessives, did not even crack the Top 15 most visited Web news sites in the Pew Research Center survey that came out last year. Just 2 percent of those polled by Pew listed Drudge as their main online source for political news.
In truth, Drudge, though admirable as a bootstrap story, is a tool. Limbaugh is a tool. Fox is a tool. They are used to punish dissidents, people who actually try to govern and a range of enemies. Ken Mehlman, campaign manager for George W. Bush, bragged how he used Drudge to bring down John Kerry in the 2004 election. 
But it's a different era now. In the summer of 2011, House Speaker John Boehner sought Limbaugh's approval of his insane plan to bring the economy to a halt by holding hostage what had been a routine debt ceiling measure. He made this show of fealty to a professional gasbag before he even revealed it to his conference. You saw how well that worked out, leading to the lowest Congressional approval ratings in the history of modern polling. 
And while Mitt Romney played the Drudge Report to help him slay rivals in the primary, the same alliance got him nowhere in the general election. 
So yes, Fox and friends can still crush their own, as Obama noted. But that only drives the Republican Party further to the fringes. Virtually everything the broadcast bullies are against -- sensible gun measures, immigration reform, raising taxes on the rich -- are favored by a majority of Americans.
It makes sense, then, that the logical next step for these folks is to retreat into an actual bubble of brick and mortar -- their own city. Glenn Beck has announced plans to build "Independence, U.S.A.," a sort of new urbanism for paranoids. In that world, at least, all the fantasies of the far right are always true.

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Seeks to Block Anheuser's Deal for Modelo

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Justice Department has sued to block Anheuser-Busch InBev's proposed $20.1 billion deal to buy control of Grupo Modelo of Mexico, the first major roadblock in a decade of consolidation by brewers around the world. 

 BODY:
 8:57 p.m. | Updated 
For more than a decade, the world's biggest brewers have been swallowing competitor after competitor as they grapple with slowing growth in many markets. Now, the Obama administration wants to cut them off.
The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block Anheuser-Busch InBev's $20.1 billion deal to buy Grupo Modelo, the Mexican maker of Corona beer, saying that the merger would cement Anheuser-Busch InBev's control of the market and enable it to continue to raise beer prices. Grupo Modelo is the third-biggest beer company in the United States. 
"This is the sort of product that matters to consumers," William J. Baer, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a conference call with reporters. "If you have a very slight price increase that happens because of this deal, it could mean that consumers will pay billions of dollars more."
The lawsuit is the first major roadblock in a decade of consolidation by brewers around the world, which has reduced the industry to only a few major players, primarily multinationals that own a majority of big brands.
At the top worldwide is Anheuser-Busch InBev, itself the product of a 2008 merger between a St. Louis-based icon and a Belgian-Brazilian brewing juggernaut. To compensate for slow growth in developed economies like the United States, the company has been seeking significant footholds in emerging markets like Mexico.
Since the middle of 2008, the brewer has announced more than 15 takeovers, according to Capital IQ.
The government's lawsuit details how in California, a price war among the biggest brewers had led Anheuser to complain in internal documents that Modelo's strategy was "eating [Budweiser's] lunch." According to the suit, a sales executive said that "California is a burning platform" for Anheuser.
With the lawsuit, the Justice Department is again flexing its aggressive antitrust muscle. It is the biggest deal to be opposed since 2011, when the government sued to stop AT&T's proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. (Those companies abandoned the deal.)
The antitrust action is in an industry that previous administrations had allowed waves of consolidation. Anheuser-Busch InBev; the acquisitive SABMiller, which is one of MillerCoors's parents; and Grupo Modelo have 72 percent of the $80 billion American beer market, giving them enormous power over pricing.
Despite the explosion of smaller breweries in recent years, industry analysts say that the craft beer market makes up just 6 percent of beer sales.
The biggest in the market, Anheuser - brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois - has raised its prices with regularity every year, with MillerCoors following suit, the Justice Department said.
"Even small price increases could lead to significant harm," Mr. Baer said.
Like AT&T, which ferociously battled the government's case for months, Anheuser-Busch InBev has promised a fight. In a statement, the company said, "We remain confident in our position, and we intend to vigorously contest the D.O.J.'s action in federal court."
Yet behind the scenes, the two sides will continue to try to reach a settlement.
Analysts were divided over how significant a hurdle the lawsuit posed. In a research note on Thursday, analysts at UBS wrote that the case wasn't a "deal breaker," expecting Anheuser to give up what they called "reasonable" concessions.
Anheuser has long pursued the benefits of consolidation, including opportunities to cut costs. Last summer, the company agreed to buy the 50 percent that it did not already own in Modelo, a deal that would give it full control of Corona, the United States' top imported beer brand.
"In this case, there are pretty significant synergies," said Harry Schuhmacher, the editor of Beer Business Daily. "Anheuser can afford to overpay for Modelo and is eager to."
He added that he believed the Modelo deal was the end of beer deals for a long time, especially among the beer giants. Some consolidation could still be in store among smaller companies.
The Justice Department's lawsuit is the first prominent antitrust action on the watch of Mr. Baer, who took over as President Obama's top antitrust lawyer at the beginning of the year. Mr. Baer, who previously worked at the Federal Trade Commission and in private practice at the law firm Arnold & Porter, is the first permanent antitrust chief since August 2011, when Christine A. Varney stepped down.
Ms. Varney left the government to join Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where she is now leading Modelo's antitrust defense.
The Justice Department contends that taking over full control of Modelo would give Anheuser overwhelming control both nationally and in markets like California, Texas and New York.
Mindful of potential antitrust issues, Anheuser has proposed selling Modelo's 50 percent stake in Crown Imports, the main importer of Corona in the United States, to Constellation Brands for nearly $1.9 billion. Anheuser has said that Crown is what dictates the prices of Modelo products, and that selling the stake removes any say that it would have in the matter.
But the Justice Department called that offer a "facade," arguing that Crown's dependence on Modelo products makes it effectively subject to Anheuser's wishes. The government's lawsuit highlighted an internal e-mail from Crown's chief executive, Bill Hackett, to employees that read, "Our #1 competitor will now be our supplier."
Since the Modelo deal's announcement last June, consumer advocacy groups have called for government intervention.
"Obviously, beer is different from most other goods and services because there are significant public health issues relating to alcohol," said Sandeep Vaheesan, special counsel at the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit group that supports stronger enforcement of the antitrust laws. "But an antitrust analysis looks strictly at promoting competitive prices, product innovation and consumer choice, and this deal thwarts those objectives."
Thursday's lawsuit is the most prominent setback in the deal-making career of Carlos Brito, Anheuser's chief executive. Mr. Brito helped lead the growth of AmBev, a regional Brazilian brewer, into a global giant through a successive series of takeovers.
"I'm not sure if this is the end, but Brito's a guy who's used to getting what he wants," said Lew Bryson, a writer who follows the beer industry. "InBev isn't a company that's growing much organically. It's grown by acquisition."

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Names Interim Replacement for Khuzami

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission named a veteran agency prosecutor, George Canellos, to be its acting enforcement chief on Thursday, positioning him as one of the top cops on Wall Street. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission named a longtime agency prosecutor, George Canellos, to be its acting enforcement chief on Thursday, positioning him as one of the top cops on Wall Street. 
The appointment will fill a crucial spot that opened with the looming departure of Robert Khuzami, a former terrorism prosecutor who joined the S.E.C. in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr. Khuzami was credited with revamping the agency's enforcement unit after it suffered embarrassing blunders like missing Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme.
Mr. Canellos, who served as Mr. Khuzami's top deputy, was long considered a front-runner to replace him. The pair are close friends, and Mr. Canellos is believed to have benefited from Mr. Khuzami's backing. 
"George is highly respected for his intellect, prosecutorial instincts, and commitment to tough and fair enforcement of the federal securities laws," Mr. Khuzami said in a statement. "His service will benefit both the S.E.C.'s talented and hard-working staff and the investing public."
But it is unclear whether the "acting" appointment, which kicks in when Mr. Khuzami departs on Feb, 8, will be short lived. Elisse B. Walter, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman who named Mr. Canellos to the interim spot, is expected to step down later this year. President Obama last week nominated Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, as her replacement, opening the agency's roster to significant upheaval. 
The appointment bodes well for Mr. Canellos, who cut his prosecutorial teeth under Ms. White in New York. He spent nearly a decade there, serving as head of the so-called major crimes unit and senior trial counsel for the Wall Street task force.
But Ms. White could choose to pick her own enforcement chief, and she is expected to attract a deep list of candidates. Mr. Canellos also faces opposition from some enforcement officials, who are seeking a broad leadership change after Mr. Khuzami's four-year tenure. 
Still, Mr. Canellos beat out a range of candidates on Thursday for the interim spot. Ms. Walter was reportedly interested in Matthew T. Martens, the enforcement division's chief litigation counsel, and David P. Bergers, director of the S.E.C.'s Boston office. Instead, Mr. Bergers will slide into the deputy role Mr. Canellos will soon vacate. 
Mr. Canellos, an avid motorcycle rider until a recent crash landed him in the emergency room, came to Washington last year when Mr. Khuzami named him to the No. 2 spot. A former partner at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, he previously served as head of the S.E.C.'s New York office, a hub for many of the agency's biggest Wall Street enforcement cases. In that role, he oversaw some 400 enforcement lawyers, accountants and other investigators. 
"It is an honor and inspiration to serve with such talented and dedicated colleagues throughout the S.E.C.," Mr. Canellos said in the statement. "I look forward to continuing to work with them as we emerge from a historic restructuring and confront new challenges."

HEADLINE: Markey and Lynch Outline Visions in Vying for Massachusetts Senate Seat

BYLINE: JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats offer two approaches in seeking to replace John Kerry in the Senate: moderation or liberal fealty. 

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The declared candidates in Massachusetts' special Senate election, Representative Edward J. Markey and Representative Stephen F. Lynch, gave Democrats a first glimpse into their primary contest Thursday night, with Mr. Lynch casting himself as a candidate who can appeal to political moderates, while Mr. Markey focused on his liberal stands.
The two separately addressed a meeting of the state's Democratic State Committee, held at the Boston Teachers Union in the Dorchester neighborhood, bookending a joint appearance by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator John Kerry. 
Mr. Kerry was his final hours on the job before he becomes Secretary of State, creating the vacancy Mr. Lynch and Mr. Markey are vying to fill. Also present was William Cowan, who was appointed this week to fill Mr. Kerry's seat until the special election in June.
Speaking first, Mr. Lynch, who formally announced his candidacy at a union-hall rally in South Boston earlier on Thursday, made an appeal to a political establishment that initially seemed eager to avoid a primary after Mr. Markey announced his candidacy in December.
Drawing on his record as a moderate Democrat, Mr. Lynch argued that he would be better suited than Mr. Markey to defeat Scott P. Brown, the former Republican senator who won his seat in a special election in 2010 but lost to Ms. Warren in November, and who is considered a likely candidate for the Republican nomination in the race. Mr. Lynch recalled how Mr. Brown made a concerted effort to reach out to independent voters and presented himself as an everyman with working-class roots.
"I think if there's anyone that can take away that base, that formula from Scott Brown, that can take away the regular-guy, the working-family mantra away from Scott Brown, I think it's myself," said Mr. Lynch, who said he would be better suited than Mr. Markey to court independent voters. "I think I offer the Democratic Party an opportunity."
"Look, I had a pickup truck too," he continued, referring to the vehicle that regularly made appearances on the campaign trail with Mr. Brown. "I was an ironworker for 19 years and I know what it's like to stand in an unemployment line."
Mr. Markey spoke after Mr. Kerry bid farewell to the group, and he came out swinging, eliciting cheers from the crowd as he declared his support for women's rights, gay rights and action on climate change, making a general-election-style argument that broadly pitted Democratic ideals against Republican ones.
"The Obama agenda is going to be on the table in a referendum in June in the state of Massachusetts," Mr. Markey said, echoing a campaign theme frequently used by Ms. Warren, who often highlighted the national implications of her race against Mr. Brown. "I ask that you send a signal to the U.S.A., to Karl Rove, to the Koch brothers."
Mr. Markey has $3 million in campaign funds to Mr. Lynch's $750,000, and has high-profile endorsements, while Mr. Lynch has none. He did not acknowledge Mr. Lynch by name, and made only a single, curt mention of the primary election.
"The primary, believe it or not, is in 90 days," said Mr. Markey. "You wanna know something about the Democrats in Massachusetts? They do not agonize, they organize."
Mr. Lynch played up his underdog status at his rally earlier in the day, presenting himself as both a political outsider and an committed Democrat.
"It's uphill," he told reporters. "If the election were held today, I would lose, I admit that, but the election's not today. That's what the campaign's going to be about."
His "everyman" message seemed to resonate with the hundreds of mostly male supporters -- including members of some 26 unions, according to Mr. Lynch's speech -- who turned out for the rally in South Boston, which is part of his Congressional district.
"Down in his soul, he is a solid, blue-collar kid," said Jim Regan, a plumber, who took the train there from Braintree, Mass., and who is a registered Democrat. "I'm a blue-collar guy, and he understands my family. A guy like this going for the Senate is a win for the working man."
Mr. Markey has his first major campaign rally planned for Saturday.

HEADLINE: Can Obama Do for the Grid What Eisenhower Did for Highways?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama should continue to build the electricity side of his energy policy around a smart grid. 

 BODY:
 12:21 p.m. | Updated | 
Building on earlier discussions of President Obama's options on energy and the environment, here's a "Your Dot" contribution from Lee C. Harrison, a frequent comment contributor who'se a senior research associate at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center of the University of Albany:
The United States is one of the most favored nations for combined wind and solar resources. Few people are surprised that our solar energy availability is highest in the southwest deserts, but many do not appreciate the degree to which wind energy is strongest at sea along the coasts, and in a stripe down the central plains states. Detractors of renewable energy often claim that 'the intermittency problem' prevents wind and solar power ever providing anything beyond a small fraction of our nation's energy. This claim is simply untrue. A recent study [footnote 1] shows that even the Atlantic region of the United States can achieve electric energy self-sufficiency, using a combination of wind and solar, aided by storage which is feasible today. However it will be both more advantageous and lower cost if the United States commits to the construction of a true national power distribution grid.
 
The contiguous lower 48 states span three time zones, and usually have two to three frontal weather systems moving across them. Both wind and solar availability are affected by the moving systems; averaging across the United States makes the fractional variability much smaller. To achieve this we need a far more capable distribution grid, turning the 48 states (and likely much of Canada and northern Mexico) into a single unified power pool, capable of moving large amounts of power. Studies demonstrate this is practical today, and would result in economies even without renewable energy, because it would reduce the number of power plants which must be built/maintained, and creates a bidding pool far more resistant to price manipulation. It strongly improves the case for wind and solar if it can ship power from the areas of strong resource to markets far away. [footnote 2]
Improvements in how we use energy are economic "low-hanging fruit" and are already underway. We need improvement in building efficiency and particularly air-conditioning. It is the latter which is the largest driver of peak electrical loads. 
Peak loads correlate very well with solar availability (for obvious reasons) but locally the peak lasts later than the sun does. Improved building performance and AC performance trim this; AC systems which "store coolth" are straightforward and increasing in use today. Solar power shipped from the American southwest can handle east-coast loads (the majority of US electrical consumption) well after sunset.
Power management can also be done on the "demand side" by implementing near-realtime pricing to end-users Some storage or backup/peaking power generation will still be needed. 
This transition need not be difficult or costly given a national grid. An obvious example is "the Portuguese model." They simply use their existing fossil power plants as backup. Fossil-fueled peaking/backup plants will produce little CO2 output as long as their duty cycle is small, and their other pollutants become more tolerable too. As battery cars and plug-hybrids become more common the storage capacity and load-shifting (for charging) of the transportation fleet becomes very favorable in terms of load management -- ditto the potential to use the fleet of parked batteries to assist during peak loads.
Nothing stops us now other than the lack of national political will to overcome inertia and the entrenched regional and state regulatory oligopolies. We need an "Eisenhower Interstate" program for a national electrical grid. It can then make fossil-powered generation intermittent!

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank's Restructuring Weighs On Results

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Deutsche Bank posts a $3 billion loss in the fourth quarter. | Facebook's earnings give investors reasons for optimism and some cause for concern. | A government lawyer who secured a conviction of Raj Rajaratnam is headed to a private firm. | Research in Motion changes its name to BlackBerry, underscoring its bet on that brand. 

 BODY:
It has been a difficult turnaround for Deutsche Bank. The big German financial firm said on Thursday that it lost 2.2 billion euros ($3 billion) in the fourth quarter, as it was hit by legal costs and expenses related to its restructuring. "The results underline the task ahead for Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the co-chief executives who took over the bank less than seven months ago and have declared their intention to deal more severely with the legacy of the financial crisis," Jack Ewing writes in DealBook.
 The firm said "significant" charges related to legal proceedings contributed to the loss, without giving specifics. The bank, which avoided a bailout in the financial crisis, has been hit with numerous lawsuits and official investigations, including a tax-evasion inquiry that led to a raid on the company's headquarters last month. In addition, Deutsche Bank's leaders have pledged to reduce the firm's risky activities, a process that can involve booking losses.
But such strategic efforts are starting to show signs of working. The firm said revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent, to 7.9 billion euros. 
"This is the most comprehensive reconfiguration of Deutsche Bank in recent times," Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Jain said in a statement. They warned that "deliberate but sometimes uncomfortable change" lay ahead, adding that "this journey will take years not months."
FACEBOOK'S MIXED REVIEWS | Facebook's earnings gave investors reasons for optimism and some cause for concern. The company said revenue rose by 40 percent, to $1.59 billion, in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' expectations, after an aggressive push to ramp up advertising. But expenses also rose rapidly as the company hired engineers and built data centers. Facebook reported net income of $64 million, or 3 cents a share.
Facebook's shares, which have been on a roller-coaster ride over the company's eight months on the public market, fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading as the results were released. "It's important to start planting seeds," Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said, cautioning that profit might not grow as fast as investors would like.
"The most closely watched part of the earnings report was how much money the company brought in from its mobile users," Somini Sengupta writes in The New York Times. "Facebook said advertising on the mobile newsfeed accounted for 23 percent of its advertising revenue, up from 14 percent in the third quarter but slightly lower than some analysts had forecast." Over the long term, Facebook's biggest challenge "remains how to profit from the enormous piles of personal data of its one billion users without alienating them or inviting the wrath of government regulators in the United States and abroad."
"The quarter was a little like a cold shower after you've been out all night - it's something that makes you sober up very quickly," said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.
 PROMINENT PROSECUTOR IS EXPECTED TO JOIN PRIVATE SECTOR | A government lawyer who secured a conviction of Raj Rajaratnam on insider trading charges and led the successful prosecution of Rajat K. Gupta is leaving the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. The lawyer, Reed Brodsky, is joining Gibson Dunn & Crutcher as a partner in the white-collar criminal defense practice, the law firm is expected to announce on Thursday, according to DealBook's Peter Lattman.
 Mr. Brodsky is the latest government lawyer to head to the private sector. Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said he was stepping down on Wednesday. The two prosecutors who tried Mr. Rajaratnam with Mr. Brodsky, Jonathan R. Streeter and Andrew Z. Michaelson, have already moved on to corporate law firms. "Reed is a star in federal prosecutorial circles," said Randy M. Mastro, co-head of Gibson Dunn's litigation practice.
Mr. Brodsky was known as a workhorse around the office, Mr. Lattman writes. "But Mr. Brodsky was also a show horse. Fresh faced and animated, Mr. Brodsky endeared himself to juries with an impassioned, eloquent presentation. He could also be tenacious and combative in the courtroom, frequently butting heads with his adversaries."
ON THE AGENDA | The Blackstone Group, Nasdaq OMX, MasterCard, Royal Dutch Shell and United Parcel Service report earnings on Thursday morning. Russell Wasendorf, the founder of the Peregrine Financial Group, is to be sentenced at 10 a.m. on charges of mail fraud, embezzlement and lying to regulators. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission holds a public round table starting at 9:30 a.m. to discuss the "futurization" of the swaps market. Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts is on Bloomberg TV at 3 p.m. Shawn Matthews, chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, is on CNBC at 4 p.m.
BLACKBERRY'S COMEBACK ATTEMPT | As it introduced a new product line on Wednesday, the maker of the BlackBerry also changed its name from Research in Motion to simply BlackBerry, underscoring its bet on that brand. "But because the new name is now tied to the company's hopes of restoring its main product's status as a symbol of executive cool, the change carries some risk," Ian Austen writes in The New York Times. The company's ticker symbol on Nasdaq is also changing to BBRY from RIMM. For context, DealBook put together an abridged history of corporate rebranding.
"BlackBerry 10 arrives long after Apple's iPhone and phones using Google's Android operating system have come to dominate the smartphone market, so its success is anything but assured," Mr. Austen writes. According to an industry research group, "BlackBerry now holds just 4.6 percent of that market, about one-tenth of its peak market share. Analysts are concerned about how long it will take for the phones to go on sale in the United States." Still, the products have gotten some favorable reviews.
Those on Wall Street may miss one feature in particular. BrickBreaker, a simple game whose devotees have included Richard S. Fuld, formerly chief executive of Lehman Brothers, won't be installed on the new devices, DealBook's Susanne Craig reports. The company said it wanted to encourage third-party developers to make versions of the classic game, which is still played by Richard B. Handler, the chief executive of the Jefferies Group.
