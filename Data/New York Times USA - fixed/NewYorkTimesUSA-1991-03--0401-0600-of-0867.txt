HEADLINE: Market Place;
Failure Group Thrives on Disaster

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
After the brief Persian Gulf war, in which very little went wrong for the allied forces, it may be seem odd that a company called the Failure Group Inc. sees a lucrative postwar role for itself. But Failure, the nation's largest consulting firm devoted to analysis of accidents and disasters, figures its skills are sorely needed.
"Just as an example, every oil storage tank with a bullet hole in it should be structurally analyzed before it is repaired," said Piotr Moncarz, vice president in charge of the company's structural and stress analysis group. "If you just put a steel plate over it, it may burst." 
 How much business the Failure Analysis Group, the company's operating arm, gains from the reconstruction will depend largely on subcontracting decisions by engineeering concerns like the Bechtel Group Inc., which are expected to coordinate much of the work. In the meantime, Failure consultants at nine North American and three European offices have plenty of work, which is one reason the stock has become a Wall Street favorite.
"Economic cycles come and go; product failures and disasters do not," said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Prudential Securities, which helped manage Failure's initial public stock offering last August at $13 a share.
On Wednesday, with Failure's top executives in New York to talk to investment managers, the stock rose to $27 on record volume in over-the-counter trading. It continued upward yesterday, reaching $28.50, before closing at $27.125, up 12.5 cents.
The run-up has been so sharp that Dirk Godsey, who follows the Menlo Park, Calif., company for Hambrecht & Quist, the co-manager of the initial offering, no longer projects that the stock will outpace the market.
Fittingly, Failure's initial offering was delayed for three days by the explosion of a Consolidated Edison transformer in New York, which knocked out power to Prudential Securities and several other firms participating in the deal but led to a new consulting job for the company.
In a measure of how differently the company and Wall Street look at the world, the company insisted on using the ticker symbol "FAIL" over its investment bankers' objections.
"It doesn't matter if 99 percent of the market does not understand this company," Roger L. McCarthy, Failure's chief executive, said in an interview at the company's headquarters. "The other 1 percent is enough to fund our needs."
Founded in 1967 by five young engineers with Ph.D.'s from Stanford University, Failure now has some 500 employees. It reported income of $3.5 million on revenues of more than $35 million in the six months that ended Nov. 30. Mrs. Conigliaro expects earnings to continue to grow at an annual rate of more than 20 percent through 1993, regardless of whether the company gains any Persian Gulf business.
Failure's strength is the variety of engineering expertise and experience that it can apply to figuring out what went wrong -- or might go wrong -- with almost any human product or endeavor. The company says that its data base of accidents is the largest and most detailed in the country.
In addition, the company has become a leader in developing animated presentations of such engineering problems as how a component fails or how pollution moves through soil to contaminate groundwater. Such presentations make mountains of engineering data easier for juries, corporate executives and other laymen to understand.
"They have a tremendous array of experts," said Jack Dinan, a spokesman on environmental and safety issues for the General Motors Corporation, which accounted for more than 20 percent of Failure's revenues last year. Failure's most recent project for G.M. involved a study comparing the effectiveness of seat belts and air bags in different vehicles of all manufacturers, based on accident records in every state.
Figuring out what caused past vehicle accidents or how to change designs to help prevent future ones accounts for more than half of Failure's current workload. But the company has also been studying, and in some cases simulating, disasters like the 1985 crash of a Delta Air Lines jet at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, the 1987 fire at the Du Pont Hotel in San Juan, P.R., and the explosion and fire in 1988 on an Occidental Petroleum oil platform in the North Sea.
It has also consulted on numerous fires and warehouses at factories and industrial plants, as well as component failures on the space shuttle. The company works primarily with big industrial companies, but is also currently working with the Defense Department on materials research to create stronger armor.
At the other end of the scale, Failure has taken on assignments as modest as analyzing why a homeowner on a metal ladder received a shock from a power tool. Big or small, the engagements are carried out with a minimum of fanfare and not just because the results are frequently used as evidence in lawsuits.
"We keep a low profile because the nature of our business requires decorum," said Mr. McCarthy, the lanky 42-year-old mechanical engineer who has headed the company since 1982.
Operating out of a large office packed with cameras, fountain pens and books on disaster, Mr. McCarthy sets a busy pace for the company by traveling up to 300,000 miles a year on consulting jobs.
Senior Failure consultants charge up to $450 an hour. "We are the most expensive engineering company in the nation," Mr. McCarthy said, noting that Government agencies can rarely afford Failure's services. "It's not even close."
High fees allow the company to pay the highest salaries in the industry, with the Ph.D.'s from the top schools at which it recruits starting at more than $50,000. The annual turnover in its technical staff is an unusually low 3 percent, Mr. McCarthy said.
Typically, Failure competes for work against university professors or engineers who have left big companies and who operate alone or in small groups. As it has grown, Failure has repeatedly redivided into small profit centers. "If you are not going to lose out to 10-man niche companies, you have to have 10-man profit centers," Mr. McCarthy said.
Some of these profit centers now sell software programs and diagnostic equipment that Failure has developed. The SSam-2, for example, is a remotely controlled device to retrieve minute samples of material from inaccessible locations like the inside of pipes in a power plant.
The company also markets data management services separately, exploiting its skills and computer investments made to organize and manipulate vast amounts of technical information for clients like G.M.

Wholesome Enough for Children

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Michael Craig-Martin makes Conceptual art of an unusually public sort: handsome, accessible, with a sense of common good and shared fun. Mr. Craig-Martin, who was born in Ireland in 1941 and who attended college in the United States in the early 1960's, has lived in London since 1966. Although well known in London as an artist and a teacher, he is making his American debut in the "Projects" series at the Museum of Modern Art and in a show at the David Nolan Gallery in SoHo.
At the Modern, the stronger of the two showings, the artist's big sparkling black-on-white murals glide across the walls of the "Projects" gallery with uplifting clarity. (At Nolan, where the images shrink, or are executed on canvas, they start to seem merely illustrational and lose much of their evocative power.) 
 The pieces at the Modern have the economy of means of a Sol LeWitt or Lawrence Weiner wall piece; they are made of thin black architect's tape stuck directly to the wall. But Mr. Craig-Martin's work has an accessibility that few American Conceptualists allow themselves, which brings it closer to Pop Art but without Pop's irony. These murals are so sincere and wholesome, it's easy to imagine them on the walls of a school lobby, where they would undoubtedly make children excited about learning.
This is partly because the everyday objects that Mr. Craig-Martin's crisp lines so monumentally depict refer to the joys of knowledge: a book, a globe, a plain work table, a desk drawer and a light bulb are the motifs of the three murals at the Modern. But it is mainly because the artist's murals are like big optical puzzles that invite engagement.
Their interlocking or overlapping outlines continually flip back and forth, between transparent and solid, flat and dimensional, positive and negative. These shifts clarify the ways that lines can make, and unmake, images and the ways they can affirm or disrupt a spatial illusion; they heighten one's awareness of the partnership of the eye and mind.
The murals at the Modern each use line in a different way. In the first mural, on the gallery's right-hand wall, the five images are outlined in full, one directly on top of another. This transparent pileup is hard to decipher; one realizes that the eye can't necessarily cope with a complete set of facts. In a second mural, which is nearly identical, the images are piled up again, but this time, certain lines are omitted, and this enables some motifs to take precedence over others.
In this arrangement, confusing transparency gives way to a sense of sculptural interlocking. It doesn't make strict spatial sense, but at least we can differentiate one form from another.
In the third and largest mural, which is the show's tour de force, the five images multiply to form an elongated magisterial procession, a rhythmic frieze. The lines now define discrete fully volumetric objects. Each book or light bulb has a clearly defined placement, either slightly in front of its neighbors or slightly behind them. The logic of spatial illusion finally triumphs.
If these works are like big enjoyable puzzles, they are also too easily digested, which can make them seem less like art than like inspired graphic design. This problem is aggravated when Mr. Craig-Martin's art leaves a commanding public space for the more private situation. The wall drawings downtown at the Nolan Gallery suffer from a reduction in scale; weaker still in that show are Mr. Craig-Martin's attempts to transfer single motifs onto monochrome canvases, despite an ingenious method of execution.
The images, a revolver, for example, are outlined in tape, the surface is painted over and then the tape is removed, creating a pristine incised effect. There, only the small drawings on paper, which appear to be drawn in ink but which are actually made with incredibly thin tape, retain the bold, engaging clarity of the works at the Modern.
"Projects 27: Michael Craig-Martin" remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, through April 24; additional works by the artist are at the David Nolan Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, through April 6.

HEADLINE: Hope in the Streets of Belgrade

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, has always claimed to speak for all Serbs when he insists that Yugoslavia's six republics must live in a centralized state and economy. The thousands of Serb protesters in Belgrade's streets demonstrate how massively wrong he is.
By weakening Mr. Milosevic, the demonstrators may well advance interests that Americans and friends of freedom share: to help avoid bloodshed and secure the human rights of ethnic minorities throughout Yugoslavia. 
 Mr. Milosevic wants to maintain the federation by force but Slovenia and Croatia resist. They are prepared to declare independence, but that would leave a substantial minority of Serbs within Croatia looking to Serbia for protection. The result could well be violence and civil war.
Last June, Mr. Milosevic condemned the looser confederation sought by Slovenia and Croatia. "Confederation," he said, "is not a state, but an alliance of states; therefore there can be no confederation, even if all political subjects of Yugoslavia wanted it, within . . . existing borders." The choice, as he framed it, was between the present Yugoslav state and a Greater Serbia.
He has further alienated his neighbors by trampling the rights of the Albanian majority in Serbia's Kosovo province. That made even more fearful the prospect of life in a Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. Mr. Milosevic, a hard-line Communist, remains devoted to central planning and is willing to pay for it with sordid manipulation. The most recent example was unilaterally printing $1.3 billion in dinars to meet the payrolls and pensions of workers in Serbia's failing state enterprises. Understandably, that shocked other regions -- and jeopardized the hopeful economic reforms of the current national Government.
For a time it seemed likely that in the elections due this fall he would be elected easily. But that was before his supposedly solid Serbian support turned to street protests. "We made a mistake," said one Serb. "We were thinking that Milosevic was a kind of Serbian Gorbachev."
Mr. Milosevic retains a potential ally in the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army, which might rally to his side and resist the dismantling of the unitary state and centrally planned economy. If it did that, civil war would almost surely result. But the army so far disavows any intention to intervene.
The erosion of Mr. Milosevic's political support opens the possibility of genuine dialogue among Yugoslavia's republics, leading either to loosened confederation or negotiated separation. Either would be an outcome Americans can endorse.

HEADLINE: Why Pay Ransom to OPEC?

 BODY:
OPEC decided earlier this week to cut oil production by about a million barrels a day in an attempt to control oil prices. The modest cut -- 5 percent -- is probably enough to keep prices from collapsing, but it's unlikely to push them much above the current $18 a barrel.
What price should Americans be rooting for? For some, the issue is simple: the price should be as low as possible because every extra dollar the U.S. pays OPEC is one less dollar for itself. For others, the issue is complicated by political factors: to protect the environment and reduce dependence on the politically volatile Middle East, the price should be high, perhaps even above OPEC's target of $21 a barrel, thus encouraging conservation. 
 In this case, the simple idea is better. The best OPEC price is the lowest OPEC price. The need to conserve energy can be handled by piling on taxes. Taxes are paid by some Americans to other Americans. That makes a lot more sense than paying ransom to OPEC.
 Oil prices have been falling since the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf and are now about the same as a year ago. With two of the largest oil exporters -- Iraq and Kuwait -- dormant, low prices might seem surprising. But oil production hasn't fallen very much because Saudi Arabia has raised its production by several million barrels a day. And demand for oil is weak because several large economies, including the U.S., are suffering economic slowdowns, if not recessions.
Falling oil prices are an economic blessing for the U.S. and other oil-importing nations. Living standards rise because the nation is forced to give up less food, chemicals and computers in exchange for foreign oil. That's important for rich countries, and a matter of life and death for poor countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Falling oil prices lower production costs, thereby making investment more profitable, and give a temporary reprieve from inflation.
Philip Verleger, an oil expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, makes a more subtle point: The U.S. needs low oil prices now to help build back stocks in anticipation of large needs next winter.
The drawback of lower oil prices is that they stimulate consumption, and that creates problems. Gasoline and other energy use pollutes air and water and contributes to global warming. Yet consumers pay for none of this damage. Nor do energy consumers pay the likely costs of future supply interruptions from the volatile Middle East or future military bills protecting Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oilfields.
The most effective way to make consumers pay the full cost of energy is to levy higher energy taxes. Americans would then switch to fuel-efficient cars, move closer to work, ride-share and make thousands of other decisions that would help protect the environment. And with higher energy taxes, Congress wouldn't need to micromanage new automobile technologies, light-bulb specifications and adoption of alternative fuels.
The best tax would apply to all fuels, or at least all carbon-based fuels. A gasoline tax would be a good second choice. How high would the tax need to be? The estimates range from 20 cents to $2 a gallon.
But disagreement over the level should not obscure the principle: Congress, not OPEC, has the responsibility to set the right price for America.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Democrats: The Burden of Error

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
I miss the Democratic Party. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming that the party I knew will suddenly reappear, if only for a minute, so I can introduce it to younger friends who never got to know it before it passed away.
I am not now, never was and never will be a member of the Democratic or Republican parties. I walk about ringing my journalistic bell to ward off contaminating political associations. I pick and choose from either party in elections for every office, alderman to President. 
 But throughout my youth and early adulthood, the Democratic Party represented those things that were central to my own life and hopes.
Democrats stood for decent breaks for the working man and his family -- unemployment benefits, minimum wages, collective bargaining, at least some medical insurance, civil liberty.
All those things -- they could be called respect -- had to be fought for, hard. Now all American society, including the Republican Party, takes them as unquestioned. That is the triumph and vindication of the old Democratic Party.
I saw Democrats as also fighting to protect this country against dreadful danger from abroad. They fought against Fascism before and during World War II and against the Communist takeover of Western Europe afterward.
For years, many Americans were edgy about the Republican Party because we saw it as isolationist, denying the fearfulness of the great cancer of our time -- dictatorships metastasizing through aggression.
That has changed, of course. But Americans still know that a party that is not strong enough to fight evil abroad cannot be trusted to fight evil at home. The whole blessed country knows it -- all except the leadership of the present Democratic Party.
The Democrats made one of the worst errors of American political history when all but a handful of them voted against allowing President Bush to use force against Saddam Hussein. Only the occasional blowhard questions their patriotism. And of course, it was the Republican Administration and Republican leaders of the Senate who slavered over Saddam Hussein until the eve of the invasion. But the Republicans and the President finally learned something about appeasement -- at least of Saddam Hussein.
So we have a right to question the judgment of those Democrats who voted against the President. And we can question the judgment and candor of those Democrats like Gov. Mario Cuomo and party leaders of the House and Senate who now try to justify themselves by saying that we will never know if sanctions without force would have worked.
They expect us to believe that the same Saddam Hussein who chose war after months of sanctions and who then withstood the most ferocious air bombardment in history might have folded and surrendered simply under the pressure of a few more months of continued embargo.
Yes, all right, Governor and Senators, proof of the unknowable is impossible to obtain; terrific point in a high school debating class. But among grown-ups, it is embarrassing for its lack of common sense and honesty of hindsight.
These politicians are making fools of themselves, which is their own business. But it is the country's business that they are reducing any chance the Democrats can give the electorate a respectable choice in the 1992 Presidential election.
Do they really believe that Americans would put their affairs into the hands of a candidate who not only opposed military action against Saddam Hussein but is too murky-minded or arrogant to drop the heavy baggage of that mistake and goes staggering on under it, crying "What mistake? What baggage?"
Elections for Congressional and local office prove over and over that on domestic matters Democrats hold out more ideas and more hope for a majority of Americans than do the Republicans.
But they won't get the chance to try out those ideas in the White House unless they now talk frankly to Americans. What's needed is a statement by the Democratic Congressional membership and Democratic governors on how the majority of them now see the world and this country's place in it.
At least it will show that some Democrats understand that the voter who does not trust a political party abroad is not likely to entrust it at home. And it might convince Americans that the party they knew may one day be more than a memory.

HEADLINE: Bush's Domestic Record Is His Achilles' Heel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You quote Jim Ruvolo, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, saying, "My sense is George Bush is getting close to unbeatable" (Political Memo, front page, Feb. 27). He does not speak for a vast number of Democrats who believe Mr. Bush will be vulnerable in the fall of 1992, Persian Gulf war notwithstanding.
Many of us believe that the Bush Administration's elitist economic policy, barren domestic social program and backward-looking energy and environmental programs have at least an even chance of catching up with the President by November of 1992. 
 We in Minnesota elected a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Senator in Paul Wellstone, who offered better answers for the challenges that face the country than his conservative, well-financed and heavily favored opponent did.
Yes, George Bush would win if the election were today. He is basking in the reflected glory our troops and their leaders have brought to our country and the international alliance of which we are a part.
But if he is entitled to share the triumph, he must also be held responsible for our recession and growing unemployment.
To the extent that this Administration fails to provide strong domestic leadership in the economy, energy, education and the environment, President Bush is at risk in 1992.
But if Democrats are buffaloed by Mr. Bush's success today, and fail to take our case aggressively to the American public, then 1992 could be a tough year indeed.

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis Will End Schools' Mentor Program

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
The Board of Education, which decided in more prosperous times that its teacher-mentor program was a luxury it could not do with out, now says it is a luxury it cannot afford.
The program was created to match veteran teachers with uncertified colleagues in the hope that a legacy of teaching could be passed on. But budget constraints have made that almost impossible, with the board laying off 550 of approximately 1,850 mentors in the last two weeks. The remaining mentors are expected to be dismissed after June. 
 The recent loss of so many people in the mentor program, which many teachers and school officials had viewed as a success, will mean that hundreds of uncertified teachers who depended on the mentors for teaching tips and support will be left to fend for themselves for the remainder of the school year.
"To start the term with the program and then fire us is heinous," said Delores Harris, a retired teacher who worked as a mentor at Intermediate School 14 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. "We had lessons planned and our days were set."
Mrs. Harris has filed a grievance with the United Federation of Teachers in an effort to block the layoffs. But that may have little effect: the layoffs were done with the union's approval.
Stanley Litow, the deputy chancellor for operations, said the layoffs would save more than $3 million this year. In September, when the board faces up to $650 million in city and state budget cuts, the program will be eliminated completely for a savings of $28 million, he said.
The mentor program began in 1987 after the public school system hired thousands of uncertified teachers to ease a shortage of qualified instructors, Since then, it has been credited with keeping many of the system's 4,300 new teachers from quitting, said Howard Gollub, who oversees the mentor program for the teachers' union.
"There is a dramatic difference in retention between teachers who have mentors and those who do not," Mr. Gollub said, adding that a report to be released later this month by the board praises the mentor program for stemming the city's high teacher attrition rate.
 
'It Has Improved My Teaching'
 Maureen Shelley, a teacher at I.S. 14 and one of the 2,700 new teachers to have a mentor, said the program has helped to improve the quality of teaching done by new instructors.
"It has improved my teaching 100 percent," said Ms. Shelley, who teaches a total of 160 children in five different classes and different grades, compared with the 22 she taught as a private school teacher.
"Obviously, I'm luckier than most teachers," said Ms. Shelley. "But to fire that kind of experience when teachers are leaving the profession is just a shame."
Ms. Shelley, who joined I.S. 14 in September, was matched with Mrs. Harris, who retired two years ago after teaching Spanish and French in public schools in Brooklyn for 26 years. Mrs. Harris has said she will continue as a mentor, despite being laid off.
Dr. Aaron Friedman, the principal at I.S. 14, said he understood the economic realities that led to a cut in the program, but he added that "from a professional standpoint, it's a loss."
"They should've at least left it in place until June," he said.
Mr. Litow said that any new teachers who were left without mentors can receive instruction on Saturdays at the LaGuardia High School of Music and Art in Manhattan.
"The school is in a critical situation," Mr. Litow said. "Obviously, if everybody hunkers down and stops focusing on which program is getting cut, it would be easier."
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the teachers' union, which fought for several years for the mentor program, said the loss of the program was "tremendous." But at a time of looming budget cuts, the program had to be considered a luxury.
"The small consolation," she said, "is that next year we probably won't be hiring any new teachers that would need the mentors."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 16, 1991, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the elimination of the New York City teacher-mentor program referred incorrectly to the status of the mentors, who help train new teachers. Of the 1,850 mentors, 550 are retired teachers, whom the board is laying off; the remaining mentors -- teachers who are not retired -- are to be reassigned within the system. The article also misstated the location of Intermediate School 14. It is in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, not Flatbush.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
The Powell-Cheney Relationship: Blunt Give-and-Take Early in Crisis

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The low point of the relationship between Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell came in the first hours after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, as the two men and their aides faced a giant map of the Arabian Peninsula in the Defense Secretary's cavernous office on the Pentagon's outer ring.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had privately confided to an associate that he believed that if the military was asked to intervene, it should not go in halfway. General Powell believed he would have to go in big. But because he was skeptical that the White House was willing to commit the kind of force that would be required to remove President Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait, the general presented limited military options, like bombing Iraq's oil pipeline through Saudi Arabia. 
 The Defense Secretary dismissed the limited options as inadequate, insisting that President Bush have a full range of options, including the maximum use of force.
Mr. Cheney was blunt in criticizing the plans. There was a lot of "thrashing around," and the atmosphere was "testy," a senior Administration official said.
Associates say the conflict lasted no more than 24 to 36 hours. Mr. Cheney says he will not discuss it, because that would intrude on the heart of the confidentiality in his "good close relationship" with General Powell. There was a lot of "intense interaction that was even more intense during the period when our forces were engaged in combat," was all he would say in an interview this week.
 
Bush's Inner Circle
 "It gets to be very close," he said. "We each see more of the other guy than we do of our families."
"He called me today and we grabbed lunch together," Mr. Cheney said," adding "no specific agenda, just a bull session."
Steeped just last summer in the drudgery of managing the decline of the American defense establishment, on the defensive against Congressional attacks for timidity and lack of vision in the face of the collapse of the Soviet empire, Secretary Cheney and General Powell have emerged as two of the most visible members of President Bush's inner circle. For the Republican Party, they are emerging as factors in Presidential speculation.
Mr. Cheney, the career Republican Party political operative who spent a decade in the House of Representatives, seems at times easily outshone by General Powell, the Bronx-born son of Jamaican immigrants.
After the military victory in the Persian Gulf, General Powell addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who were meeting in Washington. Here is how he reminded them of the time when he told them that Saddam Hussein's threats would never shake American resolve.
 
'Powell Is a Politician'
 "Was I right?" the General said, standing before an American flag the size of the one Hollywood put behind George C. Scott in the film "Patton." The crowd erupted.
"Powell is a politician in the old-fashioned, buy-you-a-hot-dog style, that's true," said an Administration official who has worked with both men. "Colin gets a big charge out of getting down with the guys, of cheering and rooting them on," the official said. "They probably react more viscerally to him than to Cheney, who is a little shy in getting in and working the crowd."
Mr. Cheney's is more self-effacing image, a hands-shoved-into-the-pockets Westerner who is ready to tell a joke about his former career in Congress and then, with his head sinking between hunched shoulders, say something sincere. But there also is a hard edge -- some opponents in Congress call it a mean streak -- that can flare in dealing with an adversary.
This is the rebuke he delivered to his former colleague, Representative Peter H. Kostmayer, Democrat of Pennsylvania, after a challenge to his spending plans: "When the Soviets were oppressing Eastern Europe, invading Afghanista, building and deploying massive armaments, engaging in the largest military buildup, peacetime, in the history of the world, supporting third-world revolution in Central America and southern Africa, I don't recall that you supported the defense budget then, either."
 
Cheney's Senior Post
 General Powell's instincts seem disciplined by his military training. From Army fatigues and getting down with the troops, he can change effortlessly to spit-polish and dress-greens to discuss international affairs with diplomats, statesmen and royalty.
It is that political-military combination in General Powell's resume, the four-star warrior who also served as President Reagan's last national security adviser, that gives him special status. In an interview in August, just two weeks after he had clashed with Mr. Cheney, General Powell reinforced the restraint he had felt in those opening hours of the crisis.
"The use of the armed forces of the United States is a political matter, not a military matter," he said. "There has to be a political objective when we use the armed forces. We tend to get in trouble when we forget that."
But Mr. Cheney, almost stately at 50 -- nearly four years younger than General Powell -- is the senior partner by virtue of his seat in the President's Cabinet.
 
Staff Members Clash
 "They are not equals, and Colin understands that," said one associate.
And though they frequently pay tribute to each other -- Mr. Cheney refers to the general as "my compatriot" and tutor -- each man vigorously guards the prerogatives of his office.
Mr. Cheney runs the huge Pentagon staff through a small circle of trusted aides, many of whom have been with him since his Congressional or White House days. That inner staff has clashed from time to time with General Powell's over Mr. Cheney's information-gathering forays into the military.
"Powell is very concerned with making sure that he is the adviser to the Secretary and the President," an official said.
 
Powell's Political Allure
 Because he held office, ran President Ford's White House staff at the age of 34 and understands party machinery intimately, Mr. Cheney has become the darling of the Republican right wing. He has strong ties to the West, a perfect conservative voting record as a Congressman, skepticism about Soviet intentions, devotion to Israel's security and unfailing support for "Star Wars."
"Cheney is probably the conservatives' favorite right now," said Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative Republican fund raiser. "He is one of us. We have known him for many years and fought many battles together."
But a Republican media consultant, Robert Goodman, disagreed, arguing that General Powell and his field commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, have intense political allure for the Republican Party.
"In a nation starved for heros, with politicians generally in low repute, with incumbency in some kind of turmoil right now, a fresh heroic face can be very very appealing," Mr. Goodman said.
 
A New Republican Image
 Mr. Cheney "is the only real politician in the crowd," Mr. Goodman said. But he said that General Powell, if he were to replace Dan Quayle on the 1992 Republican ticket "could create a sea change in national politics," not only by virtue of the racial coup such a draft would represent but also because General Powell might be able to rid the party of its four-decade shutout on projecting a humane domestic agenda.
The biggest problem for Republicans who lust for a Powell candidacy is the General's persistance in not declaring his party while in uniform.
In midwar, weeks ago, the General called Vice President Quayle and assured him that any talk of a Bush-Powell ticket was nonsense from his perspective.
 
Availability for Interviews
 Both men have the relatively thick hides that only come from years of Washington experience.
"Cheney is a little more patient than Powell in dealing with Congress and the press," a senior official said.
General Powell carefully screens requests for access, and his distance has become all the more acute as his political future -- and his relative attractiveness as a Bush running mate in 1992 -- are more frequently discussed.
"In our free time he likes to fix old cars and I like to fly-fish," Mr. Cheney said. "I'm from the wide-open spaces of Wyoming, and he's a big-city boy from New York, so we are very different in that respect. His background is primarily military and mine is political, but they mesh nicely where they need to mesh."

HEADLINE: Third Airport for London

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, March 15

 BODY:
Queen Elizabeth formally inaugurated London's third international airport today. Stansted Airport, 30 miles northeast of London, will open to the public on Tuesday.
The $744 million renovated airport, replacing one that was built by the United States Air Force in 1942, is London's first important new airport since Gatwick Airport was rebuilt in 1958. 
 Heathrow Airport is by far the most popular in Britain, mainly because of its many connecting flights. Its 70 scheduled airlines handled 41.6 million passengers last year.
Sir Norman Payed, chairman of BAA P.L.C., the company that operates Stanstead, declared it "the best airport terminal yet."
Because of the gulf war and the recession, BAA expects 1.5 million passengers in the first year, down from its original forecast of two million. The old Stansted regional airport was handling 1.14 million.
BAA said Stansted could handle eight million people a year, a goal it expects to reach before 2000, and it could be expanded to handle 15 million.

Midlantic Lays Off 120 in New Jersey

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 15

 BODY:
Midlantic National Bank of Newark has laid off 120 employees to save about $2 million a year. The chairman of the Midlantic Corporation, Robert Van Buren, said the layoffs were the latest cost-cutting effort by the financial company, which reported a net loss of $195 million last year.
The cuts reduce to 4,300 the work force of Midlantic National, the flagship bank of the Edison-based Midlantic Corporation, a bank spokeswoman, Dorothy Hinchcliff, said.Most of the layoffs came from middle management and clerical positions that were not needed after the bank sold some operations. In recent months Midlantic National has sold credit card operations, leasing agreements and home equity loan portfolios to trim operations.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
By most accounts, a dramatic and pivotal moment occurred last month at the assembly of the World Council of Churches, the organization that loosely links 316 churches with a collective membership of 400 million Christians.
On Feb. 8, the second day of the two-week meeting, Dr. Chung Hyun Kyung, a Presbyterian theologian from South Korea, addressed most of the 3,500 delegates and observers from 100 nations, who were gathered in Canberra, Australia. Her topic was the meeting's theme: the Holy Spirit and the renewal of creation. 
 Amid the sound of gongs, drums and clap sticks, the 34-year-old churchwoman was joined onstage by young Korean dancers wearing white like herself and two Australian aborigines in loincloths and body paint. She invited the audience to follow the custom of aboriginal Australians and other Asian and Pacific people by taking off their shoes to honor their "holy ground" and preparing to encounter God's spirit.
What followed would entrance many in her audience and anger others, even to the point that they would talk about leaving the World Council. It would also underscore a problem faced by believers since Christians confronted Hellenism: how to express their belief in terms meaningful to their local culture without abandoning their essential Christian distinctiveness.
Reading from a rice-paper scroll, Dr. Chung invoked the spirits of women and men oppressed through the ages. "Come," she began, "spirit of Hagar, Egyptian, black slave woman exploited and abandoned by Abraham and Sarah, the ancestors of our faith."
"Come," she eventually concluded, "spirit of the Liberator, our brother Jesus."
Included in her litany were Joan of Arc and other women burned as witches, all the victims of the Crusades and of Western colonization, Jews killed in the Nazi gas chambers, Vietnamese napalmed and boat people starved, those "smashed by tanks in Kwangju, Tiananmen Square and Lithuania," soldiers, civilians and sea creatures dying in the Persian Gulf fighting. She also summoned "the spirit of the Amazon rain forest" and of "earth, air and water, raped, tortured and exploited by human greed."
Then, deftly rolling the scroll into a cone, she set it aflame and let the ashes drift into the air.
In the soft-spoken presentation on the Holy Spirit that followed, Dr. Chung, who studied in the United States, drew not only on biblical images of Babel, Mammon and repentance but also on Korean concepts of wandering "ancestor spirits" and "Ki," or "life energy."
She portrayed the Holy Spirit in terms of Kwan In, the enlightened one who delays her passage to nirvana so as to help others achieve enlightenment and who is popularly venerated in Korea as a goddess of compassion and wisdom.
Dr. Chung received a standing ovation. But as Jean Caffey Lyles reported in the weekly Christian Century, one Eastern Orthodox delegate noted, "There was passionate applause, but there was also passionate silence." Leaders of Eastern Orthodox churches were distressed by what they considered an illegitimate blending of pagan and Christian elements. In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, they said, "Our tradition is rich in respect for local and national cultures, but we find it impossible to invoke the spirits of 'earth, air, water and sea creature.' "
Expressing "disquiet" at any dialogue with religions that might not be scrupulously true to "biblical faith," the statement asked whether the World Council had not strayed from its chief aim of restoring unity among Christians. "Has the time come," the leaders asked, for the Orthodox "to review their relations with the World Council of Churches?"
Some will see from the Canberra episode only confirmation of the frequent charges that the World Council has traded its theological birthright for the pottage of whatever ideological currents run strongest among third-world intellectuals. Some delegates thought there was little chance that the Orthodox churches, which represent 160 million Christians, would withdraw from the world group. But the Rev. Joan Campbell, who headed the American office of the World Council until becoming the new Secretary General of the National Council of Churches, said the possibility should be taken seriously.
Yet this clash at Canberra could be seen as an extremely healthy one. As Ms. Campbell said, it put on the table not only the question of adapting Christianity to local cultures but also the basic issues of what limits to diversity Christian unity demands and how those limits are set.
Compounding the drama in Canberra, Dr. Chung's presentation had been preceded by one from Patriarch Parthenios of Alexandria, Egypt. The Patriarch's text was not at all stodgy, but it was read, lecture-like, by another Orthodox cleric because the Persian Gulf war had kept the Patriarch at home. Thus the invidious contrast between the old and the new, between the bearded and black-garbed male hierarch and the youthful and white-robed female radical.
The image is, of course, deceiving. The Orthodox churches may be ancient, but, suddenly freed of Communist domination, they are in a sense the newest, and certainly among the fastest-growing, of Christian groups.
The Rev. Daniel P. Matthews, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in Manhattan and a participant in the Canberra assembly, said Dr. Chung represented the effort to "contextualize" the Christian faith, to make it relevant to its political, economic and cultural context.
At the same time, he added, "the fascinating thing is that in Eastern Europe the Orthodox survived because they did not succumb to the context but maintained their traditions with profound clarity." There is great power in each point of view, he argued, and a great need to bring them into conversation.
Unfortunately, the Canberra assembly cast doubt on the council's capacity to go much beyond such initial confrontations. Like Patriarch Parthenios, the meeting was somewhat waylaid by the gulf war, which tied up delegates with proclamations and resolutions.
An intricate system of quotas for electing leadership by continent, church, race, age and sex led to bitter wrangling and embarrassing floor fights. "Fifteen people were all screaming 'point of order' at the same time, none of them knowing what it meant except that it was a way to get the chair's attention," said one observer.
But the World Council of Churches remains the only place where a patriarch from one of the first great centers of Christianity and a feminist liberation theologian from a church less than a century old could not only be joint keynote speakers but also embrace the hope that, however long it takes, their successors will someday be united, sharing the same communion table both as recipients and as ordained celebrants.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly Despite Intervention Efforts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a broad advance on world currency markets yesterday despite repeated rounds of central bank intervention.
Several central banks stepped in during European and domestic trading hours to sell dollars. Traders said that there were indications that the Bundesbank, the German central bank;y,, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank of Canada were trying to hold down the dollar. But it was undaunted. 
 "The central banks' return to the market was less than triumphant," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston's office here.
 
 Drop Seemed More Apropos
 The bullish sentiment for the dollar came despite fresh economic data that could have been interpreted as negative for it.
The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices dropped a sharper-than-expected six-tenths of 1 percent last month. Foreign exchange dealers said the figures pointed to moderating inflation, which could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Such a move is typically bearish for the dollar because it reduces the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Separately, the Government reported that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell sharply for the fifth straight month, the worst string of setbacks since the last recession eight years ago.
"People expected the numbers to produce a selloff," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland. Instead, because interest rates in the bond market rose, "real buying interest emerged," he said.
"We're seeing a variety of corporations and legitimate users of foreign exchange as opposed to speculators" buying the dollar, he said.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to close at 136.25 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted higher, at 136.97 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 137.85 yen, up from 135.87 yen on Thursday.
 
 British Pound at $1.8340

In London, the British pound fell to $1.8340, from $1.8560 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8225 to buy 1, cheaper than Thursday's $1.8520.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6070 German marks, up from 1.5825; 1.3930 Swiss francs, up from 1.3715; 5.4735 French francs, up from 5.3910; 1,200.00 Italian lire, up from 1,181.00, and 1.1561 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1537.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell 40 cents to settle at $364.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $364.25, off 40 cents an ounce.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $365.75 an ounce, from $364.85 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $365.90 from $364.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.02 an ounce to close at a bid of $363.50.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Falls 0.8% to Lowest Level in 2 1/2 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Industrial production declined eight-tenths of a percent in February to the lowest level in two and a half years, the Government said today. It was the fifth consecutive monthly decline, and analysts saw it as another sign that the recession was continuing unabated.
The February performance marked the longest string of declines in manufacturing output since a 10-month stretch between March and December 1982, during the most severe recession since the Depression in the 1930's. 
 "It's further evidence that the economy, as of February, was still in a full-fledged recessionary decline," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
"There is not yet any indication from this sector of the economy that a bottom has been reached," added Marilyn Schaja, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation of New York.
 
 Factories Slowing

The Federal Reserve report also showed the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities falling eight-tenths of a percentage point, to 79.1 percent of capacity. That was the lowest level since October 1986, when the rate was 79 percent.
The central bank's report on prodution displayed a broad decline, led by a 5 percent drop in motor vehicle assemblies. But excluding automobiles, output was still down seven-tenths of a percent.
Excluding vehicles, the consumer goods sector fell five-tenths of a percent, about the same rate of decline as in December and January, the report said. Production of appliances, carpeting, furniture and electricity for residential use was down.
Analysts attributed the slide to slack demand resulting from uncertainties over the Persian Gulf crisis, growing unemployment that is eroding purchasing power, and, in some cases, tight lending requirements.
Output has not risen since inching up a barely perceptible one-tenth of a percent in September. The declines included drops of six-tenths of a percent in October, 1.5 percent in November, 1.1 percent in December and a revised five-tenths of a percent in January, slightly worse than the decline of four-tenths initially reported last month.
Output of durable goods -- products like automobiles and large appliances that are expected to last more than three years -- dropped 1.3 percent for the fifth consecutive decline.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Conflicting readings of inflation and consumer sentiment sent prices of long-term Treasury bonds tumbling yesterday. Fears of inflation, the bane of investors holding fixed-income securities, were raised when the Government released its Producer Price Index for February before the markets opened.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, fell 31/32, or about $9.75 for each $1,000 of face value, to 95 15/32. This lifted the yield to 8.28 percent, compared with 8.19 percent the day before and 8.30 percent a week ago. 
 In the Treasury bond futures market in Chicago, the March contract, which expires on Tuesday, declined 30/32, to 95 14/32.
 
 Upset by Price Report

According to dealers, the wholesale price report cast a pall over the bond market throughout the session, although at first glance the data appeared bullish for the bond market. Among other things, the report said wholesale prices fell six-tenths of 1 percent in February, the third decline in three months. But the same data showed that "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up four-tenths of 1 percent. The market had expected a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent at most.
"Part of the shock came from the rise in car prices last month, a time when car sales remained dismal," said Kevin M. Flanagan, credit market specialist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Then we had the contradictory reports on consumer confidence."
The University of Michigan's latest index of consumer confidence soared to 80 percent, from 70.4 percent a month ago. But Sindlinger & Company's latest survey, also highly respected, put consumer confidence at its lowet level in 35 years.
Those reports overshadowed a Government report showing a sharp decline in industrial production in February. Such negative economic news would normally have been positive for the fixed-income securities market.
Dealers said some clients feared that the unexpectedly high core rate of inflation last month would inhibit further moves by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
 
 No Intervention by Fed

But the Fed did not intervene in the credit market, perhaps because the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for brief loans, traded at 5 15/16 percent most of the day before closing a touch lower at 5 7/8 percent. The Fed's perceived target for this bedrock cost of credit is 6 percent.
Meanwhile, the discount rates on Treasury bills rose modestly. The 90-day bills rose 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.80 percent; six-month bills gained 2 basis points, to 5.81 percent, and the one-year bills also rose 2 basis points, to 5.92 percent.
Among some closely watched Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 6.75 percent notes of 1993 fell 2/32, to 99 19/32, for a yield of 6.97 percent; the 7.5's of 1996 lost 9/ 32, to 99 5/32, for a yield of 7.70 percent, and the long notes, the 7.75's of February 2001, plunged 17/32, to 97 22/32, which sent its yield rising to 8.09 percent from 8.01 percent. A week ago the yield on the long notes, which is often compared with that of similar German and Japan maturities, was 8.12 percent.

HEADLINE: A Fare War With a Difference

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
When American Airlines announced this week what it called the largest fare promotion in its history, it looked like the start of an old-fashioned fare war: one carrier slashing ticket prices, absorbing losses for a while in a gamble to increase its market share.
But industry analysts say they detect a difference in the strategy adopted by the airline that is widely viewed as the industry's most savvy marketer: The changes could actually improve American's financial picture immediately, even in the difficult times now facing the industry. 
 "This isn't a real fare war," said Kevin Murphy, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company.
American, the nation's largest carrier and historically the fare-setting leader, announced a number of short-term and long-term fare changes. In the short term, it said it would cut spring and summer fares sharply for people buying tickets by April 8 -- to $318, for example, for a round trip between New York and Los Angeles or San Francisco. The other four largest carriers -- United, Delta, Northwest and Continental -- said they would match most of the special fares.
But analysts said that unlike most fare wars, in which the intention is to drive out competitors, this round of discounts is meant to bring back travelers scared off by a recession and the gulf war. In the past, by contrast, airlines tended to slash fares to compete for people who were already flying; by cutting the price they were simply earning less money on them.
Beyond special promotional fares, American has announced broader changes in its fare structure, including raising prices for some tickets. These changes are intended to generate more revenue by stopping the recent migration of higher-paying business travelers into ticket categories aimed at leisure travelers, and attracting lower-paying vacationers but steering them toward planes with more empty seats.
American brought back a 30-day advance-purchase fare, a bargain-basement ticket offer that the airline had phased out roughly two years ago. It added a discount fare aimed at the business traveler and cut the price of some international tickets.
 
Raising and Lowering
 Yet American also said it would significantly raise its 14-day advance-purchase fare, which had been popular not only with leisure travelers but also business travelers. By raising the 14-day fare while bringing back a 30-day fare that will be lower than the recent lowest fare, the airline figures it will increase revenues from business passengers and attract new vacation travelers.
In addition, American is tightening the scheduling restrictions on the lowest discount fares, saying that more of them will now require travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday, encouraging leisure travel when the fewest business travelers fly.
"We think this restructuring will bring some common sense to airline ticket pricing," said Michael Gunn, American's senior vice president for marketing.
 
Consumer Groups Are Skeptical

But consumer groups say the changes may raise overall ticket prices. "It appears in the long run that passengers are going to pay more," said Christopher Witkowski, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington.
American is making the changes as the industry tries to pull out of one of its worst slumps. In the last quarter of 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, oil prices took off and travelers stayed put. The United States airline industry lost a record $2 billion. Analysts say the loss may be $1.5 billion or more in the first quarter this year, but a recovery is expected soon.
At American, the share of seats filled on flights -- the "load factor," in industry parlance -- was 56.6 percent in January and fell to 49.9 percent in February, down from 53.8 percent in the same month a year earlier, according to Airline Economics Inc., a consulting firm.
"This has been a terrible period for the airlines," said L. John Eichner, chairman of Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, an airline consulting firm. "So if they attract any passengers, they will be filling empty seats and generating more revenue."
American has been expanding its fleet despite the recession -- this year alone, it has firm orders for 84 new aircraft -- so it has an added incentive for luring passengers back.
The airlines are actually reversing the impact of the higher fares they instituted last fall. The industry raised fares an average of 15 percent in the last quarter of 1990 when fuel prices rose sharply; but passenger traffic fell by even more, roughly 25 percent.
With fuel prices falling again, the airlines have greater leeway to trim fares. Aviation fuel cost nearly $1.15 a gallon in October, but analysts estimate that airlines are now paying about 75 cents a gallon. A one-cent change in the cost of a gallon of fuel means a loss or gain of $160 million in profits for the industry.

HEADLINE: POLAND IS GRANTED LARGE CUT IN DEBT

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 15

 BODY:
Western governments have agreed to forgive about half the $33 billion that Poland owes them, the French Government announced today, with the creditor nations offering what they called "extraordinary terms" to help ease Poland's transition to a market economy.
Western officials said the debt-reduction package was the most generous treatment that the creditor nations, meeting in an informal group known as the Paris Club, had ever given a debtor nation. Many indigent African nations, for example, have been granted 33 percent debt relief, and they, along with developing nations in Asia and Latin America, are expected to demand treatment similar to Poland's. 
 Anticipating this, officials involved in the talks said Poland warranted special treatment because "of the exceptional situation of Poland, involved in a transition without precedent toward a market economy." Western nations are eager to insure the success of Poland's move away from Communism.
But negotiators do expect the treatment to set some precedent. Egypt, for example, might get something similar, negotiators said, because Western governments want to show gratitude for Egypt's significant role in the anti-Iraq coalition during the Persian Gulf war.
Poland owes $48.5 billion in all, including about $11 billion to commercial banks. It also owes money to some of its former Soviet bloc partners and other creditors.
David Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, who was Washington's chief negotiator on Polish debt, said in a telephone interview, "We see this as a historic event similar to the reduction in debt in Germany in 1953, which we hope will put Poland on the path of sustained economic recovery and will make it one of the leading economies of Eastern Europe, provided they stick to their reform program."
The United States and other leading industrial nations have debated since the summer the Polish debt issue, with Washington taking the lead in pushing for large-scale debt relief.
Speaking today in Paris, Poland's Minister of Privatization, Janusz Lewandowski, said the debt relief would be a boon to his nation's 38 million people. "Poland deserves a reward for its courage in undertaking such drastic economic reforms," he said. "That sort of reward, vital to our success, could be an example to all other countries, to encourage them to more radical policies."
Poland has moved far more boldly than other countries in the former Soviet bloc. It has ended central planning, scrapped price controls and slashed subsidies to consumers and industry, but with the moves industrial output has plunged and unemployment has risen above one million.
 
 Feeling Austerity
 Polish officials said the debt burden had hurt their reform efforts by making it hard for the nation to afford to import much-needed consumer goods and capital equipment. In addition, Polish officials said the nagging uncertainties created by the unresolved debt problem had discouraged Western companies from deals in Poland.
In an interview, Jacek Kozlowski, a Polish Government spokesman, said: "This debt-relief decision is very valuable for us. If it had been made a few months later, it would have been too late."
The creditors are not giving Poland the 80 percent write-off that it sought, but the plan, which has two stages, is intended to cut interest payments by 80 percent over the next three years. Maximizing relief at the plan's start is a recognition that repaying debt will be especially hard during the early years of economic reform. The package will reduce Poland's annual interest payments on its government-to-government debt from an estimated $3.3 billion to $660 million, negotiators said.
"It is a very large country with a very substantial debt burden contracted by the previous Government before a total revolution in the system," Mr. Mulford said. "Poland's fate had been in the hands of outside forces until that revolution."
He said Poland got special treatment because of its "political uniqueness" and because such a high percentage of its debt is government-to-government debt, making it possible for creditor governments to bring about large-scale relief.
Bank creditors were negotiating in Paris today over how much they should lighten Poland's debt burden. The British Treasury said today that "the Paris Club creditors expect comparable treatment from Poland's commercial bank creditors." The statement added, "It would be quite wrong for debt relief from the official sector simply to lead to an increase in the recoverability of the commercial banks' debts."
Under the plan, creditor governments are given three options for reducing Poland's debt: forgiving principal, offering below-market interest rates, or transforming interest payments into principal and then offering low interest rates.
Germany is Poland's largest creditor, and other large creditors include Austria, France, Canada, Britain and the United States, which is owed $3.1 billion by Poland.
The two-stage plan calls on creditor nations to reduce the net present value of the debt by 30 percent at the beginning of the first stage, which will last three years. When the second stage begins, an additional 20 percent is to be cut.
The first stage is contingent upon Poland's signing an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to restructure its economy. Such accords often call for privatizing businesses and holding down public spending and inflation. The second stage is contingent upon fulfillment of the terms of the I.M.F. agreement.
"The plan is designed to insure that Poland will be implementing the right adjustment policies," said one official who was involved in the talks.
Officials taking part in the talks said there were wide divisions among the creditors, with Washington urging 60 percent relief. France was said to have called for 40 percent, to put the package more in line with the 33 percent granted to the impoverished African nations.
Germany supported a low level of debt forgiveness, and Japan opposed forgiving debt, urging instead that new subsidized loans be granted.
 
Reaching a Compromise
 On Thursday, the creditors compromised on 50 percent debt relief, but Polish officials said they hoped to win even larger relief in bilateral talks. The agreement includes a voluntary option allowing debt swaps for up to 10 percent of the total debt.
Such deals would reduce Poland's debt by, for example, allowing creditors to swap debt for an equity stake in a Polish company. Swedish officials say they would give up some of their debt in exchange for Poland's undertaking environmental measures, like cleanup projects and protection of certain lands.
Conscious of the large Polish-American population, Congress has pushed the Bush Administration to be generous toward Poland. Many Congressmen have said substantial debt relief will be a condition for their supporting creation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based multilateral bank being established to help rebuild Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Some Industries Gain, But No Upturn Is Seen

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Amid the almost daily evidence of the continued deterioration of the American economy, there are beginning to be signs of improvement.
The encouraging reports are popping up in such diverse areas as construction, electronics and automobiles. Executives and economists warn against interpreting these straws in the wind as a turnaround in the economy, but they might provide the beginnings of one later on. 
 Much of the good news comes with caveats. American Express, for example, reports "a slight uptick" lately in the use of its 26 million credit cards, but not enough to declare that people are spending more. The automotive industry notes that car and truck sales have risen since January, but only to levels that are not yet respectable even for a recession. And Sears, Roebuck & Company says women are buying more clothes, but for the job, not for leisure.
"We have managed double-digit sales increases in women's clothing because most of our inventory is in career wear," said Dorrit Bern, Sears's merchandising manager for women's clothing. "But casual wear isn't selling. The instant-gratification purchase isn't present in this recession. The situation is tough."
The appearance of good economic news in the midst of a recession is not unusual. It has happened in past recessions, which have then often continued without abating, says Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board. He calls these episodes "intuitive leaps forward" that anticipate the end of a recession, sometimes prematurely. The stock market, with its sharply rising prices since early January, reflects such an anticipatory leap on the part of investors, Mr. Sommers argues.
 
 Many Weak Numbers

The good news, in fact, comes in the midst of plenty of bad news. In the last 10 days, Government reports showed that unemployment rose sharply in February while the industrial production index plunged, and inventories grew in January, for the third consecutive month. That means production outstripped demand and the unsold surplus went into warehouses. If the trend was to continue, production would be cut another notch and more workers idled.
For the moment, however, Robert A. Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, and others in the Bush Administration, are making the most of the positive reports, suggesting that they signal that the recession's hardest months might be over. Nevertheless, Mr. Mosbacher acknowledges that the good news is still too "fragmentary" to serve as the basis of a trustworthy forecast that the recession is entering its final phase.
"When you hear these things, you assume that in a month or two we will get some data that will show an upturn in some areas," he said, "and maybe by the end of the summer, we'll see more up signs than down signs."
Some of the good news might indeed contain the seeds of an upturn. Many realtors, for example, report rising sales of existing single-family houses. Changing home ownership cannot by itself reverse a recession. That takes new construction, with all the jobs it creates, not only to build a home, but also to supply lumber, steel, appliances and other items.
When sales rise, however, home prices stabilize and the new demand eventually encourages builders to start new projects. That might be happening now. Nationwide construction data for February, made available this week by the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill, shows that the value of newly started homes, commercial buildings and government projects has been stable for three consecutive months, after having fallen since September 1989.
Home construction, rather than new office and apartment projects, appears to be stabilizing the construction figures. That is certainly the case for Frank Wimer, president of the Wimer Construction Company of Pittsburgh. Last July, he had five homes under construction in the suburb of Forest Chapel and none of them sold, an unnerving experience for a builder who usually sells his houses before they are finished.
He vowed not to build another house until buyers were found for the homes already sitting empty, and this he accomplished by the end of the year, selling the homes, he says, for nearly the half-million or so he had originally asked. "I changed real estate agents and threw in more landscaping at my expense," he said.
 
'Taking a Chance'
 Now he has five more homes under construction, in the $300,000 to $600,000 range. "I'm taking a chance, but there isn't a big inventory of unsold single-family homes in the Pittsburgh area anymore," he said.
Beyond construction, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of the nation's economic activity, some of the positive reports are more impressionistic. "When I talk to my peers, what I hear is that manufacturing activity is abysmally low, but people nevertheless feel better," said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman of the Eaton Corporation, a huge Cleveland-based manufacturer of machinery and parts for autos, appliances and electronic products. "The mind-set is that with the gulf war behind us all the conditions are in place for a recovery that we don't see yet."
The conditions Mr. Hardis refers to are these: With the war over, spending might increase as consumer confidence revives. Factories, in turn, would increase production to meet the new demand. Laid-off workers would be recalled, not only at factories but also at the numerous companies that service a prospering economy. The new jobs mean rising income from wages, which makes possible more spending and still more job creation -- ending the recession.
Confidence did, in fact, turn up in early March, according to the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. But Richard T. Curtin, the center's director, offers a caveat. "People are saying that they expect some improvement in the economy, and if they see it, they'll step up their spending, but until they see it, they'll be cautious," he said.
For Eaton, the only improvement so far is a rise in orders for switches that go into computers and hand tools. Mr. Hardis says the order pickup might not last. "You want to see several months of upturn to decide it is a trend," he said.
 
Retail Sales Up
 Retail sales are also hard to read. The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that retail sales rose in February, for the first time in four months. But the $148 billion in total sales was less than in any month since last summer -- except January.
Similarly, the Semiconductor Industry Association, representing companies that make chips for electronics products, reported that in February orders for new chips exceeded shipments for the first time since last July. But one month's improvement does not constitute a trend, said Andrew A. Procassini, president of the association.
Auto and truck manufacturers are also skeptical. Sales of American-made vehicles rose in February and early March to 12.4 million, at an annual rate, from 11.2 million in January. This is below the 13.5 million that would be a more normal recession level, says Donald Hilty, chief economist at the Chrysler Corporation.
But it is more vehicles than the industry is manufacturing. Presumably, production will soon have to rise to keep up with the demand, and workers on layoff will have to be recalled. "There is some hope in what is happening," Mr. Hilty said, "but so far it is a straw in the wind, not a trend. The industry will draw down inventories and wait until March ends before deciding what to do."

HEADLINE: Worrisome Producer Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
A sobering report on inflation showed today that prices received by American producers advanced four-tenths of 1 percent in February, excluding the prices of energy and food. Many analysts said the increase was unsettlingly high for an economy mired in recession.
The price figures, overshadowing another report showing continuing weakness in industrial production, suggested that the Federal Reserve might be reluctant to relax monetary policy soon. In the bond market today, prices of Treasury issues fell and interest rates rose. [Page 34.] 
 "Inflation is not showing the permanent slowdown we'd like to see," said Paul W. Boltz, chief economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "It's a little disheartening in the throes of a recession."
 
 Disregarding Oil Prices

Over all, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods dropped six-tenths of 1 percent, but the bottom-line figure -- though better than expected -- was largely disregarded because it included a 5.1 percent plunge in the price of gasoline, heating oil and other energy sources. Oil prices began to fall long before the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Shortly after the Labor Department published its inflation data, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production had slumped another eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, the fifth straight decline. [Page 32.]
The decline in industrial output had been foreshadowed in earlier figures and economists tended to regard the report as essentially confirming the notion of an economy that is still sinking although at a subdued pace.
 
 'Momentum Is Clearly Slowing'
 "The momentum is clearly slowing," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank of North America, adding that there was no evidence yet that the eventual upturn will be vigorous. He called the rise in the core rate "disappointing."
On the other hand, some analysts were unfazed by the inflation report, which included a sharp increase in the price of motor vehicles, an increase that seemed anomalous in light of that industry's deep slump.
"The drop in producer prices indicates that inflation isn't ratcheting up the prices for goods paid by wholesaler-distributors to their suppliers," asserted Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group. He said low oil prices and interest rates, and "tame" inflation "put the stars in alignment for a rebound in business and consumer confidence."
The University of Michigan found in preliminary data published today that its index of consumer sentiment rebounded to 88 percent in March, from 70.4 in February, recovering nearly all of the ground it lost since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. The index for July 1990 was 88.2.
This may have also contributed to lower bond prices today, though analysts cautioned that changes in consumer psychology are not necessarily translated, at least in the short run, to changes in behavior.
Analysts who remain optimistic about inflation also cited figures in today's Producer Price Index showing that the index for goods at the intermediate stage of production fell a substantial seven-tenths of 1 percent while crude goods dropped a record 8.2 percent, the latter mainly reflecting a record 15.9 percent plunge for crude energy.
Not counting food or energy, intermediate goods rose just one-tenth of 1 percent and crude goods just two-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed.
The February drop in the finished goods Producer Price Index was the third in a row and cut the rise for the latest 12 months to 3.2 percent, the lowest pace since last spring.
However, the rise in the core rate of four-tenths of 1 percent followed a five-tenths rise in January, producing a two-month increase higher than for any such period in 1990.
Prices of consumer foods edged up two-tenths of 1 percent last month after two small declines, with big increases in fresh fruits and vegetables, soft drinks, candy and nuts, cheese, pork and processed turkeys.
But analysts focused mainly on such substantial increases as 2 percent for floor coverings, 1.2 percent for both women's apparel and lawn and garden equipment, 1 percent for pharmaceuticals and nine-tenths of 1 percent for motor vehicles and household glassware.
Capital equipment rose two-tenths of 1 percent, about the same as in preceding months.
In energy, gasoline plunged 11.5 percent, while fuel oil fell 8.3 percent and residential gas fell 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND KREMLIN STILL DEADLOCKED ON ARMS TREATIES

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 15

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union, at the end of two days of high-level talks, said today that they remained deadlocked over two important arms control agreements that are delaying the next summit meeting, which Moscow has proposed for the end of May.
Although Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and senior Soviet officials said overall relations remained good, there were rumblings today suggesting that serious strains were developing. 
 One of the treaties is on reducing long-range nuclear missiles, and a year ago both sides said the pact was almost ready for signing.
 
U.S. Accused of Stalling
 Today the official Soviet press agency, Tass, distributed a commentary during the talks quoting a "high-ranking Soviet diplomat" as accusing the Bush Administration of stalling a resolution. It said Washington was refusing to make "a political decision" to complete the treaty and "frankly speaking, does not seem to be willing to meet us halfway."
An American official described the accusation as a Soviet "smokescreen." The official said it was intended to disguise the fact that Soviet and American negotiators in Geneva keep working out technical issues in the strategic arms treaty, only to find them rejected by the Soviet leadership.
American officials say President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who met with Mr. Baker today, appears to be under pressure from members of the Soviet military and its military-industrial base. Many within the Soviet military say the Kremlin has made too many concessions on arms control and should dig in its heels on the strategic arms treaty and on the second treaty, limiting conventional weapons in Europe.
 
'Internal Problems' Cited
 "We've been trying to meet them halfway," an American official said, "but we are not going to pay extra just because of their internal problems."
With Mr. Gorbachev worried about a national referendum on Sunday on the very unity of the Soviet Union -- in a speech tonight, he urged his population to vote "yes" -- Mr. Baker invited leaders of Soviet republics and municipalities, including some who favor separation from the Soviet Union. to a dinner tonight at the home of the American Ambassador.
Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Republic and a Gorbachev rival, was invited to the dinner, and to a private meeting with Mr. Baker, but he declined and sent a representative instead. Mr. Baker will meet with leaders of the independent-minded Baltic republics on Saturday.
Asked what signal he was trying to send, Mr. Baker said: "The purpose is to hear from them with respect to their views of the situation within the Soviet Union and the prognosis for reform, to give them the benefit of our views and to have the contacts we said we would be having with republic leaders. We are going to be encouraging them to have contacts at the state and local levels with officials in the United States."
In February 1990, during a visit by Mr. Baker to Moscow, the two sides announced that they had overcome the last major obstacles to a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- known as Start -- and that all that was left were largely "technical details." Yet 13 months later, many of those same details remain unresolved.
 
Differences on Verification
 The main differences are over treaty verification, which is crucial for the Bush Administration if it hopes to get the treaty approved by the Senate.
There are differences over how intrusively the two sides should monitor each other's missile factories to make sure no banned missiles are produced, how they should monitor each other's test flights to make sure that missiles are not improved in certain ways, and how to inspect long-range bombers carrying air-launched cruise missiles.
More problematic, American officials say, is that in November the United States, the Soviet Union and 20 other NATO and Warsaw Pact nations signed a treaty slashing non-nuclear conventional forces in Europe, sometimes called the C.F.E. treaty.
After the signing, the Soviet military insisted on excluding from the treaty three naval infantry divisions and their weapons on the ground that they were involved in shore defenses and were technically not covered by a treaty involving land armies. The action annoyed officials in Washington and raised questions about Soviet sincerity.
 
Insistence by Bush
 Mr. Baker has told Congress that President Bush will not submit that treaty for Senate ratification until the Soviets drop this demand, and Mr. Bush says he wants the treaty on long-range arms finished before another summit meeting.
"Where the summit has been left," Mr. Baker said, "is that we will seek to find a time before the middle of the year. But the leaders themselves have said they would want a Start treaty ready for such a summit, and right now we don't have that situation. We still have unresolved problems with C.F.E., and we have not concluded all of the issues on Start."
Asked when these lingering arms- control differences might be worked out, Mr. Baker said, "I can't answer your question."
While the first meeting between senior Soviet and American officials since the end of the Persian Gulf war did not produce any breakthrough on arms control, both Mr. Baker and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, argued that the good news was that despite many dire predictions, the gulf war did not result in a breach in Soviet-American cooperation.
 
'Constructive Partner' in Gulf
 At a news conference after four hours of talks in the Kremlin between Mr. Baker and Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Baker said he hoped and expected that the Soviet Union would remain a "constructive partner" with the United States in stabilizing the postwar Persian Gulf.
Mr. Baker, who was accused by Republican conservatives at various stages of the gulf crisis of being naive about Soviet intentions in the Middle East, seemed to take relish in saying: "Many predictions were made, particularly in the latter stages of that crisis, that the Soviet Union would not remain committed to the same goals that other coalition partners were committed to. But it did."
Then, referring to Washington's decision to start the ground war despite an 11th-hour Soviet attempt to find a diplomatic solution, Mr. Baker added with emotion: "The relationship has gone through a test recently, and it has survived. And that is good for the Soviet Union, and that is good for the United States, and that is good for the world. And we should work to keep that relationship on the same track if we possibly can."
Mr. Bessmertnykh said, "What matters most is that the Soviet-U.S. relationship has gone through a very difficult test and passed that test, and this opens reliable prospects for future developments."
 
Baker's Dinner Guests
 The list of those attending the Baker dinner tonight included the Chairman of the Georgian Parliament, Zviad Gamsakhurdia; the Premier of the Republic of Armenia, Vazgen Manukyan; the Premier of the Republic of Kirghizia, Nasirdin Isanov; the Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil K. Popov, and the Mayor of Leningrad, Anatoly A. Sobchak, as well as a former Gorbachev adviser, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, and a reform economist, Stanislav Shatalin.
Whether Soviet-American cooperation will really persist in the Middle East region could depend how events unfold in Iraq. The Bush Administration appears increasingly interested in fostering the downfall of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by depriving him of any ability to use chemical weapons, warplanes or helicopters to put down the mounting insurrections against his Government.
Mr. Bessmerthnykh, when asked for his attitude on this, seemed to indicate that Moscow was uncomfortable with anything that smacked of American efforts to use its military position in the gulf to change the regime in Baghdad.
Mr. Bessmertnykh said, "It is my view that military operations which were carried out against Iraq in connection with this aggression against Kuwait were based on Security Council Resolution 678, and there were no other grounds for use of armed forces in Iraq or against Iraq."
 
Baker Praises Gorbachev
 But with the gulf crisis now receding, the quality of American-Soviet relations will again be measured largely by the yardstick of arms control agreements, where the two sides seem increasingly unable to break their deadlocks.
Mr. Baker went out of his way to praise Mr. Gorbachev for his efforts to resolve the Baltic crisis peacefully, after last January's violent crackdown.
He said Mr. Gorbachev had told him that his Government had appointed individuals to negotiate with independence-minded Baltic leaders and was waiting for negotiators to be appointed by the Baltic republics. Mr. Baker said some Soviet troops had also been withdrawn from the area.

HEADLINE: New Delays in Hotel Plan for Homeless

BYLINE: By Celia W. DUGGER

 BODY:
New York City has spent two and a half years and $25 million trying to turn a decrepit rooming house on 42d Street into a model residence for 300 homeless people, but no one lives there yet because the city has been unable to pick someone to run the place.
Advocates for the homeless and community leaders say the failure to open the Holland Hotel is a case study of creative social policy stalled, not by lack of money, but by bureaucratic fumbling. 
 The city's latest attempt to select a manager for the former hotel near Ninth Avenue collapsed last month when the chosen candidate withdrew from the project for the second time. Even before the latest snag, the project had been plagued by construction problems.
"This is just incompetence, plain and simple," said Doug Lasdon, executive director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless. "At a time when we need housing so desperately, we're losing the use of hundreds of rooms for homeless and poor people."
 
Applicant Withdraws, Twice
 Only four groups have applied for the daunting job of managing what will be the city's largest nonprofit single-room-occupancy residence for the homeless, in what was once its most notorious welfare hotel.
Twice, the city's Human Resources Administration has awarded the job to Clinton Community Services, a small, storefront social-service agency in Manhattan that has never run an S.R.O. Twice, that decision has backfired.
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth Messinger, said the human resources agency could have avoided the latest problem if it had done a basic background check on the application from Clinton. Agency officials insisted that they had followed proper contracting procedures.
In the 1980's, the Holland Hotel, then privately owned, became a symbol of the city's failure to find a humane solution to the plight of the homeless. At times, 275 families were crammed into about 300 single rooms at the hotel.
It was a dangerous, squalid and very expensive place. The city paid up to $1,800 a month for a family to live in one room in the drug-infested, honky-tonk area near Times Square.
Then, in 1988, the city decided it could transform the Holland into a symbol of hope for the homeless. The owner had declared bankruptcy and the city, under the Koch administration, bought the 20-story, tan brick building at 351 West 42d Street for $13 million.
The dream was to make it a model residence for homeless adults, a place where tenants would find under one roof the social services, medical care and moral support they needed to get back on their feet. The realization of that ideal has not been easy.
 
Still Work to Do
 The renovation, which has cost $12 million to date, initially left out such elements as wiring for air conditioners, lounges on each floor, stoves or microwave ovens in each room, intercoms to the front desk and locks on the doors, said Nancy Wackstein, director of the Mayor's office for homelessness and single-room-occupancy housing.
While the city wants to have all those problems fixed, Ms. Wackstein said, it decided to select a nonprofit group to run the hotel before undertaking the final renovations so the group could be involved in the design.
But that choice has itself become a major stumbling-block. In May 1989, the Human Resources Administration issued its first "request for proposals" to operate the Holland. One group applied and was rejected.
The paucity of responses was a harbinger of trouble to come. The prospect of caring for such a large number of formerly homeless people -- some with AIDS, some with drug or alcohol problems, some mentally ill -- concentrated in one building discouraged applicants, officials said. The location near Times Square compounded the difficulty.
In addition, there were concerns over the renovation work, said Ruth Kahn, chairwoman of the human services committee for Community Board 4. "They did the most god-awful job," she said. "It looks like a prison. The rooms look like little cells."
The city again asked for applicants, and again got only one reply, this time from Clinton Community Services, a five-year-old agency that helps homeless people find housing.
 
Contract Awarded
 The agency, which has an operating budget of only $300,000, had never run an S.R.O., but planned to enlist the Central Brooklyn Urban Development Corporation, a private agency, to provide managerial experience.
Clinton got the contract. Then, last July, news reports said that Sylvester Leaks, who headed the Central Brooklyn group, had been ordered to relinquish management of two federally subsidized buildings after an audit found major maintenance problems. Mr. Leaks denied any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, Clinton Community Services withdrew from the Holland project.
In September 1990, the Human Resources Administration sent out yet another request for proposals. This time, three groups replied.
Clinton Community Services sent in a new proposal, this time listing T.U.C. Management Company, headed by Bradford Winston, as its coapplicant. Mr. Winston's company manages S.R.O.'s that house formerly homeless people, and is well known to the city. On the signature page, "Brad" was scrawled on the coapplicant line.
The Doe Fund, another applicant, runs a residence for 70 formerly homeless adults. The third applicant was Selfhelp Community Services, a 55-year-old social-service agency with a $40 million budget. It had never worked with the homeless, but managed 800 units of housing for poor elderly people.
 
Debate Over Tenants
 Selfhelp won the unanimous endorsement of Community Board 4 because of its record and because it proposed that 190 of the Holland's tenants be over 55 years old, with the balance divided between people with AIDS and people with mental illness -- a population the community board found acceptable.
But the city wanted an operator who would "respond to our greatest need," to house young unemployed people, Ms. Wackstein said. Clinton Community Services agreed, and this January was again awarded the contract.
But after the application was approved, Mr. Winston told officials that had never agreed to be the coapplicant. He said he had met once with Mary Clark, Clinton's executive director, but had only agreed to give the group technical assistance. He would never have signed his name as just "Brad" on a legal document, he said.
Ms. Clark said the document that listed Mr. Winston was a working paper submitted accidentally. "It was a boo-boo," she said. On Feb. 28, Clinton Community Services withdrew from the project for a second time.
The Human Resources Administration had never called Mr. Winston to verify his participation before giving Clinton the contract. Jeffrey L. Carples, deputy commissioner of adult services at the agency, said that the selection of contractors is based on the applications they submit, and that the accuracy of the information is checked afterwards.
Ms. Messinger, the Borough President, strongly criticized that process. "Before they announce a winner, the investigation should be thorough," she said. "And in this case, the basis for selecting the group was that they had gotten a strong partner with experience managing S.R.O.'s. It would have taken one call to check that."
Once again, the agency is looking for someone to run the Holland. It may pick Selfhelp or the Doe Fund, Mr. Carples said. Then again, it may issue a fourth request for proposals.
Fred Papert, president of the 42d Street Development Corporation, a private nonprofit group, said he hoped the city would find a manager to turn the Holland's troubled history around. "It would be a great sadness if the Dinkins administration let it slip back into an ugly battle," he said.

HEADLINE: Bolshoi Producers to Declare Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Entertainment Corporation USA, which is producing tours this year of the Bolshoi Opera and dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet, will declare bankruptcy on Monday, a founder and director of the corporation's British parent company said yesterday.
Peter Brightman, the company's British director, said he did not expect cancellations of the Bolshoi Opera, which is scheduled to open at the Metropolitan Opera House on June 25, and the Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet tour, which is scheduled to open on April 11 in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
 "Fundamentally, we believe these tours are going to take place," Mr. Brightman said yesterday. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Opera House said yesterday that neither the Bolshoi Opera performances nor a summer season by the Royal Ballet, also to have been produced by Entertainment Corporation USA at the Metropolitan, had been canceled. He said that meetings with the company would continue on Monday.
"Basically, the company will go into Chapter 7," Mr. Brightman said. "We have new investors. But there are all sorts of legal problems. What happened is that a new company is being formed on Monday, subject to approval by trustees and the court."
He said that talks with James L. Nederlander, the theatrical producer, had been discontinued. Mr. Nederlander had been named as a possible partner in producing the Bolshoi Opera this summer at the the Metropolitan and at the Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Va., just outside Washington. "At the moment, he is not involved," Mr. Brightman said. Talks between the Royal Ballet and the Metropolitan will continue next week.
Mr. Brightman said that Entertainment Corporation USA, formed in 1989, had a deficit "in excess of $500,000." He attributed the problems to the "economic recession being faced here and certainly in London," adding that the company had also been hurt by recent cancellations of tours by the Red Army Chorus in England and the Georgian State Dancers in the United States.
Presenters of the Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet said yesterday that they had received no cancellation notices and that ticket sales had been going well. "We heard today that the tour would continue," said Elisa Getto, executive director of Ruteckerd Hall in Clearwater, Fla.

HEADLINE: Secured Credit Cards: Ask Before You Leap

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
As many as 40 million Americans cannot obtain credit, including the two million people a year whose credit cards are revoked, specialists in the banking field say.
These consumers, as well as others who have difficulty getting bank cards like Visa or Mastercard, are the prime candidates for a category of cards known as secured cards. They are usually willing to pay for the privilege of having a credit card with annual fees, interest rates, late charges and over-limit fees higher than those of regular credit cards. 
 A regular card assures merchants that the bank or savings and loan that issues it will pay for purchases or services if certain conditions are fulfilled. Consumers pledge to repay the issuing bank, with interest, if the monthly bill is not paid in full.
But a secured credit card also requires the holder to keep collateral in the issuing institution against possible default that amounts to at least as much money as can be borrowed on the card.
For those whose applications for regular Visas or Mastercards are rejected, or who lose their cards because of bankruptcy or other serious financial problems, secured cards may be useful, at least temporarily.
But some financial institutions that specialize in secured cards, or the middlemen who market secured cards for those institutions, charge high fees, use deceptive advertising or engage in other practices that consumer advocates deplore.
"The good news about them is that they truly can be a way for a person to establish or re-establish a positive credit history," said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a credit-education organization. "The bad news is that they are frequently marketed by boiler-room purveyors who charge exorbitant fees."
Bankcard Holders sells a list of banks offering secured cards. The fee is $3, sent to 560 Herndon Parkway, Herndon, Va. 22070.
Marvin Kaplan, a spokesman for Associated Credit Bureaus, a trade association, added: "People should not get these cards though a third party, but should go out and shop for themselves. A lot of them are promoted by credit-repair clinics that hold out the lure of promises that probably won't be fulfilled."
 
'Savings' as Collateral
 Secured credit cards became popular in Southern California in the late 1970's; the concept has since spread to other parts of the country. They look like any other bank card and are accepted equally by merchants and service establishments.
Because a credit card is now a virtual necessity to cash a check, guarantee a hotel reservation or rent a car, the secured credit card has attracted a wide segment of the population.
To obtain a card, you open a savings account that serves as collateral for the credit made available (minimum amounts range from $500 to $5,000), generally at a bank specializing in secured credit cards.
The line of credit, the amount available to the holder, is typically equal to half or all the amount in the savings account. When the bank pays interest on the account, it is normally at below-market rates, say, 4 or 5 percent.
"Once you establish or re-establish credit this way, the standard card issuers will usually solicit you after three or four years," said Frank Martinez, vice president of Key Operations Inc., a bank that issues secured cards in Havre de Grace, Md. "It's almost a rehabilitation process."
Budget and Credit Counseling Service, a nonprofit New York organization, has arranged with American National Bank of New York , a Larchmont, N.Y., issuer of secured cards, to offer the cards to people who complete the service's debt-management program.
"If, after a year, you pay your bills regularly, they'll give you the card uncollateralized," said Luther R. Gatling, president of the service.
Because so many consumers are desperate for credit, the secured credit-card business has attracted unscrupulous promoters who use illegal or unethical practices. Many employ heavy television or direct-mail advertising through which they charge "application" or "processing" fees ranging from $15 to $300. Sometimes the fee is just for providing lists of banks in the secured-card field, often without the banks' knowledge. Others merely mail applications for secured cards and the applicant is unaware that there is no assurance of actually receiving credit.
"Some phony outfits promise to get you a card and then close down," said H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a credit-card newsletter in Los Angeles. "Over the years, this has been one of the black marks on the industry."
Kurt T. Peters, editor of Credit Card News, a Chicago publication, said: "Secured credit cards seem to attract a certain kind of marketer. You may be out the money for a secured deposit and also have a dead credit card on your hands."
And so it's important to check out the card's issuer and marketer, determining all costs and qualifications before paying any money. Ask your local Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General of the state where the bank does business if other consumers have complained. Also, be wary of the "900" telephone number used by some institutions to sign up customers; that initial charge could add $9.95 to $80 to your overall expense.

 
 
Knowing What to Expect
If you are applying for a secured credit card, here are some questions to ask:
Is the card a general-purpose card?
Some cards being advertised are really not general-purpose credit cards at all but credit instruments good only for merchandise bought through a particular company's catalogue.
Will I get an actual card?
Some marketers simply send to those who have paid their fee a list of financial institutions that are said to provide cards.
Should I use a 900 telephone number to handle the transaction?
The cost of doing that may be very high. If the price of the call is not disclosed at the start of the call, ask about it.

HEADLINE: Now, Save Prince William Sound

 BODY:
Exxon's $1 billion settlement of state and Federal claims stemming from the calamitous Exxon Valdez oil spill is clearly preferable to a long and chancy trial that might have yielded a smaller penalty. But the real test will be whether the money is spent wisely.
The six Federal and state agencies controlling the funds will inevitably lodge competing claims. These claims must not be allowed to shortchange the main victim of one of the worst environmental disasters in American history: Price William Sound. 
 Under the settlement, Exxon and a shipping subsidiary will plead guilty to four Federal criminal charges, pay an immediate criminal fine of $100 million and an additional $900 million over 10 years to settle civil claims brought by the Federal Government and the state of Alaska.
The agreement wisely includes a "reopener" clause, obligating Exxon to pay an extra $100 million if damages turn out to be greater than presently anticipated. And while the settlement relieves Exxon of Federal and state liabilities, the company still faces 300 smaller suits brought by fishermen, food processors and other individuals and businesses.
The settlement isn't perfect. The Justice Department might also have pressured Exxon to fork over the entire $1 billion immediately. True, Exxon has already paid a stiff price for its carelessness -- $2 billion so far in cleanup costs. It's also true, as Justice argues, that the additional $1 billion can't be spent right away. But that's disingenuous. A one-time payment would begin earning interest immediately; the same amount spread over 10 years will lose value through inflation.
A further question is why Justice chose not to sue Alyeska, the pipeline consortium composed of Exxon and other companies with drilling interests on the North Slope. Alyeska, which had piously assured the public that it could handle any emergency, thoroughly bungled the Valdez spill. One theory is that the Justice Department feared that Alyeska would countersue the Coast Guard, which also performed miserably. As one Congressman put it: "For Alyeska and the Coast Guard, this agreement may be more shield than sword."
The agreement is unlikely to be changed, so the task now is to make sure it does the most good. Six different agencies -- three Federal, three Alaskan -- will collaborate in administering the funds. The agreement calls vaguely for the "restoration, rehabilitation or replacement of natural resources" or the acquisition of "equivalent resources." Those words could mean almost anything, from cleaning beaches to land acquisition for wildlife refuges to building recreational parks to encourage tourism.
There will be many good ideas and hard choices. But the first beneficiary of the money should be the sound itself. Eleven million gallons of oil did not, as some feared, turn Prince William into a dead sea. The beaches are now much cleaner and there have been predictions, challenged by some environmentalists, that salmon runs will reach record proportions this year.
But coastal wetlands have suffered grievously, as have colonies of sea birds and the bald eagles, shellfish and other species vital to the food chain and the local economy. Despite the sound's hardy resilience, there's no guarantee that the ecosystem will recover on its own. Exxon devastated that ecosystem; Exxon's money ought to be targeted first and foremost at speeding its renewal.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Winners And Losers

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Republican leaders, who were on the defensive last summer about taxes, the budget, abortion and other domestic issues, now are gleefully charging Democrats with having been wrong, at best, and unpatriotic, at worst, in opposing the Persian Gulf war.
That war was shorter and U.S. casualties were fewer than I, for one, feared they might be. Iraqi resistance was weaker, Arab allies' reliability greater and the American triumph more overwhelming than I expected. 
 These misjudgments certainly influenced my opposition, and no doubt that of some Democrats, to President Bush's decision -- narrowly approved by Congress -- to go to war with Iraq in January. But they do not prove that that opposition was also "wrong"; nor does the desert victory necessarily mean that Mr. Bush chose the better course.
The world will never know whether the policy he first adopted, and that I and many Americans wholeheartedly supported -- international economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait -- would have worked had it been sustained, as it could have been, for more than a few months. That Mr. Bush decided on war, instead, means that the possible efficacy of the collective economic sanctions never can be determined.
The war was a success. That does not mean that the other strategy might not have succeeded, over a longer period, but at a lower cost -- in dollars and lives, American as well as Iraqi; or that it might not have left the U.S. in a better long-range position in the Middle East, or at the head of a "new world order," than it is as the military victor over what proved to be a weak opponent.
Some argue that Saddam Hussein's erratic but determined leadership shows he never would have knuckled under to sanctions; that leaves out of account what else might have happened in the world during six or eight more months of sanctions. It's also argued that those months would have given the Iraqis more time to build up their defenses; in view of the weak resistance actually offered, and the overwhelming coalition power -- not to mention sanctions still at work -- this argument is not persuasive.
Those who supported the resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to go to war have a right to argue, and they certainly will, that the war's success supported their judgment. Some -- not all -- of them also have the right to say that they judged likely military events more accurately than did others. None of that makes it wrong, and certainly not unpatriotic or cowardly, to have opposed the war.
The most prominent Democratic victim of his opposition vote, and of current Republican taunting, is Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia -- no longer, as he seemed to be last year, a likely Presidential candidate. Perhaps that was as inevitable as his nay vote is irrecoverable. But do the American people really scorn Senator Nunn's reasoning?
"I considered my basic philosophy on war and peace," he told Robin Toner of The New York Times, "and that is that you should fight wars only when it's in your vital interest and there's no other reasonable alternative. And I felt then that there was a reasonable alternative, and I still feel there was a reasonable alternative. . . . I've also had the position, and nothing about this conflict is going to change it, that war is a last resort."
Another Democrat who voted against war in January was Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the chairman of a subcommittee on Mideast affairs. In an article for The Washington Post, Mr. Hamilton made two points that may be of increasing importance as time goes on:
"How do you calculate the cost" not only of Americans killed and wounded, but of an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Iraqi casualties? "How do you estimate the cost of reconstructing devastated cities? How do you measure the cost of environmental damage to the air and waters of the Persian Gulf and the cost of destroyed oil wells and facilities? Were we wrong to support a policy that might have spared these lives and that damage?"
Mr. Hamilton pointed out, moreover, what Secretary of State Baker may have learned on his Middle East trip -- that "every tough issue on the Middle East agenda remains ahead of us after this war. . . . our military success will be of little lasting value if we do not fare well with postwar political and economic challenges."
There's no doubt who won the war, and who gained the most politically by the victory. But those inclined to deride the political losers might yet have cause to regret their intemperance. As an old Semblan proverb has it, the wise at nightfall praise the day.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Not Violating Refugee Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Camps Victimize Vietnamese Boat People" (letter, Feb. 23), Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, accuses the Hong Kong Government of intentionally maintaining "woefully inadequate living conditions" in the detention centers for Vietnamese asylum seekers to deprive them of basic dignity. 
 The Hong Kong Government rejects this distortion. It has scrupulously observed the obligations laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the world community.
Since 1975 about 185,000 Vietnamese have come to Hong Kong in hopes of resettlement in the West, particularly the United States. None have been turned away. All are given refuge, food, clothing, medical care and, where possible, education and training. Hong Kong has spent $450 million caring for the Vietnamese. Scarce land and government resources needed for Hong Kong's own use have been given over, though Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places on earth, with 5.8 million people crowded into a territory about one-third the size of Long Island.
We are host to nearly 8,000 Vietnamese judged by a screening process approved and monitored by the United Nations refugee agency to be political refugees. While they wait for Western nations to take them, they are housed in open refugee centers and are free to move about and obtain employment. Unfortunately, more than 1,000 have been stuck in camps in Hong Kong more than five years, a sad commentary on the generosity of the international community.
Also, nearly 15,000 Vietnamese found by the screening to be illegal immigrants will not be accepted by Western nations. Under the auspices of the High Commissioner for Refugees, Hong Kong began a program in March 1989 of voluntary repatriation. Almost 7,000 have volunteered to return home. Neither the United Nations refugee agency nor any other has found any indication that they suffered persecution upon return.
We are processing quickly 29,000 more Vietnamese awaiting screening. All have access to legal counsel and the right of appeal.
Most of the problems in the centers are due to overcrowding. The difficulties were exacerbated by more than 52,000 arrivals in 1988 and 1989. The living conditions have improved, as we have dedicated increasing resources to the Vietnamese. A new center opens this month managed by a nongovernmental organization.
Those concerned with the plight of Vietnamese in crowded centers might use their energies to persuade Western governments to change their policies toward Vietnam and help redress the economic difficulties that most of those leaving Vietnam are fleeing. Alternatively, they might accept the terms of the international agreement signed in Geneva in 1989, and endorsed by the United States, which stipulates that these economic migrants be returned to their homeland.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, Stung by State Budget, Sinks in a Poll

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget woes, which have been around for months, turned up as a poll problem yesterday as his ratings in a nonpartisan survey dropped to their lowest point in his eight years in office.
Fifty-two percent of those questioned in a Marist College Institute of Public Opinion poll rated the Governor's performance as only fair or poor, largely because of dissatisfaction with his fiscal policies, said Lee M. Miringoff, who supervises the Marist survey. 
 The poll was conducted as the Governor confronted the biggest budget deficit in the state's history and as friends and foes continued to speculate about whether he would seek the Democratic Presidential nomination next year.
The Marist poll of 583 registered voters, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, also indicated that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato is still paying the price for questions about his integrity. Fifty-two percent of those polled gave him a poor or fair grade, the same mark as for the Governor. The Senate Ethics Committee has been investigating the Senator's involvement in the awarding of housing contracts.
As for potential Democratic challengers to Senator D'Amato next year, Attorney General Robert Abrams is the strongest at the moment, and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate in 1984, is among the weakest, according to the poll.
 
Praise From Rinfret

Mr. Cuomo's decline in the poll, which was conducted on Feb. 28 and March 4, reinforced the impression left by last November's election, when he won a third term with 53 percent of the vote against one of the weakest opponents ever fielded by the New York Republican Party. In 1986, Mr. Cuomo was elected with 64.6 percent against Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive.
Coincidentally, his opponent last fall, Pierre A. Rinfret, praised the Governor's budget cuts yesterday in a Public Broadcasting System television interview.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo blamed his relatively poor showing in the November election on a low turnout in normally Democratic New York City and a nationwide anti-incumbent sentiment.
A spokesman for the Governor, Tom Conroy, said yesterday, "The Governor is delivering the raw truth on the budget, and he's paying for it politically." He added that "people don't like spending cuts and they don't like taxes."
Customarily, a Presidential candidate's popularity in his home state is important, but Carter Eskew, a Democratic political consultant in Washington, said yesterday that even with the poll decline, Mr. Cuomo "is still remarkably stronger than other Northeastern governors with budget problems." He said that Mr. Cuomo had "tremendous resources" and had articulated Federal responsibility for many of the states' fiscal problems.
 
Abrams's Lead
 Yet, Mr. Miringoff said much of the drop had to do with Mr. Cuomo's specific fiscal policies. The respondents called the budget, taxes and cutbacks the state's biggest problems. Many of those polled also criticized Mr. Cuomo's proposed spending cuts and layoffs of state employees, half of them saying they would prefer taxes on corporations and the affluent to be raised instead.
In the Senate survey, only Mr. Abrams ran ahead of Mr. D'Amato, by 47 to 41 percent. Mr. D'Amato ran slightly ahead of City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and well ahead of his 1986 opponent, City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Mark Green and Ms. Ferraro. Mr. D'Amato's lead over Ms. Ferraro was 20 percentage points.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Two Reasons for Dancing in the Streets of New York

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
It's been a big week for the good guys, no doubt about it. If you're in the New York City architecture and preservation business, things have suddenly been going so well you could start feeling like Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. First the United States Supreme Court declines to review the landmarks case involving St. Bartholomew's Church, effectively killing forever the church's plan to erect a skyscraper on a portion of its landmark property on Park Avenue -- and ending the bitterest landmarks dispute of the decade entirely in the favor of the landmarks lobby.
 The ink is barely dry on that story when Donald Trump and a group of do-good civic organizations announce that they are joining forces on a new, revised plan for the 72-acre Penn Yards site on the Upper West Side -- a plan that looks mysteriously like the restrained and sensible design the civic groups have been demanding all along, and not a bit like the huge and overbearing scheme Mr. Trump has been insisting he would build. 
 What's going on here? At this rate it wouldn't be surprising if Mayor Dinkins announced his intention to tear down Madison Square Garden and re-erect the old Pennsylvania Station. And all of this follows by just a couple of days the opening of the new Henri Bendel store at 712 Fifth Avenue, another triumph for the forces of landmark preservation and good planning in New York City. There hasn't been a spate of good news like this since Olmsted and Vaux unveiled their design for Central Park.
 So is it too good to be true? Well, certainly not in the case of St. Bartholomew's. The high court has spoken, and that's that. Period. By deciding to let stand a lower-court decision denying St. Bartholomew's the right to overturn the city landmarks designation and erect a 47-story skyscraper on its landmark property, the Supreme Court has spoken, firmly if implicitly, in favor of the benefits that saving great landmarks can bring to society at large.
 The church had argued that tearing down its community house and putting up a profit-making tower would bring money that would subsidize its other activities, including feeding the poor. Advocates of the St. Bart's skyscraper project thus not only tried to make a case that building the tower would be socially beneficial, but some even went so far as to suggest that not building the tower would be tantamount to denying food to the poor.
 The courts did not buy this highly disingenuous argument, or its corollary that landmark designation for this great church, designed by Bertram Goodhue and built in 1919, was an unreasonable interference of government in the practice of religion. By the same reasoning that permits the government to enforce public-welfare laws, like fire safety, in churches the Supreme Court deemed landmark designation a perfectly reasonable exercise of governmental authority. Its silent ruling -- letting a lower-court decision stand without comment -- implicitly accepts this.
 More important still, it accepts the argument that landmark designation has a positive benefit -- that society at large is helped if the St. Bartholomew's Church complex is allowed to remain on Park Avenue. The joys of this Byzantine church and its community house, set in a garden that is itself the last remaining public open space on Park Avenue, are available to everyone in New York. It is not too flippant to say that in the preservation of St. Bartholomew's as an intact piece of the cityscape there is some benefit to the soul not unlike that which the church aspires to within its doors.
 Emotions ran astonishingly high in the St. Bartholomew's case: the preservation community saw it as a symbolic last stand, while for the church it represented a huge potential windfall. That made this tiny plot of land the subject of tremendously high stakes for both sides.
 Emotions were no less intense, though, regarding what, until a week or so ago, was going to be called Trump City, the site of the huge old railroad yard along the Hudson River from West 59th to 72d Streets. Here, after years of fighting between a developer and a community as bitter as any in New York, suddenly there is peace. Not only peace, but compliments on all sides. Was that really Donald Trump saying on the evening news how wonderful he found the community's proposal for this plot of land?
 When a lion lies down with a lamb, one is always a bit suspicious of what the lion expects to get out of the deal. But Mr. Trump has never been as much of a lion as a tiger -- and a paper one at that. And when his kind of paper -- the junk bonds of the 80's -- evaporated, well, there went his roar.
 The fact of the matter is that Mr. Trump had no real choice but to capitulate before the coalition of community groups opposed to his Trump City project. His version of the design -- which called for more than 14 million square feet of space, a 150-story skyscraper as a centerpiece, and a shopping mall so vast it would have dwarfed most suburban centers -- stood no chance of being approved, and the developer knew it. Such a scheme could not have been approved by the city, and even if it had, it would have had to pass a gantlet of court challenges that could have tied it up for a generation. Even then, it probably could not have been financed -- since Mr. Trump, like all real-estate developers, builds not with his own money but with what banks are willing to lend him.
 And that brings us to what is surely the real reason this remarkable deal, the urban-planning equivalent of Shamir and Hussein sitting down to break bread, became possible: the banks that held Mr. Trump's mortgage wanted to see a plan that had some chance of getting built. Even if Mr. Trump's celebrated financial problems make it impossible for him to build the project himself, the new scheme makes this piece of land a lot more salable to someone else.
 The design of what is now called Riverside South was largely the work of a coalition of community groups, led by the Parks Council, Westpride, the Municipal Art Society and the Regional Plan Association. Paul Willen was the prime architect for the project, along with Daniel Gutman, an engineer, and the firm of Andrews & Clark.
 The basic idea involves relocating the West Side Highway, now an elevated structure along the waterfront, inland to free the river's edge for a public park. (In the Trump City plan, the elevated highway was to remain, cutting most of the project's parkland off from the river.) In the Riverside South design, the highway would curve inland above 59th Street, then back out again to meet the present highway at 72d Street. It would be slightly depressed for much of its length, with a southern extension of Riverside Drive set beside and partly over it. That new Riverside Drive would be lined with tall apartment buildings in the manner of Central Park West; on the eastern portion of the site would be an extension of the existing grid of Manhattan streets.
 It's vastly more sensible than the exercise in gigantism represented by Trump City, designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners. Indeed, the whole plan is a testament to moderation, political realism and intelligence. Did it happen only because Mr. Trump got desperate, and his bankers got impatient?
 A huge share of the credit must go to the civic groups, who were willing to swallow their pride and negotiate with the man who for six years has embodied all they despise. But the Parks Council, Westpride and the Municipal Art Society did more than just sit down with Mr. Trump: these private groups showed a degree of vision and daring that has seemed altogether absent in the city government. The groups' efforts in the final stages of negotiations were coordinated by Richard Kahan, the former head of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Battery Park City Authority and now in charge of the Urban Assembly, a private research and planning group. It was Mr. Kahan's expertise that got the groups and Mr. Trump to agree on a total size for the project, 8.3 million square feet, that represented a density that both met good planning standards and promised to achieve economic viability.
 But in the end, it is hard not to be struck by the curious fact that the last party to join in this agreement was the one that should have come aboard first: the city government. The city had nothing to do with bringing this coalition of private citizens and Mr. Trump together, and the city's planners initially did nothing to support it. Only after the lion had lain down with the lamb and made peace did the city join in and support this remarkable -- indeed, extraordinary -- event in the history of New York.

HEADLINE: SHOPPER'S WORLD;
Mexico's Village Of Guitar Makers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER; LARRY ROHTER is the West Coast culture correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
FOR more than 450 years, ever since the Spanish conquistadors arrived in west-central Mexico, guitars have been a way of life in the town of Paracho, high in the Sierra Nevada in the state of Michoacan. It was a priest accompanying the original conquerors, Vasco de Quiroga, who decided that each Indian village should be taught a craft that would enable its residents to support themselves as they were incorporated into the Spanish colonial system. And just as it fell to Santa Clara to become a copper-making site and Uruapan to turn out lacquerware, Paracho soon gained fame as Mexico's principal center for the manufacture of stringed instruments.
As it turned out, the choice made by Tata Vasco, as the cleric is still known affectionately to the people of Michoacan, was a wise one. Paracho, about three hours' drive southeast of Guadalajara, is surrounded by meadows of grazing sheep and goats and a cool, thick forest of pine, augmented in recent years by fragrant stands of eucalyptus. During most of its history, it also lived largely in isolation, thereby allowing guitar-making families to hand down their venerable craft from father to son without worrying that their progeny would be tempted to wander off elsewhere. In other words, both the raw material and the skills needed to produce guitars have always been close at hand. 
 Nowadays, the production of guitars in Paracho is a much more sophisticated process, drawing on materials from around the world. The finest instruments are made of rosewood imported from Brazil or India and of spruce from Canada or the United States. The designs on the elaborate inlays around the guitar sound holes may appear to be indigenous, based perhaps on patterns handed down from the Purepechua people, who were the ancestors of many Paracho residents, or on some Hispano-Moorish archetype. But many of the rosette inlays are actually bought in bulk from Japan and Germany, both of which are increasingly the source of the handtools preferred by the most accomplished of Paracho's guitarreros.
The craftsmanship that brings all these ingredients together, however, is purely home grown and deeply rooted. A stroll down the principal streets of this town of 20,000 makes it seem as if there is a taller, or workshop, attached to every home.

FROM dawn to dusk, the streets of Paracho are filled with old men leading burros loaded with hardwood ready to be worked. Children run down the sidewalks carrying bundles of guitar necks, eager to get out of the house after sanding instruments for hours at a time. Inside workshops open to the street and littered with wood shavings, their fathers can be seen carefully gluing guitar sides, fronts and backs together as their mothers do delicate inlay work on the frets or apply lacquer to the body of the guitar.
"I grew up among people who worked the wood, and if you see that daily, you come to it naturally," Jose Luis Diaz Reyes, one of Paracho's most respected luthiers, said as he fit the neck of a guitar to the body he had made by hand, an apprentice watching closely in his shop at 361 Calle 20 de Noviembre. "My grandfather made violins, and I couldn't have been more than 9 years old when I started with him, picking the wood he would use. I worked on my first guitar in 1953, when I was 13, and I have never stopped since. But I'm still learning and still improving, and every guitar is a new challenge."
The guitar makers of Paracho divide their output into two categories: the handmade, carefully crafted guitarra fina and the cruder guitarra comun. The latter can be purchased for as little as $20, though prices can range up to $150. The fina runs from about $500 to $1,500. But those guitars are truly made to order, allowing the purchaser to choose not only the types of wood (rosewood, ebony, palo santo, spruce, pine, cedar, walnut) and guitar adornment but also one of four timbres: bright, deep, sweet and mellow.
The economic crisis from which Mexico is only now beginning to emerge substantially reduced the domestic market for fine instruments and also resulted in the proliferation of guitar factories, in which cheap and shoddy instruments are turned out on a production line. Nevertheless, certain families in Paracho have a tradition of craftsmanship that they have been able to maintain: the Amezcua, Caro, Diaz, Granados, Reyes and Soto families are perhaps the most prominent. Competition among them is intense, and they do not always speak well of each other when questioned, but their individual pride of craftsmanship is unmistakable.
With communications with the outside world improving, some of Paracho's younger luthiers have branched out and begun to make electric guitars and basses. A few of the more adventuresome have even been lured northward to work in guitar shops on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, a city that has more people from Michoacan as residents than the capital of the state, Morelia. Ruben Vasquez Rubio, 31 years old, was one who made that trip, quickly found work on the basis of Paracho's reputation, discovered that California was not to his liking and is now back in his home town. "It is better to work alone than in bad company," he said.

MANY of the electric instruments produced in Paracho are no more than crude knockoffs of the Fender Telecaster and Gibson Les Paul guitars standard in the pop music world. But in a second-floor workshop above his home at 204 Cuauhtemoc, Mr. Vasquez Rubio displays photographs of an outlandish skull-shaped bass he made while in Los Angeles for Gene Simmons of Kiss and of a no less bizarre guitar he built for George Clinton of Parliament Funkadelic. "I have also made an acoustic guitar to specifications for John Denver and a flamenco guitar for Charo," he said. "But if you want a copy of a Fender Stratocaster, a Gibson, a B. C. Rich or even a Martin, I can do that, too." Prices are roughly half what they would be in a guitar shop in the United States.
In Paracho it is possible to find other stringed instruments of varying quality, at prices comparable to those of the guitarra comun. Many of the guitar makers also produce excellent specimens of the bajo sexto, a traditional Mexican basslike instrument with doubled steel strings, and the rest of the stringed instruments common throughout Latin America. Among these are the tiple, or tenor guitar; the requinto, a small, four-string guitar; and the charango, the tiny, five-stringed Andean guitar made from the bodies of mummified armadillos. Ramon Granados, at 164 Independencia, has tried his hand at lutemaking and found customers as far away as Germany. Violins and mandolins are also for sale in some shops, but the levels of craftsmanship can be erratic.
Since the 1970's, Mexico has held its annual Feria Nacional de la Guitarra in Paracho. The weeklong event, which begins on the second Sunday in August, has become a major attraction for guitar lovers and players from all over the world, and with good reason. Fifty or more of the town's guitar makers, joined by luthiers from other parts of Mexico, compete in several categories for prizes and offer their finest instruments for sale. There are guitar expositions and concerts, ranging from classical and flamenco music to Mexican folk songs and Purepechua tunes that were sung at similar festivals even before the arrival of Tata Vasco.

ONE gauge of the degree of craftsmanship at a workshop is to count the number of certificates that have been awarded as prizes from the national guitar fair; these are displayed on the walls and often used as a bargaining point when it comes time to set a price. Other shops tout their wares by showing off letters and cards from satisfied customers in the United States, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Australia and Britain. "It's a long way to come for a guitar," one visitor from San Jose, Calif., wrote in Mr. Diaz's testimonial registry, "but it's worth it."
For those daunted by distance or the isolation of the town, a wide variety of Paracho guitars can also be purchased at the Casa de la Artesania on the Plaza San Francisco in Morelia. In addition, some guitars from Paracho are available at shops in the Zona Rosa in Mexico City and at the Fonatur chain, which is run by the Ministry of Tourism. (Prices in Morelia and in Mexico City will be roughly a third higher than in Paracho.) Instruments can even be found in trinket stores in Tijuana and other cities on the border, though these tend to be mass-produced, bottom-of-the-line specimens selling for twice or three times the price in the town where they were made. "Yes, it is true that Paracho is known everywhere for its guitars," the luthier David Soto Valencia said. "But the best instruments never leave here. You can only buy them here."
The only hotels and restaurants in Paracho are rather basic. There are good hotels in Uruapan, about 25 miles away, including the Hotel Plaza Uruapan (64 Ocampo; telephone, dialed locally, 30333) and the Meson de Cupatitzio in the Parque Nacional (32060). A room for two will cost about $50 at either place.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Office Leasing;
A Big Drop in 1990 In Mid-Manhattan's Level of Activity

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
HAVING kept at a relatively steady level since 1987, the volume of office leasing in mid-Manhattan dropped dramatically last year, to a total of 15.9 million square feet, from 18.3 million the year before.
Downtown, there was a slight increase, to a total of 5.2 million square feet, from 4.6 million the year before, said a new study by the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage. 
 Law firms leased 1.183 million square feet in mid-Manhattan last year, down 33 percent from 1989, another Cushman & Wakefield study found. Securities and financial service concerns leased 356,000 square feet, down 54 percent. Insurance companies leased 162,000 square feet, down 70 percent.
Banks actually leased more space in midtown in 1990 than they had in 1989, but the overall volume, 969,000 square feet, was 31 percent less than two years ago.
Government assumed the No. 1 position in the downtown market last year, with a total of 813,000 square feet, an increase of 180 percent over the year before. Securities and financial services concerns also showed an increase in leasing activity downtown, but the volume, 800,000 square feet, was one-quarter of what it was in 1986.
"If the financial industry is this distressed, what's going to make New York come back?" asked Maurice H. Solomon, vice chairman of the Julien J. Studley concern. "Now you see law firms struggling."
Among the firms that have too much space is Shea & Gould, which is in the former Exxon Building, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets.
The building's owner, Mitsui Fudosan (New York), said that "a mutually acceptable restructuring of Shea & Gould's lease is being considered to assist the firm in meeting its short-term needs while satisfying Mitsui's long-term expectations."
"As you look out into the business community, what industry is growing?" asked James S. Vanderslice, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield and the branch manager of its New York offices. "I don't see any that's really growing and adding employees. But every industry is looking to operate more efficiently and at a lower cost, and that's what the market is offering right now."
The spurt of government leasing was occasioned in part by a deliberate decision by the city's General Services Department to take advantage of the lower rents available in the battered downtown market. "I think it would be unrealististic to expect that pace of leasing to be kept up," said David A. Tewksbury, a director of Cushman & Wakefield.
Yet, there may be a lot of activity.
"As we're getting into 1991," Mr. Vanderslice said, "interest rates are coming down and rental rates are coming down. That's helping new activity in the market. We're not anticipating a record year in leasing, but we're anticipating a decent year in 1991, much better than we anticipated coming out of the fourth quarter of last year."
"We have a tremendous amount of potential leasing velocity," said Martin Turchin, vice chairman of the Edward S. Gordon Company, a real estate concern. "You have a whole variety of tenancies that are going to have to move, notwithstanding that many of them might not necessarily be expanding, which, historically, was the typical motivation for relocation.
"In terms of tenants of 200,000 square feet or more, there are probably 7 million to 8 million square feet of those tenancies alone that are in the marketplace right now, at the end of 25- or 15-year leases."
"The expectation is that while there will be a lot of velocity in terms of leases being made," Mr. Turchin said, "there is not going to be any significant change in the amount of space that's occupied, so the vacancy rate overall will probably not diminish."
TO get a clearer sense of what the future holds, Mr. Turchin has been looking all the way back to the late 1960's.
Some 35 million square feet of space came on the market between 1969 and 1972, Mr. Turchin said, and "a lot of leases in those buildings" were taken on a 25-year basis, meaning that they will begin expiring in 1994 -- a date that is on the immediate horizon for any company's long-term planning.
"Most of the lease expirations were primarily dictated by financing," Mr. Turchin said. "Up until 1971, most lenders were giving very long-term mortgages. What they wanted to know was that major tenants would be there for the duration of the mortgage, so they didn't have any risk that the building would be exposed before the mortgage was paid off. The lenders required lease terms coterminous with the mortgages and the mortgages were basically 25 years."
He said there was also a cluster of 15-year leases, entered into during the late 70's and early 80's, whose expirations were near.
"The other problem," Mr. Turchin said, "is that most buildings in the first vintage, from 1969 through 1972, have asbestos. Even if tenants have a desire to renew in those buildings, they find they really can't. They're not going to continue to live with asbestos in the premises, and because of it they can't do any alteration work."
In addition, almost half of the leases at Rockefeller Center will expire in three years. That is a vestige of the fact that much of the property used to be owned by Columbia University, with a lease to the Rockefeller interests that ran until 1994. Until the Rockefeller Group bought the leasehold from Columbia in 1985, it would not extend its tenants' leases past 1994.
Moreover, Mr. Turchin noted, "You have landlords now pursuing tenants saying, 'If you're prepared to move a year earlier, we're prepared to assume your unexpired lease liability.' "
BUT there is still a lot of space available -- some 53.9 million square feet in Manhattan as of last week, the Gordon company calculated. Cushman & Wakefield estimates that the vacancy rate in primary buildings in mid-Manhattan will rise this year as high as 19.3 percent. (They already exceed that level in west midtown.) Downtown, the figure could approach 17.9 percent.
"Sure, there's movement," Mr. Solomon said. "There are firms doing O.K. There are leases expiring. And people will want to make deals. The musical chairs will continue, but who's to say that there will be a net increase in overall absorption? I don't think there'll be too much increase for a while."
"A lot of things make markets," he said. "One of them could be psychological. It's a feeling either of diminishing expectations or fruitful expectations. And I think that we're still in diminishing expectations in New York City. When you couple that with the continual firings from the banks and other institutions, what do you have?
"Plus, you have this incredible communications system that's been built around the world, where computers talk to each other and fax machines don't require messengers anymore. And you wonder whether we're dawning on a new era."
He reflected on the virtual disappearance of the 137-year-old W. R. Grace & Company, once known as the "Old Lady of Hanover Square," whose roots run through New York history. Grace, once a great shipping power and now primarily a chemical company, said in January that it would move most of its staff to Boca Raton, Fla., out of its headquarters on West 42d Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue.
"They're leaving because they don't have to be here," Mr. Solomon said. "When you get an old-line firm, a real city firm like Grace going, who I thought had a commitment to New York, then you wonder."

A Class Gift With a Purpose: Creating Teachers

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
To encourage graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to become public school teachers, the class of 1991 has made a $60,000 loan-forgiveness program its senior gift to the institute.
"The gift project is a real expression of what a lot of people in our class have as values," said Jason B. Slibeck, a enior in political science from Russell, Ky., and chairman of the senior gift committee. 
 "M.I.T. is one of the best as far as educating professionals in fields such as engineering, architecture, science and economics," Mr. Slibeck said, but the institute "is not educating that vital group of professionals known as educators, at the primary and secondary levels."
 
Pledges of $91

The gift committee hopes to raise the $60,000 this spring, asking seniors to make an initial lump sum donation and to pledge an additional amount over the next four years. As a symbolic gesture, each of the eight committee members has already promised to give $91 to the fund this year.
The money will be used to forgive M.I.T. loans to members of the classes of 1992 to 1996 who become public school teachers. Mr. Slibeck said that details of administering the fund have yet to be worked out, but he said that after the gift committee determines guidelines for eligibility and distribution, it hopes that M.I.T. will administer the fund.
Mr. Slibeck estimated that about 30 students would have loans forgiven through the fund over the next five years, and he expressed the hope that M.I.T. might continue forgiving loans after the fund is exhausted. dry.
In past years, the money for the traditional senior gift has gone toward more material things: classroom renovations, information maps and, last year, a clock for the Student Center.
 
Praise From a Dean
 Although there is no teacher certification program at M.I.T., students can receive certification through an exchange program at Wellesley College. Students pursuing certification can either complete the program during their undergraduate years or stay on for a fifth year, devoting the full year to teaching, and pay only $1,000 in tuition.
M.I.T.'s dean for undergraduate education, Margaret L. A. MacVicar, wrote to the gift committee expressing her enthusiasm for the idea.
"It is critical," she wrote, "that M.I.T. encourage and support its students, staff and faculty to undertake the critical challenge of K-to-12 education facing this nation."
Not everyone, however, thinks that debt forgiveness ought to be used as an incentive for prospective teachers.
Brian M. Katz, a senior in mechanical engineering, from Larchmont, N.Y, voiced concerns that graduates might leave public education after taking advantage of the loan forgiveness. A better idea, Mr. Katz said, might be to finance a fifth-year program to enable students to receive their teaching certification. Mr. Katz participated in the early discussions of the senior gift committee and is completing requirements for teacher certification through the Wellesley program.
The gift committee, which first met early last fall, decided to establish a teaching fund after holding several open meetings and sending out surveys to members of the class.

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Campus Life pages on March 17 about the Massachusetts Institute of Technology misstated the amount of money students must pay to spend a fifth year at the school, devoted solely to teaching. It is the regular tuition, currently $15,600, not $1,000.

Student Accuses Veteran Professor Of Racist Remarks

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va.

 BODY:
Questions of racism and academic freedom have been raised by a departmental inquiry into complaints that a sociology professor makes disparaging remarks about minorities in class and grades minority-group members and women more harshly than white males.
David Lutzer, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said the inquiry into complaints against the professor, Vernon H. Edmonds, did not involve "talking about the theories" he presents in class. 
 "We're not checking for anyone's 'political correctness,' " Dean Lutzer said. "Academic freedom allows him to teach the sociological theories that he believes."
But Mr. Lutzer said he was concerned about the "pedagogical issues" raised in complaints against Mr. Edmonds, a professor of more than 20 years tenure.
Those issues were first raised in a letter sent to college administrators by a sophomore who took Professor Edmonds's "Principles of Sociology" course, a requirement for the major. The student, Mike Halpin, a sophomore English major from Orchard Park, N.Y., wrote that Professor Edmonds used his classroom as a forum for prejudiced ideas about women and minorities, including jokes about blacks and homosexuals, and that he gave lower grades to women and minority students.
Mr. Lutzer said that the letter has been discussed with Professor Edmonds, who denies the charges. He has been asked to respond in writing.
 
'A Snowball Effect'

 If Mr. Lutzer and the department's acting chairman, David Aday, deem it warranted, the complaint could be referred to a faculty committee for further investigation.
Other complaints have surfaced as well. Both the student Minority Affairs Committee and the Student Association Council have passed resolutions calling for an inquiry into Mr. Halpin's charges. The minority committee reported receiving complaints from 13 other students, two of whom turned over their class notebooks to back up their assertions.
"It's basically a snowball effect," said the minority comittee chairman, David Scott, a transfer student who is a computer science and government double major from Elk Grove, Calif. "Edmonds has been teaching for 25 years and for the past 25 years has been complained about."
University officials declined to comment on whether there had been past complaints about Professor Edmonds. But according to the archives of Flat Hat, the student newspaper, he was reprimanded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1973 after failing four black students in his "Social Problems" course in the fall of 1972. The reprimand charged him with "failing to abide by precise criteria" in grading the students.
The Minority Affairs Committee plans to compare the grades of minority students in Professor Edmonds's classes with those of white men, Mr. Scott said.
In an interview, Professor Edmonds denied the charges, and called Mr. Halpin "a mole" who took the class with "the sole purpose of finding some damaging evidence" against him.
He agreed that minority students tend to avoid his class. "There is some kind of a widespread myth that I lower the grades of black students," he said. "I think they hear it through the grapevine, or through some official or semi-official source."
 
Wants Due Process

 But Professor Edmonds said that in reality, "I have had a number of black students in my classes, and their grades probably average out above the norm."
Professor Edmonds said that if the administration pursued the matter, he would assert his right to due process -- that is, a hearing before the appropriate faculty review committees and, if necessary, further investigation.
Professor Edmonds has been teaching at the college since 1967 and was granted tenure in 1968.
Some students and faculty members have expressed concern that the allegations against Professor Edmonds are aimed at pressuring professors and others to be "politically correct."
 
'He's a Fine Teacher'
 In a letter to Flat Hat, Deborah G. Ventas, an associate professor of psychology, wrote: "Fears about racism, sexism and homophobia in the classrooms are matched by fears among professors that issues of race, class and gender are being forced into the curriculum in the interests of being politically correct."
Professor Edmonds, whose field of expertise is philosophical issues of social science, said that "when you get into the social sciences, facts that don't fit into a certain ideology get passed by the wayside."
Mark Zito, a senior government major from Bedford, N.H., took the "Principles of Sociology" course last fall and wrote to another student publication, The Remant, to criticize Mr. Halpin. "As a student of Dr. Edmonds in Sociology 210 as well as two other classes, I feel qualified to say that he's a fine teacher,", he wrote. "Halpin's alleged factual accounts are grossly misconstrued."
In his letter, Mr. Halpin said Professor Edmonds had gone "so far as to dictate that blacks were happier in slavery."
Mr. Zito said the professor had compared the economic status of black American slaves to that of working-class Europeans and North American industrial workers of the same period. Professor Edmonds, he said, then "revealed the fact" that slaves were economically better off than their white European and North American counterparts, citing a book titled "Time on the Cross," by Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman (Little Brown, 1974), which he said supports this theory by with comparisons of living space, infant mortality rates and other measures.
 
Dispelling Myths

 Referring to the slavery lecture, Professor Edmonds said, "I was primarily dispelling the myths about slavery, which I think are little better than Sunday school." He said he didn't think that the interpretation he offered was "standard" but noted that "the average sociologist doesn't know a whole lot about slavery."
Mr. Aday said: "You can't rule out all partial presentations as illegal. If the idea is to make students think or question, then it won't be prohibited."
But he said: "It's really a very thorny issue. We don't have very much of a way of resolving challenges to academic freedom."

Yes, That's A Tunnel; Yes, That's Light

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Happy days are almost here again. Consumers, at least if one is to believe what they tell pollsters, are now more confident about the future than at any time since early last year.
The rising tide of consumer confidence is probably good news for owners of stocks and of speculative bonds, but it may not be such great information for owners of Government bonds. For Republicans, basking in the glow of the Persian Gulf victory, it could remove the last apparent obstacle to a landslide victory next year. 
 On one hand, it is hardly surprising to see the consumer sentiment numbers starting to pick up. Investors -- who are all consumers themselves, it may be noted -- stopped getting more worried back in October, just as consumers' views of the future were reaching their lows. And by mid-February, investor sentiment began to approach euphoria.
The report that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey had produced a preliminary March reading of 88.0, almost exactly what it was in July, was greeted by Ed Yardeni, the optimistic chief economist for Prudential Securities, as proof that the gulf crisis was "the main cause of the economic downturn."
Particularly impressive in the survey results -- which will be revised before final figures come out in a couple of weeks -- was that the consumer view of the future, as opposed to the present, is now higher than it was last summer. On the other hand, the view of current conditions remains well below prewar levels. Given the rise in unemployment since then, that is hardly a surprise.
Maybe some of that is simply the elation of victory, and will soon fade. It certainly has not shown up yet in such areas as auto sales, and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan seems to be a member of the group that is not convinced the recession is ending. Last week, he hinted that more easing was coming, providing a brief lift for the stock market that soon faded as yet another run at 3,000 came up a loser. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 6.68 points, to 2,948.52.
If it is the gulf that turned off the economy, and that turned it back on again, perhaps it is wise to look there for possible clues to the future. A negative sign is that the direction of events seems to have passed from the generals to the diplomats, who, it will be recalled, were telling Saddam Hussein in July that this country had no position on his border dispute with Kuwait. It is not hard to imagine a prolonged stalemate in which almost everyone gets mad at America for the lack of progress, and in which Americans begin to wonder if the troops will ever come home.
There were, of course, reasons to worry about the economy long before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Newly poor bears are right to say that the war did nothing to bring down budget deficits, or to relieve the excessive debt burdens on many companies. But it is likely that the Fed's aggressive easing of credit will give the economy at least a temporary shot of adrenaline, and the probability is that the rise in consumer confidence is not near an end.

Currency Traders vs. the Central Banks

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Traders who have been predicting a rally for the dollar ran up against the concerted force of the leading central banks last week. The score by Friday was Traders 1, Bankers 0.
In a swift turnaround last month, analysts decided the dollar was too cheap, especially against the German mark. Although falling interest rates are usually bearish for a nation's currency, the traders' optimism survived even the rate-cutting noises made to Congress last week by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 But the dollar's rally apparently smelled of speculation to the tight-lipped central bankers, who sold dollars several times during the week in a bid to rein in the currency. Given the size of the currency market, such gestures are largely ceremonial when an authentic rally arrives, said Robert Gay, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. What's ahead? Probably more erratic gains, as traders keep one eye on the Fed and the other on the future, he added.

British Airways Whines About Its New Competition
 
British Airways P.L.C. wants sympathy. Even after winning permission last week to fly between the United States and the Continent and penetrate the American market in a host of other ways -- rights no other foreign airline has had -- the British carrier is sounding defeated and distraught. It seems British Airways will have to accept some competition from United, American and Virgin Atlantic at Heathrow Airport, London's most convenient. The day before creditors were to seize Pan Am's planes, Pan Am and T.W.A. won British approval to sell their Heathrow routes to United and American. "U.S. negotiators have succeeded in weakening British Airways," a spokesman for the airline intoned, as the company's chairman spoke of reduced profitability. Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, shed few tears. "They're yelping so much it's suspicious," he said. British Airways already plans to invade the Continent by buying a large piece of Sabena World Airlines and forming a new carrier in Germany.
 
The British deal hardly gives America's feeble old international carriers the strength to rise from their wheelchairs. Pan American World Airways, the sickliest case, is earning only enough from its route sale to perhaps survive until someone buys its remaining assets. And Trans World Airlines said the Transportation Department's ban on the sale of three of its six London routes to American, in the interests of competition, imperils its financial health.
 
Maxwell's Plum, or Prune?
 
"Maxwell's Plum," said a Daily News headline Wednesday morning. "Miracle Max!" and "Daily News Lives!" followed that afternoon. Now Robert Maxwell needs to live up to his headlines. The plum he agreed to buy after settling with the unions last Tuesday has shriveled to perhaps half its former circulation of a million-plus, and even less of its former advertising. His purchase of The News -- the Tribune Company is actually paying him $60 million or more to take on the newspaper's liabilities -- is based on agreements by the striking unions to accept sharp staffing cuts. Mr. Maxwell, a British publisher, promised to invest what the News called "mega-money" -- not to mention the mega-time he might need in his trans-Atlantic schedule to lure scores of advertisers, several hundred thousand readers and Jimmy Breslin back to his pages.
 
Exxon, and Taxpayers, Pay Up
 
For a company that earns as much as Exxon, $1.1 billion actually isn't real money. No sooner had the Exxon Corporation agreed to pay such a settlement to Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill than Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman, said there would be virtually no effect on the company's earnings or image. The company also pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors. Exxon's ability to write off the whole settlement save a $100 million criminal penalty will cost taxpayers an estimated $300 million.
 
A Purge at Chrysler
 
Tough times provided the Chrysler Corporation with the perfect occasion to kick a union leader off its board. Cost-saving, Chrysler called it, adding that four of the other 18 members were leaving as well. In fact, it's the loss of labor's voice, responded Owen F. Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors.
 
McDonald's New Burger
 
No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the "McLean" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. "This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard," she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, "It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line."
 
In Brief
 
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising.
 
The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet.
 
The House reluctantly poured another $30 billion into the savings and loan bailout last week.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Putting a Leash on '900' Calls
 
The Federal Communications Commission proposes that callers to "900" numbers get to hear the price tags before they pay. Under rules announced Thursday, the "900" services would have to describe their prices and offerings, then give callers a chance to hang up before they are billed. No longer would callers applying for construction jobs learn only later that the calls had cost them $18 each, as the Government alleges, nor would callers for nearly useless credit cards end up paying $49.95. Several industry representatives blasted the F.C.C.'s proposal as a threat to legitimate "900" services; many provide weather, sports scores and stock information for willing customers. The F.C.C. is likely to issue its final rules by the end of the year.
 
Harsh Message in Output
 
Factory output fell in February for the fifth straight month, indicating that the recession continued to deepen. An eight-tenths of 1 percent drop last month brought production to the lowest level since June 1988. Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns, said that considering last month's dismal employment report as well, the recession now looks to be as long as average. "The short and mild argument has gone down with the February numbers," he said. But consumer confidence appeared to improve in early March after the war.
 
Inflation Just Simmers Along
 
Wholesale inflation continues to simmer despite a tepid economy. While producer prices overall fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the core rate, without volatile food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, said that like Goldilock's evaluation of the baby bear's porridge -- "not too hot, not too cold," he sees the inflation report as "not too inflationary, not too recessionary." Some economists say inflation remains too strong for the Federal Reserve to further ease credit.
 
Modest Cutback From OPEC
 
With Iraq no longer around to bluster about the need for much higher prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to cut production by only 5 percent, or about a million barrels a day. The agreement demonstrates the influence of Saudi Arabia, which wants to keep prices moderate enough to guarantee long-term demand for its vast oil supplies. With neither Iraq nor Kuwait exporting, most OPEC members have quotas far higher than their previous levels. News of the OPEC agreement nudged oil prices up by only 69 cents last week to $20.
 
The Great Bankruptcy Shield
 
France had the Theatre du Grand Guignol, presenting murder, rape, torture and suicide. The United States has the bankruptcy courts. The latest example of creative bankruptcy is an Equitable Life Assurance Society production, starring a partly empty 53-story Times Square office tower and grieving investors. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company accuses Equitable of deceiving other investors and trying to stick them with tens of millions of dollars in losses by throwing the partnership that owns the tower into bankruptcy. This, after Manville used the bankruptcy courts to confront its asbestos claimants; Texaco, to rebuff a challenge from Pennzoil, and Frank Lorenzo, to fend off his striking airline unions. Equitable and Manufacturers reached a tentative settlement on Friday, but negotiations on the exact terms continued.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
A Bigger Slice of Soviet Pie
 
Soviet officials harass foreign businesses, protesting crowds swarm around the Kremlin walls, but Pizza Hut's first two Moscow restaurants claim profit margins higher than in the United States. Russians line up down the block for the chance to pass an hour or two in a Western setting. But the trials of doing business in the Soviet Union have slowed Pizza Hut's expansion plans. Andrew Rafalat, the Pizza Hut executive who opened the restaurants in September, said he first needs to secure domestic supplies of meat and mozzarella cheese, to save the expense of buying them for hard currency in Western Europe and trucking them all the way in. Soviet meat suppliers are still incredulous when he asks them to meet his specifications. "They say, 'We're giving you a scarce product. We're doing you a favor.' " Mr. Rafalat, visiting the Pepsico parent company's New York headquarters last week, said he hopes to open some stand-alone take-out windows in Moscow by the end of the year. But as David Williams, senior vice president of Pepsico Food Service International, said, "Nothing in the Soviet Union comes easily. Nothing is handed to you on a plate." Except for some American-style pizzas, he hopes.
 
Forgiving Poland
 
Leading industrialized nations have decided that the proto-capitalist Poles should not suffer for the borrowing binge of their deposed Communist rulers. To aid Poland's progress toward a market economy, officials meeting in Paris agreed to forgive about half the $33 billion owed and ease repayment terms on the rest. While micro-entrepreneurs have lined several of Warsaw's broadest boulevards with their booths, the most ambitious economic reforms in Eastern Europe have also caused severe unemployment.
 
The Trade Police in Japan
 
Inspectors and police milling around an American rice exhibit at a Tokyo food show last week became, in the view of American officials, a prime exhibit of Japanese protectionism run amok. Japanese officials insisted that the sealed bags and plastic containers of American rice, if not the "Have a Rice Day" bumper stickers, violated laws against rice imports. Americans insisted the display was solely educational.

Muffling the Thunder in the Sky

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
By the year 2000, according to Federal Aviation Administration rules, the nation's noisiest commercial jets must be phased out of the fleet. The trouble is, these aircraft -- built in the 1960's and 1970's -- include almost all of the Boeing 727's, which are among the most economical planes for carrying passengers and freight. To bring these planes into compliance, the engines must be replaced -- which is expensive -- or modified.
Now, Federal Express Aviation Services Inc. in Memphis, Tenn., and Pratt & Whitney of East Hartford, Conn., are developing noise reduction kits -- "hush kits" -- for the JT-8 series of three basic engines. The JT-8 series, built by Pratt & Whitney, is used on the 727's. Certification from the F.A.A. for these kits is expected by fall. 
 Hush kits reduce engine noise by slowing the velocity of exhaust gases and baffling the sounds of the turbines and other moving parts. To reduce exhaust sound, new mixers and farings are added to the engine to blend the core stream of high-velocity gases with lower velocity gases from the fan blades. The kit also modifies the fan blades so more air bypasses the combustion chamber.
Since noise increases with the velocity of the gases, the lower average speed reduces the sound. A new tail pipe reduces the sound further by slowing the exit velocity of the gases. To muffle the turbines, the air inlet of the engine, at the nose cone, is replaced with one with sound-absorbing baffles. Baffles are also added to the support pylon and to the thrust reverse assembly to quiet the plane as it lands.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Playing the Adjustable-Rate Game

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Looking for a fund that has everything? High yields? And stable principal? And guarantees by the United States Government or one of its agencies?
A new breed of funds -- adjustable-rate mortgage-backed funds -- is one solution, although critics say there are problems. These new funds promise higher yields than money-market funds, less fluctuation than long-term bond funds -- and the credit safety of securities backed by American Government agencies. Investors have poured more than $1 billion into the first fund of this sort and rivals are racing into the market. 
 Mortgage funds, of course, are not new; for years, there have been funds that invest in fixed-rate Government National Mortgage Association securities, and those of Ginnie Mae's cousins, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But adjustable-rate funds investing in offerings from these same agencies were developed to eliminate the volatility that has long characterized the fixed-rate funds. Prices for fixed-rate funds must move around to compensate for any shifts in market interest rates that cannot be reflected in the portfolio's fixed rates.
Adjustable-rate mortgage funds also offer competitive yields as rates rise and a cushion against any sharp rate declines.
 But as fund groups rush into the market, some experts worry that investors don't understand the tradeoff that these funds require. "Trying to do it all in one investment is a loser's game," said Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo, N.Y., who believes investors pay too much in total return for reducing volatility.
For those willing to do so, there are now several options. The biggest -- and oldest -- of these funds is the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Securities Fund, sponsored by Franklin Resources, San Mateo, Calif. Its assets soared to $1.3 billion at the end of February; at yearend 1989, they were $76.2 million.
Although it was set up in October 1987 as the Franklin Adjustable Rate Mortgage Fund, it languished until last year. Its name then was changed and sales shot up, partly because it was perceived as a safe haven during market turbulence and because of its solid record. For the 12 months ended Feb. 28, it yielded an average of 9.5 percent -- or roughly 2 points more than the average money market fund, said CDA Investment Technologies, which tracks mutual funds. Franklin's total return -- yield plus changes in principal value -- was 10 percent, compared with 9.2 percent for all bond funds.
This success has drawn rivals: Pilgrim Group, Los Angeles, launched its fund in late February; Keystone Group, Boston, said it plans to introduce one this month, and others are in the works.
 What is the investor's tradeoff for lowering some of the interest rate risk? For one thing, monthly dividends fluctuate more than they would with a standard Ginnie Mae fund, potentially every month, said Jack Lemein, the Franklin fund manager. That could pose problems for people who rely on regular checks to cover their living expenses.
Another problem is that the funds' yields will drop when interest rates fall. That's because the underlying mortgages will pay less over time as the borrowers' rates are adjusted downward. Even when interest rates rise, the funds will lag because the rates on the underlying mortgages are adjusted periodically, not immediately. And when mortgages are prepaid, the money often is reinvested at a lower rate.
"Franklin's quest to significantly lower the fund's volatility has cost investors too much in total return," said Mr. Ogorek.
Consider this, he said: In 1988 the Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Backed Security Index rose 8.7 percent. The Franklin fund rose 6.4 percent, while the Vanguard Ginnie Mae Fund rose 8.8 percent, according to CDA. In 1989, the index rose 15.4 percent, Franklin gained 10.3 percent and Vanguard, 14.8 percent. Last year, the index increased 10.4 percent while Franklin gained 9.5 percent and Vanguard, 10.3 percent.
Meanwhile, the "standard deviation," a measure of risk, for the Franklin Fund is 0.30 percent compared with 1.45 percent for the Vanguard Ginnie Mae Fund. While it is five times higher, 1.45 percent is hardly a risky rating. Municipal bond funds, for example, carry a 1.29 percent rating.
Then there are sales charges. The Franklin fund has a hefty 4 percent sales load, so if you had invested $50,000 in it three years ago, you'd have $61,684 today, for an annual return of 7.25 percent. But if you had invested the cash in money funds for three years, yielding the Donoghue 12-month average at yearend, you would have earned a combined 7.93 percent return -- or more than a half point more than the Franklin fund. Your $50,000 would be worth $62,865.
Mr. Ogorek's conclusion: You can do better by dividing your portfolio among various investments. But if you do want to invest in mortgage-backed securities, buy shares in a regular Ginnie Mae fund, he said.

HEADLINE: McKesson: No. 1 but a Doze on Wall Street

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The 158-year-old McKesson Corporation is old enough to refer to all but a handful of American companies as young whippersnappers. It is big enough to be the only national force in the growing $22 billion business of distributing pharmaceuticals and personal care products to drugstores, hospitals and mass marketers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. And McKesson is good enough at what it does to have been invited by the Soviet Union to help unravel its infamous distribution logjams.
Yet McKesson is greeted on Wall Street with a yawn -- and in some cases, a wince. 
 The main reason has been the company's failure to generate sustained profit growth. During the mid-1980's, there were costly price wars in the company's core business, drug distribution. Those have subsided, but a variety of problems have cropped up in McKesson's nondrug businesses, which account for less than 20 percent of revenues but a higher proportion of profits. These include companies in "service merchandising" that distribute personal care products, candy and other consumer products to 20,000 grocery and discount stores; the nation's largest bottled water business; Armor All Products Inc., a car-care products concern, and PCS Inc., the nation's largest processor of prescription drug bills.
"McKesson has never fired on all cylinders," said Donald Hultgren, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, which ends this month, McKesson's earnings fell 2.9 percent, to $78.1 million, even though operating profits from drug distribution rose 8.9 percent and sales were up 9.6 percent, to $6.25 billion.
Analysts say the company's inconsistent performance is the main reason its share price has climbed about 78 percent since the beginning of 1985, compared with almost 125 percent for the Standard & Poor index of 500 stocks. McKesson's shares began the year at $34 and have stayed at that level while the S. &P. 500 jumped more than 13 percent.
"We have had some real disappointments in terms of maintaining earnings momentum," Alan Seelenfreund, McKesson's chairman and chief executive, acknowledged.
Mr. Seelenfreund and Rex R. Malson, president and chief operating officer, assumed the challenge of shedding that legacy in late 1989 when they were appointed to a new "office of the chief executive" after the abrupt resignation of Thomas Field Jr. as chief executive. The company's five units have since undergone consolidation or other changes in top management and focus.
Part of McKesson's problem, analysts say, is that distribution companies get far less attention than their role in the economy warrants. The public is generally unaware that in the drug business, for example, even large manufacturers like Eli Lilly and Company rely largely on intermediaries like McKesson to keep track of what retailers need and make sure they get it on time.
Analysts say McKesson controls about 27 percent of the drug distribution market, far more than the 15 percent held by the second-ranked Bergen Brunswig Corporation of Los Angeles. McKesson's greatest strength is the nearly 3,300 independent drugstores that operate as part of its "voluntary chain" under the Valu-Rite name, which provides purchasing clout, sales promotions and ancillary services from car leasing to insurance. That helps the independents compete with drugstore chains, the largest of which is the Rite Aid Corporation, with about 2,350 outlets.
McKesson is a strong second to Bergen in the fastest-growing segment of the business, sales to hospitals. Analysts say that McKesson is the most bureaucratic of the drug distributors and was slower than Bergen to recognize the potential of the low-margin, high-volume hospital business.
McKesson has also had trouble keeping up with smaller, more entrepreneurial companies like Wall Street's current favorite, the Cardinal Distribution Company. Based in Dublin, Ohio, Cardinal has been assembled by the entrepreneur Robert Walter over the last decade from six older firms and is now the market leader in the Northeast.
"There are very few national customers and very few economies to having a national scale," said Mr. Walter.
Mr. Seelenfreund responds that few regional firms would mind having the Wal-Mart contract, which should produce about $500 million in revenue this year for McKesson, not to mention McKesson's purchasing clout. And while McKesson has no real advantage over regional distributors in buying automation equipment for individual warehouses, it can spread the costs for its communications and order-processing systems over more operations.
Like all major distributors, McKesson invests far more than manufacturers care to risk on such automation. They exploit their investments by buying large volumes of product at discount prices, often snapping up extra supplies in advance of price increases. For about 3 cents on the dollar, they gather and ship the particular mix of products that customers want on any given day.
Typically, the products are delivered to a local drugstore in small bins organized so that a clerk restocking the store finds everything needed for a particular aisle in the same bin. In many cases, distributors actually manage the restocking of the shelves.
McKesson also is a buying agent for druggists in dealing with scores of producers of generic drugs, which can be substituted for more expensive prescription brands. In some cases, retailers even get financial support. McKesson, for example, secured a loan to a Kansas City druggist who wanted to create a separate pharmacy to serve the needs of people with AIDS for various drugs and prompt insurance reimbursement.
McKesson also has a large business delivering bulk supplies to retail chains that supply their own outlets. McKesson charges a markup of just one-quarter of 1 percent on such deliveries, a miniscule margin that produces profits largely because McKesson pays its bills monthly but collects receivables biweekly.
McKesson began distributing drugs in 1833, by supplying the medicine chests of clipper ship captains. The company was nearly bankrupted in the 30's in a celebrated embezzlement case. In 1967, it was acquired by Foremost Dairies Inc. and became part of a mini-conglomerate involved in pasta production, chemicals recycling, home building, industrial real estate management and liquor distribution, as well as drugs and dairies.
Drug distribution re-emerged as the company's focus during the past decade, when it shed the Foremost name and 17 businesses that represented 60 percent of its sales in 1980. Last year, the drug business accounted for 83 percent of the company's revenues and about 60 percent of earnings. Analysts encourage the company to continue narrowing its focus by selling its 83 percent stake in Armor All and perhaps its water business.
McKesson disagrees, although it concedes that Armor All profits have plunged because of mismanagement, price competition from STP and the recession. But the unit still has a 75 percent market share. "Nothing would enhance shareholder value more at the moment than working to get it back on track," said Mr. Seelenfruend.
And the company is enthusiastic about the prospects for bottled water, which it markets door-to-door to 600 homes and offices, principally in the West, under the Alhambra name. Bottled water produces the highest profit margins in the company, and its consumption is growing far faster than other beverages.
A visit to the company's computer and communications center just east of Sacramento underscores why McKesson's core drug distribution business remains the analysts' favorite part of the company.
The six-year-old center handles up to 5,000 orders an hour at peak periods, and an average of 30,000 per day. Orders are entered electronically. Druggists walk their aisles with hand-held computers supplied by McKesson that allow them to compile their orders in a format reflecting the layout of their stores. To place an order, a druggist simply plugs the computer into the phone. The order travels directly to an A.T.&T. substation at the center via McKesson's satellite communications network.
The orders are processed in anywhere from 12 minutes to 55 minutes by the center's I.B.M. mainframe computers. The computers automatically route instructions for completing the order for next-day delivery to whichever of the 45 distribution centers is nearest the druggist. The system costs just 12.2 cents an order, down from 44 cents in the days when McKesson relied on more error-prone human operators.
The system proved its flexiblity by absorbing the addition of some 957 Wal-Mart stores over a single weekend in 1989, when McKesson took over the account from Foxmeyer Drug, a subsidiary of National Intergroup.
To further exploit such state-of-the-art communications, McKesson is investing in warehouse automation. Analysts say Bergen Brunswick is a step ahead in this area, having already installed two giant Austrian devices that automatically pick a high proportion of each order from storage bins at its largest distribution center. McKesson got diverted by an attempt to develop a huge system based on that used for parts handling by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Cape Canaveral.
"It turned out to be too expensive to make sense for all but the largest centers," said Eugene Dammel, manager of the West Sacramento, Calif., warehouse. "We want to be near the leading edge but not at the bleeding edge."
That philosophy explains McKesson's cautious drive to become the nation's first multinational drug distributor. McKesson's domestic growth is being hindered by antitrust rules that block it from buying major competitors. So last year, it purchased control of Canada's largest drug distribution firm and a 10 percent stake in a Dutch company. A Soviet invitation was declined; too risky, said one executive.
 
 
WHAT WENT AWRY AT PCS
 The McKesson Corporation and Thomas Field Jr., the company's former chief executive, have refused to explain their abrupt parting in 1989, but analysts believe a major strategic blunder by PCS Inc., the company's drug reimbursement subsidiary, played a major role.
PCS, acquired by McKesson in 1972, rapidly achieved market dominance in the new field of managing payments for prescription drugs covered by major health plans. PCS's clients are insurance companies and large self-insured companies like McDonald's. Anyone covered by such a plan is given a card to present to a participating druggist when filling a prescription. The card tells the druggist how much the insurer will cover; the consumer pays the difference. Typically, the insurance payment reflects a discount from the "average wholesale price," a nationally established benchmark.
Some 51,000 drugstores, more than 90 percent of all retail pharmacies, swallow the discount to get a share of the business of the 22 million PCS card users. They also benefit from prompt payment and instant access to PCS's warnings of potential conflicts in drug therapy or overuse when they process a consumer prescription.
In 1986, McKesson sold 14 percent of PCS to the public to capitalize on its rapid growth. Under Donald Dahlin, a former PCS president and a protege of Mr. Field's, PCS began to pursue new clients by offering plans that sharply cut reimbursement rates to druggists. The druggists angrily blamed their supplier, McKesson, for not halting the aggressive tactics of its subsidiary.
Mr. Dahlin left to join a competitor shortly before Mr. Field's departure. Last spring, McKesson recruited Robert Johnson, who was head of the California pharmacists' trade group, to replace Mr. Dahlin and paid $50 million to buy back the public shares of PCS. Since then, most of PCS's top management has been replaced and PCS has pursued a policy of cutting reimbursement levels only when forced to by competition.

Reaping Innovation From Recession . . . And the Recognition of Visionaries

BYLINE: By KARL D. LOOS; Karl D. Loos is a vice president of Arthur D. Little Inc.

 BODY:
Recently, I asked a random sampling of several dozen of my colleagues and business acquaintances for their thoughts about vision, visioning and what qualities they most identified with visionaries. By vision I mean the ability to correctly foresee the future and navigate successfully through it. I also asked them for their thoughts about putting those visions into action and about which leaders -- in general -- they most regard as visionaries. The results of my informal "poll" were enlightening:
* Although the men and women I polled were all in business, none of them cited a business leader or entrepreneur as a visionary. This, I believe, is quite a commentary on how people in business view their peers. 
 * Only three of the eight most frequently mentioned people on my respondents' lists are alive today: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mother Theresa and Lech Walesa. The other people most frequently cited were John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.
* Among the people I polled, not one listed a scientist, author or inventor. Their candidates were all in public policy, politics and social reform.
After reviewing these results, I decided to ask my colleagues specifically for visionaries in the business world. Again, the results were significant:
* More than half of the business visionaries mentioned were deceased: Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's; Thomas Watson Sr., the chief executive who built the International Business Machines Corporation, and Walt Disney.
* Of the living business visionaries who made it onto my respondents' lists, only one was in office: John Young, president and chairman of Hewlett-Packard. The other one, Reginald Jones, former chief executive of General Electric, is retired.
While those who participated in my survey had trouble naming people who are alive as visionaries, they did agree on the qualities that distinguish visionaries from the rest of us: courage, determination and the willingness to take risks.
I found this listing of qualities particularly interesting since it seems to me that the list of qualities my respondents most admire are those that are closely associated with leadership in business.
For example, in their book "Breakthroughs," P. Ranganath Nayack and John Ketteringham described a number of important innovations and how they were brought about. These innovations included the invention of microwave ovens, the development of the ulcer drug Tagamet, the marketing of 3M's Post-it Notes and the introduction of the Sony Walkman.
The authors concluded that elegance of concept, dogged persistence, serendipity and team management skills were critical success factors. Aside from serendipity and team management, these conclusions closely resembled the qualities my respondents agreed were visionary.
Why don't business people see themselves as visionaries? Partly, it is poor public relations. Business people have not been terribly good at telling the world how much they have contributed to it. They have not explained their story well.
But it is also due to the short-term orientation that today's managers must pursue. Visionaries, my respondents agree, are people who look beyond the next quarter. They take the long view and are willing to take risks and mortgage their careers. These are qualities my respondents admire. They are also qualities that, although in short supply, have changed the world.

Time to Curb the Weapon Makers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM D. HARTUNG; William D. Hartung is a senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute in New York City.

 BODY:
One of Saddam Hussein's most impressive "achievements" in the period leading up to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was his ability to use financing and advanced technology from the United States and other countries to build up his arsenal. Our policymakers have much to answer for on this front.
In perhaps the most egregious case, Iraq is believed to have milked the American Government and some banks for $3 billion in unauthorized export credits. These credits, it is alleged, were raised by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. On Feb. 28, an indictment was issued by the United States Attorneys Office in Atlanta against the bank's manager and several Iraqi officials. More indictments are expected. 
 It is believed that these credits were used to buy chemicals, machine tools, high-speed electronic devices and other components for use in Iraq's nuclear, chemical and ballistic-missile programs. American intelligence agencies were apparently aware of this massive financing of the Iraqi war machine, but the loans were allowed to go on for more than two years before the attorney's office finally began investigating.
 Banks were not the only institutions aiding Iraq. Congressional investigators have revealed that between 1985 and 1990, the Department of Commerce granted licenses for the export to Iraq of $1.5 billion in "dual use" equipment -- items that can fashion metal for use in nuclear weapons, for exmaple -- with significant military applications.
Last but not least, for a good part of the 1980's, President Hussein's alleged front man, Sarkis Soghanalian, an arms dealer, is believed to have run an extensive military export operation to Iraq from his offices in Miami. Mr. Soghanalian has admitted that he supplied Iraq with everything from French howitzers to American transport helicopters. He claims to have done so with the knowledge and support of the State Department and the National Security Council. In 1987, Mr. Soghanalian was indicted for illegal arms dealing when he shipped military helicopters to Iraq without a license. This was after he had provided years of assistance to Iraq's military establishment.
The regulatory agencies that should have prevented these outrageous lapses in military export controls were evidently looking the other way. On the theory that Iran represented the greater danger to American interests in the Persian Gulf, Iraq was removed from the State Department's list of terrorist states, given access to billions of dollars in credits, and allowed unimpeded access to military-related financing and technology.
It remains to be seen whether American policymakers will be more cautious about swapping arms for political and military influence in the future. So far, the signals from the Bush Administration are mixed, with Secretary of State James A. Baker only grudgingly acknowledging that it would be worth looking at future arms sales.
Unfortunately, even the belated recognition of the value of arms-transfer controls has been totally contradicted by the rush to supply tens of billions of dollars worth of American arms exports to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Turkey and other states in the gulf region to cement the anti-Iraq coalition and foster postwar "stability." Confidential Bush Administration estimates for the coming year put American arms sales worldwide at a record $33 billion -- $8 billion to $10 billion more than the next-best year.
This new round of military exports is driven by economic as well as strategic motivations. One Congressional aide dubbed last fall's $21 billion American arms offer to the Saudis as "the defense industry relief act of 1990," and for good reason. Three of the systems included in the original prosposal -- General Dynamics' M1 tank, Boeing's Awacs aircraft and McDonnel Douglas's F-15 fighter -- were slated for termination unless foreign customers could be found.
This traditional pork-barrel logic has been given added impetus by the determination among some Bush Administration officials and arms-industry insiders to seize on the success of American weapons in the gulf war as an opportunity to lock up a sizable portion of the Middle East arms market for decades. This would also knock competitors out of the arms business.
It is time to make a clean break from the bankrupt policy of pouring arms into the third world to prop up American allies of the moment against the enemy of the moment. As Saddam Hussein has so painfully demonstrated, continuing on this course could come back to haunt American policymakers down the road.

 BODY:
Reading the article about party politics and patronage ["Democrats Clash Over Propriety of Dual Positions," Feb. 17] tells me the stench on Long Island is not only from the landfill in Port Washington. These hacks throw around $94,000 jobs as if there was no recession and no large unemployment among middle-level managers and blue-collar workers which threatens the very survival of the middle class and the viability of Long Island's economy.
It is very discouraging to this voter that it really doesn't matter which party is in power. They all focus on serving themselves first.

HEADLINE: A Wrong Technology At a Wrong Site

 BODY:
It is unbelievable to me that our County Administration has spent $1.8 million to study a long-term land-based sludge-management system, required under the terms of a 1989 consent decree, only to come up with a plan that selects the wrong technology at the wrong site at the wrong time ["County to Reasses a Plan to Burn Its Sludge," March 3].
To select incineration over composting is environmentally unsound, expensive and inefficient. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's hierarchy of preferred solid-waste management methods, designed to reduce dependency on land burial of wastes, ranks compostings above incineration in the state Solid Waste Management Plan. Incineration with recovery of energy from the solid waste is only to be used on solid waste that cannot be recycled. This sludge, however, can be recycled.
Further, there is no plan to recover any energy from this proposed incineration process and the proposed process will still need a landfill site for the disposal of residue ash. This proposal circumvents the goal, the spirit and the letter of the Solid Waste Management Plan. Westchester's long-term land-based sludge management system should be redesigned as an in-vessel composting process, along the lines of New York City's plan, with a "fair share" given to each community of origin.
The Yonkers Joint Treatment Plant treats 65 percent of the county's waste, which comes from 26 local municipalities, serves a population of over 400,000 people and encompasses hundreds of square miles. This facility has been disposing of its sludge outside of its environs by ocean dumping since its inception.
Why did the county prepare a countywide siting study for this disposal facility rather than one within its catchment basin? Why didn't the administration look to locate disposal sites within the treatment area? How could anyone possibly select a community such as Peekskill, which is less than four square miles and has a population of less than 20,000, that has its own sewage-treatment plan and isn't in the catchment area?
Why weren't actual tests taken to consider the cumulative impact on the air quality in the Peekskill/Cortlandt area of imposing another unwanted and environmentally questionable project? We are host to nuclear power plants, the Resco incinerator, the Sprout Brook Ash Pit, the Croton Point landfill, a hazardous dump at the Harmon Railroad Yard, a low-level radioactive site designated by New York State, pollutants from the Lovett Power Plant across the Hudson and numerous industries. A cumulative health-assessment study must be prepared before this project can be evaluated by the County Board of Legislators.
The environmental-impact statement glosses over the need for 500,000-plus gallons of water a day by the proposed sludge plan and points out that the "Resco Facility at Charles Point is reported to cause a drop in water pressure in the city of Peekskill." It goes on to state that "there are no measures recommended to mitigate the facility's consumption of processed water."
How does the county administration expect Peekskill to fight a fire with low water pressure? Is the bureaucracy aware that Peekskill's water system is trying to develop a plan just to meet the start-up needs of Resco after a boiler shutdown? And, if it is, how does it intend to get processed water?
In 1981 the county canceled a contract with Peekskill to develop sludge-burning at Charles Point. My understanding of this contract is that it allowed the county to make no use of this site unless it is agreed to by both parties. How is the administration planning on using a piece of property over which it has given away control, and for a use which is opposed by the city of Peekskill? The county has selected the only site that the county, by contract, cannot build on.
How is it that New York City, that bureaucratic nightmare of a government, could produce a more environmentally sound, fairer and more efficient plan than Westchester in a shorter period of time? How is it that New York City's plan allowed four months for public comment and ours less than four weeks? How is it that the administration never found the time to give Peekskill's city administration a chance to take part in the selection process? How is it that our consultants could put this enivironmental-impact statement together in only three-and-a-half weeks?
Is it because the administration thinks the March 1 deadline was a gun at the head of every county legislator and that we could be forced to adopt this proposal rather than pay the fines? If it is, they have overestimated their position.
This plan is tragically flawed. It is environmentally unsound and technologically inefficient. It is on a site the county cannot build on, designed outside state guidelines and unfairly placed beyond the catchment area. Finally, and most tellingly, it stinks of the type of social-economic steering that the present administration has been charged with before.

HEADLINE: Search Is On for Next U.N. Secretary General

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 15

 BODY:
The job pays $183,000 a year and brings a chauffeur-driven Volvo limousine, a mansion on Sutton Place and a role in shaping a new world order.
It has been described by one incumbent as "the most impossible, daunting, challenging, rewarding, fascinating, clearly unique job on earth." 
 There is no shortage of hopefuls to succeed Javier Perez de Cuellar as Secretary General of the United Nations when the 71-year-old former Peruvian diplomat steps down at the end of this year, as he has repeatedly said he would after serving two five-year terms.
The merits of at least a dozen possible candidates are being debated by diplomats here and in national capitals, including the Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland; Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of Pakistan, recently coordinator for gulf and Afghan refugee relief; Lieut. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former President of Nigeria, and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas.
But, for the first time, many countries are pressing for the next Secretary General to be selected in a more open way, saying the 15-member Security Council should search worldwide for the best candidate available.
This would be quite a change. In the past the decision has usually come as aback-room political deal among the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China, the five permanent members with a veto on the decision.
"A study of how the five Secretaries General since 1949 were appointed," a recent Ford Foundation study of the office said, "creates two main impressions -- its last-minute and unpredictable nature, and the increasingly parochial level at which the matter is considered by member states."The pressure for change reflects a belief that with the cold war over, the United Nations now has a real chance to function better, but that whether it reaches its potential may depend on who is chosen to run the organization for the next five years.
Calling for reform of what it termed the "present haphazard and predominantly political process" of choosing the Secretary General, the Ford Foundation study argued that the United Nations must adapt to changing world circumstances or become irrelevant, saying "effective leadership will be crucial to this transition."
Over the last few months, a somewhat shifting group of diplomats has been reviewing the choice process and trying to agree on the characteristics of the next Secretary General.
The discussions have yielded a broad consensus on several points, participants say. The next Secretary General should have high-level experience in both the political and economic fields, be a proven manager able to organize and motivate a staff of 14,000, speak English and French well, and exhibit personal appeal and an ability to communicate with news organizations.
In addition, many would like to see the Security Council extract a pledge from the successful candidate to reorganize the United Nations' unwieldy bureaucracy.
"Never before has the whole issue of the appointment been discussed so openly in advance," said Olara Otunnu, a former Ugandan representative at the United Nations, who is mentioned as a possible candidate.
African countries are claiming the job, complaining that Africa is the only region of the world that has never filled the post.
The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France say they are ready to appoint an African, but, as a matter of principle, they oppose rotating the job on a geographic basis. China thinks it is Africa's turn.
Two Africans have declared their candidacy with backing from their Governments -- Kenneth Dadzie, the Ghanaian head of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the Zimbabwean Finance Minister, Bernard Chidzero. Other possible African candidates are General Obasanjo, Mr. Otunnu, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, James B. Jonah, a senior Sierra Leone official of the United Nations and Salim A. Salim, the Tanzanian Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity.

HEADLINE: The Deadly 'Spoils' of War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the article "Big Spoils From a Bargain War" (March 3), the headline proclaims how Americans will profit from the gulf conflict. "Cheap oil for years to come," it continues. "A quicker end to the recession. The Pentagon might even show a profit." With thousands, possibly tens of thousands of people dead, cities devastated, a massive oil spill, hundreds of oil wells burning, and the anticipated aftermath of disease, we should be praying, not gloating.

HEADLINE: Groups Help Each Other Help the Mentally Ill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Last year Robert McDonald, a 44-year-old former systems analyst from Kansas, was in a downward spiral. Suffering from severe depression, he lost his job and his house and was living on the streets in Los Angeles.
 Now he has a permanent address and a job driving a van. 
 His descent into homelessness was checked by the housing project where he has lived since August. Camerford, a restored five-bedroom house in West Hollywood, is one of a growing number of grass-roots projects around the nation that provide not only shelter but also psychiatric treatment -- an idea that is now being copied by the Federal Government.
Camerford, which Mr. McDonald shares with four other people, was jointly developed by the Community of Friends, a local nonprofit development organization, and Portals, a mental health agency. There is no estimate of the number of such projects nationwide, but a recent survey of 10 cities found more than 60 organizations providing housing enhanced by social services.
"In New York alone there are at least 20 projects in the pipeline," said Julie Sandorf, president of the organization that conducted the survey, the Corporation for Supportive Housing. The national organization, based in New York, provides financial and technical assistance for such endeavors.
 
Helping the Most Vulnerable
 The Federal Government plans to replicate this model in a new pilot program consisting of six housing projects for homeless people who suffer from severe mental illness. The projects -- two in New York City and one each in Boston, San Diego, Baltimore and Cincinnati -- will be financed by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"This collaborative project between the two departments shows that it is possible to be innovative in our approach to helping the most vulnerable of homeless people, those who are mentally ill," said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
This kind of collaboration is not only for the mentally ill. The Victims Services Agency, an advocacy group in New York, helped develop the first permanent housing for battered women in Brooklyn.
But Liz Rosenbaum, director of Urban Initiatives in Stamford, Conn., a technical consulting firm for developers of housing projects, says that for every successful project there are 10 to 20 that are never completed. "These are not easy deals to pull off," she said.
The main reason is financing. Because many sponsoring organizations are small nonprofit groups, most deals require four or five sources of funds.
 
Promoting Self-Sufficiency
 Under the 1987 Federal law that provides money for housing the homeless, funds are available only for temporary housing. Finally, few private nonprofit organizations have the staff and administrative capacity needed to develop housing enhanced by social services.
One of the challenges of this kind of housing is to foster self-sufficiency. Take the case of Mr. McDonald. He was supplied with his job driving a van for Portals, the mental health agency that helped develop the Camerford project, and he is given daily supervision for tasks like balancing his budget and food shopping. The goal is to help him function successfully on his own.
Developers of low-income housing and social services organizations say they need each other to achieve this goal of self-sufficiency. The service groups say that without housing they can do very little to stabilize the lives of their clients, and developers say that without social services their projects are likely to fail.
"It used to be that the problem was just being able to afford a place," said Jean Butzen, executive director of the Lakeside Single Resident Occupancy housing project in Chicago. "Now, with drug addiction and abuse so widespread, it is much more complicated. The amount of services needed is so large that we cannot fund them all."

HEADLINE: Sideshow to Soviet Votes: Gorbachev vs. Yeltsin

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 16

 BODY:
Soviet voters will take on the cacophonous political disarray of their country Sunday as they cast ballots on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's referendum on the nation's future.
And, in a significant aside, they will also decide whether to create a powerful new populist vehicle for his chief rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic. 
 The basic referendum question is whether to approve Mr. Gorbachev's general approach to protecting a "renewed" national union from the many separatist pressures sweeping the troubled nation, suffering not only from political confusion, but also from a staggering economy.
But in the referendum process, many of the union's separatist republics and localities have defied Mr. Gorbachev by adding ballot questions. In the most important of those, voters in Russia, the largest and most influential part of the nation, face a question they seem likely to approve: whether to inaugurate direct popular election of their republic's President.
 
New Level of Populist Power

To do so would create a fresh and probably secure opportunity for Russia's favorite politician, Mr. Yeltsin, to attain a new level of populist heartland power far beyond that enjoyed by Mr. Gorbachev, who chose last year to avoid the risks of popular election to the larger office of union Presidency. If he were eventually to be directly elected, Mr. Yeltsin's supporters would be able to say that their man was chosen President of Russia by voters in the largest republic in the nation, while Mr. Gorbachev was chosen President of the entire nation only by the national legislature dominated by his loyalists.
Final results are expected to be slow in emerging. But the chief outcome, according to some estimates, are that Mr. Gorbachev might win a somewhat half-hearted approval of his amorphous ballot question defending the simple idea of national unity, while Mr. Yeltsin gets a far more politically attractive mandate with which to maintain his basic criticism that Mr. Gorbachev should now resign because he has failed to uproot the endemic ills of Communism.
Thus, a voting day initially planned by Mr. Gorbachev as a simple means to tap some badly needed popular support for his flagging program of national renewal has grown instead into a juggernaut bristling with separatist ambitions.
Only four of the 15 republics -- Byelorussia, Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenia -- have agreed to hold the referendum precisely as Mr. Gorbachev wants.
 
Boycotts and Partial Boycotts

Six of the rest -- Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldavia, Georgia and Armenia -- have called for an outright boycott.
The other five -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, the Ukraine and Uzbekistan -- have qualified Mr. Gorbachev's wording or crafted additional questions to favor greater sovereignty for the republics.
To further blur the political Rorschach, an assortment of sovereignty-minded cities and regions have scheduled their own partial boycotts and non-boycotts, depending on their nationalist proclivities, and also have added a welter of additional local ballot questions.
Those range from the question of beginning popular election of the Mayor here in insurgent-minded Moscow, to the ballot option far to the east in the Kamchatka peninsula of whether that Pacific enclave, until recently a closed, top-secret military region, wants to reclose the area voluntarily because of the already noisome tide of Soviet travelers looking there for opportunities.
 
50% Turnout Needed

To be valid, at least 50 percent of the nation's voters, estimated at 192 million, must take part, with a majority of them, in turn, settling the issue. Mr. Yeltsin has roundly criticized Mr. Gorbachev's referendum for ignoring the practical detail of how greater democracy might be guaranteed in a renewed union.
But the Russian republic leader has declined to explicitly recommend a "No" vote, presumably so no rival can accuse him of trying to bring down the union. At the same time, his Russian ballot question for direct Presidential election is likely to attract extra voters and indirectly help Mr. Gorbachev toward the 50 percent turnout he needs for a valid referendum.
The national referendum question reads: "Do you consider it necessary to preserve the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics, in which human rights and the freedom of people of all nationalities will be fully guaranteed?"
This nation is so tense with political dispute as its economy and morale continue to sag that such key words as "Soviet" and "Socialist," not to mention "sovereign" set off furious debate. Contrary guidance abounds, with some democratic critics urging that both the main referendum's two options -- Yes and No -- be crossed out as a protest.
 
Nationalist Minorities
 The mathematics of the voting are intricate and confusing, with various spirited nationalist minorities voting as enclaves within some of the boycotting republics. Notably there are the hard-pressed Ossetians in Georgia and Gagauz in Moldavia, as well as the many voters of Russian stock in the Baltics, where nationalist governments already have held plebiscites establishing the majorities' wish for independence from the Kremlin.
Only a few years into being afforded semi-democratic options -- including openly contested local and regional elections -- after seven decades of pure Communist monolith, the voters will be grappling with their most confusing ballot thus far.
"Our 'Yes' guarantees that never again will the flame of war scorch our land that has already gone through trials enough," Mr. Gorbachev said in a TV appeal Friday.
Mr. Yeltsin and other critics, handicapped by being denied equal opportunity on the Kremlin-controlled television networks, say the simple question of merely maintaining a somehow "renewed" union is a distraction from the critical issue of how much power the Kremlin must surrender to the republics to finally make this a nation rooted in the consent of the governed.
 
Struggle of 2 Presidents

As sprawling as the ballot is across the land, the shadow struggle between the two Presidents, Mr. Yeltsin of Russia and Mr. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, remains the underlying attraction. Mr. Yeltsin, caught off base with an emotional call for a political "war" on the Kremlin, has been getting his share of abuse as an alleged political schemer rather than a true reformer.
In one recent telephone call-in interview, he found his usual popular majority of supporters, but also an acid-tongued doubter upbraiding Mr. Yeltsin thusly: "Boris Nikolaivich, when will you die a dog's death?"
"Oh, I still have plenty of things first to be done," he replied amiably, insisting the voters should consider the referendum important but not apocalyptic.

Uzbekistan will ask its people whether they want "to belong to a new Union."

HEADLINE: Higher Job Loss Forecast in New York Region

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Two new economic forecasts predict that the New York metropolitan region, already faltering, will lose tens of thousands of jobs this year, but disagree over the extent of the losses and the timing of a revival.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in an analysis released last week, said that the region might lose more than 70,000 jobs in 1991, with New York City accounting for 40,000, the New York suburbs 9,000 and northern New Jersey 24,000. 
 But Rosemary Scanlon, the authority's chief economist, said the agency expected the slump that began in 1989 to end toward the end of this year, assuming the national economy strengthens by midyear. Suburban counties would be the first to show signs of revival, she said, since they more closely parallel the national economy.
In a gloomier forecast released last month, Matthew P. Drennan, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, predicted that the region would lose 128,000 jobs this year, 71,000 in the city. Mr. Drennan said that he expected a turnaround in 1992, but that the New York and northern New Jersey region and the city would still end next year with losses of 28,000 and 26,000 jobs, respectively.
Both economists said that job growth, whenever it resumed, would be much slower than in the 1980's. Mr. Drennan projected that by 1995 the region would have 40,000 more jobs than in 1990, but that the city's total would decline by 51,000.
Mr. Drennan said he was surprised by the extent of the job losses in his forecast. He attributed the depth of the slump and the modest growth envisioned after it to a weak national economy, New York's slumping financial services industry, a long real-estate boom that left the city with a surplus of space and little need for new construction, slower growth in the health-care industry and in social services and a decline in local government employment.
Still, he said he expected a continual upgrading of employment opportunities in Manhattan, resulting in a higher percentage of jobs requiring more skills and paying higher salaries. The consolidation of the European economic community in 1992, he said, could help New York's service and financial industries.
"After 1992, the city's economy will be in good shape," Mr. Drennan said.
In the last year, the Port Authority said, the region lost 105,000 jobs, 44,500 in the city and 41,400 in northern New Jersey. Construction starts in the region dropped by 28 percent, compared with an 11 percent decline in the nation. Retail sales rose just 0.9 percent in the region and fell 1.4 percent in the city.
But the authority said increases in travel and international trade in goods and services could provide opportunities for growth in the 1990's.
 
Difficult to Predict
 The two forecasts were based on different analytic methods. Mr. Drennan used a computer model with 250 equations involving 53 industries. The Port Authority analyzed a range of forecasts for the national and international economies, then interpreted the effects locally using its own historical data.
Ms. Scanlon noted another difference: The Port Authority's forecast was completed after the end of the Persian Gulf war, while Mr. Drennan's was compiled earlier.The different conclusions are hardly surprising, given that New York's economy has proven difficult to predict. After the stock market plunge in 1987, for instance, Mr. Drennan projected a drop of 70,000 jobs in the city by end of 1988. The losses materialized, but not for years.
But Mr. Drennan said his model did enable him to predict the city's turnaround in the late 70's, an event missed by many forecasters.
"To some degree, economic science is very helpful," Ms. Scanlon said. But she added, "To get a turnaround is almost as much an art as a science."

HEADLINE: For Foes of Gulf War, Nation's Victory Is Bitter

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Despite the nation's euphoria over the allied victory in the Persian Gulf, the war's hard-core opponents in the United States -- the small group against military action of any kind -- remain implacable.
They say they worry that the outcome will embolden the United States to resort to further military force to solve other international problems and will also result in increased military spending by Congress at the expense of social programs. 
 The swiftness and completeness of the victory over Iraqi forces, at minimal losses to allied forces, prompted few if any second thoughts among the war's opponents, and they continue to argue that economic sanctions and diplomacy would eventually have accomplished the same goal, with no loss of life and no destruction, particularly the costly Iraqi losses.
"This is one victory I'm not celebrating," said Margaret Hummel, a community organizer from Underhill, Vt., who was so opposed to the war that she journeyed almost 600 miles to Washington to take part in a protest.
 
Different Kind of Defeat Seen
 "This was a severe defeat for the international community," she added. "I was appalled at the death of so many Iraqis. Sanctions and diplomacy could have eventually forced them to leave Kuwait. Now I fear that war will be more and more accepted as a way to solve our problems and that we'll spend more and more money on the military instead of on problems at home that are more pressing."
Ms. Hummel's comments were echoed in postwar interviews with other Americans who earlier had voiced opposition to the war.
"The truth is, I worry more now that the war is over than I did before it started," said Marian Solomon, a public health nurse from Ames, Iowa. "We came off as an impatient bully. We should mind our own business, especially at home. Where will we intervene next? How many more will die?"
Brenda Reed, a writer who was active in the antiwar movement in Oakland, Calif., says the war reinforced the "mistaken notion" by Americans that they can police the world.
 
Hopes for Alternatives
 "I didn't believe that before the war began and I still don't, absolutely," she said. "Now, more than ever, we have to turn to diplomacy and arms control and a sane energy policy to solve the problems in the Middle East."
Some leaders of the antiwar movement, which precipitously lost strength as the gulf conflict progressed, say they will continue to be involved in Middle East and military issues.
"We intend to stay organized so that we can focus attention on this country's neglected social problems," said Bonnie Garvin, a coordinator of the ad hoc National Campaign for Peace in the Middle East, based in New York. "There's outrage that we could find enough money for a war we didn't need to fight but not enough money for peace at home. The puffed-up chests that are now everywhere will deflate in time when people finally realize that we're still not any safer in this world."
The Rev. McKinley Young, an Atlanta pastor who helped black churches in the South form an antiwar movement during the gulf crisis, hopes to redirect their antiwar fervor.
"If this nation can demonstrate so much international war power," he said, "then it can also demonstrate peace power and the ability to solve national problems. A nation willing to depend upon thousands and thousands of black soldiers to help it fight its wars should be able to pass meaningful civil rights laws."
 
Inquiry on U.S. Tactics
 At least one antiwar group, the National Coalition to Stop United States Intervention in the Middle East, based in New York, not only still believes its opposition to the war was correct but is also investigating the military tactics used by the United States.
"We're looking into the possibility of war crimes by the U.S., whether civilians were targeted for bombing," said Brian Becker, a coalition official. "If so, the Iraqi attrocities pale in comparison. We may hold a tribunal, the same way that some antiwar groups did during Vietnam."
Before United States forces went into combat in mid-January, polls indicated that Americans were almost evenly divided over whether to commence the fighting or give sanctions and diplomacy more time to work. After the air attacks began on Jan. 17, support for sanctions and diplomacy dropped to about 15 percent, with most of the holdouts saying they either opposed wars in general or believed United States military involvement in the gulf was not in the national interest.
In interviews, many people who switched and came to approve military action said they had never ruled out that possibility, feeling that Iraq had to be pushed out of Kuwait.
 
Switched to Back Bush
 They explained that they worried about the possibility of another drawn out conflict like Vietnam and generally believed in giving sanctions and diplomacy time to work. But once the war started, they added, they viewed the timing question as moot and sided with President Bush, though some continued to worry about the possibility of becoming bogged down in another foreign conflict with many casualties.
"I was skeptical when it all started, especially because it was not clear to me what the Bush Administration wanted to accomplish, and why," said J. Michael Cassell, a public prosecutor in Charles Town, W.Va. "But I didn't really rule out an eventual military solution. I just knew it had to be quick, not another Vietnam. It was, thank God. Now the job is to preserve and strengthen the peace."
Like Mr. Cassell, Nellie Cutchins of Virginia Beach, also had initial doubts about United States involvement in the gulf.
"But once the war got started, I went along with it," said Ms. Cutchins, a cleaning woman. "I was just hoping right up to the end that there would be some other way to get Saddam Hussein out of there. You do what you have to do and pray for the best."
Like their constituents, many members of Congress initially opposed quick military action, voting in favor of giving sanctions and diplomacy more time to work. But once the war started, most backed the President.
Early polls indicate some lawmakers may suffer politically from their initial opposition. But few, if any, are backing away from their vote.
"I don't regret it," said Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who was an outspoken opponent of quick military intervention. "I voted my conscience. The flip side would be not to do what I believe in. Going to war is the last alternative."

HEADLINE: Channelview Journal;
Love, Ambition and the Price for a Child's Success

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHANNELVIEW, Tex., March 15

 BODY:
The azaleas and jasmine have bloomed across the Sterling Green subdivision here, and in two nearly identical houses around the corner from each other, two mothers have resumed their routines of car pools and trips to the mall.
They show no signs that they are the suspect and intended victim of a purported murder plot born of big envies and small ambitions. 
 The police say Wanda Webb Holloway, the organist at the Channelview Missionary Baptist Church, tried to arrange the murder of her neighbor, Verna Heath, in an effort to influence a cheerleading contest involving their daughters, Shanna Harper and Amber Heath.
Mrs. Holloway's objective, the police say, was to cause Amber so much emotional grief that she would not be a threat to Shanna in the rigorous competition for slots on next year's freshman cheerleading squad at Channelview High School.
Shanna, 13 years old, has always been an avid participant in cheerleading competitions and in many other contests intended to measure the mettle of Channelview's children. Over the years Amber has not only been her friend but also her chief rival, and Mrs. Holloway was determined, the police say, to bring that rivalry to a decisive conclusion.
A grand jury indicted Mrs. Holloway on Feb. 19 after it heard tape recordings of what the police say are conversations she had with an informer -- Mrs. Holloway's former brother-in-law, who notified the police after she asked him for help in finding a killer -- and an undercover detective posing as the killer for hire. She faces life in prison if convicted.
"She was cold, calculating and persistent about her intentions over an extended period of time," said Lieut. Charles Shaffer of the Harris County Organized Crime Task Force, which handled the investigation.
At first Mrs. Holloway discussed a contract for the killing of both Amber and her mother, Lieutenant Shaffer said, but Mrs. Holloway, who is divorced and unemployed, balked at the asking price of $7,500. The indictment charges that she offered a pair of diamond earrings as a down payment on the $2,500 cost of killing Mrs. Heath.
Mrs. Holloway has pleaded not guilty to the charges. She refuses to comment on the allegations, and her lawyers say they will not address the matter publicly except at her trial, which is scheduled for June in Houston, about 15 miles west of here.
The automotive life style of the suburbs assures that the two mothers, who live just a few dozen yards apart, can go for months without meeting, but Shanna and Amber, so similar in their talents and aspirations, are constantly thrown together. For example, Amber is president and Shanna is vice president of the student council at Alice Johnson Junior High School, where they are both eighth graders.
Just two days after the indictment was issued, both girls were inducted into the school's honor society. As so often before, the alphabet dictated that they stand beside each other and appear on stage one after another, Harper then Heath.
In Sterling Green, like many other subdivisions, tall wooden "privacy fences" seal in the sides and back of each family's little green domain, allowing the family to work out all manner of sins and crises in private, subject to gossip, perhaps, though not exposure. But Mrs. Holloway's notoriety has changed that.
Television trucks have begun invading the neighborhood. Children have gathered behind the journalists doing their on-camera reports, but the adults have mostly remained indoors.
"We are all guilty of standing back and watching what has been happening to her," said James M. Barker, the school principal, "because all of us -- anyone who is a parent -- can identify with her, at least to the extent that we all push our children to compete, that we all want our children to succeed."
Both Mrs. Holloway and Mrs. Heath, who was a high school baton twirling champion, demonstrated considerable zeal in promoting their daughters, Mr. Barker said, but Mrs. Holloway usually seemed ready to go an extra step.
Two years ago she tried unsuccessfully to get Amber disqualified from the cheerleading competition by invoking a technicality in the rules. Last year she showed up at school the day students were voting on cheerleader candidates and handed out pencils and rulers bearing the slogan "Shanna Harper Cheerleader." But as a result of her mother's action, Shanna was disqualified.
This year Mrs. Holloway hired professional coaches to prepare her daughter for the cheerleading competition, but in the end Shanna did not enter it. The deadline was the day after her mother was arrested.
Last week Mrs. Holloway's former husband, Tony Harper, won an agreement in the Houston Family Law Center that granted him an expanded custody of Shanna and her brother, 17-year-old Shane, in which they spend more time with him.
Paula Gavrel Asher, the lawyer who represented Mr. Harper, said, "The mother and daughter had developed a symbiotic relationship, an extreme form of emotional interdependence. It was like the child was in a cult."
Mrs. Holloway has been divorced for 11 years, and in that time virtually her only activities have been raising her children and going to church, which she did several times a week, the police and others familiar with her habits say.
"She was living her life through Shanna," Mrs. Asher said. "Shanna's achievements were all she had, and it had become an obsession."
Almost all murders for hire fall into one of two categories, Lieutenant Shaffer said.
"It's usually either money or love when someone goes out and solicits a murder," he said. "This case has its bizarre twists, but it basically fits the pattern.
"The motive here was love, a mother's love for a daughter."

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Wontons, Not Lapskaus

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The signs of social change and the transformation of a community are often subtle, sometimes brutal and occasionally bizarre.
Into this last category falls the former Atlantic restaurant, a popular diner that for decades catered to the many Norwegian-Americans of the Sunset Park and Bay Ridge sections of Brooklyn. Today, above the entrance on Eighth Avenue and 54th Street, a bright red-and-yellow sign proclaims "WeeKee's." And in one of New York's strangest ethnically hyphenated amalgams, the menu now describes the cuisine as "Chinese-Norwegian-American." 
 The Chinese and Norwegian waitresses alternate between serving dumplings and wonton soup and fish pudding and stekte middagspolser, or fried sausage. Bjorg Nilsen, who has worked at the restaurant for years, meekly and unconvincingly defended the Atlantic's transformation: "It's good that people can order different things now."
For years, the Atlantic was the hub of a stretch of Eighth Avenue between 45th and 60th Streets that was dotted with dozens of Norwegian bars, bakeries and restaurants. But in the 1980's, as Chinese and Arab immigrants moved in, Chinese restaurants and meat markets supplanted almost all the Norwegian businesses along a street that was popularly known as Lapskaus Boulevard, a reference to a meat-and-potato stew that was a staple of the Norwegian worker's diet.
 
Strangers in Their Own Haunts
 Olsen's, a bakery a few blocks down the avenue, still features apple crumb squares and fyrste kaker, an almond cake, as it has for the last half century. But Edith Reinertsen, a longtime customer, said: "It's sad. We feel out of place, like strangers here. There used to be two or three Norwegian bars and bakeries on each block. Now there are two or three Chinese restaurants on a block."
Another sign of the Norwegian-American community's decline is the flagging fortune of The Norway Times, which is marking its 100th anniversary this winter. There is little to celebrate in the paper's crowded five-room office at 81st Street and Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, and among its dwindling readership, there is sadness that the area's Norwegian community is on the verge of extinction.
"The situation of the paper mirrors that of the Norwegian community," said Toralv Ostvang, the paper's editor in chief, who was recruited from Oslo last fall to breathe life into the weekly paper by making it a national publication. "The population is steadily diminishing. I guess it will eventually assimilate and vanish, because many who still live here are older, their children have moved out of Brooklyn and there's no more Norwegian immigration."
A few Bay Ridge churches, like the 59th Street and Trinity Lutheran Churches, still conduct services in Norwegian. The annual Norwegian Constitution Day parade is still held every May 17, making its way along Fifth Avenue to Leif Ericson Park, where Miss Norway is crowned. A Scandinavian food shop is flourishing.
 
From 100 Papers, Only 2
 But The Times is the most prominent vestige of a community settled by tens of thousands of Norwegians and other Scandinavians who emigrated because of crop failures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although many immigrant farmers moved west to Minnesota and the Dakotas, others, especially sailors like those who founded the Norwegian Seamen's Church in 1878 near the docks of Red Hook, stayed in New York, eventually gravitating toward this southwestern Brooklyn neighborhood.
More than 100 Norwegian newspapers were started in America, Mr. Ostvang said, but today his paper and The Western Viking, based in Seattle, are the only survivors. Circulation for The Norway Times has fallen to about 5,000 now, from more than 20,000 in the 1940's, and that slide was only arrested somewhat by the decision of the paper's new Oslo-based owners in 1983 to switch the Norwegian-language publication to one in which 80 percent of its articles are in English. In small letters on the front page and masthead, the paper still identifies itself as Nordisk Tidende.
Mr. Ostvang, a 39-year-old journalist who relished the opportunity to spend a few years in America, has tried to build national circulation by hiring freelance writers, particularly in the Midwest, to cover everything from the re-election of George S. Mickelson, the Norwegian-American who is Governor of South Dakota, to the Uff Da gift shop in Red Wing, Minn. Circulation has increased by 10 percent since September, and half of the paper's readers are now outside New York, he said.
As The Times's only newsroom employee, Mr. Ostvang reports Norwegian political and economic news that he gathers from shortwave-radio broadcasts, facsimile messages from friends in Norway and news summaries from the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Articles appealing to the Norwegian business community in Manhattan, like one on the prospects for Norwegian companies to capitalize on the growing American demand for environmental-technology products, are increasingly played up, while tidbits of local news like the 80th anniversary celebration of Brooklyn's Sporting Club Gjoa are given shorter shrift.
Perhaps the most upbeat local story is the success of Fredericksen & Johannesen, a Scandinavian food emporium just a few blocks from The Times's office. Pungent smoked hams and legs of lamb hang from the ceiling, wheels of Nokkelost and Norvegia cheese and homemade sausages beckon at the deli counter and shelves are brimming with condiments, candies, caviar and ubiquitous cans of fishballs.
The store, which dates to the 1940's, was bought in 1986 by Stephen Postler, a young Norwegian-American investor and entrepreneur. To attract customers, he got a J. C. Penney catalogue franchise and aggressively developed a national Scandinavian food mail-order business.
In five years, he has increased sales by 150 percent, although he noted, with a mixture of pride and wistfulness, "Everyone who calls to order on our 800 number from around the country says they used to live in Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Baker Ready to Test Plans for Arab-Israeli Peace

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 16

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that his talks with Arab and Israeli leaders had encouraged him to begin presenting specific peace proposals next week to see if the leaders are as interested in reconciliation as they say.
In talks in Moscow on the future of Iraq, however, Mr. Baker left a meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday with the impression that Moscow and Washington have significant differences, reporters traveling with Mr. Baker were told. 
 American officials said the differences -- on when to lift the economic sanctions against Baghdad and what conditions should be imposed on Iraq for a formal cease-fire -- are likely to become apparent when the cease-fire is debated in the United Nations Security Council as early as next week.
Mr. Baker, speaking to reporters at the end of a 10-day trip to explore the possibilities for an Arab-Israeli settlement, said that he planned to speak by telephone with Middle Eastern leaders next week to elicit answers to specific questions he posed during his trip.
 
Telephone Diplomacy

"We will be following up primarily on the telephone," Mr. Baker said, as he flew from Moscow to Turkey for talks with President Turgut Ozal. "Now you are going to ask me who and when and where, and I can't get into that. In some case we will be asking them: What do you think about . . .? How does the following strike you? Suppose we were willing to get X to do Y. Would you be willing to do Z?"
On his trip, Mr. Baker spoke with foreign ministers or heads of state from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon and the Soviet Union. He also met with Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem.
Although he has not disclosed specific proposals he raised or the ideas the countries put to him, he has indicated that the first steps would be simultaneous confidence-building gestures.
For instance, Israel might be asked to reopen closed Palestinian universities in the occupied territories, or to halt the building of new settlements, or to commit itself to one day considering trading land for peace, in return for Palestinian and Arab gestures to end their state of belligerency and their boycott of Israel.
 
Foundation Is Gelling

"From the discussions we have had on this trip I have gotten the distinct impression and sense that the parties to the conflict really want true reconciliation and really want to make an active effort for peace," Mr. Baker said. "While we have to recognize that we have a long way to go, I am pleased that the foundation has gelled as quickly as it has."
But Mr. Baker added: "Now, whether that sense and impression turns out to be correct, we will have to wait and see when we test it. And that is what we are going to do in the weeks ahead -- test it -- by putting specific ideas and proposals to them to see whether or not old, rigid stereotypes can be broken, adjusted and compromised, because without that there won't be peace."
The basis for Mr. Baker's optimism was not clear. Throughout the visit he met alone with each official, with only his policy planning staff director, Dennis Ross, as his notetaker. Clearly, Arab and Israeli leaders have made positive and forthcoming comments in private, but whether they will defend them in public is another matter. Very little has leaked out from Mr. Baker's discussions.
When pressed for details, Mr. Baker said: "We have talked specifics with these countries to bounce our ideas off them and solicit their views and their expressions, their ideas. Now, the surest way for us to sabotage our own efforts is to get into too much of those specifics because what that will do is cause people to have to react, sometimes negatively and prematurely."
When discussing the results of his trip, Mr. Baker made a distinction between the reaction foreign leaders to his ideas for peace and to specific American ideas for a new security structure to stabilize the Persian Gulf. On the security framework, which will be based on an Arab peace-keeping force protecting Kuwait from Iraq, with American naval and air forces on aircraft carriers providing backup, Mr. Baker said he found "broad support."
On the issue of arms control in the Middle East and an Arab-Israeli settlement, Mr. Baker said his talks revealed a "consensus" that there is a "significant opportunity here."
While all the parties apparently agree that there is an "opportunity," it is not at all clear that they agree how to exploit it, and judging from the public declarations made by various leaders along the way, it will be a real challenge for Mr. Baker to find overlapping areas of agreement.
The Palestinians Mr. Baker spoke with from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, for instance, insisted on a state of their own and representation by the P.L.O.; the Arab states insisted that Israel agree to trade land for peace and Israeli officials said land for peace was a nonstarter.
 
Gulf Changes Create Catalyst
 "Nobody can impose peace, an Arab-Israeli peace, unless the parties themselves really want it," said Mr. Baker. "I think that what makes the situation a little bit different now is that there has been a significant change in the region and that has presented us with an opportunity to act as a catalyst. The Soviets were responsive and I think that there is a basis for us to continue to work together."
Regarding the Persian Gulf, Mr. Baker was asked whether the Bush Administration was playing a dangerous game in trying to unseat President Saddam Hussein -- a process that could inadvertently lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Government and the breakup of Iraq's loosely tied multi-ethnic society of 17 million.
"We want to see the territorial integrity of Iraq," said Mr. Baker. "We don't want to see a Lebanonization of Iraq. I am not prepared right now to give you a prediction with respect to exactly how that situation is going to turn out. But we don't want to see a power a vacuum develop there."
 
Gambling on a Leader

Without putting it in so many words, the Bush Administration is apparently gambling that external pressure on Iraq will stimulate a revolt that will topple President Hussein, without leading to the disintegration of the Iraqi state and the violation of its borders.
This is risky given the fact that Iraq's Shiites, who dominate the southern part of the country, and its Kurds, who dominate the northern mountains, have long chafed under the Sunni Muslims who dominate the ruling Baath Party and run things from Baghdad.
The Saudi leadership has apparently argued to the United States that the Iraqi Baathist regime, which has been in power since 1968, is more than a one-man dictatorship, but rather a substantial state machinery that can hold things together even without Saddam Hussein. Their apparent hope is that someone will emerge from this apparatus who is strong enough and cruel enough to hold Iraq together, but will be more willing to reconcile with its Arab neighbors.
Mr. Baker said he will be discussing with Turkey's President the situation in northwestern Iraq, where the region's predominantly Kurdish population is in open revolt against Mr. Hussein. Most of the people of eastern Turkey are also Kurds.
Six bombs exploded in Turkey shortly before Mr. Baker's arrival, but there were no casualties -- only property damage. The targets included an I.B.M. office and a General Dynamics office in Ankara and a Pepsi-Cola plant in Istanbul.

HEADLINE: $226.5 Million for New York Water Projects

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has awarded $226.5 million for New York State municipalities to upgrade water works.
The grant, announced today, is the largest in the agency's history. The Federal money, coupled with a state grant, will allow New York to use $788 million in bonds to finance cleanup projects, said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York. 
 "These funds are crucial to the efforts to improve rivers, lakes and estuaries in New York State," Mr. D'Amato said.
Mr. D'Amato said the money will subsidize interest rates on loans for at least 69 water and sewage treatment projects across the state. The money can be used for collection sewers, treatment plants, pump stations, sewer overflow work or sludge handling.
"These funds will go for loans to upgrade water and sewage treatment at interest rates as low as 5 percent," said Mr. D'Amato, a member of the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the environmental agency.

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT/Tournament Money: Root of Good or Evil?;
N.C.A.A. Distribution Plan Makes Rich Get Richer

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. DEALY Jr.; Francis X. Dealy Jr., is the author of "Win at Any Cost: The Sell Out of College Athletics," Birch Lane Press (1990).

 BODY:
For the next three weeks, one of America's most exciting sporting events, the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball tournament, will spawn office pools across the land and divert millions of people from their worries about the recession and dwindling job security.
Unfortunately, the tournament will also make people forget the increasingly hapless administration of the N.C.A.A. over the rest of college athletics. If this seems harsh, consider that little of the unprecedented amount of television money coming in will go toward solving the greatest problems. 
 For the genuine reform of college athletics to take place, we must acknowledge that money is the root of all evil in college sports, too, and that the N.C.A.A. exacerbates, rather than deters, this evil.
As part of a $1.1 billion, seven-year package, CBS will pay the N.C.A.A. $143 million to televise this year's tournament, an increase of $88.7 million from last year. But will this huge windfall be used to correct some of the worst offenses in college sports, including steroid use, alcohol abuse, academic fraud, recruiting bribes, campus rape and the exploitation of black athletes?
Sadly, the answer is no.
Shrewdly, the N.C.A.A. leadership precluded college presidents and the N.C.A.A.'s smaller schools from answering this question by diverting them with reform pretexts at its annual convention in Nashville in January.
While the convention at large reduced the number of football scholarships from 95 to 90 by 1996, the N.C.A.A. executive committee met behind closed doors to adopt a formula for distributing the CBS money. Not surprisingly, the formula, which is all but unfathomable, rewards those N.C.A.A. schools with the most tournament victories and the biggest athletic departments.
While big-time athletic departments stand to gain several million dollars annually from the money, needy big-time student athletes will not fare as well. A special fund will be established that will dispense, on average, a trifling $25 per athlete per year for those who qualify.
A mere $25,000 per Division I school will be spent on what the N.C.A.A. refers to as academic enhancement. Division II will receive $1 million to be divided among 209 institutions. Division III schools, 323 institutions, will receive nothing.
With all the new CBS money swamping the N.C.A.A. system, there are still only 18 N.C.A.A. investigators to monitor more than 800 N.C.A.A. schools and 200,000 athletes.
But when questioned, Judith Sweet, the new N.C.A.A. president, said: "With respect to enforcement, we want fair competition throughout the N.C.A.A. system. We feel we have that now. There's always room for improvement, of course, but I don't think more money is necessarily the answer."
To restore its credibility, the N.C.A.A. must divide the opposing functions of promotion and enforcement into two distinct and equal bodies. And the enforcement body must be headed by a commissioner with sweeping powers.
We deserve more from the N.C.A.A., despite the excellent basketball tournament it stages. College athletics reflect the character of our higher education system. When hooliganism tarnishes the World Cup, although regrettable, it reflects only the baseness of a few. But when an athletic scandal taints a university, it corrupts everyone's symbol of integrity.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
The 'New Order' Is a Tall Order for the U.S.

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
FOR all of the jubilant comparisons of the triumph in the Persian Gulf to the victory in World War II, Americans have begun to realize that this is not the same world an all-powerful United States faced half a century ago after the defeat of Germany and Japan. Today, threats of civil wars and regional wars survive not only in Iraq and throughout the Middle East, but in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and elsewhere; and the United States, less dominant than it was, confronts severe economic, financial and social problems of its own.
The United States is still in a recession which, Government and many private economists say, was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Unemployment, just 5.2 percent last June, has risen to 6.5 percent. Business failures were higher last year than in any year since 1983. The nation's total output, adjusted for inflation, fell 2 percent in the final quarter of 1990 and is likely to fall further in this quarter. But President Bush's economic advisers tell him that the economy will soon rebound, probably by the middle of this year. 
 Yet there are still reasons for concern about the hangover of the nation's underlying economic and financial problems stemming from the debt explosion of the 1980's, when public and private debt soared from $3.4 trillion to $10.6 trillion. Many experts feel that even if the economy turns upward shortly, the recovery will be sluggish. And some, like James J. O'Leary, a consulting economist at the United States Trust Company, insist that "there are powerful forces at play which threaten to make the recession more severe and longer than now expected by most forecasters."
Nevertheless, Mr. Bush, exultant in victory and scoring higher in the polls than any other President, seems unfazed by domestic problems. He remains committed to establishing "a new world order" in which, he has said, "nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice."
Congressional Democrats, most of whom opposed Mr. Bush on launching the ground war, are looking for an issue on which to contest his popular leadership. "The President seeks a new world order," said George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader. "We ask him to join us in putting our own house in order."
 
Not Strictly Partisan

But the contest between foreign and domestic goals is not a strictly partisan issue. The Republicans, including the President, know that domestic economic and social problems cannot be long buried, with the 1992 election ahead. And the Democrats know that the nation must continue to play a global leadership role in the interests of preserving peace and national security.
President Bush has been criticized by some for his idealistic talk of making the world safe not only for democracy but for justice and freedom and national self-determination. But his actual approach to specific situations has been pragmatic. Indeed, Mr. Bush's willingness to deal with Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader whom many believe to be as ruthless as Saddam Hussein, and with Deng Xiaoping after the Chinese leader used tanks to quell protests in Tiananmen Square, seemed to some to signal an unprincipled pragmatism.
But if the President faces a conflict between morality and pragmatism, so do all Americans. It is no simple task to define a new strategy in a world changed so fundamentally since the end of World War II, when the nation's aims were relatively simple: to rebuild the war-shattered countries and to contain Communism.
The success of that strategy helped produce some of the changes now facing the country. America's relative decline -- its share of total world output has fallen from one-third in 1950 to less than one-quarter today -- is due to the soaring economies of reconstructed Germany and Japan. With the end of the cold war, the Soviet Union's economic and political disintegration could revive the threat of violence in Europe.
But the United States is perhaps the first modern world leader to have waged a war with so little money of its own and such big budget deficits -- for 1991, it is likely to be $325 billion. This lack of financial assets makes "shared responsibility" not a catch phrase but a necessity for the United States, and not only in the Persian Gulf, where victory was financed largely with other people's money, but anywhere in the world where the United States assumes a leadership role.
The new American strategy cannot afford ideological purity, if it ever could. The outburst of hope that followed the liberation of Eastern Europe in 1989 and the belief that the Soviet Union was well on the way toward a market economy and liberal democracy has given way to anxiety over Mikhail S. Gorbachev's failure to resist powerful pressures from Kremlin conservatives. At the same time, there are long suppressed nationalist and ethnic conflicts everywhere from Albania and Yugoslavia to the Soviet Union itself.
The United States will have to choose among lesser evils in deciding to whom to give its support. A striking example of this came in Iraq after the war when Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim who had fought Iran, was seen in Washington, at least initially, as a lesser evil than Iraq's Iran-backed Shiite rebels. Without the lodestar of anti-Communism as a strategy guide, American policy-makers may be navigating with a wobbling compass.
In America's relations not only with the Communist world but with the rest of the world as well, this is a new age of uncertainty. The open international trading system that the United States led the way in creating after World War II may have been jeopardized by the recent breakdown in the so-called Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, though efforts are under way to get those talks back on track. Yet the threat to an open world economy has been heightened by the American recession and the possibility that it could spread. If protectionist pressures get out of control, they would inflict serious damage on the United States and the world economy -- as they did during the Great Depression, with frightful consequences culminating in World War II.
 
Continuing Leadership?
 Faced with so complex a range of economic, political and military problems, can the United States continue to play the role of leader of the "free world"? Or has its power to lead been seriously weakened by its relative economic decline or its own lack of fiscal discipline?
One body of literature, headed by Paul Kennedy's "Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," has advanced the thesis that America may indeed be in decline, like other powers before it, as a result of overstretching its resources in an effort to maintain its dominance. The United States has been spending between 5 percent and 6 percent of its G.N.P. on military programs, compared with only 1 percent for Japan.
 
The Right Stuff
 But another body of literature, led by Joseph S. Nye's "Born to Lead," contends that the United States still possesses economic, scientific, technological and even moral qualities that have resulted in its emergence as the only global power that remains crucial to the maintenance of world peace and prosperity.
However, few would deny that the United States now faces serious economic and social problems at home, in such areas as education, poverty, health, drugs, urban decay and crime, and lacks the resources to fulfill both its global and domestic responsibilities.
With the end of the cold war, there was hope that a "peace dividend" resulting from cuts in military spending would free more national resources to reduce the budget deficit and help meet the nation's economic and social needs. But the war with Iraq, among other things, has dimmed those expectations. So the nation still must tailor its global strategy to fit the measure of its purse.
What should its new strategy be? Many would like to inherit the mantle of master strategist that George Kennan once held with his cold war doctrine of the containment of Communism. One contender is Paul H. Nitze, the veteran arms control negotiator and foreign policy expert. Last November, in a speech at West Point, Mr. Nitze spelled out a new strategy that appears similar to the concepts on which President Bush has been acting. The Nitze strategy has these key elements:
* The "the accommodation and protection of diversity within a general framework of required order." This implies an acceptance of very different ideological groupings and a willingness to defend them against outside aggressors. A corollary, which Mr. Bush would doubtless accept, would be to protect the right of each group (the Baltic states? Israel? a Palestinian entity?) to self-determination.
* Significant reliance on supranational institutions, such as the United Nations, to deal with problems that transcend national or ethnic interests, such as drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental concerns.
* The United States, "with first-class military potential, inherent political, economic and cultural strengths, and no territorial or ideological ambitions, can play a unique role" in such a world "in bringing its latent power to the support of order and diversity among diffuse and varied groupings." That could well be what Mr. Bush might say he had done in the Persian Gulf.
But diversity is a more complex concept than containment. If used opportunistically, the doctrine of promoting diversity could mean an utter lack of principle and a tolerance of the intolerable. But this is not what the strategy is intended to imply. Rather, it aims at achieving peace through principles and actions supported by the world community. As Mr. Bush said at the war's end, "Enduring peace must be our mission."
That quest is in jeapardy, however, while the nation's economy, social structure, education system and infrastructure deteriorate. With the thrid world population explosion exacerbating poverty and instability, the achievement of a peaceful world order will depend more on economic development than force of arms.

How Do You Tell A Victorious War From a Just One?

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
MILITARY experts are already reviewing the Persian Gulf war, assessing battle plans, appraising the performance of weapons and personnel, drawing lessons for the next war. Somewhat more hesitantly, moralists are beginning to do the same. They are looking back at the debate about the war's morality, evaluating the kinds of arguments they made, wondering whether it all made any difference and, like the military, asking what the implications are for the future.
 There is a lot of "painful retrospecting" going on, said the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, the new general secretary of the National Council of Churches, which was outspoken in its opposition to the American military action. The 32-church umbrella group, which joins the principal liberal Protestant denominations with many Eastern Orthodox and traditionally black churches, is soon to issue a pastoral letter reflecting on the divergence between its own stance and the different direction taken by national policy and public opinion. The council will undoubtedly take some satisfaction in the fact that its objections helped force a moral debate. But it will also have to reconcile its early predictions of a war with no winners and a protracted Middle East disaster with the appearance of a swift American victory. 
 Also under the microscope is the "just war" doctrine, a centuries-old approach to judging the morality of warfare that almost came to dominate the debate about the Persian Gulf. The doctrine was pushed to the forefront last November when America's Roman Catholic bishops outlined the traditional criteria to be met before warfare could be justified, including the sparing of civilian targets from direct attacks. Without issuing any definitive judgment, the bishops strongly suggested that an attack to liberate Kuwait risked violating at least two principles: that war be strictly a last resort, initiated only when means like diplomacy and economic pressure have been exhausted, and that the likely good consequences outweigh the physical and spiritual damage.
 By February, however, President Bush himself was invoking just-war principles to defend his policy. And once the fighting began, the Catholic bishops were divided, with only a few in outright condemnation of the war. Some wondered how useful the just-war categories actually were if they didn't lead to a clear conclusion, while others said that the traditional tenets had proved inapplicable to modern warfare.
 Defenders of the approach were not fazed by the fact that different people used the teaching to reach different conclusions. "If the President makes the case that this meets just-war criteria and you reach a different conclusion, you can at least engage him on the same ground," said the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a professor of ethics at Georgetown University.
 Some argue that just-war teaching had an even stronger impact, permeating the military's thinking and its efforts to avoid bombing civilian targets. This was not because of the current debate, said the Rev. John P. Langan, another Georgetown professor of ethics, but because of the bishops' 1983 letter on nuclear arms, which has been closely studied by the military.
 "The early briefings on the air war sounded like the briefers had been reading just-war theory," said Michael Walzer, a political philospher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Mr. Walzer is now trying to incorporate the lessons of the Persian Gulf into a preface to the latest edition of his widely used book "Just and Unjust Wars."
 Unlike those who believe that just- war principles actually shaped military policy, Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton of Detroit, a veteran Catholic antiwar leader, called the military's gesture to the teaching "moral camouflage." By knocking out electrical power and communications and cutting off water supplies, he argued, the air assault ultimately eliminated any immunity for civilians.
Not all the moral debate centered on trying to dispassionately apportion the evils and goods that add up to a just war. Much of what church leaders wrote and said more closely resembled the political commentary appearing on editorial and op-ed pages, with perhaps a strong dash of moral exhortation: Modern war "produces only losers" or unleashes consequences "beyond comprehension" or involves "certain catastrophe." It was not clear whether the statements implied total pacifism or simply argued that war was always tragic.
Also common were what might be called collateral moral arguments about past American responsibility for arming Iraq or the United States' dependence on foreign oil or its failures to solve domestic problems.
Did these arguments mean that the United States was morally disqualified from using force overseas until it had rectified all its domestic and international failures? One critic of these critics wondered how they would have justified fighting Nazism in the 1940's, when even the armed forces were segregated. Many of the admonishments rested on such a profound distrust of American political leadership that a military and diplomatic success in the Persian Gulf would be considered as unwelcome as a failure.
More specific claims about the war's consequences also appeared, and some of them are now being re-examined. In December a group of church leaders organized by the National Council of Churches stated that war "will destroy everything" and "inflame the entire Middle East," a judgment that in hindsight Ms. Campbell acknowledges may have been extreme. At least one goal, the freeing of Kuwait, was achieved, she noted, and some council officials are saying that "maybe this has opened some doors to peace."
Those who looked at the gulf through the lenses of just-war criteria were generally more cautious in their early judgments, whether they concluded the impending war to be justified or not. But they, too, are reviewing both the accuracy of their assessments and the usefulness of their categories.
Comparisons of likely good and bad consequences played a key role in the arguments, but such estimations are notoriously hard to make. "We still don't know the full extent of either civilian or military casualties," Mr. Walzer said, "and there could be a cholera epidemic, plus the deaths to come in the civil war." Some engaged in the moral debate feel strongly that for purposes of future reflection Washington should make every effort to discover and release these figures.
Longer-range consequences for Middle East peace and well-being are even more difficult to assess. But some of the just-war theorists are willing to acknowledge that their forecasts were wrong. "I thought it wouldn't be possible to contain the war to Iraq and Kuwait," Father Hehir said. "And I thought that a major tank battle with large casualties on all sides was inevitable."
The emergence of "smart" weaponry has added another new ingredient to just-war theory. "For most of the 20th century, technology seems to have given us increasingly indiscriminate warfare," Father Hehir said. "We may be seeing a new generation of weapons in which at least some of them have reversed this pattern."
Mr. Walzer said that the war's outcome strongly rebutted the position recently voiced by some officials at both the Vatican and the World Council of Churches that modern weaponry means no war can be just. "Modern technology makes it more possible to exercise discrimination," he said, "and therefore we should be more critical of any non-discrimination." But Mr. Walzer, who believed that the military tried hard to hit only military targets, was still troubled by the definition of those targets to include so much of the infrastructure necessary to civilian life.
 A longstanding objection to just-war thinking is that it seems to promise a clarity that is at odds with the overwhelming uncertainties of international affairs and the terrible ambiguities of balancing human lives, aspirations and predictions about the future. What should be done when the case hangs on difficult questions over which reasonable people easily disagree, like the extent of Iraqi casualties or whether diplomatic efforts had been truly exhausted or whether prolonged sanctions were a realistic alternative to war?
Most Catholic bishops disappointed war opponents by withholding any definitive judgment and disappointed war supporters by continually warning about the need for restraint.
On the eve of the fighting, Mr. Walzer concluded that the war would be "just but dangerous." Father Langan called it "an imperfectly just war." Father Hehir called it "just but unwise."
Are such conclusions properly modest, or do they land policy makers and citizens in a twilight zone of morality that paralyzes conscientious decisions?

HEADLINE: Victory Lap;
Baker Finds Doors Open, Minds Sealed

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey

 BODY:
RIDING a wave of optimism in the wake of the American victory in the Persian Gulf war, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d took a grand tour of the Middle East and Moscow last week to see whether that victory could be translated into a breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict as well.
What he found, in many ways, was that the connection between events in the gulf and the future of the Arab-Israel dispute is uncertain. Everyone Mr. Baker spoke to was long on optimism, but short on specific promises. It was as if there had been an earthquake in Kuwait and Iraq that turned the world there upside down and prompted nearby governments to act in ways they had never before contemplated. But the Arabs and Israelis down the street got hit with only the aftershocks. It has rattled their diplomatic teacups and unnerved some people, but a survey of the main Arab-Israeli players with whom Mr. Baker spoke last week shows that -- for now -- their world and their attitudes remain mostly intact. Here is a look at what Mr. Baker found.
 
 
ISRAEL
 Israel Radio, describing the political scene at home the other day, referred to the veteran hard-liner Ariel Sharon -- then went to say, "and then to the right of him . . ." When Mr. Sharon no longer defines the right edge of Israeli politics, it means there are some awfully angry Israelis. Moshe Arad, Israel's former Ambassador to Washington who returned home five months ago, said he has found that everyone used the gulf war to prove what they already believed. "Everything is the same only the feelings of people are cruder, sharper, more raw," he said. The No. 1 pop tune on Israel Radio during the war was a Hebrew rap song, "Saddam You're Just an Idiot," with the main refrain being "Saddam, Saddam, these are Americans not Iranians -- boom, boom, boom." 
 The Israeli left argues that the gulf war and the recent wave of stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians only proves definitively that Israel must find a solution both with the surrounding Arab states and the local Palestinians. The Israeli right argues that the same violent incidents only prove that the Palestinians are barbarians and that peace will only come when aggressive, hostile Arab states reconcile their differences with each other and Israel. Although Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir offered Mr. Baker some happy talk about the need to move toward peace, his aides say privately that now is not the time to take any chances, and with once-powerful Iraq out of the way, they don't have to. This is a recurring pattern in Middle East politics: When I am weak, how can I compromise? When I am strong, why should I compromise?
The Israeli silent majority wavers between the extremes, mistrusting the Palestinians more than ever and wanting to find a solution more than ever. Under such conditions, some believe, American diplomacy might succeed with Israel only if it begins with a new vocabulary. Most Israelis today think 242-338 is a telephone number, not the shorthand for two United Nations resolutions that touch their lives and that call on Israel to trade occupied territories for security and recognition from its Arab neighbors.
"There is a hunger here to find a way out," said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi. "But when Baker asks the Israelis to consider trading 'land for peace,' most Israelis hear 'land for Utopia' and they instinctively demur. The endemic instability in this region makes the very notion of peace sound naive and not very real. The Americans need a new vocabulary, because the right wing will always shoot them down when they claim that they are going to broker 'peace.' They must approach the Israelis instead by talking about trading land for alternative security arrangements, out of which peace might one day grow."
 
 
SAUDI ARABIA
 When an American diplomat in Saudi Arabia asked a devout Muslim what he thought about predominantly Christian troops from the West defending his country, he answered: "As the Koran teaches, a starving man is allowed to eat pork," which is normally forbidden under Islamic law. The story is a useful reminder that before the gulf war started King Fahd had to seek the approval of his clerics, who told him that under the extreme circumstances, with the nation's survival at stake, it was O.K. to summon non-Muslim troops for protection.
No such extreme circumstances impel the Saudis to recognize Israel. At home, King Fahd is called the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, references to Mecca and Medina. For the moment his top priorities are insuring that Saddam Hussein is dead and that his own status as Muslim leader is restored. Saudi officials are already talking about an extensive new mosque-building program. Mr. Baker said that he heard the stirrings of "new thinking" from the Saudis about Israel, but for it to flower into anything the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques will require far-reaching gestures by Israel to trade away land and give the Palestinians something to call their own.
 
 
SYRIA
 When Mr. Baker strolled through the Damascus souk he was greeted with a smattering of cheers and by a throng of schoolchildren chanting "Congratulations to Baker and America." Not the usual reception for an American Secretary of State. But if there is one thing the Syrians respect and understand it is raw power, and in the wake of the gulf war Mr. Baker embodied that. What the Syrians seem to want most out of the gulf war is not a new relationship with Israel, but a new relationship with America. President Hafez al-Assad knows that the Soviet Union can no longer protect him or help Syria flourish economically.
But Israel is another matter. One Western diplomat recalled that on the first day of the American air war against Iraq, the Syrians who worked for him were morose and depressed. Many had relatives in Baghdad, others identified with Mr. Hussein. The next day, when the Iraqis began firing Scud missiles at Israel, the diplomat reported that his Syrian employees were suddenly upbeat and smiling. No wonder that President Assad was so concerned about pro-Iraqi sentiments that he jammed the pro-Baghdad Jordanian Television and barely allowed his own press to even mention Syrian troops fighting alongside the Americans. If Mr. Assad is that sensitive about taking part in a winning war with Americans in the gulf, how far-reaching is he going to be toward Israel?
 
 
PALESTINIANS
 The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, has had his ups and downs over the years, but his enthusiastic support for Saddam Hussein in the gulf war is a legacy that he will not easily overcome. Put simply, it has severely damaged the legal-moral basis of the Palestinian cause, which is something Palestinians have always been careful to preserve. How could Mr. Arafat be in favor of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, and be against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip?
Not even the most left of Israeli leftists today is prepared to argue to his fellow citizens that Mr. Arafat can be trusted. Every Arab leader Mr. Baker talked to told him that Mr. Arafat was debased currency and Washington should ignore him. It was ironic to hear President Francois Mitterrand of France urging President Bush to deal with the P.L.O., when Arab commentators were ridiculing Mr. Arafat. "You are a corrupt war criminal, you clown," Moussa Sabry wrote of Mr. Arafat in the Egyptian paper Al-Akhbar. "You betrayed those who fed you and meanly stabbed those who helped you. It's time for the picture of your bewildered-looking, idiotic face to disappear."
But the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are not going to dump Mr. Palestine simply because he has become Mr. Unpopular, and they told that to Mr. Baker. They might demand that Mr. Arafat let them take the lead in negotiating the Palestinians' fate -- but they will only do that if the Israelis offer them something worth negotiating over. The Israelis want Mr. Arafat out of the way in the hope that the Palestinians in the occupied territories will accept a lesser deal. But they will only get rid of Mr. Arafat if they prove to Palestinians from the territories that if they represent themselves they will get a better deal.
 
 
 IRAQ
 Iraq is a big Lebanon, a multi-ethnic melting pot of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, where nothing ever quite melted. The same iron fist that Saddam Hussein used to smash Kuwait he used to hold his centrifugal republic together. If the United States hopes to withdraw its troops from the gulf, and preserve all of its military gains from the war, it is essential that Mr. Hussein, or, preferably, a different but equally strong figure, is at the helm in Baghdad. Otherwise, the United States and its allies may find themselves with no one to turn over their chunk of Iraq to.
On the day that Mr. Baker left Israel, Benjamin Zeev Begin, a member of the Israeli Parliament and the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, wrote: "Those who call for a 'new order' in the Middle East treat this troubled region very generously, as if it ever had an 'old order.' " Actually, the Middle East did have an old order. It was a fragile, rickety equilibrium built, as it always has been, on the pillars of Egypt and Iraq. This equilibrium was based not on peace and reconciliation between neighbors but on controlled enmity and the balance of power. That ever-precarious equilibrium was sent totally out of kilter by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Western counterattack.
If Mr. Bush can simply restore this "old order," and still get all the American troops home, it will be no small achievement.

HEADLINE: The World;
The View From Inside A Strained Relationship

 BODY:
ON questions like trade, foreign investment, and responsibilities for world security, feelings between the United States and Japan seem to go from bad to worse. Yukio Okamoto, who resigned from the Foreign Ministry recently, spent most of his 23 years as a diplomat massaging the often-troubled Japan-United States relationship. As director of the First North American Division, he was the chief line officer for Japan's fitful response to American requests for aid in the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Okamoto is now president of Okamoto & Associates, a consulting firm that advises Japanese and American businesses on dealings in each other's countries. He was interviewed by Steven R. Weisman, chief of the Tokyo bureau of The New York Times. Following are excerpts from that interview.
Question. Despite Japan's contributions on the gulf, Americans still seem disappointed with its reaction. Are their opinions justified? 
 Answer. Only a portion. Unfortunately, there is a pent-up frustration in the minds of Americans over almost 10 years of economic friction. When we announced the $4 billion package [for the war] in September, the American Congress interpreted this as the result of Japan being pushed into the corner by a Congressional resolution to withdraw American forces from Japan. Obviously, you cannot squeeze out $4 billion within two or three days after the adoption of a resolution in the American Congress. It was in the pipeline for a long time. It's true, the Japanese bureaucracy has been inflexible in interpreting some laws and regulations, and we are not seen to be really accommodating to the changing realities. But under a normal bilateral relationship, these things would not blow into a big criticism.
Q. Didn't American disappointment arise partly because Japan did not participate in a more direct way?
A. Many people thought that Japan should have sent, for instance, a medical corps or transport planes, but these were denied by the people's pacifism.
Q. Was it just pacifism that prevented Japan from moving to this new kind of role?
A. The Japanese Constitution says in its preamble, "We have determined to preserve our security and existence trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples in the world. In schools throughout Japan, teachers were saying: "Do you know there's a war going on in the gulf? Who do you think is bad?" "Well, both are bad because both are resorting to force." [They were teaching this] without infusing the fundamental value of freedom or democracy, and how these concepts are important to be fought over. That's one flaw of pacifism.
Secondly, I think that conservatism in Japan failed to get into the minds of people an intellectual and moral framework. So when we were asked to put our life at stake to defend freedom, this was a totally different concept. People did feel that we had to do something. But invariably they were arguing that Japan should contribute by peaceful means.
Q. A lot of people say that Japan's political leadership was weak.
A. I would like to eschew the word "weak." But it was certainly not a strong leadership.
 
Sharing the Blame
 Q. I take it you feel that the United States . . .
A. . . . has to be blamed as well. I was shocked to see the discussions in the Senate. These senators were treating Japan like a malfunctioning cash dispenser. Look at the record of our economic negotiations starting from textile in the late 1960's -- machine tools, color TV, automobiles, steel, farm products, citrus, wood products, satellites, supercomputers, semiconductors. Just name one trade dispute that was not solved. The only weak point of Japan institutionally is how we can cooperate vis-a-vis an international security crisis.
Q. So why have tensions increased?
A. The relationship between any two countries has ups and downs, with frustrating episodes as well as heart-warming episodes. In the present relationship, that latter element is gone. I mean, Japan donates over $10 million to the earthquake in San Francisco. No word is reported. Japan is simply looked at in a monotone color of being a tough, selfish, unyielding, unscrupulous, inscrutable country.
Q. Are Japanese-U.S. relations in a crisis?
A. It's a crisis in perceptions, not a crisis in reality. Trade figures are improving. More Japanese people are awake to the need of Japan contributing more to the common cause of Western democracies. But there's a pent-up frustration on the part of Japanese as well. To people who value honor, to be called tough, selfish, almost liars, this has begun to erode people's warm feeling toward the United States. Japanese people say, hey, wait a minute, Japan is dependent completely on the United States for our security. Why shouldn't Japan be more free to strengthen our military forces, which is the only way to be again assertive to the United States?
Q. Is a shift to the right a serious danger in Japan?
A. Yes, I am concerned. Comic magazines containing rightist stories are sold out the first morning they appear. The Japanese are beginning to realize that perhaps we have to introduce new thinking into the heretofore held pacifism. But if you overdo it, it will be very easy to swing to the other side.
Q. How do you see the future?
A. I thought the relationship was bottoming out last summer, and then this crisis in the gulf hit us. Now it depends on the economic condition in the U.S. and on Japanese political maturity. Basically I am optimistic because of the realities, the complementariness of our economic structures, the geopolitical relationship and the importance of Japan for American security strategy. All these realities can only mean that the U.S. and Japan will have to stick together, whether we like it or not.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. and Iraq to Meet on Request by Baghdad to Shift Its Warplanes

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
American and Iraqi commanders will meet in the Iraqi desert within two days to discuss an Iraqi request to move warplanes around the country, an action that the Pentagon considers a violation of the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
Iraq flew some airplanes to different locations last week, and Baghdad has sent word to the American military command that it wants to do so again, Administration officials said. In response, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the senior American commander, warned that under the terms of the cease-fire, Iraq was prohibited from doing so without allied permission, and that the planes risked being shot down.
 
Issue of Cease-Fire
 Iraq's ability to put any of its aircraft in the skies has vexed efforts to reach a permanent cease-fire and clear end to the war. It underscores the delicate problem that the Administration faces in trying to remain firm with Baghdad cease-fire terms while avoiding new combat.
 
 President Bush, meeting in Bermuda today with Prime Minister John Mojor of Britain, said he was determined to insure that Iraq abide by the terms of the cease-fire, reached in a March 3 meeting in a tent in Safwan in southern Iraq.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Major agreed on conditions that would be proposed for a new Unitied Nations resolution to be presented as early as next week to end the war. The conditions include the destruction of Iraq's chemical weapons and a timetable for resuming Iraq's oil shipments, profits from which would be used to pay reparations to Kuwait.
The request for the desert meeting follows several days in which the United States, which controls 15 percent of Iraqi territory, has warned Baghdad against offensive action.
 
Several U.S. Warnings
 The United States told Iraq this week that its use of helicopters against Iraqi rebels violated the ban on "missile attacks on flights of combat aircraft" spelled out in the United Nations resolution voted after the war. On Friday, the United States said it had moved its forces back to their forward-most positions in occupied Iraq to signal to the Iraqis that they cannot move their forces, including aircraft, as they choose.
Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said today that the Iraqis were interested in "repositioning" their warplanes. "That may well be true but is nonetheless a violation of the cease-fire," he said. In Saudi Arabia, General Schwarzkopf said today that senior military commanders would meet with Iraqi commanders in a day or two to hear their reasons for wanting to regroup their air force. He did not identify the commanders.
"They will state their reason and we will listen to their request and respond appropriately," Mr. Williamssaid. "We don't wish to be arbitrary about this but we have many forces in the area and the issue of aircraft flying around raises a serious security consideration."
In complaining about Iraq's lack of compliance with the cease-fire terms, Mr. Bush said: "Certain arrangements were made and certain ground rules spelled out. The movement of aircraft, for example, and so they should not violate certain things."
Mr. Bush continued: "Having said that, none of us want to move forces into Baghdad. Frankly, we don't want to have any more fighting. But they know what the ground rules are and they should abide by those rules."
 
'Rhetorical Approach'
 A senior White House official said the Administration was striving to be firm with Baghdad as the best way of avoiding any further military conflict.
"Basically, it's a rhetorical approach at this point," the official said. 'We want to avoid military action if we can and the idea is to keep up the warnings since the Iraqis have been basically going along with what we've been telling them to do and not to do."
The official said that the President was interested in dampening any speculation that the United States is on the verge of resuming military action.
Asked about the possibility of new military action, Mr. Bush said, "We're not ruling anything in or out, but we're making clear, as General Schwarzkopf did I think just yesterday, that they must abide by agreements made."
Mr. Bush also said there were "many provisions in the future that we expect Iraq will comply with." It was in that spirit that Mr. Bush and Mr. Major agreed to propose what they called tough conditions that Iraq must fulfill before the war can be concluded.
In addition to calling for destruction of chemical weapons and allowing for resumption of Iraqi oil shipments, three other conditions are envisioned, officials said: the formal recognition by Baghdad of Kuwait's prewar borders, the setting of a timetable for lifting the economic embargo against Iraq for all but military items and release of all Kuwaiti detainees now held by Iraq.
In addition, the resolution might also deal with what kind of United Nations peacekeeping force should remain in the region. Officials said the resolution would take up the questions of who would make up the force, how long they might be stationed there and on what side of the border or whether there should be a demilitarized zone near the border. Mr. Bush said the force could be international or an Arab force.
Mr. Major emphasized his interest in destroying all of Iraq's chemical arms.
"I certainly would like to see the supervised destruction of their chemical weapons," he said. "I think that is extremely important for future security in the Middle East."
The movement of Iraqi aircraft first became an issue after the allied forces tentatively agreed to allow Baghdad to move helicopters to transport troops in the first few days after the truce.
Administration officials were angered when President Saddam Hussein began using helicopter gunships to attack Kurdish and Shiite rebels. On Wednesday while he was in Ottawa, President Bush sternly warned Hussein that he was violating the cease-fire and that would prevent any permanent end to the war. Earlier the Administration had signalled Iraq it would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against anti-Government rebels.
 
Bush's Ottowa Warning
 After Mr. Bush's warning from Ottawa, American forces moved some units forward in Iraq, in what was taken as a message to Mr. Hussein not to use helicopter gunships aginst the rebel forces. The sudden decision to send combat troops, including M1-A1 tank units, demonstrated that the United States was prepared to go on the offensive if necessary, officials said.
 Administration officials said that after General Schwarzkopf's response to Iraq about moving planes, Iraqi field commanders ordered their pilots to stay put pending the desert meeting.
Pentagon officials said the issue of whether Iraq may reposition its planes does not involve any of the aircraft flown to Iran during the war.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Policy Monotheism

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Americans transform every success and every failure in foreign affairs into a policy doctrine and a political cudgel. We refuse to rest until we possess one lens through which to view the world and one answer for all challenges. We are forever brushing off small but important lessons in the quest for great and single truths.
 Ours is a short and tumultuous history of taking largely unique events -- the fall of Eastern Europe and China to Communism, the Korean War, the Cuban missile crisis and Vietnam -- and elevating their purported lessons into policy dogmas, be they Truman Doctrines, Kennedy Corollaries or Vietnam Syndromes. 
 Once enshrined, high priests wield these theologies like clubs to destroy their political adversaries. But at some point, they are blinded by their own convictions and commit blunders, which, in turn, give rise to new dogmas and new blunders.
 We are the monotheists of world politics. Yet we keep abandoning one god for another with unholy frequency.
 Once again, the nation seems poised to bury what the ascendant high priests call the Vietnam Syndrome in order to establish yet another new world order, or what may come to be known as the Iraq Pandemic.
 The priests of this new order start, appropriately, by settling old historical scores. They charge that the war against Iraq shows that the U.S. could have won in Vietnam if the military had not been handcuffed by timorous civilians. But just as Vietnam did not prove success to be impossible or too costly in Iraq, Iraq does not prove that victory was achievable in Vietnam.
 The U.S. could have obliterated North Vietnamese cities and bombed the dikes and flooded the rice fields. (We did not do such things in Iraq either.) We could have fought the ground war in South Vietnam more relentlessly and spread the fighting into Communist sanctuaries in Cambodia and Laos much sooner.
 Maybe Hanoi would have surrendered then; maybe not. Unlike the conventional victory over Iraq, Vietnam was essentially a guerrilla war, a continuation of a nationalist anti-colonialist struggle and a civil war. Even Hanoi's military defeat would not have ended such a war once and for all.
 The new-order priests also inveigh against liberal Democrats, who, they say, are traumatized by Vietnam, do not fathom the realities of power and have an almost absolute aversion to the use of force. Unfortunately, this is true of a number of Democrats.
 But most Democrats do not fit this caricature and draw quite sensible lessons from Vietnam. They see in that experience the need to make distinctions between countries, to define U.S. vital interests more rigorously, and to understand the imperviousness of most problems to military solutions and the limits of American power.
 There is a healthy skepticism here, not dogma. Democrats with this outlook reluctantly went along with President Bush's invasion of Panama, but are not surprised to find that General Noriega's successors also condone drug-running and money laundering.
 In thinking about the Persian Gulf, many such Democrats took their skepticism too far. They focused far too much on the problems war would not solve and not at all on the one problem -- Saddam Hussein's military power -- it would eradicate. Iraq thus holds a critical lesson for moderate Democrats.
 But the new-order priests shrug off such specific lessons about distinctions. They want Democratic scalps. They also want to squash the healthy skepticism derived from Vietnam and replace it whole cloth.
 Mr. Bush pushes his new world order. With more collective security, billions for economic development, more democracy, more conventional arms for the good guys and no terror weapons for export, it has all the makings of a Bush Doctrine. Charles Krauthammer of The New Republic goes further and calls for a policy of "robust and difficult interventionism."
 Their schemes contain good ideas. But the problem is they lead down the path to new dogma, to the single answer of the U.S. becoming the world's policeman under the umbrella of collective security. Both schemes would result in a vast over-extension of American interests and power. Both seek to make the Iraq experience the rule rather than the exception.
 America's strength lies in its regenerative powers, its pragmatism and its common sense. The nation does not need a new truth; it needs many -- with the wisdom and courage to choose among them.

HEADLINE: New Domestic Supply Of Oil Is Needed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Conserve Oil -- and Wilderness" (editorial, Feb. 19) is persuasive only because it ignores two critical facts in the energy debate: 
 * Every major oil field in the United States is in decline. Even production at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest of all, is dropping at a rate of 10 percent a year. Conservation can slow the use of fossil fuels, but not eliminate it. New sources of oil aren't needed so we can burn more; they are needed to maintain our economy while we look for alternatives.
Some would argue we can just buy what we need on the world market, but that's not necessarily true -- which brings us to the second point:
* We already import about half our energy supply, which is responsible for about half our enormous trade deficit. And, while energy use in the United States is declining, third-world use is growing rapidly. In 1973, developing countries accounted for only 17 percent of world commercial energy consumption. Today, they account for 23 percent, and their share is expected to rise to 40 percent by 2020. Because oil is non-renewable, with a universally high value, our needs will conflict with those of other nations.
A rational energy policy will protect our interests in the long term. That means we need stable oil supplies while we find alternatives, and that means new domestic production to help replace our losses. Conservation is crucial, but only part of the answer.

HEADLINE: Learning From the Religions of Others

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report on the Transfiguration parochial school in New York City's Chinatown, with 95 percent Chinese students, 80 percent of them Buddhists (news article, Feb. 16). 
 What Transfiguration does, despite possible impressions to the contrary, is to combine the cross and the dragon, not Christ and Buddha. The encouragement of Chinese culture is not synonymous with the elevation of the Buddhist faith of these pupils to parity in the school's curriculum with Roman Catholic instruction.
Indeed, the wonderfully tolerant, syncretic and inclusive sentiments of the largely working-class Buddhist parents that you record ("I am a Buddhist," says one, "and when I open my son's religion books, I see the same human values I believe in") puts into embarrassing perspective the school's insistence that "All children, regardless of their faith, attend all Masses and religious ceremonies" -- meaning Catholic ceremonies.
There are other, better models for the spirit of toleration. In St. Xavier's, the splendid Catholic mission school that I attended in Bombay in the 1950's, the Catholics and other Christians had Bible classes; the rest of us were instructed in morals, altogether free from Christianity's theology and rituals. The good deed of providing an excellent education was its own reward, here and in heaven. Perhaps the hope was that the very example of a religion that would evenhandedly dispense benefits to all, while denying itself the advantage of insidious indoctrination, would attract others to its fold.
This is the wiser, and the more appropriate, path for our increasingly multireligious society. Respect for other religions, even while one is wedded to one's own, has to be genuine and strong; it is a sine qua non for harmony and pluralism, values that make our society less fractious.
We should therefore pray for the day when Transfiguration makes the transition from the dragon to the Buddha.

MODELS OF MY LIFE
By Herbert A. Simon.
Illustrated. 415 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $26.95. 
 As much as any one person, Herbert A. Simon has shaped the intellectual agenda of the human and social sciences in the second half of the 20th century. A brilliant polymath, Mr. Simon is a Nobel laureate in economics, a pioneer in political science, psychology and management and a founding father of artificial intelligence, the enterprise of trying to build machines that think. Now he has turned to autobiography and thus provides a window onto the subjective side of scientific achievement.
"Models of My Life," one of the books in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation series, offers dramatic examples of science as the product of the whole scientist, of the fit among personality, scientific problems and strategies for their solution. As the work comes out of the life, so the life is shaped by the work. And while readers may come to this book thinking that artificial intelligence is an impersonal product of technological progress, they will come away seeing that it is a deeply personal enterprise -- an expression of the esthetic of the people who work in it and, more than that, a science of self-reflection, a way of thinking about one's own thought.
Herbert Simon was born into a middle-class German immigrant family in Milwaukee in 1916. From his earliest years, and notably from the days of his first algebra course in high school, he had a strong love of order. He was, for instance, "troubled by the fact that some quadratic equations had two solutions, some had one, and some none." Referring to his young self in the third person as "the boy," Mr. Simon comments that the intensity of the boy's feelings "seemed to reveal something of a Platonist within him, a desire to find pattern, and preferably simple pattern, in the world around him." He recalls that during his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago, in the early 1930's, a period of intense intellectual and political ferment, he argued philosophy with friends who were loyal to an unruly "Aristotelian-Thomist-Catholic-Trotskyism." But his own tastes led him to less esoteric intellectual seas. A political scientist by training, Mr. Simon studied decision making within organizations and used his findings to lay the foundation for a critique of neoclassical economic theory.
Mr. Simon developed a vision of rationalism adapted to 20th-century sensibilities. Neoclassical theory, he believed, had turned such abstract goals as what economists call "optimization" and "maximization" into fundamental laws of human behavior, and it had foundered, as he thought any inquiry into ultimate meaning would, on a preoccupation with absolutes. In his view, people who behave rationally are not optimizing anything at all; they are simply making decisions based on what their environment tells them they can and cannot do. People don't strive for the best, he maintained, they look for what is possible within the bounds of their given situation. Instead of satisfying desires, said Mr. Simon, human beings "satisfice," they search "for 'good enough' actions rather than optimal ones."
Mr. Simon tells us that this idea of "bounded rationality" has been his "lodestar for nearly fifty years." As he sees it, people torment themselves when they ask too-big questions about their ultimate desires. He believes the proper procedure is to determine the boundaries in which rationality can most constructively operate and then to keep one's sights within them. Such theoretical beliefs allow Mr. Simon to have a relatively untroubled eye. "Searching for the best can only dissipate scarce cognitive resources," he writes. Borrowing Voltaire's aphorism, he says that in science as in life, "the best is enemy of the good."
In the mid-1950's, Mr. Simon married his vision of human behavior to the possibilities offered by computer technology. The computer gave powerful expression to Mr. Simon's already-formed intellectual esthetic. His idea that humans solve problems under constraint was easily adapted to the task of programming a computer to solve problems using heuristic search -- a procedure that doesn't involve absolute rules but rules of thumb based on the knowledge of specific and bounded environments. And his idea that observation must be the foundation for abstraction led him to create a research strategy for artificial intelligence that he called "thinking aloud."
In "thinking aloud," Mr. Simon and his colleagues asked people to express their thoughts as they solved logical problems, and then they analyzed the transcripts of these sessions. The protocols of human beings playing games and solving puzzles were used to evaluate computer programs made to follow in human footsteps. Whereas some artificial intelligence researchers were content to leave aside the larger question of whether machines that perform intelligent tasks are doing them in the way people might, Mr. Simon took a very different tack. His artificial intelligence was psychology, not engineering. From the first, he says, "we were interested in simulating human problem solving, and not simply in demonstrating how computers could solve hard problems." His school of artificial intelligence was committed to the view that human intelligence is the manipulation of symbols and the implementation of rules. "For my money," he writes, "to show that something whose behavior looks very complex and erratic is really built from the combinatorics of very simple components is beautiful, not demeaning."
What Mr. Simon saw as self-evident, others found controversial. His critics questioned whether he had really demonstrated that people solve problems the way his programs did, and challenged the premise that a rule-based theory could explain the complexity of human behavior. In artificial intelligence, technical and philosophical arguments commingle. So, in addition to contributing to artificial intelligence as a scientific discipline, Mr. Simon became a chief spokesman for a view of the field as a revolutionary and salutary break with past limitations in philosophy and psychology. In Mr. Simon's opinion, the computer offered the 20th century a solution to the mind-body problem -- "how a physical system can have thoughts." He believed that if one put aside the too-literal analogies between the neurological organization of the brain and the wiring of the computer, there was a "more fruitful analogy": people and computers could be shown to process information and manipulate symbols in the same way.
In December 1955, Mr. Simon and his colleague, the artificial intelligence scientist Allen Newell, succeeded in writing a computer program that could prove mathematical theorems. Mr. Simon celebrated the achievement by walking into class in January and announcing to his students, "Over the Christmas holiday, Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine."
To the rest of the world, he was no less enthusiastic or unequivocal. In a letter to Bertrand Russell written the following October, Mr. Simon stressed that when the thinking machine had proved theorems from Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica," the solutions had involved "genuine 'discovery.' " (To this missive Russell replied: "Thank you. . . . I am delighted to know that 'Principia Mathematica' can now be done by machinery. I wish Whitehead and I had known of this possibility before we both wasted ten years doing it by hand.") In a much-cited 1957 paper, Mr. Simon predicted that in 10 years "a digital computer will be the world's chess champion, unless the rules bar it from competition," and that after chess the possibilities were endless. Within the "visible future," Mr. Simon declared, "machines that think, that learn, and that create" will be able to handle the range of problems "coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied."
Things have not worked out as straightforwardly as Mr. Simon expected. A digital computer is not yet the world's chess champion, and it has turned out that it is easier to teach computers to solve logical problems than to recognize everyday objects, easier to make them play chess than make mud pies.
These disappointments have led some critics to claim that there are absolute limits on what computers can do and other critics to say that no matter what computers accomplish they will only be simulating thought. The field has sparked an impassioned and continuing debate about the qualities that might make people different from "thinking machines" in fundamental and unbridgeable ways.
In "Models of My Life," however, Mr. Simon barely acknowledges the four decades of controversy in which he and artificial intelligence have been engaged. He interprets and dismisses most of it as romantic resistance. "I think those who object to my characterizing man as simple want somehow to retain a deep mystery at his core," he writes. "In arguing that machines think, we are in the same fix as Darwin when he argued that man shares common ancestors with monkeys, or Galileo when he argued that the Earth spins on its axis."
Mr. Simon does not make his large claims and predictions in a spirit of hyperbole; in his eyes, modeling elements of human logical capacities in machines is the same as creating intelligence. His simplification of the scientific path ahead and his impatience with skeptics have always been in the service of starting and protecting a new discipline. He sees himself as a pioneer, inventor and missionary, whose job is to present artificial intelligence in as sharp and clear a form as possible. The task of recognizing limitations and pronouncing caveats is better left to others. His role was to announce a scientific revolution and declare it ready to set up provisional governments in all the human and social sciences.
One can hardly imagine a better fit between a man and his intellectual enterprise. Artificial intelligence is the expression of Herbert Simon the economist and Herbert Simon the man. He used thinking about his own thinking and strong personal convictions about bounded rationality to create the general shape of his theory. Conversely, when he contemplates his life he uses concepts drawn from his vision of the field. In "Models of My Life," artificial intelligence appears not only as a technical discipline but also, like psychoanalysis, as a structure for self-reflection.
Through its lens, Mr. Simon sees his life in terms of choices, branch points in a maze, searches and decisions. But there are no demons. Mr. Simon describes his life as a "maze without a Minotaur." Indeed, in 1970, he sought out Jorge Luis Borges in Argentina to discuss their shared metaphor of the labyrinth. For Mr. Simon, the search for patterns and rules goes beyond intellectual matters; he looks to it to provide him with a moral metric and a set of values for living. In his autobiography, he explores the meaning of intimate experiences through the formal propositions that might hold them together. Thus, he seems disappointed that Borges denied there was an abstract model underlying his mazes.
In Mr. Simon's hands, even the most emotionally charged events become occasions to discover rules and defend theorems. For instance, he describes an episode during which he contemplated infidelity with an attractive former student he calls Karen. He begins by saying that he "cannot deny" the proposition that one might be "genuinely in love with two women at once" and then shows how he used his experience to add an important new corollary to his theory of love: "You can love two or more women at once . . . but you cannot be loyal to more than one." In his account, Mr. Simon casts his wife in the role of dialogue partner for himself and Karen as they all agree that he was "asking for the moon," attempting the logically impossible. The consistency of Mr. Simon's scientific and personal esthetic, the penchant for the propositional, will surely draw fire from those with Freudian sensibilities who will be alienated by his search for simple rules in complicated situations and his tendency to close down potentially discomforting questions.
When, in 1965, Mr. Simon visited the school in Darmstadt, Germany, where his father had studied engineering, he was faced with questions about his father's real reasons for immigrating to America. Before leaving Germany, in 1903, his father had challenged a fellow student to a duel because of what Mr. Simon believes was an anti-Semitic comment. What, asks Mr. Simon, was his father's relationship to his Jewishness? What, wonders the reader, is Mr. Simon's own relationship to these elements of his past? But such questions are dismissed as irrelevant. They will not yield up facts: "Nothing we could now seek out in Darmstadt would reveal the secret of that student quarrel." And the feelings they would bring up would only be unhelpful: "The mists perform an important social function when they place a statute of limitations on man's memory of ancient wrongs."
The information-processing lens, like all theories of mind, is selective in what it places in the foreground and leaves in the background. It consistently leads Mr. Simon to see facts as more important than feelings and to see logic taking precedence over all. His lodestar principle of bounded rationality makes him comfortable with a situation in which there is little room for considering those things an information-processing model leaves out. He is comfortable with the mists that hide the Minotaur. In focusing on the maze, he falls squarely on one side of a division in the long history of thinking about human nature -- on the side that sees people as rational animals and rationalism as the source of a happy life. If deviation from rationalism is what gets us into trouble, let's be rational. If memory is painful, let's forget.
Of course, there has always been another approach -- to put oneself in touch with memory and Minotaurs. In this view, dreams of rational progress founder on the shoals of fantasy, passion and irrationality. In choosing a life as well as a science of simple propositions, patterns and principles, Mr. Simon is certainly a pre-Freudian, one who does not recognize a seamless web between rational and irrational. But the more important issue raised by this book is that Mr. Simon and his computational esthetic may be the harbingers of a post-Freudian world view. For many readers, Mr. Simon's view of human endeavor, of love and of work, will seem emblematic not of the pre-Freudian rationalism-that- was but of a new, sleeker rationalism-to-be -- a rationalism purged of utopian excess, committed to empirical studies and wedded to the most modern technology.
"Models of My Life" challenges us to think carefully about the costs as well as the benefits of this new rationalism, by suggesting that it may blind us to the Minotaurs in our mazes. And since the parents of scientific revolutions are often more effective if they gaze on their progeny with untroubled eyes, Mr. Simon's book challenges us to do what he has not.

 
 
'I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M IN A MAZE'
 If there is one thing holding together Herbert A. Simon's work in economics, artificial intelligence and psychology, it is the idea that making decisions is like going through a maze. But even he acknowledged that the maze metaphor can be confining.
After all, "one doesn't spend most of one's time making decisions. One lives. I don't feel like I'm in a maze," he said during a telephone interview from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where he was attending a conference on cognitive psychology. "The choices we make lead up to actual experiences. It is one thing to decide to climb a mountain. It is quite another to be on top of it."
Mr. Simon said that "any model of human behavior that focuses on decision making gives us an overrational idea of humans. Artificial intelligence is only a model of human choice, not of human emotion." So, while a computer program can simulate what human beings are doing when they're making decisions, "no one has ever tried to model, say, two people married to each other."
Why focus on the rational rather than on the emotional? That choice, Mr. Simon said, "may be a commentary on my personality. Being reasonable, if not rational, is very important to me."
His decision to write his autobiography, "Models of My Life," was one of his eminently reasonable decisions. Mr. Simon, a professor of computer science and psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University, said he began to reminisce about his life when Pamela McCorduck interviewed him for her book "Machines Who Think." As he recalled, "she said she wanted to do a biography of me, but then she found something more interesting to do." So Mr. Simon wrote it himself, thinking, as he does about many things in his life, that it was for the best. After all, he said, "I have access to some sources that no one else has."
Mr. Simon said that the experience of writing an autobiography hasn't changed his thinking about thinking and that history hasn't changed his thinking about thinking computers. Though his prediction that a computer would be the world's chess champion by 1967 did not come true, he said, "I still feel good about my prediction. Only the time frame was a bit short." -- SARAH BOXER

HEADLINE: He Had Money, Women, an S.&L. Now Don Dixon Has Jail

BYLINE: By N.R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
With a price tag to taxpayers that may reach $500 billion, the savings and loan bailout is destined to become the most expensive financial debacle in the country's history. About 550 failed savings institutions have already been closed, their assets brought under the Government's control to be sold. Deregulation, allowing savings units to invest in everything from raw land to risky "junk bonds," is largely to blame for the failures, but entrepreneurs who rolled into the industry and played fast and loose with the money are also culprits. Federal prosecutors won convictions of 403 of them of fraud. Among the most notorious is Donald Ray Dixon, the head of Vernon Savings and Loan, who could soon get the stiffest sentence of any. His story, culled from court documents and interviews, is emblematic of the torrid living that ransacked the industry. 
 Some people's lives are built on chicanery and deceit; they become snake oil salesmen and confidence men, looters of other people's dreams. Donald Ray Dixon was a savings and loan man, but his life appears to have been built on these same sands, and before his mountain got washed away, it grew very tall indeed.
When the 51-year-old Mr. Dixon was convicted in December of 23 counts of fraud, after a six-week trial speckled with lurid testimony of call girls and hot tubs, yachts and $25,000 shotguns, it brought to a close an extraordinary saga of trickery that may well mark the very depths of the shameful savings and loan debacle. Throughout the country, ruined savings and loans shelter stories aplenty of rapacious greed by owners with long and sticky fingers. There are pirates enough to fill a thousand bedtime story books. But few rival Don Dixon.
"Don Dixon was the highest of the high fliers among the savings and loan crooks," said United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh after Mr. Dixon's conviction. "His excessive life style and illegal management practices stood as a symbol of the wrongdoing of our national thrift industry."
The craggy-faced Mr. Dixon, who once earned a million dollars a year and wheedled an audience with the Pope (bestowing a $40,000 gift on the Pontiff), now waits in despair for his sentencing on March 26. He faces up to 120 years in prison and a fine of $560,000. He is expected to be dealt the lengthiest jail sentence of any savings defendant.
Mr. Dixon was initially refused bail and remanded to the Mansfield Law Enforcement Center in Dallas. Suspicion persisted among Federal prosecutors that he has squirreled away considerable mad money in Europe and Curacao and, if freed, would flee the country. But he was stricken by a heart attack on Jan. 6 and has since undergone surgery. After his release from the hospital, he was permitted to return home so long as his wife, Dana, surrendered her passport.
 
A Place That Regulators
Call Vermin, Tex.
 The curtain rises on this story of avarice in the same place it falls -- the dusty ranch town of Vernon, Tex., 50 miles west of Wichita Falls and two hours northwest of Dallas. Some 13,000 people call it home, as well as a factory that stitches Boy Scout uniforms. Vernon was named after George Washington's cherished residence, though, in time, Federal regulators would drop their respect and come to call the place Vermin.
Don Dixon's father, W.D. Dixon, was an editor of The Vernon Daily Record and a commentator on the local radio station. Mr. Dixon studied architecture at the Rice Institute, but transferred after two years to University of California at Los Angeles, where he picked up a degree in business in 1960.
Once out of school, Mr. Dixon fell into construction and development, starting with Raldon Homes, one of the biggest homebuilders in Dallas and Houston during the 1970's. The 1974 recession, however, badly ravaged the heavily indebted company and lenders forced Mr. Dixon out as one of the principal managers. He resumed his career with Dondi Construction, a condominium builder. Outwardly, Mr. Dixon appeared reasonably strait-laced during his Raldon days. At Dondi, he took to wearing gold chains and leather vests. He was having his fun.
The Vernon Savings and Loan Association had been founded in 1960 by R.B. Tanner, an erstwhile bank examiner, and it grew in a slumberous way. The only leather around the place was people's wallets. By 1981, Vernon was unmistakably robust, with $82 million in assets and $90,000 in delinquent loans, a mere hiccup.
Mr. Tanner wished to retire. The mood struck Don Dixon to buy the place and he offered $5.8 million. You could see his reasoning. He was building a lot of housing and having his own savings and loan to support his projects was a wonderful prospect to contemplate. As he would later say, "If I were to control my own destiny, I wanted to have a shot at the other end of the business."
By July 1982, Mr. Dixon had himself a savings and loan without much damage to his pocketbook. He put only 20 percent down; Mr. Tanner and other Vernon stockholders agreed to accept a note for the balance and to be paid quarterly.
Quickly, Mr. Dixon became steeped in the joy of his new purchase. He went haring after large deposits by dangling fat interest rates. With those funds, he began some slippery lending to condominium developments and costly commercial real estate projects. A good deal of the money entered the pockets of Mr. Dixon's cronies, and some of it, regulators charged, went to Mr. Dixon himself.
Mr. Dixon was not bashful about the wealth lying at his fingertips. He made a vocation out of exaggerated living. He redecorated a massive $1 million house in the tony San Diego suburb of Del Mar. The money to pay the bills was plucked from Vernon, and why not? He insisted he entertained customers amid its splendor (a multimillion-dollar art collection looked on benignly.)
There were oh so many mirthful parties, and Mr. Dixon loved to show off with special touches. At one Christmas bash, tiny Christmas trees floated in the swimming pool.
When the ski season beckoned, there was a better place to regroup: Mr. Dixon's chalet in Beaver Creek, Colo. Gerald Ford lived down the block.
Too bad Vernon didn't hang on a bit longer. When the money ran out, Mr. Dixon had a $7 million hillside house in Rancho Sante Fe, N.M., under construction. It was destined to have an 11-car garage, a stable for 10 horses, tennis courts with viewing stands, three "Maui" waterfalls and $100,000 worth of hand-picked boulders for landscaping.
And the transportation was always more than adequate. According to court records, Vernon money paid for a $2.6 million yacht named High Spirits, a Rolls-Royce and a Ferarri dealership. Mr. Dixon also bought shotguns priced at $25,000.
When Mr. Dixon relaxed, he relaxed big. In October 1983, he and Mrs. Dixon took a couple along with them on a 10-day tour of Europe. Mrs. Dixon labeled it the trip "a flying house party" and a "gastronomique fantastique." Along the way, the foursome stuffed themselves at seven three-star French restaurants. There was a marvelous lunch in Lyons of truffle soup and champagne. Afterward, the celebrated chef Paul Bocuse lined up his 12 sous-chefs for an inspection by the Dixons.
These cheerful details are well known because Mrs. Dixon had recorded them in a 17-page diary which became part of the court record. Vernon paid for the excursion, and Mr. Dixon justified it as a market study for a fancy French restaurant he intended to open in Dallas. It never opened.
 
Church Business in Rome;
Call Girls in California

In the spring of 1985, Mr. Dixon took along Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego on another European jaunt. They traveled on a company-owned Falcon 50 and rested in the finest hotels. The highlight was when Bishop Maher arranged a visit with Pope John Paul II. Mrs. Dixon didn't know what to say. Mr. Dixon always felt you could never go wrong with a nice present. He handed the Pope a $40,000 oil painting, "Night Sentry" by Olaf Wieghorst, plucked from Vernon's huge collection of Western art.
Representatives of Bishop Maher later said they had planned to go Europe on church business and accepted the Dixon invitation for a ride. The Dixons said the Bishop did not know that Vernon paid for the trip.
Much fun went on at a $2 million beach house in Solana Beach, Calif., that prosecutors said was Mr. Dixon's residence and that the defense argued was a Vernon office and hotel for employees and borrowers. Robert Hauberg, one of the Federal prosecutors, said that Mr. Dixon schemed to hide the house's rent payments -- averaging $15,000 or more a month -- from banking regulators.
Witnesses testified that Mr. Dixon convinced Jack Atkinson, a Vernon borrower and real estate developer, to pay the rent with advances on construction loans. Mr. Atkinson testified that he considered the deal "the cost of doing business" with Mr. Dixon, who he said let him use the house six or seven times in the three years he paid rent.
There was more. For example, the prostitutes. They were hired in 1984 and 1985 to entertain Vernon's directors. There were courtroom descriptions of naked frolicking in the hot tub at the beach house.
Karen Wilkening of San Diego, known as the "Rolodex Madam," testified that some of her high-priced call girls worked several Vernon parties. Their fee was $400 per woman, and they were said to have been paid more than $15,000 all together. At one party, said the Rolodex Madam, $500 was tacked on the bill because one prostitute spent the entire evening with a customer. A Vernon employee fingered Mr. Dixon as the person.
But Mr. Dixon later insisted that there was no truth to that ill-mannered accusation. He said he had occupied the evening in the company of his mistress, Patricia Oberman, a real estate saleswoman. Sure enough, his mistress confirmed the story.
On the stand, Mr. Dixon maintained that he had not intended to hire prostitutes to invigorate his directors. He said he thought the women were simply hostesses, good for some convivial conversation. "I knew they were hired from an escort service," he said, "but I had no idea what services they would perform. I specifically ordered there was to be no sex paid for." He insisted that all the partygoers were "very well-behaved."
Mr. Dixon did acknowledge that, at Vernon's expense, he took L. Linton Bowman 3d, then the Texas savings and loan commissioner, on "goodwill entertainment trips," because he wanted him to see some antique dealerships he felt Vernon ought to own (and that Mr. Bowman did bless). Two employees from the yacht High Spirits told of a 1985 voyage during which one them said she slept with Mr. Dixon and the other said she bunked with Mr. Bowman. One said they were each handed $2,000 for "expenses."
Another time, Mr. Dixon also admitted to hiring topless dancers from the Million Dollar Saloon in Dallas as a special treat for one of Vernon's board meetings.
 
Company Money for
Wright, Kemp and Coelho
 Mr. Dixon was also charged with permitting Vernon officers to make political contributions by reimbursing themselves through company expense accounts. Mr. Dixon said he did not know that it was illegal for companies to donate to Federal election campaigns.
Among those getting contributions, the government said, were Tony Coelho of California, then the House majority whip; Representative Jack Kemp, now the Secretary of the Department of Housing, and Representative Martin Frost of Texas. So was House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned his Congressional seat in the wake of a probe of his personal and campaign finances. The Government said the politicians were unaware that the payments might have been illegal.
Former Vernon officers testified that Mr. Dixon authorized them to reimburse themselves for political contributions. John Hill, an executive vice president, said he used to scribble down personal items on his expense sheets to recoup the money. Once he charged the institution for a "weed whacker."
During the four years of merrymaking in which Mr. Dixon owned Vernon, the institution saw its loan assets soar by 2,000 percent; it rose to 15th among Texas savings and loans.
But almost from the beginning, Vernon started to groan under the weight of Mr. Dixon's prodigal spending. Bad loans began to rot the place. Federal regulators drove out Mr. Dixon late in 1986. He left in style, saying his goodbyes to employees over hors d'oeuvres and cocktails at the big Vernon hangar at the Addison, Tex., airport.
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board declared Vernon insolvent and closed it in March 1987. Vernon's assets stood at $1.4 billion, but fully 96 percent of them were loans in default. Bailing out Vernon would cost taxpayers at least $1.3 billion.
The indictments were soon to follow.
Mr. Dixon's didn't come until last June 13, but by that time, seven other Vernon officers had been convicted of or had pleaded guilty to criminal charges. The sentences ranged from probation to a 30-year prison term for Woody Lemons, Vernon's former chairman. Mr. Dixon was charged with 38 counts of conspiracy and bank fraud for misapplying Vernon money. Rather than bring charges against Mr. Dixon for the ruinous loans that helped topple Vernon, the prosecutors tackled the sorts of crime that juries find easier to comprehend. Mr. Dixon pleaded innocent.
After he surrendered to the Dallas F.B.I. office and was released on a no-cash bond, Mr. Dixon declared, "All the stories you've heard about the millions of dollars the savings and loans crooks took -- it's totally dead wrong." He said the actual culprits were the politicans and the regulators. Mr. Dixon said he was unemployed and was by no means flush. By this point, he had filed for personal bankruptcy. "There are no hidden bank accounts," he said. "No millions."
To defend him, Mr. Dixon hired William (Billy) Ravkind, a happy-go-lucky lawyer of seductive charms, paying him a retainer of $200,000 in cash and $200,000 in cowboy art. Mr. Ravkind called the charges against his client "bull corn."
 
A Well-Intentioned Maverick
Out for the Industry's Good?
 The trial began in Dallas at the end of October, presided over by United States District Judge A. Joe Fish. Mr. Dixon listened to the parade of testimony of his unorthodox practices. Then he took the stand and sang a song of homiletic tragedy. He blamed Congress and Federal banking regulators for the S.&L. crisis and his own legal woes. He described himself as a well-intentioned maverick who battled for changes he felt would benefit the savings and loan industry.
After nine days of deliberation, the jury of seven women and five men found him guilty of 23 of the 38 charges, including those related to the leasing of the beach house and three charges of using Vernon funds to hire prostitutes. Mr. Dixon was acquitted of allegations that he used Vernon funds to reimburse employees for political contributions and for out-of-state trips with Mr. Bowman.
In his closing arguments, David Jarvis, one of the prosecutors, said Mr. Dixon used Vernon as "his personal piggy bank." He went on, "I think you'll see over and over that Don Dixon was a master manipulator. He manipulated people to get what he wanted."
And that is what is putting Mr. Dixon behind bars -- without the fast cars, the big houses, the loose women and with the fun, long, long gone.

 
 
JAIL TERMS AND FINES
 The conviction of Donald Dixon was viewed by the Justice Department as one of the biggest victories in its pursuit of culprits from the savings and loan crisis and added an important name to the lengthening list of defendants it has put behind bars.
The Justice Department said that in the last two years Federal prosecutors won the convictions of 403 people for savings and loan fraud. More than 315 of them, the department added, have been given jail time.
The trend among judges has been to hand out longer and longer sentences. The lengthiest term meted out so far is 30 years for Woody Lemons, former chairman of the Vernon Savings and Loan Association. He was found guilty by a jury on Dec. 6, 1989, after being indicted on 13 counts of fraud.
The department said that 98 directors or officers of savings and loans were charged with crimes during the two-year period; 78 were convicted and three acquitted. The remaining cases have not yet been settled.
In addition, judges have imposed fines amounting to $4.8 million. Some $231 million in restitution has also been mandated, though the Justice Department has found it difficult to recover much of this money.
 
ONE WHO PLEADED GUILTY
 
 
Don Dixon is perhaps the biggest scalp so far for the Justice Department in its crackdown on savings and loan fraud. But nearly as gratifying for Federal prosecutors was the guilty plea by Edwin T. McBirney 3d, whose four-year romp as chairman of the Sunbelt Savings Association, another failed Texas savings institution, created losses of $3 billion for American taxpayers.
The Justice Department announced the plea by Mr. McBirney the day after a Dallas jury convicted Mr. Dixon of 23 counts of fraud and other crimes. Under the plea bargain with Federal prosecutors, the 38-year-old Mr. McBirney agreed to plead guilty to two counts of a 17-count indictment, one for fraud and one for tax evasion. He faces a maximum prison term of 15 years and $8.5 million in fines and related civil damages.
During his tenure at Sunbelt, Mr. McBirney devoted much of his energies to spending money. It won him the nickname "Fast Eddie" and Sunbelt the name "Gunbelt Savings."
When he ran Sunbelt, Mr. McBirney lived as high as Mr. Dixon. He financed the purchase of 84 Rolls-Royces from the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. He took people on gambling trips to Las Vegas in one of Sunbelt's seven private planes. He threw his share of spectacular parties. One Halloween bash featured a live elephant and entertainment by the Spinners. A Christmas party was distinguished by a live bear.

HEADLINE: Random House's Glitzy New Imprint

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The weekly editorial meetings of Turtle Bay Books can veer almost anywhere. They are never dour and they are never strictly confined to the peculiarities of manuscripts. Joni Evans, the compulsively talkative editor who runs Turtle Bay, leaned forward and confessed, "What we normally talk about at these meetings is our hair. But today nothing about hair."
Susan Kamil said she badly needed everyone to read a novel she was about to edit. And she said the publicity people were distressed by use of the word "caper" in promotional copy for the book. "Caper is a category that is really, really weak," she said. "It is no category. Get caper out of the copy." 
 Joni Evans said, "It's not really a caper. It's more like picaresque. We can play with picaresque."
Julie Grau mentioned that she had been desperate to get hold of a manuscript and she had finally got it and it was "so mediocre."
"No!" Joni Evans said.
"You're kidding," Susan Kamil said.
"O.K., O.K., where are we?" Joni Evans said. "Where are we?"
Karen Rinaldi mentioned an idea that was a little cryptic.
Joni Evans said, "I don't know who buys this in book form unless you're a brilliant writer."
Julie Grau mentioned that she thought it was the birthday of one of their authors, because she knows it coincides with the birthday of a former boyfriend.
"Send flowers?" Susan Kamil wondered.
Joni Evans scribbled a reminder. "Birthday," she said. "Do something!"
Turtle Bay Books is five women in pursuit of the big time. Whether it is bound for glory is not known yet, but it is bound for attention. For one thing, it is the newest imprint to join the cluster under the vast Random House Inc., the country's largest issuer of general-interest books. And at its nucleus is Joni Evans, long one of the most visible, most prosperous and most voluble people in publishing, a business increasingly punctuated by the clashes of big egos, big dollars and big risks, a business that, even to its practitioners, often seems totally inchoate.
 
Volcanic Gossip
 The gestation of Turtle Bay began in a splashy enough way, resulting in the sort of volcanic publishing gossip that gets told in bars and around water coolers. At the end of October 1990, Ms. Evans abruptly was replaced in her job as the publisher of the Random House imprint by Harold Evans (no relation), who had been editor of Conde Nast Traveler magazine.
Ms. Evans said she had asked to have her own imprint several months before the switch took place, but almost everyone in publishing, including Ms. Evans, was startled at the timing of the change.
When she came to Random House three years ago from archrival Simon & Schuster, where she headed the adult trade department and had run Linden Press, Ms. Evans was to establish Turtle Bay. Six weeks after her arrival, her plans were upset when she was offered the publisher's mantle. After three years in the job, Ms. Evans said she had grown increasingly discontent with the minutiae of overseeing a list of some 100 books and wanted to deal with a smaller grouping of about 25 titles.
When the surprise October announcement came, some people in publishing assumed displeasure with Ms. Evans's performance provoked the change, although Alberto Vitale, Random House's chief executive, denies that, and the lists under her were studded with an unusual number of best sellers.
The wider conjecture was that the timing had to do with rumored rumblings at the Conde Nast magazine empire run by the unpredictable Samuel I. Newhouse Jr., who also presides over Random House. According to this thinking, Tina Brown, the editor of Vanity Fair, one of the most vibrant Conde Nast magazines, was being wooed to accept a job at a Hollywood studio, and if she left, so would her husband, Harry Evans. To keep them both, the conjecture goes, Mr. Evans was swiftly handed the plum Random House job, months before Ms. Evans expected to vacate it.
 
Intimate Feeling
 For the time being, Turtle Bay is installed in boxy temporary quarters on the 12th floor of the Random House offices on East 50th Street near Third Avenue. In mid-April, it will relocate to a quaint nearby brownstone, to afford a snugger, more intimate feeling; the Random House offices give off a vibration of institutional charmlessness.
The five women who comprise Turtle Bay hope to become something of a throwback to a bygone era, when publishers were small and lavished inordinate attention on their authors. They have great fun together. They are emphatically outgoing, decidedly free-spirited, vulnerable to contagious laughter. The effect is festive, college-dormitory-like. What's paying $1 million for a six-page proposal if you can't laugh about it?
Nine sheets of paper summarize Turtle Bay's hopes and dreams: they list the first 45 books under contract -- most years away from publication. It has the scent of a powerful list: commercial fiction from the likes of Mario Puzo and Joan Collins, autobiographies from Michael Caine and Vanessa Redgrave, a biography of Jim Morrison by Albert Goldman, serious fiction from A. S. Byatt and Ann Beattie and nonfiction from Holly Brubach and Suzannah Lessard, a smorgasbord of fiction and nonfiction, the literary and the commercial.
Nevertheless, Turtle Bay Books arrives at a troublous time for book publishing -- still dizzied by several years of slumping sales at many houses. Although the privately held Random House says it had a strong year in 1990, the sagging economy has wrung its effect on book buyers. For years, breathlessly large advances have been doled out and mortifying amounts of returned books have swamped warehouses. The big books sell bigger, the small books sell smaller and everyone complains.
Book publishing is exhausting work, fraught with uncertainty, riddled with paradox. Publishers must have quixotic faith and endure gambler's luck. You hit a few big ones, then pass through long dry spells and then another winner comes roaring home. How well Turtle Bay's books will be parlayed into business success will remain uncertain for several years, though Ms. Evans has demonstrated a knack for spotting books that captivate a wide readership.
"What she's great at is she has very strong authorial relationships and she's a very good commercial book editor," said Mort Janklow, the literary agent. "And she's a very dogmatic and aggressive acquirer."
 
Bubbling and Blunt
 Authors who have worked with her mention her bubbling enthusiasm and fidelity to the books -- and her blunt appraisals. "She says these incredible sentences to you that cause you to walk around the house kicking lamps over and saying, 'What does she mean by that?' and then it dawns on you that that's a brilliant insight," said Julia Phillips, author of the just-published "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again."
In her new situation, the 48-year-old Ms. Evans will need to shine. Turtle Bay will operate within the sprawling empire of Mr. Newhouse, known to act with seemingly impetuous swiftness with the personnel of his publishing holdings. Editors and publishers seem to be extracted from their offices in the blink of an eye. (For now, Ms. Evans is thought to get on fine with Mr. Newhouse.)
And, then, there is the immutable law that forbids anything from going predictably in book publishing. "With books, you don't control your product," Ms. Evans said. "There are so many variables. Your writer gets sick, he gets writer's block, he gets bad, he gets brilliant, he gets heartburn, his wife divorces him, he says he'll deliver in 1991 and he delivers in 1997. Or his next-door neighbor delivers the same thing and his book becomes obsolete."
Friday morning, and Ms. Evans extinguished brush fires, poured a diet drink, asked Jason Epstein, Random House's editorial director, how he liked her new hairdo (he was rather noncommittal) and revisited the birth of Turtle Bay.
"I turned to the people I knew and liked," she said about the assembling of her staff. Susan Kamil, an executive editor at Random House whom Ms. Evans hired years ago at Simon & Schuster, is one of the editors. Julie Grau, a young assistant editor who worked for Ms. Evans when she was publisher, is another. Fleshing out the staff are Karen Rinaldi, who operates as a junior editor and an editorial assistant, and Christina Gratz, Ms. Evans's assistant.
 
The Name Game
 With the personnel decided on, the maddening, crazed pursuit of a name commenced. Ms. Evans should have known it would be impossible. When offered the job of publisher of Random House, at the age of 45, she was torn over whether to accept it because she was so enthusiastic about having an imprint again. She sought the wisdom of her friend, Robert Gottlieb, the editor of The New Yorker. Mr. Gottlieb said she must take the job and gave her two reasons: "First, you have no right being happy at 45, and, second, you will never think of a name for your imprint."
He was almost right. For six weeks, she and her colleagues sifted through scores of possibilities; mothers and authors and cousins twice-removed called with suggestions. Chicory Books. A Priori Books. Top Drawer Books. Outta Here Books. Monkey Business Books. Multi Ego Press. The names that struck a chord were subjected to a title search by the legal department to make sure no one else had claims to them. Each search seemed to turn up a problem.
One day Norman Mailer phoned and said, "I have your name: Watermark Books."
"I said, 'That's it, that's it, I love it,' " Ms. Evans said. "Then we did a title search and we found out that Princeton University has a small Watermark Books and a place in Arizona has it. And we called them up and we found out we will be sued or go to jail if we even think about using it."
At last, a Random House lawyer, Lesley Oelsner, proposed Turtle Bay Books, since the division would exist in what is known as the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan. Better yet, the lawyer had already taken the trouble to do the title search and found it unencumbered. Ms. Evans disliked it. She would say it to herself and images of Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles would dance through her head.
Then desperation set in and she decided she really adored it. "We started to say it with more authority," she explained. "We'd come in every day and say, 'I hate it, I hate it.' Then we'd say, 'I love it,' 'I love it,' and it started to sound better."
Turtle Bay intends to grow to 25 titles a year within three years, but will publish about 16 next year, starting on Valentine's Day with "How We Met: Recalling Life's Most Romantic Moments" by Nancy Cobb. The book recounts the first meetings of various couples that "resulted in bliss."
Realistically, Ms. Evans doesn't expect to break even until Turtle Bay's third year, since she begins with no backlist books, timeless titles that sell year after year and fortify the bottom line.
Ms. Evans didn't want to discuss revenue and profit projections for Turtle Bay, but publishing executives estimated that a house of that size might expect to amass sales of some $7 million to $10 million in three years, and, if it's successful, might achieve a pretax profit margin approaching 25 percent after five, an impressive amount. Linden Press, she said, attracted revenues of close to $10 million after five years.
Turtle Bay built its beginning list basically by assembling works that the three editors had previously signed up at Random House. A few were let go, because the authors wanted to stay put. For example, Kirk Douglas was being edited by both Ms. Evans and David Rosenthal and Mr. Douglas wished to continue his relationship with Mr. Rosenthal.
 
The Big Bucks
 The books carry advances of anywhere from less than $10,000 to more than $1 million. Turtle Bay's arrangement with the parent Random House is the same as that for the publishing house's other cluster of imprints. Editors can buy any books up to a price of $150,000. Beyond that figure, they need the blessing of Alberto Vitale.
Book publishing in a small house can be frighteningly chancy. The performance of a few titles can vastly affect the house's fortunes. At any publisher, big or small, a sprinkling of titles supplies the profits. Ms. Evans agrees with the suppositions of other editors that as few as 15 to 25 percent of books published by a house in any given year actually earn back their advances and make money -- hopefully enough to more than cancel out losses on all the other titles.
Turtle Bay's employees hope to bring a commonsensical approach to bear. Watching printings and other details will be more obsessively important to them. "When you're small, you must be on guard," Ms. Evans said. "You call authors five times a month to say how are you doing rather than one time a month, because it matters five times a month."
Heavy returns from book stores remain the hoary thorn of publishing. Returns average around 25 to 30 percent, and often exceed 50 percent on many books, higher than was true several years ago. "The fault is optimism," Ms. Evans said. "The optimism of the publisher and the optimism of the bookstores. It's human error overriding the controls. You get a frenzy going when something's happening. You get some good news and you say, 'By god, I better print another 10,000.' "
Ms. Evans said her biggest error at Linden was failing to develop a backlist early. So the other day she was trekking through New Jersey pursuing a book project highly unlikely for her. It would be an authorized corporate history, significant quantities of which would be bought year after year by the company itself.
In picking manuscripts, the Turtle Bay editors have diverging but complementary tastes. While she has wide breath, Ms. Evans is best known for her commercial instincts in fiction. Though she overlaps with Ms. Evans, Susan Kamil leans more toward literary books. Julie Grau has identified herself with literary fiction and serious nonfiction, and has a fond taste for foreign novels. She reads Italian, French, German and Hebrew.
 
The Bug Book
 As a small house, Turtle Bay feels it can often expedite things. "We're hungry and young," Ms. Evans said. "Speed is our best weapon."
Just the other day, an agent brought Susan Kamil a proposal by a first-time author named Kevin Cook. Entitled "Night Crawlers," it was a nonfiction work about exterminators. The proposal related the trials of a Chicago exterminator (he put his wife through law school and then she left him, having wearied of the scornful looks he got when he told people about how he spent his days) and wove in oddities like the spiders that crawl up the Empire State Building. As it happens, Ms. Kamil "loves bugs."
She spoke with the author and suggested that the book encompass the whole world of pest control and this zoo of creatures that exists. She showed the idea to Ms. Evans. She liked a bug book. She showed it to Ms. Grau. She said, "Who would read a book about bugs?" (Following further discussion, she sort of saw how some people would.)
That day, Ms. Kamil made a bid and a few days later had signed up the project. "So we've got a bug book," Ms. Kamil said. "Great!"
 
 
 
THE JONI EVANS STORY -- AND STYLE
 Joni Evans is a spirited woman with short salt-and-pepper hair. Enthusiasm effervesces out of her and seems to encapsulate her, and there is something of the stand-up comic about her manner. If not in book publishing, she would be working the Borscht Belt.
Reading endless pages of unremitting slush for McCall's and The Ladies' Home Journal was her entrance into publishing. She did it for two years, starting in 1964.
"If you found anything good, you couldn't publish it," she said. "I read a wonderful Joyce Carol Oates story and it was too dark. Everything had to be upbeat. You couldn't lose sleep over anything."
After working for a while as a reader for Book of the Month Club, she became a "manuscript girl" at the William Morrow publishing house. This was 1968. "I remember the first day I wore a pants suit to the office," she recalled. "I was shaking because I was afraid I would get fired. Everyone was staring at me. The next day, everyone showed up in pants."
She graduated to junior editor at Morrow, then migrated to Simon & Schuster in 1974 as subsidiary rights director. Five years later, she became the head of Linden Press, where she published a mix of commercial and literary authors like Jeffrey Archer, Anita Brookner and Lois Gould.
In 1978, during a lunch break, Ms. Evans married Richard Snyder, the chairman of Simon & Schuster, and in 1985 she became the head of trade publishing. In early 1987, their vinegary marriage dissolved, to widespread publicity, leading her to leave Simon & Schuster.
The acrimonious divorce case went to trial and still awaits the approval of the presiding judge. "I think it's like the S.& L. crisis," Ms. Evans said. "We'll know the end of it in 1999."

 BODY:
IN THE OLD DAYS, A MAN'S MAJOR concern with smell was that he'd better not. Legend has it that the cowboys of yore took to lilac water, hoping to cancel out the sour notes with a sweet one. But a lot has changed since then. As we nose into the 1990's, fragrance companies are wooing men with the promise not only of smelling decent, or even sexy, but of acquiring an aura that packs a whole image into a single whiff.
 "I've seen more willingness to be creative in the men's market than the women's," says Michael D. Sweeney, vice president at International Flavors and Fragrances, a New York-based company that formulates scents for much of the industry. 
One reason may be the conviction of perfumers that men are now really interested. Until a few years ago, most fragrance experts believed that as much as 70 percent of the men's products were purchased by women, as gifts or even for themselves. But a recent survey conducted by The Gallup Organization found that three-quarters of the 808 men queried had purchased one or more bottles of aftershave or cologne during the past 12 months, and half had worn a fragrance five or more times within the previous week.
"Men's fragrance has become a more accepted part of an everyday grooming package," says Andrew Shore, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. "Skin care isn't there yet. But cologne is relatively innocuous."
 To lure men by the nose, companies are first appealing to their other senses. In terms of visual draws, faux granite seems to be a trend, appearing in the bottle designs of both Fendi Uomo, introduced in 1989, and Red for Men, a new Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrance, which boasts 551 ingredients and is scheduled to go on the market this spring.
 Name is important, too, preferably short and memorable. Brut, which Michael Sweeney considers an all-time great one, is "a nice little four-letter word," he says, encompassing both the elegance of champagne and all the macho you could wish for. Among the newer men's fragrance names, he gives special points to Boss, introduced by Hugo Boss.
 "It brings to mind Bruce Springsteen," says Sweeney. "Men may not know Hugo Boss, but they certainly know 'the Boss.' " One name men are likely to be tripping over this spring is Egoiste, the new men's fragrance from Chanel. Although the product has already been launched successfully abroad, it has raised a few eyebrows here.
 "I don't know how Egoiste will translate in a supposedly kinder, gentler nation," says Allan Mottus, an industry consultant and publisher of the newsletter "The Informationist." "It sounds smug."
 So, initially, does the campaign. To introduce the product to the press, Chanel had a Manhattan luxury apartment decorated as the Egoiste's abode and dispensed copies of his personal journal, designed to tantalize at least as much as the diary of the late Laura Palmer of "Twin Peaks." Like Laura, the Egoiste seems to have been conceived as a character to be barely glimpsed but discussed incessantly. In television commercials airing in late April, when the fragrance comes to New York as a Bloomingdale's exclusive, viewers will see hordes of beautiful wronged women opening and slamming balcony doors of a Riviera hotel as they hurl epithets in French at the unseen E-man. The high-camp approach begs for parody, and according to Lyle Saunders, Chanel's executive director of creative services, "We'll be very disappointed if 'Saturday Night Live' doesn't do it."
 A macho campaign that doesn't take itself too seriously may be a refreshing change, but it's by no means the only unusual approach. Liz Claiborne Inc., whose one-and-a-half-year-old scent for men, Claiborne, has lagged behind some of the powerhouse brands, has been test marketing new radio spots that highlight the sensitive man of the moment. They include original songs: a baseball-field reverie and a rumination on romance that sound so un-Madison Avenue some listeners have mistaken them for singles. Both end with the Claiborne tag line, "Man is not so simple, after all."
 "This company doesn't do sex," asserts Suzanne Cassano, vice president of marketing. "When we talked to men in focus groups, they all felt they wanted to be viewed as more complex."
 Giorgio Beverly Hills also appears to be going for the whole man. Like Calvin Klein's enormously successful men's versions of Obsession and Eternity, Giorgio's Red for Men is another attempt to cash in on an already strong women's brand. But the company is also putting a hefty budget behind its "life style" commercials, which represent the first time Giorgio has used television to advertise a men's fragrance.
 "We show a man in different settings," says Linda LoRe, senior vice president of marketing. "It's not just in the boardroom, or with the baby, or in bed."
 This multifaceted approach may be extending to the choice of a celebrity symbol. Although Guess Parfum, like most of those launching a fragrance, claims it is going for an 18- to 35-year-old audience, the company is introducing its new Guess Men scent with the same star who has appeared in Guess sportswear advertisements: craggy Tom Skerritt. Skerritt, who is obviously over 35, played one of the training officers in "Top Gun" and seems to fit more into the new 90's mold as described by Allan Mottus.
 "There's a move back to Gary Cooper and the 1950's westerns," Mottus says. "Hunks with some compassion. Look at our military pilots. They're getting-the-job-done types, and some are in their 40's."
 In addition to creating appealing images, fragrance companies are trying to make scent easy both to buy and to try. Prices remain lower than those in the women's market -- many top-of-the-line men's fragrances can be bought in some form for $30 or under -- and more manufacturers are turning to scent strips, free samples and even direct mail. Quintessence, for instance, went so far as to mail a $14 bottle of cologne to virtually every man in Aspen, Colo., when it introduced Aspen for Men in 1989.
 For men who still feel intimidated asking a sales clerk for cologne, the future may include self-service at the corner drugstore. According to market analysts, sales of men's fragrances have accelerated more in mass market outlets than in department stores and specialty retailers. Andrew Shore of Prudential-Bache sees an analogy here.
 "Before the AIDS crisis, men had to go to the counter to ask for condoms," he says. "Once they were moved out, sales started to take off."
 The industry is also keeping up the synergy with the women's market. In addition to spawning men's versions of successful perfumes, at least one company has done the reverse: When customers buy Aspen for Men cologne for this Father's Day, they'll get a free bottle of the newer scent, Aspen for Women.
 But the final, critical factor is the scent itself. No man will go back for more unless it entices him. "Men's fragrances are getting sophisticated, stronger, more floral," says Annette Green, executive director of The Fragrance Foundation, a trade group. "They want the scent to be imaginative and adventuresome -- not just a bay rum."
 It's the job of I.F.F.'s Michael Sweeney to make sure the new products live up to the ideal. He feels that the newest trend is what he calls "a freshness note," which can be a new citrus note -- such as tangerine, in addition to the ever-popular lemon or lime -- or what the industry calls the "ozone note." Now especially hot, the latter is a chemical formulation designed to have the ultimate fresh smell of clothes drying on a line.
 "There are a lot of women's fragrances we call Chypre, which are based on oakmoss, patchouli and coriander," Sweeney says. "We see these scents as appropriate for men." He adds, "Our people are usually good cooks, too."
 Despite the proliferation of new fragrances, some men seem to stay on a scent forever. The classic Old Spice, recently acquired by Procter & Gamble, remains one of the best-selling men's brands, with what Sweeney calls "spicy notes, but a soft, powdery quality." Still, he feels that smell is as much in need of fresh stimulation as the other senses. "Men will always go back to the old standbys, but they also want a new fragrance the way they want a new suit," he says. "It's uplifting."

MAGIC IMAGES
 After nine months of restorative work and renovations, the New Haven Colony Historical Society has reopened with a new exhibition, "When Images Were Magic: John Warner Barber, Connecticut's First Popular Historian." It will remain on view through Sept. 15.
 Barber established a successful engraving business in New HAven in 1823 and was one of the founders of the historical society, contributing a substantial portion of its original collection.
 His most ambitious undertaking and the focus of the exhibit is "Connecticut Historical Collections," published in 1836. The book, which sold for $3, then the average weekly wage, contained 560 pages and 180 of Barber's own wood engravings.
 To collect material for the work, he traveled widely, interviewing residents and poring over old documents and newspapers. His sketches and drawings of 19th-century life were among the first histories published in America. Their popularity was based on the appeal of his lively drawings and retelling of local lore, exposing people for the first time to the experiences of other people in other communities.
 Christopher Bickford, director of the Connecticut Historical Society, which organized the exhibit, will give a lecture about Barber on Thursday at 5 P.M.
 The New Haven Colony Historical Society, 114 Whitney Avenue, is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and weekends from 2 to 5 P.M. An opening reception, with no admission charged, will be held today from 2 to 5 P.M. Admission is $2, $1.50 for students and the elderly and $1 for children. Call 562-4183 for more information.
 
FLIGHTS OF FANCY
 "Bradley's Believe It or Not" is an art exhibition that can be seen through April 1 in Terminal A of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks. John Cusano, a Norwalk art dealer, selected the artists and organized the airport-related exhibit for the Connecticut Commission on the Arts.
 Mary Bailey's contribution is a collection of enlarged microscopic organisms out of her imagination. They can only survive at altitudes higher than 5,000 feet in pressurized aircraft, and their life span is the time it takes to fly from Hartford to Cleveland.
 Ruby Beers, a woman thought up by Bryan Konefsky, used to be in charge of unclaimed baggage. Now retired, she is depicted in her garden, where she has planted numerous pieces of luggage with only their handles protruding from the earth. The handles bear little stickers identifying each as an attache case, a makeup case or a suitcase.
 Leo Jensen chose an archeological theme in which a dig in 3101 uncovers strange helmets made of wood, twine and generally low-tech materials, assumed to have belonged to pilots and other airport denizens from his fantasy world. And the fourth artist, Suzan Shutan, forces the viewer to peer through little holes to see a variety of objects accompanied by explanatory text.
 
LIVES ON FILM
 The Westport Public Library has begun a film series of film biographies, shown on Thursdays at 7:30 P.M. through May 9. This week's subject is "The World That Robert Moses Built," about the creator of Jones Beach, the West Side Highway and other massive New York City-area projects. Venerated by some and castigated by others, he fueled a debate over public order versus individual liberty when he acquired vast properties by eminent domain, displacing thousands of residents.
 Paul Gaugin's biography, "The Savage Dream" will be shown on March 28, followed by films on Winston Churchill, Andy Warhol, Claude Monet, James Joyce, Frank Lloyd Wright, Isabel Bishop, Albert Einstein and Marc Chagall, among others. Admission is free. For a complete schedule, call 227-8411, extension 24 or 25.
 
WORLD OF YACHTING
 Olin Stephens 2d is to be the featured speaker at 9:15 A.M. on Saturday during Mystic Seaport's Fourth Annual Yachting Symposium, which runs from Friday through Sunday. A founder of Sparkman & Stephens yacht designers of New York City, he designed the schooner Brilliant, berthed at Mystic Seaport, and five successful America's Cup defenders.
 An opening reception on Friday at 7:30 P.M. will feature a talk by the British yacht agent William Collier on restoration work being done on vessels in Europe.
 In addition to Mr. Stephens, Saturday's roster of speakers includes Henry Scheel, a naval architect and designer of the Scheel keel; Jim Brown, designer of cruising multihulls; David Martin, powerboat designer, and John Deknatel, president of Ray Hunt and Associates, yacht designers in Boston.
 A reception will be held from 5 to 7:30 P.M. on Saturday, during which two awards will be presented by Mystic Seaport for contributions to the promotion of yachting and the preservation of yachts. The symposium will end on Sunday with a tour of the Seaport's yachting collection from 10 A.M. to noon.
 The fee is $95 and includes lunch on Saturday. To register or obtain more information, call 572-0711, extension 124 or 125.
 
BLUE JEANS
 Jeans, the pants that cross all barriers of gender, class and economic status, will be explored in a talk, "The Jeaning of America: Stepping Out With Denim, 1850-1990" by Jeanne Atkinson.
 An adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, Ms. Atkinson will speak at 10:30 A.M. on Tuesday at the Fairfield Historical Society, 636 Old Post Road. Accompanied by slides and articles of clothing on loan from museums and private collections, she will analyze the popularity of the pants that were once called blue jeans, how and why their use has burgeonedsince the mid-19th century. Admission is $5, and reservations are required. Call 259-1598. FRENCH REVOLUTION
 The Hartford Ballet is sponsoring the presentation of the Ballet du Nord from France in "Marie Antoinette." Devised for the French bicentennial by Alfonso Cata, the company's director, the lavishly staged and costumed work combines court dances of the period with a tale of intrigue and romance, set to the music of Mozart, Haydn and Vivaldi.
 Performances at Bushnell Hall in Hartford are scheduled at 8 P.M. on Friday and Saturday, with a Saturday matinee at 2:30. Tickets priced at $10.50 to $38.50 may be reserved by calling 246-6807.
 
GRAVEYARD HISTORY
 A family graveyard in Griswold, dating from 1740 to 1850 and uncovered by a sand and gravel operation, is the subject of a lecture by Nicholas Bellantoni, state archeologist, and Jeffrey Bendremer, a graduate student at the University of Connecticut.
 From 7:30 to 9 P.M. on Tuesday, the two men will discuss conclusions drawn from the excavation about the medical problems, genetic heritage, life styles and vocations of the family during an entire century. The program will take place in the Connecticut State Museum, Wilbur Cross Building on the Storrs campus of UConn. Admission will be $10. For more information, call 486-4460.

HEADLINE: In Burbank, Revival and Growth Limits

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

DATELINE: BURBANK, CALIF.

 BODY:
THIS birthplace of Mickey Mouse and Lockheed's Stealth fighter is soon to be home to an unusual 2.5-million-square-foot, $400 million retail and office center. Its presence is already revitalizing a downtown long derided on the Johnny Carson Show as "beautiful downtown Burbank."
But Johnny Carson's studio is more than two miles to the south, in an area known as the Media District, which has blossomed in the last decade with high-rise office towers where vacancies are rare. 
 A prime reason for the near demise of downtown was that three blocks of its San Fernando Road shopping district was closed to traffic in the mid-60's. What was to have stimulated shopping instead vastly diminished it.
In Oct. 19, 1989, the shopping district was once again opened to traffic, the day after construction began on what will be known as Media City Center.More than 240 homes and 83 businesses were displaced from the 41-acre, city-assembled, city-owned site of the largest construction project under way in sprawling San Fernando Valley. It has a tangled history.
One development deal with the Hahn Company of San Diego fell apart when the parent company of a proposed anchor tenant was acquired and quashed expansion plans. Disney and MCA, parent of Universal Studios, dropped their grandiose schemes for entertainment centers.
The 20-year struggle to find a builder for the site ended in March 1989 when the Alexander Haagen Company of Manhattan Beach, Calif., beat out 14 bidders. The 1-million-square-foot, three-level retail mall will include four anchor stores, Bullock's, Mervyn's, Sears and Ikea, the Swedish home-furnishings store, and 100 specialty shops. There is also going to be a four-screen cinema and the first satellite of the Los Angeles Natural History Museum.
Four office towers to be built and owned by the Homart Development Corporation of Chicago are to take up an additional 1 million square feet. A 300-room all-suite hotel is planned by Homart, but so far there is no commitment for it. Office construction was to have coincided with that of the mall, most of which is scheduled to open this summer. But construction of the towers is going more slowly than expected because of tighter lending conditions, said Frederick Bruning, a partner in the Haagen firm.
 Residents of Burbank, a 17-square-mile city of 94,000 residents 14 miles northwest of Los Angeles, have since the mid-80's complained about rampant commercial development in the Media District.
To address this issue, the city imposed broad guidelines last Jan. 8 limiting development there to 16.8 million square feet of new commercial and industrial construction for the foreseeable future and imposing impact fees on both current landlords and future developers for such things as road improvements.
There were no previous limits, and Richard Pruetz, the City Planner, said that developers would have theoretically been able to build an additional 50 million square feet of commercial and industrial projects in the 1.2-square-mile district.
Since 1982, nearly 2.5 million square feet of office space has been built in the district, where the office vacancy rate last month was 1.5 percent, the lowest in Southern California, and space goes for $25 a square foot. Burbank's office vacancy rate as a whole is 6 percent and rents average about $20 a square foot.
" I' M astounded that practically every square foot is taken," said Jef Vander Borght, an architect and City Planning Board member. "It's wildly successful, beyond anyone's imagination."
Within the area are the Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC studios, as well as many of the city's 430 media-related firms,such as post production outlets and recording studios.
The area that straddles the Ventura Freeway and nestles beneath the Hollywood Hills east of Universal City is popular with TV and movie firms because of its proximity to three freeways and relatively affordable housing. Home prices last year averaged $245,000.
The area also includes many quiet neighborhoods, some of them overshadowed by high-rises. Streets are clogged at rush-hour with traffic from office workers.
The engine behind the district's rapid development and distinct skyline is the studios' explosive growth, Hollywood's perceived deterioration and the easy lending practices of the 80's.
Disney in particular has grown enormously. The company already has had to scatter its operations in several locations, including neighboring Glendale. A master building plan that includes six new sound stages, a health club and commissary had been put on hold until after last month's local election, when the most recent development flap was resolved.
After a divisive campaign that led to the largest turnout in a decade, voters on Feb. 26 rejected two growth-control measures -- one that would limit the height of any new construction to 25 feet and 350,000 square feet a year, the other restricting commercial construction near residential neighborhoods -- that the studios contended would have capped their growth.
 Whether the new guidelines that took effect Jan. 8 will ultimately answer concerns about runaway growth remains to be seen.
The proof will be in whether the city is successful in negotiating future development deals that include provisions for ride-sharing, child care and open space.
On March 5, the City Council approved NBC Plaza -- two towers, one 18 stories, the other with a total of 700,000 square feet -- considered the district's future centerpiece. The network, in an equity partnership with John Cushman, will develop the project, which includes a plaza of more than two acres.
The center, which will rise next to NBC's existing 43-acre site where Mr. Carson tapes his shows, is to serve as the network's West Coast headquarters.
To gain the city's approval, NBC agreed to reduce the size of the project by 100,000 square feet, to recycle the water in its plaza fountains and spend 1 percent of the project's cost on art for the plaza. "If either of the Feb. 26 measures had passed, NBC Plaza would have been killed and it would have frozen our operations," said Jack O'Neill, vice president for network real estate, who campaigned against the measures. "You couldn't be for the measures and be for the studios. That was the message."
The message apparently was picked up before the vote, as the recession deepened. Last May, Burbank's largest longtime employer, the Lockheed Corporation, decided to relocate most of its local operations to Marietta, Ga., and Palmdale, Calif., scaling back the famed Skunk Works that made the Stealth fighter and SR-71 Blackbird, and laying off or transferring more than 3,000 of its 6,500 employees.
A decade ago, Lockheed had more than 20,000 employees here.
While Lockheed lost, the entertainment industry gained. In 1976, by all accounts, 10 percent of the labor force was employed by entertainment-related companies. Today, 15 percent of the city's labor force of 84,000 work for the studios and allied entertainment firms employ an additional 14 percent.
 "We surprised ourselves when we looked at the numbers," said Mr. Bruning of the Haagen Company. Studies show that the city's average household income is $52,000, he said. "That's an extremely wealthy population."
The downtown mall is expected to generate $420 million in annual sales and $4.2 million in tax revenue. The mall design, by the Newport Beach, Calif., architect Todd Stoutenborough, will attempt to meet the needs of film-makers to shoot movies on location. Lighting levels can be adjusted to brighter than normal and doors are extra wide to accommodate film crews.
Now that the old downtown has reopened to traffic, it is drawing new businesses, such as children's stores, a jewelry boutique and restaurants.
Larry Kosmont, a former City Development Director and now a commercial real estate consultant, expects the retail office center will ultimately salvage downtown. Part of the reason is growth restrictions and traffic problems in neighboring cities, he said.
"Burbank is the last opportunity for medium- to high-rise development," Mr. Kosmont said. "You need a little density to create some excitement."

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Cleveland;
Countering Suburbs' Lure

BYLINE: BY JENNIFER STOFFEL

 BODY:
NEW tax incentives have gone into effect here to encourage the building of housing to keep middle-income buyers in the city.
With the middle class moving to the suburbs, local planners have warned for decades that the city might lose 100,000 people by the year 2000 with a resulting drop in metropolitan Cleveland's tax base. Last year the city's population was 1,412,140. 
 "If someone wanted a bigger, better, newer home, they had to leave," said Terri Hamilton, the city's deputy director of community development.
The city responded last year with initiatives to provide housing for people tempted by the suburbs. The program now exempts buyers of new one-family homes from property taxes for 10 years, rather than the previous seven years. For developers of multifamily homes, the exemption is for 15 years.
There is also a $1 million program of Neighborhood Development Bonds for infrastructure improvements in new subdivisions and a new Housing Trust Fund created by the city with $1.5 million from the Federal Community Development Block Grant program to provide up to 25 percent of the financing for multifamily developments or renovation.
The Housing Construction Office, which was created last year, serves as a developers' clearinghouse, easing the permission and application processes.
The pursuit of foreclosures on vacant or abandoned tax-delinquent parcels in areas where there is residential demand has become a priority. This is to make it easier to assemble parcels in a city where there are few sizable individual lots.
Spurred on by the city's incentives, developers are now targeting small lots close to downtown. In one case, a 16-unit town-house project called Franklin Green has been built by Franklin Green Ltd. Partnership, a local investment group, on a site in the inner city just west of downtown. Nine studio to two-bedroom units have been sold at $98,500 to $124,900. The architect was David Harala of Cleveland.
With an unobstructed view of the city's skyline, each unit will be customized with such add-ons as Jacuzzis and skylights.
The 15-unit project, called Irishtown Bend, is named for a curve in the Cuyahoga River on which it sits. Construction is scheduled to begin in late spring and is expected to be completed this year.
"It's likely now that any lot within two miles of downtown will be developed over the next two years," said Keith Brown, president of Progressive Urban Real Estate, referring to the city's help. "Before, it was highly unlikely.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: The Party's Politics
The Democrats Are Spoiling the Beef;
Don't Argue With Victory

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Solarz; Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The guns had barely fallen silent in the gulf before the political artillery was rolled out here at home. Republicans, abandoning the bipartisanship that prevailed during the fighting, have begun denouncing the Democrats as the party of appeasement. A number of Democrats, unwilling to accept the clear lessons of the war, have chosen this peculiarly inappropriate moment to resuscitate the argument that we should have given sanctions more of a chance, and that because we didn't, we will never know if they would have worked.
The Republicans are correct in saying that the majority of Democrats voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force. But they fail to add that without Democratic support, the resolution would not have been adopted. In the House, a third of the Democrats, including some of the party's most influential members, such as Dante Fascell, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee; Les Aspin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee; and David McCurdy, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, voted for it. In the Senate, the resolution could not have passed without the backing of prominent Senators like Joe Lieberman, Charles Robb and Al Gore. 
 Furthermore, in perhaps the most significant statement in the two-day debate, Speaker of the House Tom Foley promised that once the decision was made, both parties would unite around it. In fact, virtually every Democrat supported the war after hostilities began.
To suggest that Democrats who opposed the use of force before Jan. 16 were appeasers is ludicrous. Would the Republicans also argue that two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and six former Defense Secretaries -- all of whom advocated that sanctions be given more time -- were also appeasers?
Moreover, the Republicans have much to answer for. Less than a week before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, half the Republicans in the House voted against sanctions on Iraq even though Baghdad had already massed 100,000 troops on its border with Kuwait and Saddam Hussein had threatened to "incinerate" half of Israel.
For all the credit that President Bush deserves for his magnificent leadership after the Iraqi invasion, the truth is that his Administration not only resisted imposing sanctions on Iraq before Aug. 2 but, by giving Mr. Hussein the impression he could invade his defenseless neighbor with impunity, made the aggression more likely.
Upon close examination, the claim of some Democrats, even after the war ended, that sanctions might have worked cannot be sustained. Before the debate in Congress, many honorable and knowledgeable Americans believed we could achieve our goals through the continued application of sanctions. Mr. Bush and the majority of Congress felt otherwise, but it was a politically and intellectually respectable position to take.
But that was before the war began. If six weeks of the most intense aerial bombardment in history was not sufficient to bring about an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, it is simply not plausible to suggest that six more months of the relatively benign application of sanctions would have done so. Even if sanctions had succeeded in bringing about a withdrawal, who can believe that Mr. Hussein, as a goodwill gesture, would have voluntarily blown up his nuclear reactors? Or dismantled his chemical and biological manufacturing facilities? Or destroyed thousands of tanks and artillery pieces? Sometimes it's best not to argue with success.
The American people can understand that before mid-January honest and legitimate differences existed over whether the sanctions could work. But if Democrats now persist in arguing that we should have stuck with sanctions, they will simply reinforce the view that the party cannot find a set of circumstances, other than a direct attack on the U.S., that would justify the use of force.
Instead of debating the merits of a lost case, the Democrats would be far better off persuading the public that they recognize there may be times when the defense of vital American interests and values requires military action. Such a strategy would be entirely compatible with the party's effort to remind Americans that our victory abroad has not lessened our obligation to address the many pressing problems we still face at home.

HEADLINE: Our Big Appliances Are Made in U.S.A.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While the basic point of "In U.S. Technology, a Gap Between Arms and VCR's" (front page, March 4) may be valid, Raytheon Corporation's major appliance business was a poor example to choose. 
 The United States major appliances industry is an example of successful international competitiveness. Of the 46 million washers, dryers, refrigerators and other major appliances marketed annually in the United States only 17 percent are imports. Why? Because producers such as Raytheon's appliance group have kept quality up and prices down, while advancing innovation. There has been no niche left for the Japanese and others to exploit.
A recent article in Productions magazine observed that a 14-cubic-foot General Electric refrigerator sold for $525 in 1927. Adjusted for inflation, that refrigerator would cost $8,100 today. Yet, a 16-cubic-foot G.E. refrigerator can be purchased today for $499.
United States defense spending may contribute to a poor competitive posture in some of our industries, but the major appliance industry is not one of them.

HEADLINE: Closing the Door on China Won't Help Anyone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The call by Robert L. Bernstein, chairman of Human Rights Watch, to break up the "Chinese Gulag" by economic reprisals and isolationism (Op-Ed, Feb. 17) is both misguided and myopic. 
 He characterizes the sentencing of two Chinese dissidents, Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, as "the ultimate demonstration of the failure of so-called quiet diplomacy." While, clearly, the world can and should raise its voice on the imprisonment and sentencing of all the people connected with the protest in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, if the objective is to achieve the release of prisoners and to increase the rights of the people of China, then the means Mr. Bernstein advocates, specifically the removal of most favored nation status for China, would be counterproductive.
I visited China last spring as part of a United States Information Agency-sponsored faculty exchange. Many of my discussions focused on the extension of China's most favored nation status and its importance to all people, both Chinese and Americans. As a registered Democrat, I am often in disagreement with the President's policies but I find myself in support of Mr. Bush's China policy.
It is ironic that the maligned quiet diplomacy is partly responsible for the exit of Fang Lizhi and his wife, as well as the release of a number of prisoners in the last year. While it was not 100 percent successful, that is not a basis to dismiss it.
China is a sovereign nation, and we must respect that. It is expected that governments will disagree over the severity of punishments. Some governments disagree with our country's use of capital punishment. The United States has engaged in acts, for example in Nicaragua, that the World Court condemned, a condemnation whose validity we have never officially acknowledged. We have engaged in a war in the Persian Gulf to protect countries with legal systems based on radically different principles from those we hold dear.
A policy of punishing Beijing on all fronts simply will not be effective. More progress can be made with China through national friendship and mutuality of interest. Clearly, there comes a time to draw a line in the sand, for example as the United States did against appeasement of the Nazis or toward South Africa, a country whose legal system implemented the servitude of a people. But this is not the time for that in China.
Isolationism has a price as well. The incalculable value of academic, cultural and high-level government exchanges will be forever lost. The hope of many Chinese people will be extinguished.
While some feel as Mr. Fang and Mr. Bernstein do, many Chinese repeated over and over to me that it was important that the West not close the door -- that is, the very contact that has opened up China and in a fundamental way changed people's expectations and perceptions.
Attention to human rights issues and maintaining trade relations are not mutually exclusive. There is a reservoir of good feeling between the Chinese and Americans dating back to at least World War II, when they faced a common enemy in the Japanese. This base can lead to economic opportunity for Chinese and Americans. Through an increased standard of living and economic freedom, individual freedom will flourish. As a valued trade partner, the United States will have more leverage to press China on human rights issues.
Moral crusades are often not as effective as pragmatic bargaining, as President Carter's boycott of the Soviet Olympics and the grain embargo showed us.

HEADLINE: Why Must Achievers Pay for Government?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jeff Faux of the Economic Policy Institute calls for a 38 percent tax bracket supposedly to suport the Persian Gulf war (Op-Ed, Feb. 19). Since the war is being fought by the young and the poor, he asks, why shouldn't the older and richer pay a higher tax? 
 Why do people like Mr. Faux think that the older and richer exist as mere victims to fulfill his tax wishes? Why is labor and effort to be rewarded with increasingly higher tax rates? Why cannot we be allowed to achieve in our jobs and pay the same rate on the last dollar of income we pay on first? Why must only the people who achieve be forced to put more money into the Washington sewer?
We have got to fight people like Mr. Faux and a Government that consumes and wastes too much of our wealth. The Government, and those parasites it serves, have become an all-consuming disease. Let us cut it down and force the parasites to work for a living.

HEADLINE: Germany Sees Sharp Slowdown

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, March 17

 BODY:
The economic boom that unity brought to western Germany is expected to slow significantly this year under the combined weight of eastern Germany's severe economic decline, recession in other industrialized nations and the cost of Germany's contribution to the Persian Gulf war.
But economists say eastern Germans' undiminished appetite for products from the west will keep western German growth well ahead of that in the United States and most European nations. 
 Still, there are signs of at least temporary changes in what is the world's fourth-largest economy. Its inflation, while low by most nations' standards, is inching higher. And rising consumer demand has brought so many imports that in January western Germany posted its first monthly current-account deficit since August 1985.
 
$800 Million Deficit
 In January, the current-account deficit of Germany, which had been the world's leading exporter, was $800 million, in contrast to a surplus of $6.8 billion a year earlier. Current account is a broad measure of trade that includes services, tourism and transportation, as well as merchandise.
Just hours after announcing the deficit, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government lowered its estimate for 1991 growth in western Germany's gross national product to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent, from more than 3 percent.
Although Germany was unified on Oct. 3, separate statistics are still kept for east and west. Eastern Germany's gross national product is expected to shrink by 20 percent from last year's level.
Gross national product measures a nation's total output of goods and services, and last year western Germany's G.N.P. grew 4.6 percent.
"The economy in united Germany will continue in 1991 to be marked by diametrically opposed development tendencies," the Government said in its spring economic report, released earlier this month. "In western Germany, strong growth and dynamic job creation will continue despite a weakening of the world's economy. In the new states, further adjustment by producers and workers will be necessary."
 
The Effect on Companies
 Western German companies like Siemens A.G., the electrical giant, or Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., which makes BMW autos, have not been hurt. The opening of eastern Germany has helped them avoid the declining sales and profits of their European and American competitors.
Eberhard von Kunheim, BMW's chairman, told reporters in January that domestic sales rose 13.3 percent in 1990, to $6.35 billion. But foreign sales stagnated, edging up three-tenths of 1 percent, to $7.93 billion. He blamed the mark's strength against the dollar and the yen for that development. "Over all, 1990 went pleasingly for BMW," he said.
Germany's sales of new cars are, in fact, propping up the entire European auto industry at the moment. New-car sales in Germany rose 39 percent in January, compared with a decline of 3.8 percent for western Europe as a whole.
Siemens, in an interim report on the first quarter of its fiscal year, credited "a strong contribution from activities in the new German states" for a 19 percent jump in domestic orders in the three-month period ended Dec. 31. Domestic sales were unchanged, however, at $4.5 billion. Siemens said that was not a disturbing development since sales had been unusually high in the year-earlier quarter.
 
Shaky Eastern Germany
 While consumer goods producers are prospering in the eastern German market, the onslaught of western business has undermined the region's already shaky economy, and Bonn has been forced to acknowledge that it underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding the area. The situation has been aggravated by Germany's unexpected expense of contributing $11 billion to the allied effort in the gulf war.
While Mr. Kohl maintains that eastern Germany's economy will be booming within five years, the current crisis has forced his Government to raise personal income taxes and most consumer taxes. Klaus-Werner Schatz, an economist at the Institute for World Economics in Kiel, Germany, predicted that those measures would also slow growth.
"The tax increases will certainly slow growth somewhat, even if it is used for investment in eastern Germany or to fund consumption there," said Mr. Schatz, who is predicting 2.5 percent G.N.P. growth at best. "Exports are running flat, and while there will be stronger demand from eastern Germany, it won't be that much higher than last year."
Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt, acknowledged the boost that eastern Germany had given western Germany's companies, but said they remained export-oriented. For 1991, he is predicting for western Germany a current-account surplus of $9.6 billion, down from $28.7 billion last year. Western Germany's trade surplus is likely to be $32.2 billion, well below 1990's surplus of $67.7 billion.
"They are dramatic declines, but I don't see them as alarming," Mr. Pietsch said. "The Americans and our European trading partners have been pushing Germany to reduce those surpluses. German exporters' strategy has always been to win and hold market share over the long term and that hasn't changed with unity. Exports are likely to begin picking up in the second half of this year, if, as I expect, the U.S. and European economies begin to expand again."

HEADLINE: DUE IN U.S., WALESA STRESSES AID NEED

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 15

 BODY:
President Lech Walesa insists that he is not coming to America with his "paws" out, but warns that Poland's economic reforms will fail if the West does not provide substantial additional assistance.
Mr. Walesa, who is to arrive on Tuesday for a six-day visit and a meeting with President Bush, said in an interview with several journalists here that without both debt relief and new investment, the economies of Eastern Europe would collapse and leave millions of refugees "at the gates of the United States." 
 "We need to escape from the Albanian threat," he declared, referring to the tens of thousands of people who have recently fled that Balkan nation for Italy.
Western governments announced on Friday that they were writing off $33 billion in Polish debts, 50 percent of the total owed to governments. While less than the 80 percent sought by Warsaw, the move gives the Polish economy an essential push forward.
 
'I Complain to Get More'
 Mr. Walesa said Poland needed both investment and technical expertise from the United States and Europe. Asked if he was satisfied with American investments so far in Poland, he replied: "I always ask for more, because I know I will get less than I am asking for. I complain to get more."
In the conversation, Mr. Walesa, the shipyard electrician who founded the independent trade federation Solidarity and rose to become his country's first popularly elected President, seemed comfortable in his new role. He moved easily between the language of high finance and the streets, at one moment speaking of the need to "smash" his political opponents, at another acknowledging with a smile that "I am not fit to be a classical president."
Mr. Walesa also sought to play down the rebuff he suffered this month from Parliament, which rejected his call for immediate elections and instead allowed former Communists to hold their seats at least until October. Parliament is still dominated by former Communists and their allies, who occupy reserved seats under a 1989 political arrangement with Solidarity.
"This can be turned into a success," he said of the Parliament vote. "Now we know who are the causers of undemocratic moves."
The goal of sweeping the former Communist elite from Government has been slowed by the lack of skilled replacements. "We will not bring people from the moon, and America is too far away," he said.
 
Constant Controversy
 Since Mr. Walesa took office Dec. 22, he has had to face constant political trouble. Immediately after he was sworn in, workers began striking and agitating for an end to the restrictions on pay rises at state-run industries. Meanwhile, Mr. Walesa's personal staff underwent several shakeups.
Within weeks, some of his key supporters in the presidential campaign criticized Mr. Walesa for not carrying out promises to accelerate political and economic changes.
Replying today, he said the process of governing had been more difficult than expected.
"I am sorry if I had to find a Prime Minister, and I had to change the government," he said. "Then this Government had to become acquainted with the matters at hand. It needs time, and so I had to accept all this dirty water pouring on me."
In his presidency as throughout his political career, Mr. Walesa has steered a zigzagging course that confounds both friends and foes. One day, he hinted on a radio call-in show that the wage restrictions should be substantially modified. But when his new committeee of advisers endorsed such a step, he immediately issued a statement supporting the current system.
 
Sowing Confusion as a Tactic
 In the interview, Mr. Walesa obliquely acknowledged that some of the political confusion he creates is deliberate, part of a larger plan to obscure his intentions as the country navigates through economically turbulent times.
"I will manage," he said. "Just don't disturb me. We have vision. We have plans."
He illustrated his style of leadership with a story from his years of hiding anti-Communist literature in his car.
"Sometimes, the biggest order can be found in a mess," he said. "Often, before 1980, I drove around with leaflets. I had an old Warszawa car, and I had a lot of spare parts in the trunk because it often broke down. Everything was dirty, greasy.
"Underneath I had my leaflets. Even if they sometimes tried to stop me, they just touched it with their hands and said, 'Yech, who would look deeper?' Therefore, the mess was the biggest security I could have, although not always, and not everywhere."

HEADLINE: Where Phone Lines Stop, Progress May Pass By

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW PARIA, Utah, March 16

 BODY:
Despite the challenges posed by rattlesnakes, dirt roads and a fickle water well, Brett Nybo likes the solitude of life in this dusty, remote hollow.
"It would be nice to have a telephone, though," Mr. Nybo, a 32-year-old carpenter, said as he sat in a rocking chair beneath a coyote trap mounted on his living room wall. "In case of emergencies, you know, it would be a handy thing to have." 
 In an age when the four corners of the world are linked by computer modems and fax machines, simple telephone service is unavailable to as many as 200,000 rural American households.
 
Taking Turns on Party Line
 Many more, who still call on the old rotary dial or wait their turn on a party line, cannot use telephone features now taken for granted in most homes and considered essential for businesses.
In isolated regions, the limitations have become especially critical in the last few years, as computers and conference calls have become standard tools of business communication.
"Many places facing these problems could meet the same fate as the ghost towns of the Old West," said Edwin Parker, a communications consultant who has written a book about problems with phone service in rural areas. "Rather than being bypassed by highways and railroads, they will have been bypassed by technology."
For Mr. Nybo and the seven other households in this hollow in southern Utah, telephone service is theoretically available. US West, which controls the regional franchise, said it would install telephones here, but the cost of extending the lines would be $130,000 -- about $16,000 per household.
"That's a little steep for my budget," Mr. Nybo said, adding that he would continue to drive his pickup truck to a pay phone alongside a county road about eight miles away.
 
States Pressing for Improvement
 In states with large rural populations, government regulators have been pressing telephone companies to upgrade old equipment that is slow and often unable to handle new technology, like push-button phones. In Colorado, for example, the state's Public Utility Commission reached an agreement with US West to make $85 million in improvements to rural telephone services, with a sharp reduction in its traditional hookup fees.
A bill pending in the Oregon Legislature would require telephone companies to provide service to households in rural and more densely populated areas at the same rate, or face the prospect of losing part of their franchise to another company.
 
Old Vice: Listening In
 For Stan and Jean Potratz, who run a mail-order business from their farm in Washington, Iowa, the scarcity of telephone lines has meant frustrated customers and lost business.
"Very few people write anymore, so we've got to be able to have enough telephone lines for our customers," said Mr. Potratz, whose business, Premier Sheep Supplies and Fence Systems, has 16 full-time workers. "When customers get a busy signal, they get very angry. The phone company says an upgraded system is on the way, and we sure hope so."
The multiparty line is a nuisance for the owners of the Fernwood Cafe and Laundry in Fernwood, Idaho, which shares service with a local tavern. "You never know how many times people call, can't get through and decide not to come," said Nellie Scheinost, the owner. "And at home, we can't use an answering machine because of the party line."
Since listening in on conversations is a vice as old as the party-line telephone, privacy is difficult to maintain. At the Calder Elementary School in rural northeastern Idaho, where 23 students are enrolled, the breach of confidentiality has caused some thorny problems.
"We'll be having a conversation with a parent about a child's behavior problem, and somebody decides it would be interesting to listen in," said Robert Leonard, the School Superintendent. "In three hours' time, that story has gone up and down the river. There's no way to keep it quiet."
In remote areas, it is often the small momand-pop telephone companies that are best equipped to reach distant customers. Unlike larger companies, these smaller concerns are eligible for subsidies from the Rural Electrification Administration, a Federal agency established in the 1930's to bring power to remote regions.
 
'To Hear That Ring'
 Telephone Utilities of Eastern Oregon, for example, used such a subsidy this year to bring telephone service to the 30 residents of Starkey, Ore.
"Now that we're connected to the outside world, I feel so alive," said Luella Bailey, a Starkey resident. "To hear that ring, and know you can talk to somebody on the other end, it's just wonderful."
But large companies do not receive Federal subsidies, so any extra costs of connecting rural households must be recovered in rates paid by all customers or through huge extension fees. The companies and the state commissions that regulate rates must balance the goal of providing universal service -- the stated goal of the Federal Communications Commission -- with the desire to maintain affordable rates for the vast majority of subscribers.
"If someone lives 25 miles from the nearest telephone pole, it might cost $25,000 to bring telephone service out there," said Ms. Thomas, of US West. "So an inevitable question comes up: Is the impact on society great enough to warrant that kind of expense?"
While poor telephone service can stunt growth for rural areas, a good system can be a boon. People who prefer to live in quiet, picturesque places far from cities can work at home with a comuter modem. In Taos County, N.M., many writers and freelance business professionals communicate with companies in faraway cities without leaving their dens at home.
"Good telephone service," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, "could be one of the most effective ways for rural America to lift itself up."
 
Hopes for Satellite Service
 Some rural officials are pinning their hopes on satellite-based communication, which could bring telephone service to some distant regions far more cheaply than traditional wiring methods. Such technology helped bring telephone service to Starkey, Ore.
To examine the role of phone service in rural economic development, the Congressional Joint Economic Committee has ordered a study of the problems and possible ways to remedy them. The study, which is to be released next month, found that better telephone service would help rural areas compete for business with metropolitan regions.
"But it's not going to be a silver bullet," said James W. Curlin, a program director at the Office of Technology Development, an investigative arm of Congress that is conducting the study.
For most people without telephones, however, the hardship runs much deeper than limits on economic development. They would just like to be able to call their friends and relatives, and keep up with the world.
"During the war with Iraq, I'd go a week without having any idea what was going on," said Dale Fausett, who recently testified at a Utah Public Service Commission hearing in Salt Lake City about life without a telephone.
But not everybody sees a telephone as a sign of progress.
Charlie Hochreiter, a 72-year-old former policeman, said he would not want a telephone, "even if you gave it to us for nothing."
"I haven't been on a telephone in 10 years," said Mr. Hochreiter, who lives here with his wife, Lorraine. "There's just no one I care to talk to that badly."

HEADLINE: MCI Discounts Expected On Numbers Called Often

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The MCI Communications Corporation is expected to announce a service today that will offer residential long-distance customers discount rates for numbers they frequently call.
William G. McGowan, chairman and chief executive of MCI, is expected to announce the "Friends and Family" plan at a news conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. 
 Analysts said the service would benefit MCI, which is locked in a battle for market share with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and U S Sprint.
"It is a good customer acquisition tool," said Frank J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst with the First Boston Corporation. People in the industry have speculated that customers who provide MCI with a list of their most frequently called numbers will receive a discount when calling some of those numbers. If the plan works this way, MCI customers will be providing the company with valuable marketing information, since companies often spend considerable sums to acquire the name, telephone number and a bit of information about a potential customer.
Analysts say additional discounts will be offered to MCI customers who persuade family members and friends to sign up for MCI's long-distance service.
While MCI executives would not disclose details of the plan, Mr. Governali said they "view this as a very, very powerful type of marketing." He added that "they think it will have a big impact." MCI officials could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Mr. Governali said MCI executives told him that the service had the potential to rival the success of MCI's Vision, a service package for small businesses that has been quite successful.
 
Important to Growth
 New products have been important to MCI's growth. "Historically, they have done a very good job in introducing new services," Mr. Governali said.
MCI maintains that its new program is designed to take advantage of its sophisticated billing systems by aiming at individual customers. Mr. Governali said that in some areas, MCI's billing system did allow for more flexibility than A.T.& T.'s.
Mark Siegel, an A.T.& T. spokesman, said, "Keep in mind, we have a far greater number of customers to deal with." He added that his company's billing system was excellent.
MCI has been trying to foster interest in the new service with a television commercial featuring Bill Parcells, the New York Giants coach.
A.T.& T. has responded with advertisements for its Select Saver calling plan, which for a small fee allows customers to make discount calls to a designated area code. The program was introduced a year ago. Mr. Siegel said that about half of an individual's long-distance calls are made to a single area code.
He added that A.T.& T.'s discount plan was sensitive to customers concerned about privacy issues. "You don't have to provide any information on your family and friends," he said.

HEADLINE: No Recession for Executive Pay

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In the midst of a recession, with layoffs rising and corporate profits weak, pay in 1990 for the nation's top executives rose by bigger percentages than the wages of any other group of salaried American workers.
Many chairmen and chief executives receive huge annual salaries, under what corporate America calls a "pay for performance" system. It is intended to make compensation rise and fall with a company's profits and stock price. Neither profits nor stock prices rose last year at hundreds of companies, but surveys show that the pay of top-echelon executives went up anyway -- by an average of 8 percent or more. 
 "If you have people getting millions of dollars in bad times as well as good, then the sensitivity of pay to performance is too low for this sort of compensation system to work properly as an incentive," said Graef S. Crystal, a management consultant and professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
The increases in executive pay came in a year when most American workers received raises of 5 percent or less, not enough to keep them abreast of inflation. Average pay for chief executives of large companies, in fact, is often 70 to 80 times greater than the annual wages of the average worker, according to data from the Labor Department and from Towers Perrin, a New York-based management consulting firm.
This gap between executives and workers has more than doubled in the last 15 years, and so has the spread between America's top executives and those in other industrial nations.
A Towers Perrin survey shows that chief executives in the United States earn almost twice as much as their counterparts in Canada and Germany, which rank second and third, respectively, in chief executive compensation. The higher American compensation reflects stock options and other special long-term incentive payments that add millions to base salaries.
The pay increases for top executives last year are just now being disclosed in the proxy statements that publicly owned corporations mail to shareholders in March and April. Although the data will not be fully available until next month, several surveys by management consulting firms indicate that while cash salaries and bonuses went up by 5.5 to 7 percent in 1990 -- compared with double-digit increases in the late 1980's -- the long-term incentive portion brought the increase in total compensation to 8 percent or more last year.
That was roughly the raise for chief executives at 176 big corporations surveyed by Stephen F. O'Byrne, who tracks executive pay practices at Towers Perrin. The median compensation, which was $1.6 million in 1989, rose to more than $1.7 million in 1990, Mr. O'Byrne estimated.
Such findings, in a recession year, prompted Peter T. Chingos, head of compensation practices at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, to tell corporate clients in a recent newsletter, "We are beginning to hear from some circles a growing concern over high compensation without any commensurate risk element for underperformance."
Mr. Chingos said a Peat Marwick survey of large companies showed that executive pay in 1990 rose by more than 15 percent on average from 1989's levels. "The top of the house -- the 15 to 20 highest officers -- clearly got 15 percent more," he said, "and the senior management -- the highest 100 people in a company -- clearly exceeded the inflation rate."
Incentive pay is mostly stock options, which give executives a right to purchase their company's shares over a 10-year period at roughly the price of the stock on the day the options are granted. If an executive is granted the right to buy company stock at an "exercise" price of $10 a share, for example, and it rises to $12, the compensation from the option is $2.
 
Long-Term Compensation
 Some executives clearly did better than others last year. Robert E. Allen, A.T.& T.'s chairman and chief executive, for example, received $2.02 million in salary and bonus, or 15.9 percent more than his 1989 cash pay. But the $536,577 salary and bonus that went to Don V. Fites, chairman and chief executive at Caterpillar Inc., represented only a 3.1 percent rise from 1989. Neither company's net income rose last year, and their stock prices declined.
Both men, however, got big stock-option awards, reflecting a trend that has made long-term compensation, consisting mostly of stock options, an ever larger portion of total pay.
The problem is how to value the options. Mr. Fites, for example, got options last year to buy 20,000 shares of common stock, compared with 12,000 in 1989 and 7,800 in 1988. But the total of 39,800 options carry an average exercise price of nearly $63 a share today, or nearly $10 more than Friday's closing price. That means Mr. Fites is "under water" -- he can make money only if the stock price rises above $63 a share. He will be able to cash in the options for $39,800, for example, for each dollar that Caterpillar's stock exceeds $63 a share.
"Many companies out there have underwater stock options that are really wallpaper today," Mr. Chingos said. But he and other experts in executive compensation do not emphasize the short term; they talk instead of the value of an option over its 10-year life. And over a decade, "if a company is reasonably successful, its stock price is likely to appreciate at what amounts to a 10 percent annual rate," Mr. Chingos said.
For Prof. Kevin J. Murphy, a compensation expert at the University of Rochester, such increases mean that the "recession does not seem to have inhibited stock option awards."
 
A Different Measure
 Mr. Allen of A.T.& T. illustrates the trend. He received 44,898 stock options early in 1990 at an exercise price of $45.94 a share. Those options are temporarily valueless; the stock of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company closed on Friday at $33.75 a share.
But Mr. Murphy and other compensation experts measure the trend in a different manner. They note that Mr. Allen's 44,898 options, when multiplied by $45.94, represent an "option grant equivalent" of $2.06 million. Enough options were issued, in sum, to more than equal Mr. Allen's $2.02 million salary.
A decade ago, the option grant equivalent was roughly 50 percent of base pay and bonus; now the rule of thumb is to grant enough options each year to exceed the cash portion, according to a Towers Perrin survey of 325 large companies. Other surveys confirm the trend.
The justification for a pay-for-performance system rests largely on the view that the chief executive and a few other top officers are called on to make decisions that risk the future of their company, and their jobs. Mr. Allen, for example, earned his raise because he was successful in advancing a key company strategy, to substantially increase A.T.& T.'s sales abroad, said Richard A. Gray, a company spokesman. Directing such risky strategies requires high pay to attract qualified executives.
"Corporate America operates by the John Wayne school of management," said Alan M. Johnson, managing director of executive pay practices at Handy Associates, a consulting firm. "There are one or two powerful guys at the top who have the power to bet the company on a new project or a huge investment, and that requires John Wayne-type pay. The Germans and Japanese, by contrast, run companies collegially, spreading the responsibility around among top managers."
Still, when a company's stock price falls and stays down, some boards reward the chief executive anyway. They do so by rewriting an executive's options to reduce the exercise price and thus increase the options' value. In a study issued last month, Peat Marwick reported that such revisions had been made at 28 companies, which it did not name.
"In situations where options were granted to management teams over the last five years and they are worthless, some boards say, 'We are going to clean the slate and go forward with a new program,' " Mr. Chingos said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Quick Kuwaiti Recovery Is Seen, With the Cost Less Than Thought

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, March 17

 BODY:
Kuwait's economy, far and away the strongest among the oil-producing countries before the Iraqi invasion in August put it into a coma, is expected to revive and move back to boom times within two years, say many economic and financial experts on the region.
In scores of interviews here in the last week, Kuwaiti, American and Western financial specialists, including business executives and economic planners, estimated that the cost of reviving the emirate's economy, including the devastated oil industry, would be far less than earlier estimates. 
 With Kuwait holding about $80 billion in financial reserves abroad, it is more than capable of getting back on a sound economic development track, these specialists say.
 
'Catastophic but Not Fatal'
 "There is no economy now," said Wynne Fuller, who heads the emergency operations division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers here. "We are looking to two to five years to re-establish an economy that resembles what the Kuwaitis used to have."
The Corps of Engineers is to evaluate the damage to the Kuwaiti economy and begin a repair program.
"When all is said and done," Mr. Fuller said, "what you have here is catastrophic but not fatal. The only way I can compare this is to Hurricane Hugo in the States, which cost $4 to $5 billion to repair. So you are looking here at $5 to $10 billion outside the oil sector."
Other officials, including the country's Finance Minister, Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, estimated the cost of reviving the oil industry, sabotaged by Iraqi occupation troops, at $10 billion to $20 billion.
 
Fires Halt Oil Industry
 These new and more authoritative estimates are far below others advanced over the last few weeks by a variety of foreign experts living outside Kuwait. Some had suggested that Kuwait's revival might cost as much as $100 billion.
The latest estimates also reflect the growing appreciation here that the damage to Kuwait's roads, power stations, stores, banks and hotels, while substantial, can be repaired through cleaning and patching on a huge scale rather than major reconstruction. Even that work will require skills and coordination that Kuwait cannot muster alone.
The oil industry, source of most of the country's revenue, has been brought to a halt by fires set in most oil wells and refineries. The country's commercial and business centers have been destroyed or looted, immobilizing what was once the Middle East's most active system of private enterprise.
There is no Kuwaiti currency: the Kuwaiti dinar has no fixed value and the Central Bank and other banks have yet to tell people what will happen to their savings or to find records of millions of accounts.
 
Free Food and Gasoline
 For now, people living here are getting free food and gasoline. But no salaries are being paid, and a large-scale review of employment records, with a view to eliminating foreign workers like the Palestinians, has yet to get under way.
A variety of currencies, including United States dollars and Saudi rials, are preferred to the Kuwaiti dinar, which is to be replaced with a new one whose exchange rate has yet to be established by the Central Bank.
Yet with the approximately $80 billion in financial reserves held outside the country and with the help of many foreign construction companies, there seems little doubt that the Kuwaiti economy will start rolling again.
"I am very confident about the fact that we will have a boom here," said Michel Shalhoub, a French businessman of Lebanese origin who operated a franchise business selling luxury items from Western companies like Du Pont, Chanel and Lacoste.
Mr. Shalhoub was directing workers repairing two of his shops in the lobbies of what used to be luxury hotels.
"My personal losses are typical," he said. "We had seven stores in Kuwait which were all looted. We salvaged some of the goods in storage facilities. Altogether, I would say our losses are about $6 million, or about 30 million French francs, which represents one-third of my assets here and the equivalent of five years of profits."
Mr. Shalhoub said Kuwaitis would need, and could afford, to buy millions of consumer goods to replace what they lost, including luxury items.
"Before too long, people will be buying freezers, air-conditioners, furniture, carpeting," he said. "It will be even bigger than before because those people who kept much of their money outside Kuwait for fear of things just like the Iraqi invasion now know for sure that this country is 100 percent secure and that it will be protected by the West's best armies and a reliable defense alliance to preserve its integrity and freedom."
 
Workers' Future Debated
 Before anything that resembles a big economic takeoff can take place, however, the Government must get people back to their jobs, a task that is complicated by some political imperatives dictated by the Persian Gulf crisis.
On the 16th floor of the Industrial Bank here, the chairman, Saleh M. al-Youssef, met over the weekend with his top advisers to determine how they will call their employees back to work, given the Government's edict that expatriates from countries that sided with Iraq must be dismissed.
While the bank's officials have decided to call back their employees this week, other important offices, like the Ministries of Defense, Interior, Information, Oil and Finance, have not yet figured out how to resume operations without many of the foreigners.
"We will decide on a common policy," Mr. Youssef said in an interview. "There are employees we do not wish to keep. They include Palestinians, Yemenites and Sudanese. We will give them their due, of course, but their departure is a political decision. I think the idea is to put pressure on the Palestine Liberation Organization."
There is little doubt that ridding major institutions of thousands of Palestinians will be disruptive to the economic reconstruction of Kuwait. But there is also no doubt of the Government's determination to make sure they go.
 
Change of Attitude Needed
 The magnitude of the problem is evident in the makeup of the Kuwaiti population before the occupation. Of two million or so people living here, only 700,000 were Kuwaitis while the others were expatriates, including about 450,000 Palestinians. These did jobs like running hotels, keeping books, repairing cars and working the night shifts.
The country's Planning Minister, Suleiman al-Mutawa, said it was necessary for Kuwaitis to undergo a transformation in attitude, divorcing themselves of the notion that they work only as managers or state employees collecting large salaries with others doing the work.
In the process, Kuwait will have to do away with the whole structure of a sort of welfare state based on prosperity that it has become used to.
"I think there will be a review of all our policies based on what happened on Aug. 2," Mr. Mutawa said. "The questions that have been flushed to the surface are where we can keep expatriates and where we cannot."
"Many of these expatriates have no genuine interest in Kuwait and have, therefore, collaborated with the Iraqis," he continued. "In vital sectors, we may pick up some of the cost overruns to pay Kuwaitis to do those jobs they will not do for the same low salaries that expatriates accept. This is where Government subsidies should go into the private sector to encourage them to hire Kuwaitis instead of expatriates."
"The bottom line," Mr. Mutawa said, "is that the welfare state was mother and grandmother, and when you have that waiting for you at home, you tend to become very spoiled."
 
Records Need to Be Found
 Then there is the problem of activating the banks and circulating the new Kuwaiti currency. The Government says it has printed notes, but it is far from clear how the money will be distributed and on what basis.
Bankers said they understood that Government policy will be to consider that everything in Kuwait will revert to where it stood on Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi invasion. That means that people who held bank accounts then will preserve the value of their money. But the problem is how to locate bank records and find enough employees to carry the policy out.
"What about all the Iraqi money we had to deal with?" asked a merchant who asked not to be identified. "I sold much of my stuff to Iraqis because I had no choice. Does this mean that when I go to give them the Iraqi money, they will not give me Kuwaiti money in return? What happens to the values of the goods I sold?"
For the moment, the entrepreneurs of Kuwait have not yet returned from exile and there are still 400,000 Kuwaitis out of the country. Much of the repair work is being done by foreign companies contracted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
Mr. Fuller said the corps had already given out seven contracts totaling $46 million. The contracts are for repairs to buildings, roads, electric cables and sanitation.
 
Where Contracts Go
 They have gone to non-Kuwaiti companies, including Shand of Britain, al Harbi of Saudi Arabia and several United States companies, including Blount, American Dredging Company and Brown & Root.
In addition, contracts worth tens of millions of dollars have been given to firefighting companies, largely American, that are preparing to put out fires at an estimated 600 oil wells.
But to get the emirate's economy rolling, Government spending will have to be directed at Kuwaiti companies in the building and rehabilitation business and this cannot begin until the banks are back in business and the Kuwaitis start to return home.
Along with debt, there are fears of inflation. Before the invasion, the inflation rate in Kuwait was kept at low levels -- 1 to 2 percent. With reconstruction, there are fears that political pressure will force the Government to abandon caution and cause inflation to rise to unacceptable levels.
"Economically, we can do it," said Sheik Ali, the Finance Minister. "But how to do it in the most efficient way is the difficulty. There are political considerations that may blow away the spending plans which are cautiously structured."
 
Un Unknown Quantity
 Then there is the matter of political stability, an unknown quantity that could presumably influence economic recovery.
Last week, there was unhappiness here when the Government said it would not be able to restore electricity for three more weeks. Many people asked that the Government abandon its slow reconstruction plans and rush to import thousands of generators to supply homes.
"We need patience, but I can understand that people have suffered too much and do not have much patience to give," the Planning Minister, Mr. Mutawa, said. "The period of crossing from disaster to recovery is going to be a difficult one."

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO REVIVE CREDITS FOR ARMS EXPORTS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is asking Congress to authorize a Government agency to underwrite sales of military goods for the first time since the 1970's.
After a long and divisive internal debate, the White House came down on the side of American military contractors, whose business has been lagging because of American plans to reduce the size of the armed forces. 
 The proposal comes at a time when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other members of the Administration have been trying to limit the rearmament of the Middle East in the wake of the Persian Gulf war.
Administration officials insist the two efforts are not at counterpurposes.
 
Could Include Third World
 The legislation would establish a pilot program that would guarantee up to $1 billion in commercial bank loans to overseas buyers of military products. The sales are expected to be made largely to members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to Japan, Israel and Australia. Should the President determine it is in the national interest, the program would also be available for "any other country," which would include the third world.
Backers say the proposal, which the Administration sent to Capitol Hill last week, would merely level the playing field with America's main industrial competitors, most of which have export credit agencies that finance military sales.
A State Department official, who insisted on anonymity, said the proposal is "a strictly commercial operation and is to be used only to counter subsidized credit packages from competing countries, like France."
But opponents of the proposal say that by diverting resources that should be concentrated on nonmilitary exports, the program will hurt American competitiveness and encourage poorer countries to spend more money on arms. America's competitiveness will suffer, they say, because there is less of a ripple effect through the economy from arms sales than from, say, advances in consumer electronics.
 
'Very Wrongheaded'
 Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Matters, called the proposal "very wrongheaded." Arms sales, he said, are "by their very nature noncommercial and political."
In 1989, the last year for which statistics are available, the United States sold about $10.8 billion worth of major conventional weapons systems abroad. The bulk of these sales went to American allies in NATO.
The Administration's request that the Export-Import Bank, a Government agency, underwrite the arms sales promises to be hotly debated in Congress. A Pentagon-administered military credit guarantee program was suspended in the late 1970's after too many customers went into arrears.
With the President's backing, the proposal is expected to pass the Senate. But it will run into stiffer opposition in the House, and at this stage, its fate there cannot be determined.
Even within the Administration, the proposal produced a debate before the White House decided to proceed. The State Department and the Pentagon supported the change. The principal objections came from some executives of the Export-Import Bank.
The bank was founded 56 years ago to stimulate trade by providing financing to overseas buyers of American goods at below-market rates. Since 1974, it has had policy of financing only nonmilitary exports.
 
Would Rescind Ban
 The Administration's proposal would rescind Section 32 of the Arms Export Control Act of 1968, which was enacted after widespread use of the agency as an instrument of "backdoor financing" of military sales to Southeast Asian nations during the Vietnam buildup. Section 32 bans the use of Export-Import Bank financing of military sales to developing countries. The White House has proposed that the Export-Import Bank guarantee up to $1 billion of commercial bank loans to the overseas customers of American military contractors.
Such a sweeping expansion in the scope of Government credit activities for military exports has been vigorously promoted by large military contractors like the United Technologies Corporation, the Raytheon Company and the Martin Marietta Corporation, and the White House has now decided to go along.
After that decision was made, John D. Macomber, president of the export agency and a friend of President Bush, offered this explanation: "The central point is that we're going through very difficult times in this country for defense industries. The basic motivation behind this is that the Government recognizes there are some real economic adjustment problems for these companies to go through, and this would be a way for the Government to be of some help." He was referring to the budget cutbacks of the last two years.
Representative Jim Moody, another Wisconsin Democrat, is seeking legislators' signatures on a letter to Secretary Baker, warning that the initiative is "likely to cost the taxpayer dearly" and is a "rather transparent attempt to circumvent the budgetary limitations" of the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program.
This program is the main military assistance effort under which the Pentagon in the next fiscal year plans to spend nearly $5 billion in grants and low-interest loans to American allies. Although 50 countries are on the list of recipients, half goes to two, Israel and Egypt.
 
Opposition From Industry
 The Administration has also been seeking to limit strategic arms in talks with the Soviet Union, and it has proposed restrictions on the sale of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons technology to the third world. The Administration proposal has divided the export community. Most companies whose earnings are primarily from military sales back the proposal. Others, like the Boeing Company and the General Electric Company, which have some military business but far larger nonmilitary operations, have reservations.
They worry about the crowding out of scarce credit resources, the possibility that separate divisions within companies may have to compete for Export-Import Bank money and an undercutting of political support for the bank if it becomes too strongly identified with military programs.
"Boeing recognizes financing support is required for the export of defense products," said John F. Hayden, the company's corporate vice president. "But we question the appropriateness of involving Ex-Im Bank as the mechanism."
He noted that since "defense products exports are not simply commercial transactions, but involve foreign policy and national security, Boeing feels the Department of State may be the appropriate agency to administer a defense-products export-financing program."
Willard M. Berry, vice president for Congressional affairs at the National Foreign Trade Council, said that before Congress takes up the proposal, "it is in the interest of all concerned to insure that all alternatives are explored and the pros and cons of each are fully debated."
William F. Paul, senior vice president of United Technologies, said that because the United States could not provide competitive credit terms, his company lost a big Brazilian military helicopter contract to France's Aerospatiale in 1988.
"We need a mechanism for financing this kind of defense trade when it's necessary," Mr. Paul said. "Our competitors have access to this sort of facility, and we desperately need it ourselves."
Largely through the efforts of Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, United Technologies, based in Hartford, won legislation last year specifically authorizing the export credit agency, on a one-time basis, to provide loan guarantees for a bid to produce 200 military helicopters jointly with Turkey. United Technologies is competing with French and Italian companies.
 
Some Risks Involved
 But opponents of the proposal say the Export-Import Bank should not be used to assume the risks of financing military exports and taking the risk of political backlash.
Albert H. Hamilton, a former government affairs manager for the bank and now senior associate of First Washington Associates, an Arlington, Va., consulting firm, said export credit agencies of other countries have gotten into serious polticial and financial difficulties by supporting exports of military equipment.
One example is the British agency's backing of military sales to the Kwame Nkrumah Government in Ghana. When that Goverment changed in 1966, its successor sought to repudiate the arms-related debt.
The new legislative proposal may explain why President Bush during his visit to Ottawa on Wednesday was cool to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's proposals to curb arms sales.
The President said at a new conference that the destruction of Iraq's military threat gave him hope that there would not be increasing arms sales in the Middle East. But he added: "That doesn't mean we're going to refuse to sell anything to everybody. We're not going to cut off all weapons sales."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
P.R. All-Stars Join Baseball Contest

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Every fan knows that pitching is crucial in baseball. But making the right pitch is even more important before a team exists.
With Major League Baseball set to name two new expansion teams for the National League, the six metropolitan areas vying for the franchises are waging a battle of hype and hoopla. In their effort to cajole the sport's current owners, who will decide where the new teams will play, most of the competitors have hired professional image-makers to prove that their grass is greener, their hot dogs tastier and their broadcast markets larger than the competition's. 
 The contest amply demonstrates the influence of public relations firms in the conduct of American business and the contours of contemporary life. The firms involved in baseball's expansion drive have worked on activities typically associated with their craft, like arranging articles in national publications and creating promotional videotapes.
 
Important 'Road Map'
 But their efforts have also included designing logos, writing scripts for local politicians, stage-managing the cities' presentations to baseball officials, recruiting celebrity endorsements and organizing rallies and season ticket drives for nonexistent teams to demonstrate public support.
"Obviously, the parameters set by the National League and its expansion committee are the most important road map anyone has to follow to win a franchise," said Andy Dolich, vice president of business operations for the Oakland Athletics, who also teaches sports marketing at the University of California at Berkeley. "Trying to determine what additional factors go into the decision is what this is all about. It's like the advertisement for Rolling Stone magazine. It's making perception a reality."
Four of the six finalists -- in Washington, Denver, Buffalo and Miami-Fort Lauderdale -- have each hired one of the largest public relations firms. A fifth, Orlando, Fla., has received help from a master of popular imagery, the Walt Disney Company.
Only the sixth finalist, Tampa-St. Petersburg, has relied on local advisers. But the franchise's lead image strategist, Bob Rose, previously served as marketing director for the United States Football League and for the St. Louis (now Phoenix) Cardinals football team.
For the contestants, fielding their dreams does not come cheap. The would-be owners are each spending from $500,000 to $1 million on their campaigns, estimated Robert E. Hope, an executive vice president at Burson-Marsteller, the world's third-largest public relations agency, which represents Miami-Fort Lauderdale. The two winners may spend another $130 million each on stadiums, salaries, promotions and franchise fees before their teams begin to play ball in 1993.
Last June, after several years of planning, the National League announced that it would accept applications from those interested in owning baseball's two newest teams. Eighteen ownership groups in 10 metropolitan areas sent in applications.
Each group gave a half-hour presentation to the league's expansion committee last September. The committee chose the six finalists in December. Since then, the committee has been visiting the areas and weighing their plans. Based on its recommendations, baseball's 26 owners will decide the winning franchises before the end of September.
 
No Specific Criteria
 The National League has remained vague about what it wants.
"We don't have specific criteria," said Katy Feeney, a spokeswoman for the National League. "We wanted strong, financially stable ownership. There was a lot of concern that the lead partner have some commitment to the area and that the community wants a baseball team. We said we'd obviously look at demographics and the media market."
While the competing groups' efforts largely involved the packaging of financial and demographic data about themselves and their areas, the public relations experts say they knew as well as any baseball fan that statistics are only half the story.
"It's a very interesting public relations situation," said Peter Fleischer, a vice president at Hill & Knowlton, which was hired to help lift the Buffalo Bisons from the minor leagues to the majors. "Normally in P.R., you're trying to influence millions of people. Here the audience is much smaller -- you're trying to communicate to the owners of Major League Baseball."
Melinda Rich, the Bisons' executive vice president, said the agency's primary job was convincing journalists, whose stories could affect the owners' perceptions, that Buffalo could support a major league team.
"In 1985, when we first presented our case to baseball, the media laughed at us," she recalled, "Hill & Knowlton helped us break down the misconceptions about Buffalo."
Hill & Knowlton is the second-largest public relations agency, after Shandwick P.L.C. of Britain.
For Denver, which had been trying to lure a big-league team for a decade and was considered an early favorite, the presentation proved crucial. In August, the lead partner in the city's baseball group dropped out because of troubles in his real estate business. Business and government officials scrambled to assemble a new group, which retained Cohn & Wolfe, the 14th-largest public relations agency and an autonomous subsidiary of Burson-Marsteller, to organize a presentation to show that the city's temporary problems paled beside its overall strengths.
The agency helped the new group position the franchise as a team for the entire Rocky Mountain time zone rather than for Denver alone, said Steven E. Ehrhart, the president of the franchise group, Colorado Baseball Partners.
A graphic designer retained by Cohn & Wolfe created the unnamed team's logo, and the agency wrote speeches for the presentation, including those given by Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado and Mayor Federico Pena of Denver. The agency also produced the promotional videotape and the slick information book left with the expansion committee's members.
The six finalists' promotional tapes, which were made to be left with expansion committee members, all followed the same general format, celebrating each area's residents, baseball tradition, love of sports, would-be baseball stadium and hopeful team owner.
 
Disney's Production
 The promotional video for Orlando was produced by Disney, which also donated hotel rooms at Disney World for committee members when they came to inspect the city two weeks ago, said Pat Williams, the president of the Orlando Magic basketball team, who is running the campaign to bring baseball to town. Orlando's franchise group, led by Richard M. DeVos, the president of the Amway Corporation, hopes to turn the city's minor league franchise, the Sunrays, into a major league team.
With the Miami-Fort Lauderdale group, or South Florida, as it is called, Burson-Marsteller hopes to establish the credentials of Mr. Huizenga, the Blockbuster chairman, to own a team. Unlike others chasing franchises, Mr. Huizenga was little known to baseball executives.
Mr. Hope, a former marketing executive for the Atlanta Braves, brought Mr. Huizenga together with Paul Bortz, a sports-broadcast analyst in Denver, and Steve Mat, a consultant with Arthur Andersen & Company in Dallas who does financial analyses for sports franchises.
"From the league's standpoint, they like to see you've got the right people," said Mr. Hope, who previously helped Charlotte, N.C., get a National Basketball Association team and Ottawa a hockey franchise. "It's proof in the process that you're a serious contender."
To demonstrate local support for baseball, Burson's Miami office is also working to fill Joe Robbie Stadium, where the South Florida team would play, on March 30 and 31 when the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles are scheduled to play two exhibition games. The agency's radio advertisements for the games feature Mel Allen, the Yankees' legendary former radio announcer.
Fleishman-Hillard, the seventh-largest public relations firm, has also concentrated on showcasing public support for baseball in Washington, where low attendance forced the Washington Senators to depart the city twice. The agency is arranging a season-ticket drive for the would-be team, whose lead partner is John (Chip) Akridge, a local developer.
Whether any of the public relations efforts will help is unclear. Prof. Gerald W. Scully, a University of Texas economist and the author of "The Business of Major League Baseball," said that while Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Tampa-St. Petersburg were the best expansion markets because of their size and demographics, pure politics could influence the decision.
A team in Washington could be the price for Congressional support if baseball, for instance, wanted to shift some its games to pay-per-view television, Professor Scully said.

HEADLINE: Seven Minutes In Los Angeles - A special report.;
Videotaped Beating by Officers Puts Full Glare on Brutality Issue

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; The following article is based on reporting by Seth Mydans, Richard W. Stevenson and Timothy Egan and was written by Mr. Mydans.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 17

 BODY:
Since it was first broadcast on local television, the videotape of a black man being beaten and kicked for nearly two minutes by a group of white police officers has shamed the city and outraged minority residents who have insisted for years that they are targets of an abusive police force.
Two weeks after it occurred, the beating has pushed the issue of police brutality to the forefront of the criminal justice debate. Local and Federal law-enforcement agencies have opened investigations to determine whether indeed there is a pattern of police brutality, not only in Los Angeles but around the country. 
 Four police officers have been indicted for the beating of Rodney G. King on March 3, and a grand jury is considering indictments against other officers present at the beating.
 
Chief's Views Are Questioned
 A number of points have contributed to the sense among people both in and out of law enforcement circles that the beating was far from the aberration claimed by Chief Daryl F. Gates of the Los Angeles Police Department, including these:
*In the seven-minute videotape, although 11 officers are shown standing by during the beating by three patrolmen under the eye of a sergeant, none makes a serious effort to stop it. And no one moves to care for Mr. King after he is hogtied, dragged to the side of the road and left bleeding until an ambulance arrives five minutes later.
*The beating is carried out with impunity, with no evident concern that, barely 60 feet away, up to 20 local residents are watching, some shouting, "No, don't kill him!," or that the officers are acting in full view of people in cars that drive slowly by.
*Nearly two-thirds of the people questioned in a Los Angeles Times poll published March 10, including a majority of whites, said they believed that police brutality was common here.
*Court records depict a history of similar cases in Los Angeles, some of which seem to differ from the beating of Mr. King primarily in that there was no camera to record them.
"This is going to be the defining incident in police brutality; it's going to be the historical event for police in our time," said Jerome Skolnick, professor of law and sociology at University of California at Berkeley who is an expert on police behavior. "It is highly unlikely that this is unrepresentative of Los Angeles police. Two people can go crazy, but if you have 10 or 12 people watching them and not doing anything, this tells you that this is a normal thing for them."
Although several national organizations, including the National Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Foundation in Washington, monitor law-enforcement issues and compile statistics on police practices, none keep complete statistics on complaints against the police by citizens. Many large cities rely on their police departments' own internal affairs units to take such complaints and to compile statistics about them.
For all the details captured by the video camera in Los Angeles, several questions remain about what exactly set off the beating. Police and witness accounts of the moments after the chase ended and the beating began are in conflict, with the police accusing the motorist of resisting arrest. And there is no evidence of anything that might have been said to spark the outburst.
No matter what actions Mr. King might have taken before the video camera was switched on, there was a widespread feeling here that nothing he did or said could justify the beating he received from the three patrolmen under the supervision of a sergeant.
Mayor Tom Bradley, who has condemned the beating as reprehensible, said, "The three officers, clearly with the use of their batons and with their feet, left no doubt in anybody's mind about the charges that should be levied against them."
 
The Chase
A Drive Ends In a Nightmare
 Shortly before 12:30 A.M. on Sunday, March 3, Mr. King was driving fast down the Foothill Freeway near San Fernando, at the northern edge of Los Angeles. With him in his white 1988 Hyundai sedan were two friends, Bryant Allen and Freddie Helms.
Mr. King, a 25-year-old unemployed construction worker with two children, had been released last December after serving six months of a two-year sentence for second-degree robbery; brandishing a tire iron, he had taken cash from a grocer. He was still on parole.
In a California Highway Patrol car, a husband-and-wife team, Officers T. J. and Melanie Singer, reported to their headquarters that the Hyundai approached them from behind at 110 or 115 miles an hour, a Highway Patrol spokesman, Sgt. Mike Brey, said later.
Although a number of press reports have asserted that the small car cannot reach such speeds, Sergeant Brey said that at the time it would have been traveling downhill.
When Mr. King was released from jail without charges on March 6, he told reporters: "There was no chase. I may have been speeding just a little bit."
An audio tape of police radio conversations, released last Friday, picks up the chase after the Highway Patrol called in the Los Angeles police when Mr. King's car left the freeway. A police helicopter was also called in.
Then, the tape shows, he led his pursuers in a circle through a darkened neighborhood at about 55 m.p.h. in a 40 m.p.h. zone. "Vehicle stopped at red light but failed to yield to police," a radio transmission from a pursuing car said. Based on the statements of Sergeant Brey and a review of the audio tape, it appears that the pursuing officers did not know that Mr. King had a criminal record.
 
The Beating
Awakening To Commotion
At about 12:45 A.M., Mr. King pulled over and stopped on Foothill Boulevard, a four-lane street running through Lake View Terrace, a middle-class, mixed-race neighborhood that is fairly sparsely settled. At least 15 officers in patrol cars converged on him.
In what other police officers called a chance deployment, all the pursuing officers were white. The force is 14 percent black.
The wailing sirens and the thunderous roar of the helicopter awakened many residents of an apartment complex across the street. Josie Morales, a 26-year-old service representative for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, looked out her second-floor bedroom window and saw the Hyundai and police cars pulling up behind it. Mrs. Morales said she and her husband, Heriberto, put on robes and walked onto their balcony before the police or Mr. King got out of their cars.
Mrs. Morales said she heard a muffled command from one police car. Mr. King, she said, got out of his car with his hands up, turned and put his hands on the roof. Then, she and other witnesses said, he knelt, then lay on his stomach, with three or four officers standing in a semicircle around him.
 
Here, Accounts Differ
 There are contradictory accounts of what happened next. Richard Talkington, a Los Angeles police detective, said the report filed by the officers on the scene said Mr. King tried to stand up while being handcuffed, causing one officer to fall.
Detective Talkington, who said he had reviewed the report as part of the routine initial inquiry, said the officers also reported that Mr. King had reached into his pants pocket, presumably raising concern that he might have a weapon.
According to the detective's account, the report said that Mr. King, after standing up, charged at the officers and kicked and swung at them. The full police report has not been released.
Mrs. Morales and other witnesses said they did not see Mr. King reach into his pocket, knock over an officer or charge at the officers. But one other resident of the apartment complex, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she saw a brief scuffle.
Mr. King said that after lying down he was handcuffed and got an electrical shock from "some kind of device."
"After they shocked me the first time, they paused for a minute and then they struck me across the face real hard with a billy club," Mr. King said. "I was lying face down with my hands tied, and they shocked me again on the other side of my shoulder."
 
The Videotape
Illuminated By Headlights
 A minute or two after Mr. King got out of his car and lay down, another resident of the apartment complex went onto his balcony. George Holliday, a 31-year-old manager of a plumbing-supply business, was carrying his new Sony video camera. He started shooting the scene unfolding across the street, which was illuminated by street lights and police car headlights.
The opening seconds of the videotape show Mr. King leaping up, spinning to his right and taking one or two quick steps. He was not handcuffed or tied, and it cannot be determined whether he had yet been beaten.
A close viewing of the unedited seven-minute videotape -- spanning the time from Mr. King's abrupt motion to a point where he lies handcuffed, hogtied and bleeding at the side of the road -- shows one officer swinging his nightstick at Mr. King like a baseball bat as he rose and turned. Mr. King fell to the ground.
The tape blurs for several seconds. When the focus is restored, one officer is seen striking Mr. King repeatedly around the head and shoulders.
At that point, the tape shows one officer holding a Taser stun gun that has been fired at Mr. King, although it remains unclear whether the gun was fired before or after the videotaping began. A Taser (the name is a loose acronym for "Tom Swift's Electric Rifle") shoots two barbed darts that deliver an electric shock to immobilize a suspect. The darts remain connected to the gun by a wire, which is visible on the tape throughout the beating.
 
Wires Still Attached
 The videotape shows two officers beating Mr. King ferociously for just under two minutes. A third officer joined in from time to time to kick or hit Mr. King. The officer with the Taser paced about 10 feet away, keeping the wire leading to the darts from getting tangled as Mr. King spun and rolled under the force of the blows.
Later, Mr. King showed journalists a bruise on his right side that he said was caused by the Taser darts and the shocks. Los Angeles police regulations say the darts should be removed only after the suspect has been restrained.
The soundtrack is dominated by the roar of the helicopter. But a voice can be heard repeatedly screaming "Stop!" As the beating nears an end, one of the officers seems to be yelling at Mr. King. The sound quality is poor, but it sounds as if he is saying, "Hands behind your back" as Mr. King is struck repeatedly.
At one point Mr. King, lying face down, moves his arms as if to put his hands behind his back. An officer stomps on his head or neck, causing him to jerk his arms up to his head.
The use of the nightsticks and Taser guns are regulated by the department's "use of force" rules, which permit their use only when all other reasonable means of subduing a suspect have been exhausted, or when a suspect poses a danger.
Only once on the videotape did any officer try to intervene. One officer briefly raised his left arm in front of a nightstick-swinging colleague in the opening moments of the videotape. But the gesture had no discernible effect. There appear to have been 15 law-enforcement officers and at least six patrol cars on the scene. Two cars and at least three officers were from the Highway Patrol.
Witnesses said about 20 residents were on their balconies or gathered along the metal fence separating the street from the apartment complex.
"We were yelling, 'No, don't kill him!' " said Elois Camp, a 65-year-old retired teacher who watched from the porch of her first-floor apartment. "They paid us no attention."
 
Dragged Away, to Wait
 The officers made no apparent attempt to conceal or stop the beating, despite the presence of so many witnesses and at least three passing cars, one of which slowed almost to a stop.
The beating ended just under two minutes into the videotape, when one officer grabbed Mr. King's arms and handcuffed his hands behind his back. Half a dozen officers circled around him, and one apparently pulled out the Taser darts. He was then hogtied -- his cuffed hands lashed to his ankles behind his back -- and dragged face down to the side of the street, where he was left alone.
The rest of the videotape shows the officers milling around, moving their cars off the street, searching Mr. King's car and patting down a passenger, either Mr. Helms or Mr. Allen. The tape ends with Mr. King still lying by the road.
Witnesses said about five minutes elapsed after the beating before an ambulance came. They said Mr. King was still hogtied and handcuffed when he was loaded on the stretcher.
After the ambulance left, witnesses said, the police freed Mr. Allen and Mr. Helms, who walked to where many residents were still gathered, asked where they could find a pay phone, then walked down the street. Neither Mr. Allen nor Mr. Helms has been charged; their lawyers would not permit them to be interviewed.
Mr. King was jailed until Wednesday, when he was released without charges. He was then examined by doctors, who said they found nine skull fractures, a shattered eye socket and cheekbone, a broken leg, a concussion, injuries to both knees and nerve damage that left his face partly paralyzed.
On Friday, a sergeant and three patrolmen were indicted.
 
History
Steady Increase In Lawsuits
The beating has raised a central question: Was it an aberration, as Chief Gates said, or part of a pattern?
Complaints of police brutality and racism have continued, and verdicts and settlements against the department have risen over the decades, from $553,000 in 1972 to $6.4 million in 1989 to $8 million in 1990. In one case, a jury found Chief Gates personally liable for $170,000 in damages in 1988 for a beating some of his officers gave a Hispanic family while searching for a murder weapon.
Officer Theodore J. Briseno, one of the four charged in the beating of Mr. King, had been suspended for 66 days in 1987 after he beat a handcuffed man. The others indicted were Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers Timothy E. Wind and Laurence M. Powell. Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell were also charged with filing false reports.
One former officer used the term "magic pencil" to describe the way the police can make potential allegations of misconduct disappear.
In the first two months of this year, there was a sharp rise in complaints filed against the police -- 127 for two months, against a yearly average over the last five years of about 600. About 25 percent of the complaints involved allegations of assaults by the police. On average, only 2 of the 600 complaints a year result in felony charges.
 
'An Orgy of Violence'
 When people talk about police brutality in Los Angeles, they talk about the Dalton Avenue case in 1988, in which 77 officers invaded the homes of two black families and engaged in what one lawyer called "an orgy of violence," ripping out sinks and toilets and smashing windows and television sets, apparently in retaliation for a telephoned threat to a police station.
Officers scrawled "LAPD Rules" on a wall outside the building, then beat residents as they arrested them. Four officers have been charged in the case. The city settled lawsuits by the residents last year for $3 million.
Also well remembered is the case of Eula Love, a black woman who in 1984 refused to allow a utility man to cut service to her home. When the police were called, she emerged holding a paring knife with a two-inch blade and was immediately shot dead.
Another case that received little publicity but bears similarities to the videotaped beating was the 1987 beating of Stuart Vigil, a 27-year-old white man. As Mr. Vigil, handcuffed and high on drugs, struggled against the police; 14 officers shot him with a Taser gun, kicked him in the head, then jumped on him. He died clutching the darts embedded in his chest.
In a recent case, about 30 youths, most of them Hispanic or black, were rounded up by the police when they entered a park in an affluent, mostly white neighborhood one afternoon. According to a suit filed here, the youths were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground, then to walk on their knees while the officers jeered at them and made racial slurs.
Civil rights cases against the Los Angeles police have become routine. Chief Gates recently testified at a trial involving the beating and hogtying of a man by the police.
In numerous interviews this week, minority victims of past police misconduct have said the only difference between their cases and that of Mr. King was the camera.
Louis Frescas, one of dozens of citizens who have been compensated by the City of Los Angeles, was hospitalized after a 1984 arrest. He said he was struck more than 50 times, even though charges were never filed against him. Mr. Frescas, who is Hispanic, said he was dragged from his car, thrown to the ground, and kicked and pummeled with nightsticks by one white officer as six others looked on. His case was settled out of court.
Court documents from several misconduct cases show that nearly all the victims of maulings by Los Angeles police dogs in the last seven years were black or Hispanic -- although whites committed nearly a third of the crimes in which dogs are usually deployed.
In recent years, there have been several incidents in which black celebrities -- people like Marcus Allen, the professional football player, and Jamaal Wilkes, the retired basketball star -- were ordered out of their cars and treated like felons when there was no apparent reason to stop them.
Last January, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing said the department had systematically denied promotions and advancement to black officers. The accusation came after complaints in December by the same agency that the department discriminated against Hispanic officers. The cases are pending.
 
On the Inside
Personal Code Is Powerful
Whenever force is used -- and police records show it happens in about one out of every 100 arrests in Los Angeles -- the officers are required to file a Use of Force report.
In well-supervised departments, said Dr. Skolnick of Berkeley, officers are encouraged to report any use of excessive force by fellow officers. Department regulations require Los Angeles police officers to report misconduct by their colleagues -- although authorities on police behavior have long recognized that a "code of silence" exists here as in other big-city departments.
Under mounting pressure to resign, Chief Gates has defended his 8,300-member force. The 64-year-old chief, who seems to enjoy wide support among rank-and-file officers, said there was no pattern of violence or racism. So far, he has taken no action to change procedures on the use of force or on investigating complaints of brutality.
"I preach," he said, "and I really mean preach, to every single person who graduates from the police academy about the law and their need for a reverence of the law," Chief Gates said.
 
Bush Supports U.S. Inquiry
HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 17 (AP) -- The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Saturday that President Bush fully supports the Justice Department's decision to investigate the "shocking" beating of Rodney G. King in Los Angeles.
 

GRAPHIC: Charts: THE GRAND JURY'S CHARGES

USE OF FORCE: POLICE GUIDELINES
 
Following is the language on the use of force, from the Los Angeles Police Department's manual:
 
"While the use of reasonable physical force may be necessary in situations which cannot be otherwise controlled, force may not be resorted to unless other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or would clearly be ineffective under the particular circumstances. Officers are permitted to use whatever force that is reasonable and necessary to protect others or themselves from bodily harm."

 BODY:

The Work of Nations Preparing Ourselves for 21st-Century Capitalism
By Robert B. Reich
331 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
In his original and important new book, "The Work of Nations," Robert B. Reich offers a fresh analysis of America's present economic and social prospects. Mr. Reich, who is a political economist on the faculty of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, proposes that without many citizens being aware of it, the national economy has undergone a profound transformation that has changed the very idea of what a national economy could be. 
 To simplify: Under the old economic order, which reached high tide between 1950 and 1970, productivity depended on the success of what Mr. Reich calls the core corporation. This was a hierarchical structure, a pyramid with a managerial class at the top and production workers at the bottom. The company's efforts were bent to producing high-volume goods, and the more successfully it did so, the better everyone did, from the rank-and-file worker to the chief executive officer. What was good for the company was good for the nation, to paraphrase the famous remark made Charles E. (Engine Charlie) Wilson of General Motors. The rising tide lifted all boats, and all that.
But as these core corporations went forth around the globe seeking raw materials and new markets, a reaction occurred, Mr. Reich argues. Europe and Japan, unhappy with the subordinate roles that American business hegemony had cast them into, set out to create their own "national corporate champions" to compete and connect with America's. The success of their enterprise created a new economic order, as Mr. Reich sees it.
Under this new order, the pyramid has been replaced by a spider web whose strands reach out all over the world. Productivity has shifted from high-volume to high-value goods, created by people whose skills involve discovering "new linkages between solutions and needs." Mr. Reich classifies these people as "symbolic analysts" for their ability to manipulate symbols like data, words, visual representations and so forth.
Symbolic analysis is one of three types of work of the future, he believes, the other two types being "routine production services" (blue-collar work and lower-level management, for example) and "in-person services" (like physical therapy and security guarding, for instance). But when symbolic analysts do well, the other two categories don't necessarily prosper. It takes a strand of the web to lift a producer to prosperity. And the strand is global not national, so the old metaphors no longer apply.
Unfortunately, the nation's thinking has not caught up with this new order of things, Mr. Reich laments. People continue to think of the economy as national instead of global, with all sorts of adverse results. We worry about our trade imbalance, when in fact much of it "during the 1980's was due not the predations of foreign nations and corporations, insistent on selling more to us than we sold to them, but to American-owned firms making things abroad (or, more precisely, contracting with foreigners to supply them with particular goods and services, which the firm then sold in the United States)."
We confuse skill and ownership, the author writes, so that foreigners get bashed for buying up our assets, when in fact they are really supplying capital for the development of these assets. Bruce Springsteen hasn't become any less American, Mr. Reich points out, now that as a CBS recording artist he is being marketed by the Sony Corporation. He simply has more capital behind him.
What is a problem seriously threatening the country, the author believes, is that while the fifth of the population composed of symbolic analysts is doing better and better, the four-fifths comprising production and in-service workers is doing worse and worse. Moreover, as the gap between the two groups widens, the symbolic analysts are in effect seceding from the nation by withdrawing into their own enclaves, where they build their own schools and protect themselves with their own security guards.
Isolated in golden ghettos like Princeton, N.J.; northern Westchester and and parts of Putnam Counties, N.Y.; Palo Alto, Calif.; Austin, Tex.; Bethesda, Md., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., the symbolic analysts refuse to invest in the improvement of the country's "infrastructure" that Mr. Reich believes to be necessary if opportunities to join the ranks of the symbolic analysts are to be democratized and the nation's productivity enhanced.
 What is to be done? Mr. Reich is better at defining the problem than proposing a solution. The first half of "The Work of Nations," where he traces the history of economic nationalism, is far more rigorous than the second half, where he limns the future of the global economy. The language sags. He overworks the word "comprise," even using it when he means "compose." And, while I'm quibbling, wouldn't "symbol analyst" express what the new class does a little more clearly than "symbolic analyst"?
 What Mr. Reich calls for as a solution to the nation's growing problem is an exercise in statesmanship. He calls for leaders with both a global economic vision and sufficient residual patriotism to want to aid the nation's have-nots to achieve productivity. What we need is "a positive economic nationalism, in which each nation's citizens take primary responsibility for enhancing the capacities of their countrymen for full and productive lives, but who also work with other nations to ensure that these improvements do not come at others' expense."
It is hard to see, especially in the light the recent global events, how such wise and magnanimous creatures as Mr. Reich envisions are going to spring spontaneously into being. More specifically, it is hard to imagine a prevailing socioeconomic myth, similar to laissez-faire capitalism or New Deal liberalism, that would render Mr. Reich's vision more concretely compelling.
Still, he never promises a program or a myth in "The Work of Nations." He merely wants to push the reader toward seeing things as he believes they really are. To that end, he has succeeded very well. He may not have persuaded the symbolic analysts to pay higher taxes so that the children of the production and in-person workers will get better educations. But surely he has shaken up a few assumptions.
How he does so is best expressed by one of his wittier passages, where he compares this country's present state to one in which the Lone Ranger and Tonto are surrounded by hordes of Indians. "We're surrounded!" exclaims the Lone Ranger. To which Tonto responds, "What do you mean we, kemo sabe?"

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Bill of Wrongs

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
American conservatives have complained for years about constitutional protections for those suspected of crime. Judges enforcing the rules hobble the police, they say. The Bush Administration is pressing Congress right now to limit some rights.
Anyone inclined to that view should think about Britain and the case of the Birmingham Six. We regard the British legal system as similar to ours. It is -- but without a constitution enforced by judges. Thereby hangs the tale. 
 The Birmingham Six, men from Northern Ireland, were charged with bombing two Birmingham pubs in 1974. The Irish Republican Army claimed credit for the bombs, which killed 21 people.
The police produced long, detailed confessions that they said four of the six had volunteered. A forensic expert also testified for the prosecution that there were traces of nitroglycerin on two of the men's hands. The six were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
At the trial, the defendants said the confessions were false and had been beaten out of them. But the judge, Mr. Justice Bridge, said that to accept their claim one would have to believe in a police conspiracy "unprecedented in the annals of British criminal history." He said the prosecution had presented "the clearest and most overwhelming evidence I have ever heard."
Mr. Justice Bridge is now Lord Bridge, the senior British law lord.
The six appealed, but the Court of Appeal quickly turned them down. The late Lord Widgery, then Lord Chief Justice, said in rejecting the appeal that he could see no evidence to suggest that they had been knocked about by the police "beyond the ordinary."
In 1977 the six brought a civil suit for damages against the police for injuries received after their arrest. Another senior judge, Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, threw the case out. Their claim of police malpractice opened up such an appalling vista, he said, that "every sensible person in the land would say 'it cannot be right these actions should go any further.' "
In 1986 a Labor member of Parliament, Chris Mullin, published a book supporting in detail the claim that the police had concocted the confessions. Granada Television did a program examining -- and demolishing -- the expert testimony about nitroglycerin traces. (It turned out that ordinary playing cards would leave the same traces.)
Government officials, now troubled, referred the case to the Court of Appeal again. But in 1988 the court once more dismissed the appeal. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, said the claim of a police plot to concoct a case against the six was "wholly incredible." He denounced the Granada television program.
Then an unconnected investigation found corruption in the police force that had handled the Birmingham Six case. In another look at the case, officials concluded that the police in charge had indeed faked evidence. The last claim of nitroglycerin traces was also withdrawn. Last week the Court of Appeal ordered the six released -- after 16 years in prison.
The case shook the criminal justice establishment in Britain from bottom to top. It was the third in less than two years in which Irish defendants were found to have been wrongly convicted. The Home Secretary appointed a royal commission to look into the whole system.
"Rarely has the reputation of English justice sunk so low," The Economist said. The Independent newspaper said the scandal "requires not just a royal commission but a resignation. The man who bears responsibility is the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane. It is time he threw in his wig."
But there is a broader point in the case of the Birmingham Six. It is not just that British judges were arrogant and insensitive in this case. It is that, in general, they operate without the guiding light of a constitution.
The false confessions could not have been admitted as evidence in the United States, because the six were questioned and "confessed" without a chance to see lawyers. In the Miranda case in 1966, the Supreme Court ruled out such evidence as a violation of the constitutional protection against compelled self-incrimination.
In the absence of a constitution, British judges have come generally to think less of individual interests and more of the state's. They are also hostile to claims of free speech, for example, and freedom of the press.
British politicians, too, have been cold to the idea of constitutional rights -- Labor as much as Conservatives. The result is a far more arbitrary society than ours.
Is that what we want? If Americans who scorn constitutional rights for criminal defendants think about it, I doubt that they really do.

HEADLINE: India Has No History of Anti-Semitism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The news article describing the shrunken Jewish community of Bombay, India (Feb. 17), states that they constitute "a vulnerable minority scattered throughout predominantly Muslim neighborhoods," and they fear that events in the Persian Gulf "could turn neighbors against them in a country where decades of official support for the Palestine Liberation Organization has contributed to the creation of a climate generally hostile to Israel." 
 This is a wrongheaded and mischievous picture of the situation of Jews in India, seeming to insist on finding tension even where none exists. In 25 years of visits to and travels in India, I have never seen or heard of hostility to Indian Jews. Official friendliness to the P.L.O. and Muslim countries, and hostility to Israel find no reflection in the English-language press or in public opinion or indeed among the high Indian officials who carry out these policies, when one speaks to them privately.
The official stance of India toward Israel is explained by the desire to maintain good relations with Arab countries, with the hope of occasionally getting one or another to abstain in United Nations votes on Kashmir; by the trading relations that bring India its oil; by the large numbers of Indians working in Arab countries.
Jews emigrate from India for the same reasons they emigrate from other countries with small Jewish communities: to live in larger Jewish communities where they can find Jewish spouses for their children, because of the pull of the Jewish ingathering in Israel or because of wider economic opportunity.
To suggest the decline of the Jewish community in India is owing to the official relations of India with Israel, or to Jewish fears of popular hostility or prejudice, is to demonstrate an ignorance of the well-recorded history of Jews in India, a country with no history of anti-Semitism, popular or governmental.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits 8-Month High Against Mark in Hectic Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened broadly yesterday and briefly hit an eight-month high against the German mark, buoyed by increased demand after the Persian Gulf war, political uncertainty in the Soviet Union and trouble in the reunified German economy.
Currency markets early in the day grew hectic after the dollar hit its highest level against the German mark since before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August. 
 Sustained confidence in the United States economy after the gulf war continued to keep demand for the dollar strong. At the same time, the mark was hurt by reports that Germany's economic boom, invigorated by reunification, was expected to slow significantly.
Before profit taking eroded some of the increase, the dollar was quoted at 1.6380 German marks, matching its level of July 23, 1990. The dollar ended in New York up more than 2 pfennigs, to 1.6282 marks, from 1.6070 late Friday.
Traders said the German currency was further undermined by discord in the Soviet Union, despite referendum results that apparently handed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a victory in his efforts to preserve the country's political structure.
"With Germany being close to the Russian border, it kind of creates an anxiety in that whole sphere," said Tom Benfer, senior market representative in foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York.
Rumors circulated throughout the day that central banks were poised to sell dollars in an effort to stem the currency's rise, an action taken several times last week with varying degrees of success. But the reports proved largely untrue. The Bank of Japan did sell dollars against the yen in Asian trading, but traders said the activity was virtually ignored by the European and domestic markets.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7905, from $1.8340 late Friday. The decline reflected not only the dollar's strength, but also weakness in the pound on expectations of a cut in British interest rates. The dollar also rose against the pound in New York. Sterling ended at $1.7938, less expensive than late Friday's $1.8225.
Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.65 yen, up 1.40 yen from last Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 138.10 yen, and in New York, it settled at 137.97 yen, slightly higher than late Friday's 137.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3930; 5.5485 French francs, up from 5.4735; 1,214.75 Italian lire, up from 1,200.00, and 1.1541 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1561.

Loss Is Expected At Boise Cascade

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, March 18

 BODY:
The Boise Cascade Corporation told securities analysts it expects a loss of about $16 million in the first quarter of 1991, largely because of a weak paper market. Net income for the first quarter of 1990 was $33.6 million, while income in the fourth quarter came to $4.8 million.
The company said the decline stemmed from lower paper prices, the weak economy, excess industry capacity and slow construction activity, which reduced demand for wood products. The company said it had reduced budgets and was cutting capital expenditures by about $500 million in 1991. Boise Cascade shares slipped 37.5 cents, to $26.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: FUTURES OPTIONS;
Silver and Platinum Prices Fall as Do Recovery Hopes

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver and platinum futures prices tumbled yesterday as falling commodity prices weakened hopes for a strong economic recovery. Gold futures prices also fell.
Silver futures settled 14.8 to 15.6 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in March at $3.943 an ounce, its first close below $4 since March 7. 
 Platinum ended $9.60 to $9.80 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with April at $396.80 an ounce. Gold was $2.10 to $2.20 lower on the Commodity Exchange, with the active April contract at $363.70 an ounce. Gold for current delivery in March fell $1.90, to $363 an ounce.
 
Vulnerable to Economic Signals
 Silver and platinum have industrial uses that make them more vulnerable than gold to economic signals. Both of the metals rose sharply through late February and early March on hopes that the end of the gulf war would hasten an economic recovery. But the rally faltered last week after Government reports suggested there would be little or no economic growth in the months ahead.
Silver and platinum also responded to a general decline in commodity prices, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. He said declining commodity prices reflected a lack of demand for raw materials.
Analysts said the metals also weakened in reaction to strength in the dollar, which has been gaining against other currencies in recent weeks. A strong dollar makes American-made goods more expensive overseas, which depresses export demand for United States products.
Oil prices moved lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders said there was a general lack of interest by oil buyers, which helped to weaken prices. Some players in oil futures contracts were apparently waiting to see whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries makes good on a promise to cut daily production by about 1.1 million barrels.
Crude oil finished 25 to 42 cents lower, with April down 25 cents, to $19.76 a barrel; heating oil was 0.06 cent lower to 0.13 higher, with April at 55.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.28 to 0.55 cent lower, with April at 69.79 cents a gallon; natural gas was 1 cent lower to 0.3 cent higher, with April at $1.386 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Unit Still on Block After Rebuff by Mitsubishi

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 18

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that it was discussing the sale of a stake in the Chrysler Financial Corporation with a couple of potential suitors but that Japan's Mitsubishi Motor Corporation had said it was not interested.
Chrysler, the No. 3 American auto maker, which has been operating under financial pressure, said it was willing to sell either a controlling interest in Chrysler Financial or a minority interest above 25 percent. 
Jerome B. York, chief financial officer, said Chrysler's finance subsidiary needed higher credit ratings, and the parent company needed more cash in the face of a steep downturn in business. A sale of Chrysler Financial equity could raise $1.25 billion or more.
"The book value of Chrysler Financial is $2.5 billion, and we would anticipate a transaction at book or slightly over book," Mr. York said.
 
Controlling Interest Offers
 He said some potential buyers told Chrysler's investment banks, First Boston and the Blackstone Group, that they would be interested in bidding only for a controlling interest. He declined to identify the remaining potential buyers but said that the list had contained "eight or nine" companies when Chrysler began soliciting interest in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Chrysler had approached Mitsubishi about an equity stake because the Japanese auto maker is expanding its retail automotive business in the United States and is very strong financially. Chrysler owns 11 percent of Mitsubishi and is associated in several joint projects and commercial relationships.
"Our investment bankers said that if this were 1988 or 1989 we would have 15 or 20 interested parties, but because of the crunch in financial markets the list will be shorter," he said. Some potential buyers are not able to secure financing.
In addition to generating fresh cash, selling an equity interest in Chrysler Financial could convince ratings agencies to raise their ratings on the unit's debt securities. Chrysler Financial has been excluded from public debt markets because of its parent's shaky financial condition.
Mr. York declined to say how soon Chrysler might sell Chrysler Financial equity, but if the auto maker is not able to find a buyer, its first priority "is to maintain Chrysler Financial so it can take care of automotive lending requirements," he said, which would mean finding a way to improve credit ratings so Chrysler Financial could regain access to credit markets.
Chrysler Financial, which paid a $300 million dividend to its corporate parent last year, will probably not pay one in 1991.

HEADLINE: First Fidelity In Spanish Sale

 BODY:
The First Fidelity Bancorporation announced plans yesterday to raise $220 million in capital by selling 9.5 million common shares to Banco Santander, a Spanish bank.
The sale will provide First Fidelity, one of the nation's 25 largest banking companies, with the capital it needs to expand and will give the Spanish bank 13 percent of the Newark- based banking company. 
 Banco Santander also acquired warrants giving it the right to buy 9.5 million more shares at $25.50 each, which would provide First Fidelity with another $242.4 million, and leave the Spanish bank with a 24.9 percent stake.
Since the arrival a year ago of Anthony P. Terracciano as chairman, First Fideltiy has moved quickly to cut costs and return to profitable operations, despite the increases in troubled loans caused by the recession. Last month, First Fidelity acquired 48 branches and $2.5 billion in deposits from a failed New Jersey savings bank.
"We looked at some 80 banks in 38 states before deciding ot invet in First Fideltiy," said Emilio Boton, Banco Santander's chairman. "It will be our only direct investment in a major regional U.S. banking company."
Banco Santander paid $23.25 for each new share, or slightly more than yesterday's close of $23.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Fall in Sluggish Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates rose in sluggish trading yesterday, deepening the negative tone that emerged late last week.
On Friday, a disappointing inflation report and news from University of Michigan researchers of a sharp rebound in consumer confidence led to a big selloff in the bond market. 
 The reports generated a sense that the Federal Reserve Board was not likely to ease monetary policy again soon if the economy really was on the mend and if inflation was still a problem, and that sense was more broadly visible yesterday.
"The market has relied on the Fed and the recession for so long that any change in thinking is not good," a trader of government bonds said. "And, at least temporarily it seems, we have run out of the stimulus the Fed has given us."
 
Consumer Price Report
 Stung by last week's inflation report, which showed that producer prices excluding food and energy rose by four-tenths of a percentage point in February, some investors yesterday may have decided to lighten up on positions in advance of a report expected today on consumer price trends for February.
Most economists are anticipating that the figures should be fairly good. The consensus is that the overall index rose by about one-tenth of a percentage point, and that the index without food and energy rose by about three-tenths of a percentage point. In January, the so-called core rate shot up by eight-tenths of a percentage pont.
"The market is confused about the economic outlook, and is more willing to assume that the recession will be over sooner and that inflation will not improve very much," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America.
In addition to worries about inflation, traders said that market participants were beginning to look ahead to a very large volume of new intermediate- to long-term Treasury issues that would be sold over the next six weeks.
 
Sales Start Next Week
 Those sales begin next week, with expected auctions of new two-year and five-year notes. They end in early May, with the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions.
"We are looking at a six-week horizon where there is going to be some fairly heavy supply," another bond trader said. "We can absorb it, but we need customers. Right now we aren't seeing any."
At the Treasury's weekly bill auctions, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.83 percent, down slightly from an average rate of 5.85 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.82 percent, compared with 5.91 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 1/32 late yesterday, down 14/32, to yield 8.32 percent, compared with 8.28 percent late Friday.
Mr. Wood said the rise in long-term interest rates over the last few weeks could jeopardize a recovery in the housing industry, where activity has been at an exceptionally low ebb for months.
 
No Effect So Far
 "So far, the rise hasn't hurt housing any more than it is already suffering, but it could if the rise in long rates continues, and fixed-rate mortgages go up," he said.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 97 13/32, down 10/32, to yield 8.13 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 14/32, down 5/32, to yield 7.06 percent.
Elsewhere, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues slipped by 1/4 point to3/8 point in sluggish trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by about 1/4 point, according to market participants.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills		 	 	Average Price	98.526	97.058	Discounted Rate	5.83%	5.82%	Coupon Yield	6.02%	6.10%	High Price	98.534	97.063	Discounted Rate	5.80%	5.81%	Coupon Yield	5.98%	6.08%	Low Price	98.526	97.058	Discounted Rate	5.83%	5.82%	Coupon Yield	6.02%	6.10%	Accepted at low price	38%	59%	Total applied for	$30,662,700	$26,045,035	Accepted	$8,438,370	$8,404,440	N.Y. applied for	$27,752,690	$23,151,710	N.Y. accepted	$7,322,720	$7,343,315	Noncompetitive	$1,386,510	$986,375	
 
Both these issues are dated March 21, 1991. The three-month bills mature June 20, 1991 and the six-month bills, Sept. 19, 1991.

HEADLINE: Money and Meters: One Firm, Many Companies - A Special Report;
Winning New York Contracts: Hard Questions for a Supplier

BYLINE: The following article is based on reporting by Martin Gottlieb, Dean Baquet and Eric N. Berg and was written by Mr. Gottlieb.

 BODY:
For the last three years, while New York City awarded contract after contract to the tiny Vanguard Meter Service company of Kentucky, complaints were being lodged inside and outside of city government about the company's performance on what now amounts to more than $50 million of water-meter installation work.
The complaints involved allegations that meters were installed improperly, that homeowners lost workdays waiting for installers who never showed up, and that company workers were paid less than required by law.
 
Financial Troubles
 At the same time, as city officials depicted the company as "the I.B.M. of the water-meter industry," persistent financial difficulties plagued Vanguard's work, caused at least in part by a long history of problems with creditors, of which the city seems to have been largely unaware. 
 City officials say that the meter program has been a huge success and that Vanguard has performed "satisfactory" work, with a small number of problems that are quickly corrected.
But the complaints, which came from union officials, workers, and the city's own supervisors, stand in contrast to this. And they raise broader questions about the city's $5.5 billion-a-year contracting system, which is has many of the same features as the water meter effort. These include heavy reliance on companies that win contracts that hardly anybody else wants to bid on and whose failures can jeopardize entire programs.
In previous articles, The New York Times described how the company, which initially listed $300,000 in assets, hired the politically connected lawyers Sid Davidoff, a friend to Mayor David N. Dinkins, and Armand D'Amato, the brother of United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and won about two-thirds of the contracts let thus far in the city's 10-year, $290 million program to install 630,000 water meters in New York City buildings. Under the water-conservation program, New Yorkers pay for water based on consumption rather than at a flat rate.
Vanguard is now the subject of four government investigations, focusing on possible labor law violations and other improprieties.
The company denies any wrongdoing. And city officials say any program this extensive is likely to lead to complaints. But an analysis of city records and court documents raises questions about the level of problems in three areas:
*The quality of work. At least four times over three years, officials of the city's Bureau of Water Register chastised the company variously for falling far behind schedule, hiring "rude and incompetent employees," and being responsible for an "overworked staff, apathetic response to customers' wishes, ineffectual manpower levels, and poor workmanship."
*Treatment of workers. In a January 1989 letter demanding a city investigation, the union local representing Vanguard employees reported "our office is besieged with complaints" that the company was shortchanging on wages. Workers also complained to the state Labor Department that year, which said it referred them to the city. But the city did not investigate until last year. In the inquiry by the Comptroller's office, which cleared Vanguard, no workers were interviewed and investigators relied solely on company records.
*The company's financial history. Numerous court papers, of which the city was apparently unaware, document how the company's chairman, Robert E. Bates, was warding off creditors well after he began winning city contracts. According to documents, his cash flow became so strained that suppliers threatened to cut him off, a move that could have crippled the metering program.
Yet city officials did relatively little checking on the company's background, particularly in comparison to a check on a competitor that underbid Vanguard on five contracts. After Mr. Bates and water register officials suggested that the company, Volt Energy Systems, had not done enough meter work to qualify, the officials, including Paul Recco, the meter program's director, checked Volt's work history in detail and disqualified it from three large jobs. They were then awarded to Vanguard.
Mr. Recco was later hired as an executive by Vanguard, one month after quitting his city job last September.
In an interview, he said he showed no favoritism to Vanguard and had not spoken to the company about a job until he left the city agency.
In a lengthy interview Mr. Bates said he dominated New York City's metering program because others were unwilling to take the risks. He called his company the "quality contractor in the United States" and said investigators, who have taken three truckloads of his records, "just fired their shotguns hoping they could hit something."
 
Job Performance
 
Overwork And Apathy
The first indication of problems discovered in city files came from Mr. Recco himself. In an October 1988 letter to Mr. Bates, he said the company "has failed to complete the number of installations in the approved progress schedule," creating a "large deficit" of work.
Meanwhile, he said, Vanguard's productivity on older contracts awarded for repair and replacement of old meters had "dropped drastically" as it tackled the new work.
"This," Mr. Recco wrote, "is unacceptable and cannot continue."
The following September, William Reese, Mr. Recco's assistant, wrote Vanguard to complain of a sloppy installation that he said created "a suspicion that a larger number of your work force is not complying with contract specifications."
Three months later Mr. Reese wrote a detailed report to Mr. Recco prompted, he said, by repeated problems on Vanguard jobs, including missed appointments and apathy among employees "obviously overwhelmed with their workload."
He cited 16 cases of missed appointments and poor work that he said were "a sampling of discrepancies encounted over a 90-day period."
 
'Has Proven Disastrous'
 "The sampling presented is a clear signal that Vanguard Meter Service has fallen behind, and continues to fall behind submitted installation schedules," he wrote. "All indicators of overworked staff, apathetic response to customers' wishes, ineffectual manpower levels, poor workmanship, point towards crisis management situations. This type of scenario has proven disastrous in the past. I feel the time has come for B.W.R. to intervene in these contracts." B.W.R. refers to the Bureau of Water Register.
Four months later, in March 1990, Thomas Carchietta, a customer service representative for the bureau, wrote the same sort of exasperated letter, citing five complaints he said were representative of what the bureau received daily. After one, in which he cited broken appointments made with a Queens homeowner, he concluded: "Again B.W.R. has been embarrassed by contractor failure to track customer inquiries accurately and responsibly. This situation is now the rule, not the exception."
The bottom line, he wrote, was that "Customer complaints are surpassing acceptable limits. Our customers are losing work days waiting for installers who don't show."
Steven Ostrega, director of the water register bureau, described these assessments as indications of "tough contract management for which the city should be praised," adding that independent city audits rated Vanguard's work highly. Mr. Ostrega said that the city has also been tough on the other meter installers. Mr. Recco agreed that other contractors were treated as rigorously and described the memos as standard. He added that the company's performance improved after the complaints.
However, present and former D.E.P. officials described the memos as uncommonly blunt and harsh. Mr. Bates, in fact, said he had never come across criticism "of this magnitude" before. He characterized the Reese memos in particular as those of "an overzealous young person with a job to do." He said company policy is to correct problems immediately.
Others also used strong language with the company. In July 1990 Con Edison said Vanguard workers entered one of its plants without permission and tore insulation from pipes without knowing if it was toxic.
"This is not the first time that your personnel have committed violations," Melvin Ross, Con Edison's water program coordinator, wrote Vanguard. "This also is not the first time that I have brought these matters to your attention.
"We pride ourselves in our safety records. We pride ourselves in our reliability of service. And we pride ourselves in good labor-management relations. You have jeopardized all of these."
 
The Workers
 
Was Underpayment The Norm?
The Federal Labor Department's racketeering unit is investigating whether Vanguard illegally paid workers for each meter installed rather than by the prevailing hourly rate required by state law, law-enforcement officials said. A dozen past and present Vanguard workers told The Times that the company assured them they would earn more this way. They said Vanguard contended installations would take an hour and that the company would pay $22 per meter rather than the $16-an-hour prevailing rate in effect at the program's start.
In reality, the workers said, they were often lucky to install two or three meters a day.
The consequences of an underpayment could have been broad. If Vanguard was bidding on the basis of an illegally low wage scale, it would have had an unfair advantage over its competitors.
Mr. Bates contends that nobody earned less than the prevailing rate, but said that as a productivity incentive, he pays the per-meter rate if it is higher.
But in a January 1989 letter to Harvey Schultz, then the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Frank LaRocca, business manager of Plumbers Union Local 371, wrote that the meter program "has turned into a fiasco." He said that "over 120 employees have left" Vanguard and that "many are still owed back pay."
Records from the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Bureau of Water Register, indicate that Mr. Schultz wrote a letter asking the City Comptroller's office to investigate.
But Harrison J. Goldin, then comptroller, said he got no such letter. And Louis Haber, a spokesman for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, said agency files show no complaints.
Mr. LaRocca later withdrew his complaint, even though Vanguard workers contended in interviews that they had been shortchanged as recently as this year. Mr. LaRocca did not return calls.
Ms. Holtzman audited Vanguard last year, Mr. Haber said, after a competitor's assertion that Vanguard workers were stealing meters. While investigating the theft allegation, Mr. Haber said, investigators examined Vanguard's payroll records in a perfunctory way to see if the company was paying the prevailing wage.
Mr. Haber said the Comptroller has opened another inquiry into whether Vanguard is underpaying.
 
The Finances
 
$12 and a Watch To His Name
As Mr. Bates entered the New York City market, he was trying to ward off creditors in Kentucky, apparently unbeknownst to the city.
Mr. Bates was so pressed that Vanguard's stock, his personal cars and his Kentucky home were placed in the name of his wife, Priscilla. In September 1985, two years before bidding opened on the city's meter contracts, Mr. Bates said in a court deposition that his checking account was empty and his savings account held $12. All he had to his name, he said, was a Timex wristwatch and one-sixteenth of a nonproducing oil well.
Between 1982 and 1988 Kentucky courts ordered him to come up with nearly $300,000 for suppliers, the heirs of a former business partner and an ex-wife.
By 1987, part of Mr. Bates's income from Vanguard was being withheld by court order for back alimony payments.
Mr. Bates said many of his and Vanguard's difficulties were rooted in the national recession of the early 1980's.
 
Trouble Meeting Payroll
 In June 1989, Vanguard's cash flow problems emerged in New York, where the city noted in an internal memo that Mr. Bates was "experiencing difficulty in meeting his weekly payroll and paying his suppliers, who will no longer ship material without payment." If the financial difficulties slowed Vanguard, they would threaten the metering program schedule, the memo said. The agency agreed to expedite paperwork and pick up Vanguard's checks by hand to speed payment by a few days. Mr. Bates maintained said that many of his problems were the result of the city being late in paying him.
Mr. Ostrega acknowledges that the city did not do as extensive a background check on Vanguard as it did on others, because, in his words, the company was regarded as "the I.B.M." of the business.
City officials say ordinarily it would be unfair to disqualify a company because of financial difficulties as long as it could qualify for a bond guaranteeing its performance, as Vanguard has done. But others say the city took a risk in permitting a company in such financial straits to dominate a major program.
"The credit-worthiness of a company and its leader has to be taken into account -- whether it can meet its payments and its responsibilities," Ms. Holtzman said in an interview. "Particularly in a small company, the president's credit-worthiness is key. If the suppliers are worried about it, certainly its customers should be, too."
By Mr. Bates's account, Vanguard's financial problems eased when Armand D'Amato introduced Mr. Bates to Alvin Benjamin, a Long Island developer who became a 32 percent partner. Mr. Bates said he hired Mr. Davidoff, the city's largest registeredlobbyist, to help free up payment checks. Mr. Davidoff has been successful in arranging meetings with Mr. Schultz and others, Mr. Bates said.
Last year, Vanguard was purchased by Asplundh Tree Expert Company, of Willow Grove, Pa., a large privately held company with many government contracts. Mr. Bates remains as its chairman.

HEADLINE: New York State and City Run in Place on Budgets

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 18

 BODY:
Although New York State and New York City are facing combined fiscal troubles of crisis proportions, budget negotiations here have become mired in what even the participants concede are Albany's usual parochial and political concerns.
Unwilling to approve many of the proposed cuts offered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, but lacking a politically palatable alternative, the state's legislative leaders seem to have adopted a wait-and-see approach. 
 Even as the Legislature searches for ways to fend off the Governor's budget, many fiscal analysts are questioning whether the proposal presented by Mr. Cuomo is adequate to solve the state's and the city's problems. What is lacking, these analysts say, is a comprehensive plan to deal with both governments' financial ills.
Instead, they say, the state and local governments, led by the City of New York, appear to be entering a fiscal tug-of-war in which the solution to one government's budget problems only compounds the problems of the other.
 
'The Numbers Are Bigger'
 "What we are seeing is more of the same, clearly, except that the numbers are bigger," said Raymond Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. "Unfortunately, there's no overarching plan that's designed to create some stability."
In contrast to the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, when the state and the city worked furiously to fashion a sweeping solution, this year there is little sense of urgency to budget negotiations.
"What was created last time during the fiscal crisis was an atmosphere that allowed people to do things that had never been done before," said one former state official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Now, nobody's doing anything that they have never done before. There's no real atmosphere of crisis."
For the fiscal year starting in April, the state and the city are facing combined budget gaps of $8 billion, and together are considering laying off thousands of workers.
The current problems are very different from the fiscal crisis of 15 years ago, when New York City was shut out from the credit markets. The city's inability to borrow money precipitated an emergency that prompted state and city leaders to draft a plan to restore the city's finances.
In part because of the controls imposed during the last crisis, neither the city nor the state is faced today with being shut out of credit markets.
But many fiscal analysts say the magnitude of the problems facing the two governments is even greater now than it was 15 years ago, when the city was insolvent, but the state remained on firm footing. They wonder, they say, whether a tangible crisis, like being closed out of the credit markets, is needed before the state and the city will take the kind of bold action that they took in the 1970's.
"The good news compared to the 1970's is the money won't stop tomorrow," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. "But the bad news is also that money won't stop tomorrow. There is no clear and visible pressure here."
Six weeks after Governor Cuomo presented his $51.9 billion budget to the Legislature, the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, have yet to take a firm position on the proposal. So far, the only comments the legislative leaders have made on the budget have been noncommital.
Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, has suggested that the Governor's budget, which calls for deep cuts in state aid, raises too many policy questions to be resolved during the normal course of budget negotiations, but he has failed to offer a clear alternative. He has skirted the politically perilous issue of new taxes, and has declined even to say how large he thinks the budget should be.
Mr. Marino, an Oyster Bay, L.I., Republican, has stated that he does not want to spend more than the Governor has proposed, but has also failed to take a clear stand on taxes. Neither man has offered a counterproposal to the Governor's plan.
In the meantime, the news only grows worse, and the lobbying in Albany more frenetic. Today the State Comptroller warned that the state was facing an additional $275 million gap for the fiscal year that starts April 1. And on Tuesday, more than 20,000 demonstrators are expected to arrive at the State Capitol to pressure lawmakers into restoring many of the cuts in the Governor's budget.
Two weeks before the state's budget deadline, the only issues that have emerged definitively from the desultory budget talks are the same ones that emerge virtually every year with the first tentative signs of Albany spring.
State Senate Republicans are insisting, according to their custom, that school aid to their principal supporters on Long Island be increased. Assembly Democrats, living up to their tradition, are pressing for more aid for their primary constituency: New York City. Both the Assembly and the Senate are expressing their usual opposition to raising the state's gasoline tax, as the Governor has proposed. And Mr. Cuomo is pledging, once again, to oppose to any efforts to raise the state's income or corporate-tax rates.
"We represent our constituents," Mr. Marino said, explaining the recurrent themes. "Our constituents have certain interests, and we are guided in large measure by those interests."
Cuomo administration officials offer a less flattering explanation. "The facts have changed," one adviser to the Governor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "It can't be business as usual. But it's very, very difficult to get these guys to change their political stripes."
Governor Cuomo has roundly chastised lawmakers for the slow pace of budget negotiations, saying that he made tough choices in preparing his budget, now it is time for the Legislature to do the same.
"If you're late on April 1, I will not be in the room with you," he said recently in remarks aimed at the Legislature. "I will sit back and wait for you to deliver a budget to me."
Many analysts, however, say that the Governor, too, deserves some of the blame for the business-as-usual atmosphere in Albany. Mr. Cuomo's budget, they say, while certainly containing many tough cuts, contains few proposals aimed at actually changing the way state government operates and solving the long-term budget problems confronting the city and the state.
"Solving the Governor's budget problem with aid cuts is simply passing the problem onto the the city and other localities," said Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission.
 
Higher Taxes?
 The Governor's budget, Mr. Brecher continued, is likely to prompt another round of local tax increases across a state that already relies heavily on local revenues. Such increases, he said, could be even more harmful to the state's economy than the state tax increases the Governor is resisting. "We should be shifting more of the tax burden onto a statewide base," he said.
Mr. Cuomo has rejected this argument, saying that local governments can cut their budgets just as he cut the state's. But the Governor's efforts to solve the state's budget problems without a broader plan to deal with local governments' problems as well have created chronic problems, which are evident in the nagging tensions between Mr. Cuomo and his ostensible ally, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Recently, hardly a day has passed without some new sign of the increasing strains between the two men. On Wednesday, for example, reports that the Mayor would speak at a rally against the Governor's budget raised hackles in the Cuomo administration; the Mayor eventually decided to skip the demonstration. Then on Friday, the Mayor released an angry letter to the Governor, denouncing his proposed cuts in criminal justice.
"I have given the State Legislature and you an unprecedented commitment to increase police officers and related criminal justice spending," Mr. Dinkins said, referring to his recently approved crime plan. "I had assumed and understood there to be a state commitment to at least the current level of funding for our criminal justice programs."
Without a plan to deal with the state and city troubles in concert, many analysts say that the state will solve its budget problems only to find itself a few months later forced to grapple with New York City's, as the city begins its fiscal year in July.
Mr. Marino, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged that "the ideal would be to deal with both of them together."
"But it's hard to deal with both subjects at once," he said. "It's so utterly difficult to get past the state's problems; there are so many crosscurrents at work."

HEADLINE: To Albany Lobbyists, It's Only Good Times

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 18

 BODY:
There were more lobbyists than ever walking the halls of the State Capitol last year, and they earned a record amount of money for their attempts to influence state government.
A report issued today by the State Commission on Lobbying showed that 1,993 lobbyists were registered with the state in 1990, a 17 percent increase over 1989. They were paid a total of $29.3 million in fees and expense reimbursements, a 12 percent rise over the previous year. 
 Last year's growth contributed to a five-fold increase in state lobbying fees since 1978, according to the report. The largest increases have been seen in the last three years, when spending on lobbyists rose by 63 percent.
 
Four Firms Over $1 Million
 "This is probably one of the few recession-proof industries left," said Celia Viggo Wexler, legislative director of New York State Common Cause. "In good times and bad, people are willing to pay good money for lobbyists."
Four lobbying firms collected more than $1 million in 1990, twice as many as exceeded that mark in 1989. Leading the pack was the law firm of Bower & Gardner of Manhattan, which merged at the beginning of last year with one of Albany's most successful lobbying groups, Condello, Ryan & Piscitelli.
The firm's chief lobbyist is Kenneth Shapiro, a former chief counsel to both Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and Mr. Miller's predecessor, Stanley Fink. Mr. Fink is a partner in the law firm, but does not lobby in Albany, said Peter A. Piscitelli, one of the firm's most active lobbyists.
Bower & Gardner collected $1.6 million in lobbying fees and reimbursements last year. The other firms that passed the $1 million mark were Shea & Gold; Hinman, Straub, Pigors & Manning; and Davidoff & Malito, each with about $1.1 million.
A report issued last week by the New York City Clerk showed that Davidoff & Malito was paid an additional $1.6 million last year to lobby city officials, more than any other firm. One of the law firm's partners is Sid Davidoff, a friend, occasional adviser and regular tennis partner of Mayor David N. Dinkins. The report last week by the New York City Clerk showed that one of every three dollars in new lobbying money last year went to Mr. Davidoff's firm.
Among the largest state lobbying clients were members of the tobacco industry, which fended off legislation proposed last year by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to restrict the sale of cigarettes from vending machines and to prohibit the free distribution of cigarettes in promotional schemes. Philip Morris U.S.A. spent $566,223 on state lobbying last year, more than any other corporation or association. The Tobacco Institute spent an additional $250,258.The second-largest spender was the New York State Soft Drink Association, which paid $430,224 to lobbyists. That group was the loudest voice against another Cuomo initiative, which would have given the state the unclaimed nickel deposits on beer and soft-drink containers. The group also lobbied unsuccessfully against the enactment of a two-cent container tax on soda bottles and cans.
Several Albany lobbyists said the growth of their industry has resulted from a combination of factors, including the Federal Government's ceding of responsibilities to the states during the 1980's and the increasing sophistication of corporations and interest groups.
Morris H. Klein, the chairman of the commission, speculated that the state's budget woes also contributed to the increase in lobbying. With fewer state dollars available, more agencies and interest groups are seeking every advantage in maintaining their share, he said.

U.S. Chain Is Said to Plan Tokyo Store

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 18

 BODY:
Japanese who love to emulate fashionable New Yorkers may get a chance to spend their yen just like Manhattan's shoppers: Bloomingdale's is coming to the Tokyo area, according to reports here today.
A Japanese Bloomingdale's is being planned for the Makuhari area in neighboring Chiba Prefecture, said a leading financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, whose report was confirmed today by a local official. The report added that the department store, the first in what could be a chain here, might open in 1994 or 1995. 
 The Governor of Chiba Prefecture announced that the Tokyu Department Store Company had won a competition to develop the site, which is next to a large convention center in the Tokyo suburb. Tokyu apparently hopes to complete a deal with Bloomingdale's, but those talks have yet to be concluded.
Tokyu officials refused to comment on the article. And in New York, Bloomingdale's chairman and chief executive, Marvin S. Traub, denied the report.
Tokyu "is one of a number of Japanese companies which, over the past several years, have expressed interest in developing some sort of relationship with Bloomingdale's," Mr. Traub said. "At present, we are not involved in any formal negotiations toward such an arrangement, nor do we expect to be involved in such negotiations in 1991."
 
Seeks Affluent Customers
 Tokyu, a second-tier retailer that has been struggling to upgrade its image among affluent Japanese consumers, is part of the Tokyu Group, a large railroad and real estate company, which sets up its department stores near its stations.
Tokyu and Bloomingdale's became acquainted when the financially troubled New York retailer, whose parent is in bankruptcy reorganization, was put on the auction block two years ago. A number of Japanese companies, including Tokyu, looked over Bloomingdale's, but all backed away, reportedly over concerns that the retailer looked like damaged merchandise because of the ills of the parent, Federated Department Stores.
Federated had been acquired by the Campeau Corporation in a transaction involving billions of dollars of "junk bond" debt. But as the economy slowed down and the junk bond market began to unravel, Bloomingdale's was put up for sale to try and alleviate the debt burden.
 
Japanese Investments
 Japanese retailers have been on something of a shopping spree themselves in recent years, snapping up foreign specialty stores and opening outlets in Japan in an effort to lure consumers enchanted by the international panache these stores carry here.
Mitsukoshi bought a share in Tiffany, the jewelry retailer, and has placed Tiffany's boutiques in most of its Japanese stores. Jusco acquired Talbot's and a share in Laura Ashley and has been putting up boutiques for the two here. Isetan has a venture with Barneys New York and has opened a Barneys outlet here. Last year, Tobu came in second in the bidding for Saks Fifth Avenue.

HEADLINE: How Milwaukee Has Thrived While Leaving Blacks Behind

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, March 16

 BODY:
This proud workhorse of a city, with its well-swept streets and chic new office towers, has become a striking antithesis to the recession on the coasts. It has an unemployment rate well below the national average, a booming downtown, a generous budget surplus and more jobs than skilled people to fill them.
Milwaukee pulled itself out of a serious slump in the early 1980's and staved off the current recession by making its old manufacturing plants more efficient and expanding services like hotels and retailing.
 
A Secondary Effect
 But that strategy has had an unintended but equally profound secondary effect. It has devastated the city's poor black neighborhoods, whose residents thrived in the high-wage union jobs of the city's manufacturing heyday and are now adrift on a rising tide of unemployment, crime and despair. 
 With black joblessness five tmes the rate among whites, "Milwaukee is a classic case of how a restructured economy has diminished the employment opportunities for blacks and for black males in particular," said Dr. James H. Johnson Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Urban Poverty at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied poverty in Milwaukee. "The indicators of poverty and joblessness fall solidly in the black community."
The retooling of factories also hurt unskilled whites, of course. But the effect was less severe for several reasons. At factories that laid off only some workers, whites often had seniority and were retained. And even for whites who were laid off, the prosperity of the white parts of the city insured that new businesses would spring up there, offering jobs suitable for former assembly line workers. Such jobs have generally not appeared in black sections.
The result is a city of 628,000 people where black men stand idle on street corners just blocks from the breweries and factories that used to employ them, while well-dressed white-collar workers sell insurance or computers out of some of those same factories, now converted into office parks.
 
Murder Rate Soars, Too
 More than half of all black Milwaukeeans are on some form of public assistance. The city has one of the highest black unemployment rates in the country, 20.1 percent. And its homicide rate, fueled by a new and thriving drug trade, doubled in three years to a record 165 in 1990, from 78 in 1988.
Business leaders argue that Milwaukee's social problems are far from the nation's worst, but many acknowledge that the city's overall health makes the pockets of sickness more vivid.
"I dare say that our black community is not in any worse shape than blacks in Detroit or Cleveland or other cities," said Robert H. Milbourne, executive director of the Greater Milwaukee Committee, a group of business leaders. "But here the rest of the economy is doing so well, that it sticks out."
With its social problems thus amplified, Milwaukee offers a striking glimpse of how a shifting economy can create winners and losers along racial lines. "Historically, our cities have been the machines of mobility for low-income people," said Dr. Mark Hughes, an assistant professor of public affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. "Now those machines seem to be broken."
A University of Chicago study has listed Milwaukee, where blacks are nearly a third of the population, as one of five cities whose patterns of segregation were so clear that they were deemed "hypersegregated." Most white residents live on the south side of the city with its neat bungalows and frame houses, or along the lakefront with its mansions and luxury condominiums. Most blacks live on the north side in neighborhoods dominated by worn "two-flats," or duplexes. Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Newark were other cities cited as hypersegregated.
The prosperity of Milwaukee has done little for Anthony Hoskins, a 28-year-old black resident who had a hard time remembering his last full-time job. It was as an Army sergeant, he finally said, nearly two years ago.
 
Dozens of Job Rejections
 Since then, Mr. Hoskins has had part-time and temporary jobs as a security guard, a janitor, a factory worker and a construction worker. He has applied at businesses around the city -- Wendy's, Pick 'n' Save, K Mart, McDonald's, Wisconsin Bell, Harley-Davidson and dozens of others. Usually, he said, he does not hear from them again. And if he does, he is told that he does not have the skills they are looking for.
"I'm in an endless cycle," Mr. Hoskins said. "How am I going to get qualifications if I never get a chance? You got 16-, 17-year-old white kids working and here I am a grown man, an Army veteran, and I can't get a damn job. I've even said, 'Give me a probationary period. I'll work for half the pay. Just give me a chance.' "
White residents see the city, whose Gothic towers and church spires could as easily be in Munich, through a different prism. "It's a clean and beautiful city," said Mary McGrath, who is white, lives on the lakefront and teaches at a private school. "I know there are a lot of racial problems. It's very entrenched. People tend to stay in their own enclaves. It's more fear than anything else. It makes me sick to think about it."
The economic changes have left a widening gulf between disgruntled blacks and perplexed whites, some officials say, and have even touched off a revival of the Black Panthers, with members threatening violence if the situation does not improve.
"Black people see one thing, whites see another," said Annette Polly Williams, a Democratic state representative, who is black. "We are not included in this new prosperity. The struggle is, how do we fit into the new order?"
 
Steps to Fight Poverty
 The question confounds city and state officials who have put into motion a variety of initiatives to fight poverty and welfare dependency.
Last year the state permitted some poor parents to enroll their children in private schools at state expense. Last month Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, proposed that welfare checks for teen-age mothers be cut unless the women got married. And next September, two new schools, known as African American Immersion Schools, will begin focusing on the needs of black boys.
"The economic problems are severe, and we're trying to deal with them," said Mayor John O. Norquist. "We do have problems, but it is not like walking into the South Bronx."
Mr. Norquist has tried to lend racial balance to city government by hiring more minority members as department heads than any previous administration. But his critics say that such moves have little effect on the average out-of-work black resident and that a resentment appears to be welling up.
That anger has found a voice in Michael McGee, a black alderman who started the Black Panther Militia last year and vowed to take violent action if his demands were not met by 1995.
He says that his group has a membership of 600 and that its activities so far have been limited to unarmed neighborhood patrols. But Mr. McGee has not backed away from his threats of violence.
"There's something brewing in Milwaukee and it ain't beer," Mr. McGee said. "Things are not booming in the black community. The only new construction is churches, and the No. 1 employer is drugs."
 
Opportunity Used to Abound
 The diagnosis was not always so bleak in the black neighborhoods. They were once vibrant communities that attracted thousands of immigrants from the South from the 1940's to the 1970's to work in factories and foundries. One in three jobs was in manufacturing; people with high school diplomas could buy a house and live well.
"I remember when you could quit one job one day and go out the next day and get a better job making more money," said Lawrence Hunter, a 48-year-old machinery operator who is black and unemployed. "You could go to a foundry and get a job any day. It was hard-bull work, but if push came to shove there was a job for you."
Then came the recession of the early 1980's. Debt-laden factories laid off workers or closed. Even Schlitz, "the beer that made Milwaukee famous," shut its brewery. From 1979 to 1983, Milwaukee lost 60,000, or more than a fourth, of its manufacturing jobs.
"We fell farther and faster than a lot of other cities," said Timothy Sheehy, executive vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. "We took a tremendous kick in the teeth."
In the decade since that recession, Milwaukee has reinvented its economy. It has recast an outdated manufacturing sector and bolstered it with tens of thousands of service jobs.
Moreover, the nature of the current recession may have actually helped the city. The slump 10 years ago was marked by high interest rates, which were perilous for debt-dependent manufacturing concerns, and a strong dollar, which effectively shut off export markets. Now the reverse is true, making it easier for manufacturers to borrow money and sell overseas.
 
City Rarity: A Fiscal Cushion
 Milwaukee is in its 88th straight month of job growth, state figures say, and in the last five years has had job growth second only to San Diego's, another study found. It ended the last fiscal year with a surplus of $58 million, or 15 percent of its expenditures.
But the city has been able to restore only 9,000 of the 60,000 lost manufacturing jobs, and manufacturing now accounts for less than one in four jobs. About 100 manufacturing jobs will be created in the coming months when Steeltech Manufacturing, a new minority-owned steel fabrication concern backed by several Milwaukee businesses, gets off the ground.
"The rain barrel gets full with drops like that," Mr. Sheehy said.
But people like Mr. McGee say it will take a lot more raindrops to bring blacks to a par with whites. On a recent drive downtown, he surveyed the restaurants that look like castles, and the skyscrapers with glass and marble atriums, then paused just as Old World Third Street, a major downtown avenue, turned into Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, with its boarded storefronts and abandoned lots.
"Look out there," he said, pointing to the condominiums on the Milwaukee River and the skyline beyond. "Don't it look beautiful? The other world is living good. Go a few blocks and it changes before your eyes."

HEADLINE: BUSH SEEKS TO TAP FEDERAL RESERVE TO AID BANK FUND

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Seeking to keep the Federal deposit insurance program afloat, the Bush Administration will propose that bank regulators be able to increase the amount they can borrow by $25 billion, Administration officials said today.
Under the proposal, which will be sent to Congress this week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would be given the authority to borrow $25 billion from the Federal Reserve, on top of the $5 billion it can now borrow from the Treasury. Any money borrowed, along with interest, would be repaid through increased bank contributions to the bank insurance fund. 
 Administration officials said they decided to take this approach instead of relying on the Treasury for further lending to avoid even the appearance of using taxpayer funds.
 
Help for Solvent Institutions
 The increased borrowing authority would be used to rescue the depositors at insolvent banks as well as to give additional help to ailing but solvent institutions under a current program known as "open assistance."
In recent weeks, regulators and the Administration have been considering ways to enlarge the program, particularly in New England, which has been hit hard by the recession. But critics have said that providing cash to solvent banks props up unhealthy institutions and that increasing the program provides opportunities for political manipulation.
The Administration's proposal is largely an endorsement of a similiar one made three weeks ago by L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
The precarious financial condition of the bank insurance fund and the growing crisis in the nation's banking industry have raised concerns about a replay of the bailout of the savings and loan fund, which is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The rising rate of large bank failures has left the bank fund at its lowest level since it was created in 1934 during the Great Depression.
The fund currently has $8.4 billion, or about 43 cents per $100 in deposits, and it is estimated that it will decline to 19 cents by the end of the year. Federal law has set $1.25 per $100 as the goal that should be sought by regulators.
It is too early to determine whether Congress will ultimately support the Treasury's plan, although the Congressional Budget Office has already recommended increasing the borrowing authority of the F.D.I.C. by another $5 billion, to $10 billion.
 
Optimism on Prospects
 But Mr. Seidman appeared optimistic today about the Administration plan's prospects. "My guess is that the reception on Capitol Hill will be pretty good, because it meets our needs and their needs," Mr. Seidman said in an interview. "Their No. 1 interest is that the taxpayer not get stuck with the bill. This meets that interest."
The Treasury Department's endorsement of Mr. Seidman's plan came in a letter today to him from Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber.
The original proposal by Mr. Seidman, who has enjoyed an alternately warm and cold relationship with the White House, did not detail where the borrowed money should come from.
When Mr. Seidman announced his plan, Treasury officials declined to comment. In early January, the Treasury disclosed a plan to overhaul the banking industry that included a measure to take away much of the F.D.I.C.'s authority, and that was seen by lawmakers and many in the industry as a slap at Mr. Seidman.
But the Administration has denied that it was aimed specifically at him, and more recently Treasury officials have backpedaled and said the attempt to entirely strip the F.D.I.C. of much of its authority had been "a mistake."
Unlike the bailout of the savings and loan industry, in which Congress set up a corporation that raises money by selling bonds in the marketplace and uses taxpayer funds to pay the interest, the replenishing of the bank insurance fund through Federal Reserve borrowings should be considerably less expensive because it will enable regulators to obtain lower interest rates.
The rates of interest charged for the loans and any other conditions, such as the type of collateral that would need to be posted by banks requesting open assistance, would be set by the Federal Reserve.
 
Equal to Treasury Rate
 Administration officials said the interest rate would be equal to the Treasury rate paid for borrowings of comparable maturity, which is lower than what the Government would be able to obtain from investors.
The Administration also said the premiums banks pay to the deposit insurance fund would be increased for every $1 billion drawn by the F.D.I.C. from the Federal Reserve.
As part of the proposal, the Administration will recommend that Congress cap the premiums paid by banks to the insurance fund at 30 cents per $100 in deposits. Last fall, Congress, at the urging of Treasury officials, had lifted all restrictions on premium increases.
After raising premiums from 12 cents to 19.5 cents in January, the F.D.I.C. has said it will increase premiums this summer to 23 cents per $100 in deposits, a 92 percent jump from last year. The increase will help to finance $10 billion in loans to keep the bank insurance fund from becoming insolvent by the end of this year, as some economists have predicted.
Mr. Seidman, whose term as chairman of the F.D.I.C. and of the Resolution Trust Corporation expires in the fall, estimated today that the F.D.I.C. would need to borrow only that $10 billion this year.
 
Premium Rise Would Be Needed
 Mr. Seidman has said previously that borrowing an $15 billion beyond that would require a premium increase of 5.25 cents per $100 in deposits.
In addition to its existing line of credit with the Treasury, the F.D.I.C. has the authority to borrow based on a formula pegged to its net worth. Its present net worth enables it to borrow about $65 billion, but that amount will dwindle as the insurance fund continues to pay out more than the contributions it receives from the industry.
The F.D.I.C. already has the authority to provide open assistance to banks by lending them funds, but in the last two years it has only exercised that authority twice, with two small institutions. Last September it provided $2.5 million to the Pawnee National Bank of Pawnee, Okla.; in 1989 it lent $2.3 million to the Metropolitan National Bank of San Antonio.
 
Viewed as Taxpayer Bailout
 On the outlook for Congressional passage of the Treasury's plan, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, has expressed concerns about borrowing from any source. Any borrowing would be ultimately guaranteed by the Government and he views these guarantees as a form of a taxpayer bailout.
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat, has not commented on Mr. Seidman's plan, saying only that he awaits the Administration's legislation.
"Congress is going to be extremely wary about doing anything that resembles a taxpayer bailout," a Congressional aide said. The strongest sign of the reluctance of Congress in the area came last week when the House voted by only a narrow margin to continue financing the savings and loan bailout.

HEADLINE: First-Time Buyers Aid Home Sales

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Lower interest rates and a backlog of unsold low-priced homes are pushing first-time buyers back into the housing market again after many years.
Their buying is adding to the small spurt in real estate activity that was detected first in the sluggish Northeast late in January and that has now spread across the country. The influx of first-time buyers is also making it possible for some homeowners to sell and move up to bigger homes. 
 "We are seeing a resurgence of the first-time buyers in the market," said Pall Spera, head of Pall Spera Realtors in Stowe, Vt., whose comments were echoed by brokers from Los Angeles to Miami.
 
A Deal After a Year and a Half
 Typical of the first-time buyers are Ketty and Jean Felix Day, who recently bought a three-bedroom, two-bath house in north Miami for $75,000. The couple, who got a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 9 percent, had been looking for about a year and a half.
The Days, who together earn about $43,000, said the key to their purchase was monthly mortgage payments of no more than $800. Six months ago, they said, the house would have cost at least $80,000, and interest rates were higher. As both came down, so did the mortgage cost; their monthly payment is $728.
"We were just looking last year, but the interest rates were very high, and I knew that the interest rates would go lower," said Mrs. Day, a 32-year-old editorial assistant for an airline magazine.
 
Word of Real Estate Agents
 While there are no specific measures of activity by first-time home buyers like the Days, real estate agents say such buyers have been out in force. Moreover, home sales have been strongest at the lower end of the market, typically the province of the new buyers.
First-time buyers have been among those most hurt by high housing prices because they have been unable to save enough money for a down payment.
High interest rates compounded their problems, because even if they could raise the down payment, they often were unable to make the monthly mortgage payments.
This picture has changed sharply in recent months. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation this month pronounced the current housing market the most affordable since 1977. The agency looks at affordability in terms of average family income, housing prices and mortgage rates.
 
Single-Digit Rates Help
 Fixed-rate mortgages are now being offered at about 9 3/8 percent, while adjustable-rate mortgages are available at about 7 3/8 percent. Adjustable-rate mortgages are reset -- usually annually -- depending on other interest rates.
"I think the psychology of single-digit rates has very, very positive connotations," said Dick Ritchey, regional director and owner of Century 21's south Florida office in Miami.
The Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, one of the nation's leading private mortgage insurance companies, is also reporting that houses are now more affordable for first-time buyers than they have been in several years. And by paying a premium of several thousand dollars for mortgage insurance, buyers can often secure a home with a small down payment.
The apparent uptick in activity is too recent to have shown up in national figures on home sales, which still appeared to be falling in January. According to preliminary figures from the National Association of Realtors, owners sold 2.91 million houses in January, down from 3.13 million in December and the 3.47 million sold in January 1990.
Statistics on newly built houses, which usually trail the sale of older homes especially when the economy is coming out of a slump, also showed a decline. In January 408,000 new homes were sold, down 12 percent from 465,000 in December, and down 35 percent from 627,000 in January 1990.
 
Signs of Recovery
 But Leland C. Brendsel, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, said last week that he thought the recession in the housing market had bottomed out and that it should show clear signs of recovery by midyear.
Another encouraging sign for the housing industry is the increased traffic at new subdivision sites. Many subdivisions consist of lower-priced homes aimed at new buyers. According to a monthly survey by the National Association of Homebuilders, 42 percent of the 300 builders surveyed reported that traffic was in the high to average range in February, up from 24 percent in January. Both months are generally the worst time of the year for home sales.
PHH Homequity Inc., a Wilton, Conn., firm that handles relocation of employees for corporate clients, is also seeing improvement in some housing markets, including Fairfield County, Conn.; northern New Jersey; Washington, D.C., and in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif. It said its offers for homes are now being outbid by other potential buyers.
The relocation firm, which deals with homes in the upper-middle-income segment of the residential market, said it saw a 7 percent increase, seasonally adjusted, in its housing market indicator, which tracks the rate of sold and unsold inventory and the rate at which sellers accept first bids. It maintains a data base of 10,000 houses across the country.
 
'A Significant Improvement'
 "Although a month does not a trend make, in January we saw a significant improvement after seeing a decline for the previous six months," said Stephen Fragapane, president of PHH.
While Mr. Fragapane and others are encouraged, they caution that the revival is a far cry from a fully recovered market. The January figures underlined how weak the market has been, with existing homes selling at their lowest rate in seven years and sales of new homes at their lowest in nearly nine years.
Nevertheless, the real estate industry is optimistic that the recent surge signals the start of a turnaround.
The median sales prices of existing homes in most regions of the nation are down significantly from their 1989 highs. In the Northeast, for example, which still has the highest median sales prices of any section of the country, the median is now $141,200, down from $148,800 in 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors.
People shopping for houses are also finding themselves in heated competitive bidding situations.
 
Midwest a Different Story
 "A couple of our managers are talking about multiple offers again, and our inventory is decreasing," said Gail Carriero, a marketing representative in the San Francisco office of the Coldwell Banker Residential Group.
Similar reports are coming from brokers in the Los Angeles area, Dallas, Phoenix and in southern Florida, as well as in Boston, Vermont and elsewhere in upper New England.
The Midwest is a different story. The drop in prices and consumer demand did not hit that region as hard last year as it did other sections of the country, and now brokers say they have not seen a sharp increase in sales since January. In Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana, brokers did not see the precipitous fall in sales and consumer demand last year that buffeted their colleagues in other regions. They have been experiencing a slow decline in sales and demand but that has not been interrupted by a sharp rise in the last few weeks.
"I don't think there's been an increase," said Steven Pew, head of Max Brooch Realtors in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and regional vice president of the National Association of Realtors. "There has been a slight downturn over the past few months, but it has been in the single digits," said Mr. Pew, who said the situation might worsen quickly if car sales did not improve soon.
 
Improvement in California
 In California, where the weakening of the housing market was not as severe as on the East Coast, brokers from San Diego to San Francisco are reporting improved activity at the lower end of the market.
Brad and Kifa Nantz, a young professional couple in the San Francisco Bay area, are among those who did not think they would soon see the confluence of low prices and low rates again. Although they had been looking for more than a year, the couple stepped up their search in January and put their condominium on the market. A few weeks ago they sold their one-bedroom condo for $193,500 (they bought it in 1989 for $157,000) and bought a three-bedroom, three-bath house on a golf course in San Ramone, Calif., for $310,000. In San Ramone, such prices put the young couple at the lower-middle end of the market.
The Nantzes got a 30-year mortgage that is fixed at 8 7/8 percent for the first three years and then becomes adjustable.
"We had our open house the day the war started," said the 29-year-old Mr. Nantz, who said that at first he and his wife thought the timing was a disaster. But their condo sold within weeks. The Nantzes got a mortgage for $191,000 on their new house.
"We felt that this was a good time and the rates had a lot to do with it," Mrs. Nantz said.

HEADLINE: In Messages, Officers Banter After Beating in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 18

 BODY:
Police officers who had just beaten a black motorist were relaxed and even jocular in their communications with each other and with a desk officer, according to transcripts released by the police today.
In addition to lighthearted banter in the transcripts of computer communications among squad cars, an audio tape of police communications at the scene ends with a call for an ambulance followed by the sound of laughter. 
 Comdr. Rick Dinse, who is heading the investigation of the incident for the Police Department, said the tape indicated that the officers at the scene knew the motorist's injuries were serious and that "there was some levity over it."
In the transcripts of communications among the squad cars moments after the beating of Rodney G. King on March 3, a supervising officer at the scene, identified by a police spokesman as Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, typed out, "You just had a big-time use of force."
The reply from the police communications desk was: "Oh well. I'm sure the lizard didn't deserve it. Ha, ha. I'll let them know, O.K."
Then Sergeant Koon sent a message asking for a fresh supply of darts for the Taser stun gun that was fired at Mr. King at the time of the beating.
The comments from the sergeant and other officers seem to show them treating the beating as an ordinary incident, lending support to critics who say it is not unusual for Los Angeles police officers to use force with little provocation.
At 1:12 A.M., about 15 minutes after the beating ended, the transcripts show that a patrol officer sent the message, "Oops." The Police Department spokesman, Fred Nixon, said the two officers in the car sending this transmission were Laurence M. Powell and Timothy E. Wind.
In another squad car, an officer who was apparently not at the scene responded, "Oops what?" The dialogue went on:
FIRST CAR. I haven't beaten anyone this bad in a long time.
SECOND CAR. Oh not again. Why for you do that? Thought you agreed to chill out for a while. What did he do?
FIRST CAR. I think he was dusted. Many broken bones later. After the pursuit.
The use of the word "dusted" appears to refer to the officer's suspicion that Mr. King had been taking the drug phencyclidine, commonly known as PCP or angel dust. Tests later found no trace of drugs in his system.
Sergeant Koon and Officers Powell and Wind, along with Officer Theodore J. Briseno, were indicted last week on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and are scheduled to enter their pleas this Friday.
The officers were using miniature computers fitted into their squad cars to communicate among themselves and a supervisor at the station. A police spokesman said the computers were used to supplement the heavily used voice communications system.
All police radio communications are routinely tape-recorded and preserved for some time.
The Police Department released the transcripts today at the request of Mayor Tom Bradley, through his appointed Police Commission, which oversees the department.
Earlier today, Chief Daryl F. Gates expressed his own thoughts about the victim, Mr. King, saying he hoped he would make use of the experience to embark on a better life.
Surrounded by yellow ribbons hung on his behalf at police headquarters, Chief Gates told a hundreds of cheering police officers and department employees that he would not heed widespread calls for his resignation.
 
'We Regret What Took Place'
 In response to a question, he said Mr. King and his family deserved an apology for the beating. "We regret what took place," the Chief went on. "I hope he gets his life straightened out. Perhaps this will be the vehicle to move him down the road to a good life instead of the life he's been involved in for such a long time."
Mr. King, 25 years old, was unemployed and on parole at the time of the beating. He had just completed six months in prison on a sentence for an armed robbery conviction. He had previously been convicted of trying to hire a prostitute,
Mr. King was not charged in the incident, in which the police said he was stopped for speeding.
He is in a hospital recovering from surgery to repair a shattered eye socket. His doctors say he suffered multiple skull fractures, a broken leg, injuries to both knees, a concussion, nerve damage and possible brain damage.
 
Emotional Support
 In recent days calls for the Chief's resignation have come from community leaders here and from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware.
The Chief has many supporters in the police force and the community, and the reception for him this morning was loud and emotional.
"I will be here," he told reporters at his office this morning. "I will stay here and I will fight any attempt to get rid of me. I will fight it with all the effort I have."
Chief Gates, 64, has headed the Los Angeles Police Department for 13 years. As a civil service appointee, he can be removed only for cause after a proceeding of the five-member Police Commission.

The Economy
Seeking to keep Federal deposit insurance afloat, the Administration will propose that bank regulators be able to increase the amount they can borrow by $25 billion.

HEADLINE: French TV Seeks a Slice of the Hollywood Pie

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 17

 BODY:
The idea is quite simple: If American movies are invariably the biggest box-office hits in France, if 40 percent of movies shown on French television are American, why not invest directly in Hollywood productions? Two new production companies with ties to French television channels have decided to do just that.
"It's a bit like renting lots of apartments in a building," explained Rene Bonnell, who runs Studio Canal-Plus, a new production company with $220 million in capital and ambitions to match. "You pay so much rent that you might as well become a co-proprietor." 
 Certainly for the pay-television channel, Canal-Plus , which controls Studio Canal-Plus, the logic of owning a piece of the movie industry is apparent. Last year, it paid some $130 million for the right to show about 160 American films to its 2.8 million subscribers in France.
A similar logic appears to be behind the other new production company, Ciby 2000. It is owned by the construction magnate Francis Bouygues, who is also the largest shareholder of TF-1, France's most widely viewed television channel.
"The great problem of television is to have images," Mr. Bouygues told the French magazine Le Moniteur, last year. "Yet the basis for interesting images is not television films but cinema. Production is an activity that will grow. That's why I have created Ciby 2000."
 
The First Projects
 The two companies, though, are not limiting themselves to infiltrating Hollywood with their money. Both plan to finance French films, to seek out new European directors and to participate in the growing number of multinational productions, which accounted for 65 of the 146 films made here last year.
They have also completed their first projects. Studio Canal-Plus has co-financed Maurice Pialat's "Van Gogh," which will be released here this spring, while Ciby 2000 was the main investor in Jean-Loup Hubert's "Reine Blanche" ("The White Queen"), starring Catherine Denueve, which will be released this summer.
Unsurprisingly, their arrival has already made a big impact on the French movie industry, which has long depended on the Government to provide seed money. After only a few months, Studio Canal-Plus and Ciby 2000 have emerged as major players, at least in France.
But in many ways, the two companies are very different. Canal-Plus, which is principally a movie channel, has been so successful that it has now invested in similar pay-television channels in Belgium, Spain and Germany. Showing 400 different films in France alone last year, its revenues exceeded $1.1 billion.
Bolstered by these revenues, it has held onto 60 percent of Studio Canal-Plus, with 25 percent owned by the powerful Havas communications group, 10 percent by Societe Generale and 5 percent by the Banque Nationale de Paris. There are plans to increase its capital to $300 million this year.
 
The American Contacts
 Studio Canal-Plus has also benefited from Mr. Bonnell's long experience as Canal-Plus's main purchaser of foreign movies, and it has moved quickly to sign co-production accords with major American studios.
It has agreed with Mel Brooks Productions to co-produce two films a year for the next three years. It has signed with Warner Brothers to make 20 films in the next five years with Arnon Milchan as producer, including Oliver Stone's "J. F. K." Last year it bought 5 percent of Carolco Productions and it will soon co-finance Robert Redford's "Dark Wind."
In France, too, Studio Canal-Plus is active, participating in six new movies, including one by Roman Polanski that is to begin shooting in June this year. Mr. Bonnell soon hopes to co-produce films directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Bertrand Tavernier and Jacques Doillon.
"It's true that making films in English facilitates their export," Mr. Bonnell said, "but you can do well with smaller budget films in other languages if they have quality, such as Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 'Cyrano de Bergerac." It's also important to make films not spoken in English because that's how you find new directors."
For Studio Canal-Plus, there is another good reason to finance French films. Unable to force Americans to watch French movies, the Government requires that French films account for 50 percent of all cinema shown on television here. Ten percent may be other European films, and American movies are limited to 40 percent.
 
A Different Style
 In contrast, Mr. Bouygues's relationship with cinema appears to be more personal. According to those who know the 68-year-old multimillionaire, he set up Ciby 2000 as a way to keep busy during his retirement after he handed over the reins of his vast construction group to his son, Martin, last year.
So far, Mr. Bouygues, who owns 100 percent of Ciby 2000, and his manager, the French film director Jean-Claude Fleury, have refused to speak publicly about their activities, reportedly because they plan to unveil the new company with much fanfare at the Cannes International Film festival in May.
But Mr. Bouygues's approach is said to involve agreements with big-name directors and film stars rather than with American studios. According to people in the industry, he has already signed multi-movie deals with the director David Lynch and the French actress Isabelle Adjani. He is also reportedly negotiating with the directors Bernardo Bertolucci, Francis Ford Coppola and Pedro Almodovar.
How much Mr. Bouygues is willing to spend remains a mystery, but what one French film expert described as Mr. Bouygues's checkbook strategy is causing concern inside France's Culture Ministry, where officials fear it could cause an inflationary competition for talent that might hurt the entire industry.
One Culture Ministry official said the Government welcomed new participation in an industry "where money is never enough." But echoing the ministry's constant battle to limit the influence of American movies here, he added: "We want them to put good money into the French and European cinema and not just into Hollywood."

HEADLINE: Gains Seen in Study of African Sleeping Sickness Parasite

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
A MONG the many parasites that infect and kill human beings, perhaps none is so bizarre as the wormlike creature that causes African sleeping sickness.
The organism, Trypanosoma brucei, is able to change its outer coat into as many as a thousand different shapes, thereby constantly eluding the immune system. And several features of its genetic makeup are unlike anything else yet observed. 
 In fact, so peculiar is the parasite that until the last year or so, researchers barely knew how it reproduced, let alone how any part of that life cycle might be blocked.
Now scientists have at last learned how to manipulate and replace the genes of the protozoan, raising hopes that they will soon identify the switching mechanism that controls its ability to change from one slippery cloak to another. The new genetic machinations may also allow researchers to grow a harmless strain of the parasite that could be used in a vaccine.
"It's enormously valuable to be able to go for the genes," said Dr. Larry Simpson, a molecular biologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has long studied the trypanosome. "It blows the field wide open."
In a report in the current issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore announced that they had prodded trypanosomes in the laboratory to exchange their native copy of an important gene for a mutant copy of the gene that had been designed through genetic engineering techniques. The work demonstrated that 100 percent of the time scientists can replace the parasite's own gene with a doctored version that destroys at least part of the trypanosome's ability to thrive.
In the new work, the scientists interfered with the gene that allows parasites to absorb calcium, a critical biochemical step in maturation.
Other researchers have recently reported similar advances in Nature and other journals. "These things have outsmarted people for years," said Dr. Josiane Eid, an author of the new report. "But with the ability to manipulate the genes at our discretion, we now we have a chance to find the enzyme that's important for the whole process of varying the surface coat."
Sleeping sickness, which is transmitted through the bite of the tse-tse fly, causes significant medical and economic misery in central Africa. It infects about 10,000 people a year, and nearly all of them die within months. It also kills tens of thousands of cattle as the animals are driven from one grazing area to another.
Trypanosome lives and reproduces in the bloodstream and central nervous system, eventually using up most of the body's glucose. It seems nearly invincible. Each time the immune system manages to make antibodies to attack one type of outer protein coat on the protozoan, it adopts another coat style from its enormous repertoire.
"If you look at a smear of blood from an infected person, it's a horrifying thing," said Dr. Barbara Sollner-Webb, another author of the report. "You can see the normal red blood cells, which look like Cheerios, and then you see at least as many of these wiggly trypanosomes, which are pointed at one end and have flagella on the other."
Scientists have recently discovered some real genetic oddities about the trypanosome. In most creatures, different proteins of the body are made from neighboring building blocks on the DNA molecule. But in trypanosome, a single protein can be stitched together from pieces of biochemical material found on widely dispersed parts of the DNA. That talent seems to give the creature extraordinary genetic flexibility.

HEADLINE: Treated Mosquito Nets May Offer Best Hope Against Malaria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Outwitted by Malaria, Desperate Doctors Seek New Remedies" (Science Times, Feb. 12): The world public health community is greatly concerned with the spread of this deadly disease and with the difficulty in providing effective treatment in endemic areas at a cost that can be borne locally. The new drugs you mention cost far more than chloroquine and cannot be distributed through the primary health care network. Thus they cannot be considered part of the armamentarium to attack this disease in most endemic areas.
An important approach that you do not mention is being tested by research workers from the United States and other countries. This is to develop a community-based intervention to attack the anopheline mosquito, the main source of infection. The method is based on new, safe pyrethroid insecticides, which can be used to treat nylon mosquito nets. The nets then become effective in killing and repelling mosquitoes. 
 Research in Africa and other parts of the world over the last eight years suggests the method will be effective and inexpensive. The nets, obtainable for $3 to $4 each, provide protection as well as killing the mosquitoes. The cost of insecticide is about 50 cents for a treatment that will last about six months.
The research involved is arduous and expensive. However, the Africa Bureau of the Agency for International Development recently provided support for a project developed by workers at the Johns Hopkins University and the Muhimbili Medical Center in Dar es Salaam to conduct a large, community-based intervention using these nets in Tanzania. The project involves social science studies to see how the local people view the problem of malaria and to educate them in the use of the mosquito nets. Approximately 20,000 nets will be distributed at subsidized cost, and the effect on the local mosquitoes and the incidence of malaria in those who use the nets will be evaluated.
There is a need to encourage entomologists and field malariologists in this low-tech approach. Where the laboratory-based sciences have run into serious problems, the field malaria worker may once more come to the forefront.

HEADLINE: Fax Displacing Manhattan Bike Couriers

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
They whooshed through the streets of Manhattan, members of a mobile cottage industry born of the incompatibility of big-city gridlock and the need to get important papers from one office to another right away. They were bicycle messengers, fearless and feared as they raced through red lights, around vehicles and sometimes into pedestrians.
But now the messengers have largely disappeared, victims of a speedier service they cannot match -- the facsimile machine -- and a business requirement they cannot meet -- insurance. 
 The consensus of authorities and some of the surviving services is that the ranks have thinned significantly from the mid-80's, when there were thousands of messengers working for about 200 services with whiz-bang names like Atomic, Fireball, Bullet and Zoom.
"We still get them in for flat tires, but their numbers have fallen sharply in recent years," said David Vandervere, sales manager for Bicycle Renaissance on Amsterdam Avenue near 84th Street, which has been in business for 20 years.
The nature of the messengers' work has never lent itself to a precise census. Most of the services, which came and went almost as fast as the bikers rode, did not even bother to list themselves in the telephone book.
Official documentation is even scarcer. For years, the services existed without licenses or monitoring by city agencies; most paid their workers in cash, operating outside the paper trails of tax laws, unemployment benefits and Social Security. When the state and the Federal Government did begin to focus on the services and their insurance problems, it was the beginning of the end.
What records do exist come from the police and traffic officers.
"It's hard to document, but there's no doubt that the public doesn't perceive them as the physical menace that they did years ago," said Police Capt. Richard P. Morrison, commander of the Manhattan Traffic Division.
 
Statistics Tell a Story
 From 1981 to 1985, accidents involving bicycles rose 77 percent in the city and then began to decrease steadily, said Gerard Soffian, assistant commissioner of traffic planning in the city's Department of Transportation.
In 1987, 25,982 traffic tickets were issued to cyclists, most of them messengers; 4,246 accidents were reported between bicycles and cars, and 510 pedestrians were hit by bicycles.
By 1989, traffic tickets had declined to 19,533, bicycle-car accidents to 3,544 and pedestrians hit by bicycles to 327.
The cyclists paid a price for their daring: from 1981 through 1986, an average of two a year died in accidents, and countless others were injured.
One of those statistics is Robert T. Dolan, then a freshman at New York University, who described himself as a very experienced cyclist, well able to operate in Manhattan traffic. He lasted three weeks as a messenger in the summer of 1988. Riding on Lexington Avenue at 38th Street, he swerved to avoid another cyclist, was brushed by a car and fell, breaking his left wrist.
"That was enough for me," he said.
 
Mayoral Intervention Blocked
 To calm public concerns, Mayor Edward I. Koch's administration proposed banning cyclists on weekdays from three of their favorite north-south speedways: Fifth, Park and Madison Avenues. That created an outcry by, among others, environmentalists who supported bicyling as a way to reduce air pollution.
Then a State Supreme Court justice ruled that the city was all wrong in the way it planned to impose the ban, so in April 1988 the measure died quietly, as did a proposal to create a special administrative court to deal with two-wheeled violators.
But what the city could not do, technology did. The standard "I'll send it over right away by messenger" rapidly changed to "What's your fax number?"
Sales of facsimile machines have risen sharply, from 145,000 nationwide in 1985 to an estimated total of 1.6 million last year, according to a study by Datapro Research Group, a research concern.
Still, not everyone has a fax number, and some messages are too bulky to be transmitted through telephone cables.
James Boyle, a senior vice president for administration for Ogilvy & Mather Public Relations, said, "We still do quite a business with the messenger services." But in sending something from here to there, Mr. Boyle said he was not sure how it actually made the trip.
 
Adapting to Change
 Most messengers go by subway, others by foot or by car and some still by bicycle, said Michael D. Jabick, president of the Barjac Courier Service, which counts Ogilvy & Mather among its clients. "It depends on who's available," he said. "Sometimes a customer thinks a bike messenger is faster. Others think they're more irresponsible."
Mr. Jabick is a new messenger entrepreneur, in the business three years -- "I came in when the fax was already here." He has, he said, doubled his business in each of those years as, in tempo with other parts of corporate America, he and his partner, Barrett Wolf, absorb smaller companies. His new company name will soon be the Barjac/ Royal Courier Service with 53 messengers, 10 of whom use bicycles.
Life in the big city became intolerable for many of the small courier services about four years ago when New York State and the Federal Government decided that the services and the bikers had the traditional employee-employer relationship. The courier services had maintained that the messengers were independent contractors.
The distinction meant that the employers were subject, many of them retroactively, to all the expense and regulation of laws on workers' compensation, Social Security and unemployment benefits.
"It killed a lot of the smaller companies," said Mr. Jabick. As his company's gross income rose to $500,000 a year, he was able to absorb the more than $50,000 in yearly costs for insurance and the other programs, he said.
Carlos, who shrugged off a request for his last name, is one who is living the harrowing life of a cyclist, earning about $300 for a 40-hour week.
He has been in three accidents in the year he has been a messenger, he said, landing once in the hospital with a crushed shoulder. He has no insurance, he said as he locked his bike to scaffolding in front of the Grace Building on the Avenue of the Americas at 43d Street.
"I know of three who have been killed doing this," he said. "It's a tough life."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about bicycle messengers misstated the number of bicyclists who died in accidents in New York City in 1981 through 1986. The annual average was 16.
The article also misstated the origin of Barjac Couriers/Royal Delivery Systems Inc. It was formed by a merger of two companies.
The article also referred erroneously to Bullet Services. Neither the company nor its subsidiaries has used bicycle messengers.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Senator Blurs the Party Line

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
In a city where political brand names are important identification, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut might be labeled Brand X.
He votes Democratic, sounds Republican and puts a plague on both political houses. 
 "Democrats have continued to have this idea that what we have to do is throw money at problems and any help to the private sector is a giveaway to the rich," Mr. Lieberman observed during a chat in his office the other day. "Republicans, on the other hand, have given a message that they don't care much about meeting social needs."
And where does that leave Joe Lieberman?
He reflects only a moment. "I am an amalgam of various opinions," he said. "I'm conservative on foreign policy and the crime thing. If you insist, I reject all labels and say I'm independent." But he will, he says, accept "eclectic."
 
Ribicoff Is His Hero
 Politics is a continuing exercise in research and development for Mr. Lieberman, who is now in the middle of his first term as a Democratic senator, after serving for 10 years in the Connecticut Senate and later as the state's attorney general. His professed political hero is Abraham Ribicoff, the unabashed liberal governor and senator. Mr. Lieberman once wrote an admiring biography of John Bailey, the quintessential Connecticut Democrat who was state chairman for nearly three decades, from 1946 to 1975.
But when Mr. Lieberman defeated Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the incumbent Republican senator, by a hair-thin margin in 1988, he ran as a conservative. Since then, on the most visible issues, he has lined up with the Bush Administration, although a look at his overall record suggests that the tilt to the right is something of an optical illusion. Analyses by several groups have judged his voting record on the floor scarcely distinguishable from that of his Connecticut colleague, Christopher J. Dodd, who is nothing if not a loyal Democrat.
But on several high-profile issues, Mr. Lieberman seems at odds with his party.
He was, for example, one of only 10 Democrats in the Senate who voted to authorize military action in the Persian Gulf, the others being seven Southerners and the two Nevada senators.
He also favors the death penalty and a moment of silence for those who want to pray in public schools. He supported the invasion of Grenada and the bombing of Libya and he voted for a cut in the capital-gains tax. He is willing to experiment with a voucher system to allow parents to choose what school their children will attend -- even if it is a parochial school.
And he sometimes sounds as if he had stumbled on a cache of Ronald Reagan's old speeches, sprinkling an interview with comments like these:
*"Basically, our message, the Democrats' message, has been, 'We are going to take your money you worked so damn hard to earn and we are going to give it to a lot of people who don't work.' "
*"Work should be rewarded. We understand that middle-class people are breaking their backs so they and their kids can live better and it is our responsibility to make that happen, and not just to keep taking from them."
*"I supported the war in the gulf because I have a whole set of feelings about being strong in foreign policy -- that, like it or not, we live in an imperfect world, so, like it or not, you've got to stand up and fight. If I can be simplistic about it: If good people stand by while bad things are being done, evil will triumph."
*"The Democratic Party, the national party, in the last couple of decades has come to be seen as a party that cares only about social policy and not about economic policy, that only cares about meeting social needs and not making the economy go. It has focused on how to divide the pie and not on the fact the pie is shrinking."
 
Changing Liberalism
 Mr. Lieberman stresses that when he says things like this, he is deliberately oversimplifying. But he is firm in his belief that the liberal orthodoxy that has been central to the Democratic agenda since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt no longer applies.
"It's been almost 60 years since the New Deal began and a lot of it has run its course," he said. "It's not working, and that's natural. Very few ideas can remain vibrant and effective for a long time."
Then why be a Democrat?
That's easy, says Mr. Lieberman. It's the only humane thing to do.
"What has always distinguished the Democrats, and I hope will continue to distinguish them," he said, "is that they care about people's problems, and believe that government has an obligation to solve those problems. But what we have got to do is to redefine how that happens."
What all that means in practical terms is that Mr. Lieberman is not predictable. But he is less a maverick than some of his positions might indicate. The liberal Americans for Democratic Action, for example gives him a 75 percent rating in the current session, 10 points better than his colleague Mr. Dodd. The American Conservative Union, on the other hand, gave him a 32, a shade higher than Mr. Dodd's 22.
The Congressional Quarterly, moreover, found that Mr. Lieberman voted with the Democrats 87 percent of the time in 1990, only a bit under Mr. Dodd's 92 percent. A Dodd staff member notes that except for some high-profile issues like the gulf war, their voting records are similar. Thus Senator Lieberman said his working relationships within the party are good, although he admitted he "felt a bit lonely" on the gulf vote. "I was never put under any pressure," he said.
 
'A Real Up-and-Comer'
 "We're not talking about a conservative Republican in Democrats' clothing," said Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy study group. Mr. Ornstein rates Mr. Lieberman a standout among the Senate class of 1988, which also includes Charles Robb of Virginia and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
"The first time I met him, I said, 'This guy is a real up-and-comer,' and the more time I spent with him, the more I became convinced of it," Mr. Ornstein said.
Mr. Lieberman has been particularly active on environmental matters and wrote or helped write eight bills or substantial amendments that became law in the current Congress. He was a principal author of the Clean Air Act of 1990, and helped write the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990 that quadrupled the number of Environmental Protection Agency investigators. He was also active in developing legislation promoting international trade, affordable housing and measures to increase and improve tax collections by the Internal Revenue Service.
Although they share a penchant for independent thinking, Mr. Lieberman is in many way the antithesis of the man he replaced in the Senate, Mr. Weicker, who is now governor of Connecticut.
Mr. Weicker is a towering, aggressive figure who was given to stentorian outbursts on the Senate floor and passionate, sometimes self-righteous, attacks on others, including fellow Republicans.
Mr. Lieberman, on the other hand, is a smallish, thoughtful-seeming sort who turns the issues over and over and seldom raises his voice, which is deep and resonant and seems at times to be coming from somewhere behind him as he speaks.
But once convinced of the rightness of his position, he is seldom swayed. Indeed, back home in Connecticut, where he is seen as measured and moderate, some were surprised at the intensity of his stand on the war in the Persian Gulf.
But he is a man of strong commitments. For example, as an Orthodox Jew, he declined to appear at the Democratic convention to accept his own nomination because it was held on the Sabbath.
One of the men Mr. Lieberman says he admires most, Mr. Ribicoff, calls the Senator "a man of very great ability who I would consider a good senator."
 
Appeal to Republicans
 Mr. Ribicoff skirted the question of whether he agreed with Mr. Lieberman's positions, but conceded that his own record in office was "generally liberal," while "on the cutting edge of liberal and conservative issues, you'd have to say he's conservative."
But Mr. Lieberman's positions "come from his philosphy and he is sincere," said Mr. Ribicoff, who is in private law practice in New York and lives in Connecticut. "I don't think there is any hypocrisy at all."
Is Mr. Lieberman the wave of the future for the Democratic Party in Connecticut?
"No," said Mr. Ribicoff. "He is the wave of the future of the Republican Party."
What he means by that, Mr. Ribicoff said, is that in a fundamentally middle-of-the-road state like Connecticut, a Democrat is very close to a sure winner if he appeals to conservative Republicans -- many of whom regard Mr. Weicker, the former Republican, with something akin to loathing.
"It's very difficult," Mr. Ribicoff said of such a balancing act. "But I think he is comfortable with it."

HEADLINE: Lessons About Business And Hard Times as Well

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Britt Eastland frets about the recession like any other businessman.
Sales have declined. The budget to develop new business lines has been trimmed. And monthly company-wide lunches have been eliminated to conserve cash.
"It worries me," Mr. Eastland said quietly. "But we're trying hard."
Mr. Eastland sounds as if he is burdened by the weight of a Fortune 500 company, but he is all of 12 years old. He is the current president of the Hunt School Fifth and Sixth Grade Classes Inc. at Hunt Elementary School in south central Texas. The company was formed in 1973 and legally incorporated 10 years later. Since it started, education in Hunt's working-class community of about 600 people has not been quite the same. 
 The company's founder, Tracy Gilbreth, a teacher of the combined fifth and sixth grades at Hunt, has been making the most of this teaching tool for 18 years. The 31 youngsters in his class this year have been schooled in the ways of business, marketing and a host of other lessons unusual for 11-and 12-year-old students.
 
Learning by Doing
 "We all learn more by doing than by hearing," said Phil Neighbors, executive vice president of the Kerrville Area Chamber of Commerce and a big supporter of the Hunt students, who are members of the countywide chamber. "These kids would have been written off a long time ago if they were not serious, dedicated and effective."
The students produce and sell novelty items, run a snack stand, organize pancake suppers and other such fund-raising events. They visit business people in the community to ask questions as well.
In good times, the company has earned more than $40,000 in a single school year, allowing members to outfit the school's four classrooms with televisions and videocassette recorders one year, and remodel the principal's office another.
Some proceeds have been put into certificates of deposit and money market funds, and some money has treated class members -- those with passing grades -- to year-end trips, chaperoned by teachers or school board members, to the Caribbean, Los Angeles and New York.
 
Flip Side of Prosperity
 But as the recession takes root, Hunt School Fifth and Sixth Grade Classes Inc. has learned about the flip side of prosperity.
For example, at the company's after-school concession stand -- in past years a cash cow -- receipts have declined to $18 to $20 a day from $35 to $40 a day a year ago.
"Last year, our concession stand had a lot more customers," said 12-year-old Amy Hatcher, the company's treasurer. "This year, we don't have as many. I guess they don't have enough money."
As a result, marketing efforts have become more aggressive. For example, students this school year sent letters to every school district in the state, pitching the company's "Texas Weather Rock," a novelty item with an accompanying leaflet explaining that when the rock is wet, it is raining outside, and when it is dry, the weather is fair.
The letters asked prospective customers at other schools to buy the rocks, and pointed out that they in turn could sell them to their students.
 
Grades Still Count
 Despite the headaches of managing a recession-battered company, leadership positions are prized. Good grades and good behavior are necessary to get and keep one of eight officer positions. Homework must be turned in when due; three misses and officers get the boot. In the past, several officers have been turned out, some of them for their roles in schoolyard fights.
Mr. Gilbreth, who acts as a benevolent chairman, predicts the class will finish this school year with $18,000 in the bank, up from last year's $14,000, but still below previous records.
"Whatever we have, it's not enough," said Amy Laughlin, 12, the company's secretary and publicity manager. But, she added sagely, "You have your ups and downs in your business life."

Cheap Oil, Expensive Cartel

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SAUDI ARABIA, the muscle behind the international oil cartel, made no secret of its aims at the meeting of OPEC ministers in Geneva last week: keeping the price of a barrel high enough to replenish its war-depleted treasury -- but not high enough to weaken the magic kingdom's grip on the market.
America, the muscle behind Saudi Arabia, is of two minds about the price of oil. On the one hand, policy makers worry that low prices would discommode their friends from Abu Dhabi to Houston. On the other, they fret that high prices would slow recovery from the recession and anger voters who believe deep down that Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf was fighting to make the world safe for unleaded regular at $1.06 a gallon. 
 None of this surprises M. A. Adelman, professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and perennial gadfly to the energy establishment, who argues that Washington's views on oil have been muddled by a mix of "high policy and low politics." To Mr. Adelman, the right price to pay for oil is the lowest price that would assure an adequate supply for the foreseeable future. And that, he estimates, is a startlingly low $6 to $10 a barrel.
If oil were sold in competitive markets, like cameras or computers, no single producer could hope to influence the price by raising or lowering output. Over the long term, the price would equal the cost to the highest-cost producer able to find a market for its crude.
But plainly, the oil market is not competitive. Roughly one-quarter of the world's production -- and more than half the known, low-cost reserves -- comes from a handful of Persian Gulf states. Production decisions by Saudi Arabia (and, in the future, perhaps Iraq and Kuwait as well) affect the price of oil. That has not, however, stopped Mr. Adelman from calculating the "efficiency price" of oil, the price that would emerge from a competitive market.
Over a period of weeks or months, he notes, it would pay producers to deliver oil as long as they could cover their operating costs. The competitive price floor, then, would be the price below which the world's high-cost producers -- notably Americans -- would be better off leaving the oil in the ground. And that price, Mr. Adelman reckons, may be as low as $5 a barrel and is certainly no more than $10.
In the long run, of course, output from high-cost regions would be bound to decline unless producers believed prices would be sufficient to cover both operating costs and the cost of developing new reserves. But in a competitive market the loss could easily be filled by production from low-cost regions, notably the Persian Gulf. The OPEC nations alone, Mr. Adelman estimates, could profitably produce more than 60 million barrels a day through the 1990's (and perhaps beyond) at just $6 a barrel -- three times the quantity they currently deliver at one-third the current price.
George Bush's new world order is not likely to include a blueprint for a competitive oil market. Mr. Bush, a former oilman, has never shown much enthusiasm for cheap fuel. Indeed, as Vice President, he pressed the Saudis to curb their inclination to prove their power over the cartel by driving the price toward the competitive floor. And in any case, nothing short of carving Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran into a dozen small oil-producing states and then applying America's antitrust laws to OPEC would do the trick. Nonetheless, the Adelman calculations do cast a different light on some current policy questions.
His cost estimates for OPEC make clear that most of the cash going to oil exporters is pure windfall. Squeezing the cartel would thus not be likely to reduce the supply. And it is hard to think of such a policy as unfair, unless one happens to believe that Saudi Arabia, Norway and Alaska deserve to be rich at the expense of Brazil, Poland and Oregon.
By the same token, the calculations suggest the magnitude of economic waste created by OPEC's continuing financial grab. High prices have created perverse incentives to drain America first: If Mr. Adelman's numbers are in the ball park, little or none of the billions of dollars spent annually on oil development in North America could be justified in purely economic terms.
There are environmental implications here, too. Environmentalists correctly argue that the ecological damage from burning carbon fuels -- local air pollution, global warming -- ought to be factored into the price at the pump. What they rarely acknowledge, though, is that OPEC already assesses a "carbon tax" that triples the price of crude.
Washington does have an oil policy. The only catch, it seems, is that the policy is made in Houston and Riyadh.

Detroit Is Getting New Help From Plastics

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 19

 BODY:
Automotive engineers have puzzled for years over how to use weight-saving plastics in car and truck engines without losing the strength or heat resistance of metal.
Now, new economical ways of reinforcing and molding plastics are providing a solution, and auto makers are using large plastic parts for the first time under the hoods of some cars made in the United States. 
 The Ford Motor Company uses a plastic valve cover -- which sits atop the engine and keeps the oil circulating -- for one of its large 8-cylinder engines. The engine powers Ford's Lincoln Town Car, Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria models. The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation are also producing plastic engine parts in limited quantities.
The engine parts are made from a type of plastic called thermoset, a heat-resistant compound reinforced with glass fibers. They weigh about 30 percent less than the metal ones they replace. Using them in the engine, the heaviest part of the car, could reduce a car's weight.
The breakthrough goes beyond saving weight. Plastic parts cost less than many metal parts, mainly because plastic has a smooth finish that requires little, if any, machining after molding. That means less work goes into each part, which makes them cheaper to produce.
 
A Joint Venture
 Ford recently announced a joint venture with BTR P.L.C., a British company, to make plastic intake manifolds for some of Ford's 6-cylinder engines. Intake manifolds act as chambers where the air needed to burn fuel is drawn into an engine. Like valve covers, most intake manifolds are made mainly from aluminum alloys. Years ago, most manufacturers switched to aluminum from iron to save weight.
The joint venture, called Dunlop Automotive Composites Inc., is building a plant in Benton Harbor, Mich., and has orders to supply plastic intake manifolds for the 3-liter engines in Ford's 1993 Ranger pickup trucks. Ford is completing plans to use plastic manifolds on two other engines, as well, according to industry reports.
Robert M. Tamburrino, director of business operations at Dunlop, said the company hoped to get contracts with Ford that would lift its annual sales to $50 million in a few years.
So far, plastics have received serious consideration only for nonmoving engine parts. Plastic has still not proved strong enough to use for rotating components, like cam shafts and connecting rods, where engineers would dearly love to pare ounces.
"One reason Japanese engines run so smoothly, aside from the tight tolerances, is the light weight of the components they use," said David E. Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. He said the lighter weight reduced the vibration and noise from an engine.
But Dr. Cole said he thought that auto makers would continue to use metal alloys for the moving engine parts for the foreseeable future.
"None of the auto makers are willing to do trial and error with customers," he said. "The plastics technology we see today has been very carefully validated before it is introduced."
The main obstacle to using plastics in engines has been the heat, which can reach as high as 350 degrees Fahrenheit in engine compartments. The most common type of plastic resin used for engine parts, known as phenolic, undergoes a molecular change in the molding process. When the plastic is melted for the first time to mold the part, the molecules that link up to form the plastic originally become joined differently and irreversibly. Once the plastic sets, it cannot melt again. Indeed, some parts made from phenolic can withstand higher temperatures than aluminum and other metals.
 
How It's Done
 To make an intake manifold, plastic resin reinforced with tiny glass fibers is injected into a mold that contains a metal core. As the molten plastic cools, it undergoes the molecular change and sets in the shape of the mold. The metal core is then melted out -- usually by submerging the entire part in hot oil -- leaving behind a one-piece plastic shape with very precise dimensions.
Before parts could be mass-produced using this technique, engineers had to perfect their recipes for alloy cores that were strong enough to handle the molding process but could still be melted out quickly without hurting the surrounding plastic. Depending on the part, manufacturers use cores made from metal alloys with melting temperatures ranging from 150 degrees to more than 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
The aluminum used to make most intake manifolds in cars today is melted down and cast in dies around sand cores. The sand is then flushed out after the aluminum hardens.
But sand cores limit the shapes that can be achieved. Large metal parts normally require two or more pieces that are cast and then joined together, adding to the manufacturing cost.
Furthermore, the precise shape and finish of intake manifolds is critical to engine performance. Sand cores leave a rough finish on the inside of aluminum manifolds. By contrast, a plastic manifold formed around a metal core has a much smoother interior finish. That eliminates some of the turbulence and eddies caused by friction as air streams through the manifold, and results in better performance.
"It translates into mileage increases, and in some cases, horsepower increases," said Mr. Tamburrino of Dunlop. Although the gains in mileage and horsepower are small, only 1 or 2 percent, auto makers are eager for any improvements.
 
Experiments in the 30's
 Henry Ford experimented in the 1930's with a type of plastic derived from the fibrous structure of soya beans. It was used to make insulated casings and interior knobs and buttons on some Ford models. General Motors used petroleum-based plastics for engine valve covers that appeared on some Cadillac models in the early 1970's. But a spate of engine failures was attributed to oil leaks from the plastic covers and the auto industry rejected plastic until improvements were made.
The car companies reacted quickly when the plastics industry learned how to mold parts around a metal core. "The auto makers recognized that this presented a way to mold very complicated structures, and they pounced on it," said Elio Eusedi, head of G.M.'s polymers department.
Oil pans and valve covers made from plastic first turned up on diesel engines about five years ago. The jarring vibrations and critical oil seals of diesel engines provided a grueling testing ground for the new material. Many trucking companies expect their diesel engines to run for 500,000 miles before replacing oil pans or valve covers.
"A loss of oil in a heavy truck diesel engine means disaster," said Eldon Trueman, vice president of sales and marketing for the plastics division of the Budd Company in Troy, Mich. The division supplies plastic oil pans for diesels. "Fleets are interested in keeping those trucks on the road and moving," he said.


GRAPHIC: Engine parts are now being made of a heat-resistant compound plastic reinforced with glass fibers. The plastic is so hard it can be molded around metal that is later melted out.
 
Drawing of a plastic intake manifold opened to show the metal mold. The plastic undergoes a molecular change when it sets and cannot be melted a second time.
 
Plastic parts weigh about 25 percent less than metal ones, cost less and, being smoother, perform better and more economically

HEADLINE: Starts in Housing Show February Jump of 16.4%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments shot up 16.4 percent in February, the Commerce Department said today. It was the biggest monthly gain for the depressed housing industry in more than a year.
Building permits, an indicator of future construction plans, also jumped last month. 
 Analysts said a rebound in consumer confidence now that the Persian Gulf war has ended should help housing make a modest but solid comeback in 1991 from a severe slump in the last year. A number of realtors have reported a recent rise in housing demand, particularly from first-time home buyers attracted by lower interest rates and a backlog of unsold low-priced homes.
 
First in Eight Months
 The rise in building activity last month followed a revised 12.5 percent drop in starts in January. The rise in building permit applications in February was the first in eight months.
"This report makes a pretty convincing case that we saw the bottom of the market in January and we're seeing a recovery in the housing sector," said Tom Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers' Association in Washington.
Preliminary survey results from the University of Michigan showed consumer confidence was nearly as high in early March as it was before the Persian Gulf crisis began last August with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The fall in confidence after that event was blamed by many economists for pushing the United States into recession late last year.
There were solid signs in the housing report that builders reacted quickly to evidence of a more aggressive consumer.
The February rise was concentrated in single-family homes, where starts jumped 18.3 percent in February. Apartment construction rose 10.1 percent from January levels.
In all, housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 989,000 units last month from an 850,000-unit rate in January. But that was still 32.2 percent lower than the rate of starts recorded in February 1990.
"We're not looking at a boom here," Mr. Holloway said. "We're looking at a snapback from January and the likelihood of steady but modest growth for the full year."
Mr. Holloway forecast that starts will increase to an annual rate of 1.15 million units by the final three months of this year.
 
Biggest Since January 1990
 February's 16.4 percent rise in starts was the biggest since a 21.8 percent gain in January 1990. That was just before the industry began a long slide that was interrupted only once, by a small increase in November, before last month.
On a regional basis, starts rose 77.2 percent in the Midwest, 7.9 percent in the South and 5.7 percent in the Northeast. The only region where starts fell was in the West, where they were down 9.6 percent to the lowest levels since August 1982, during the 1981-82 recession.
Builders, realtors and lenders say more potential buyers are showing up at housing developments and are inquiring about loan rates now that mortgage rates have fallen below 10 percent.
"Although the construction industry is not yet out of the doghouse, it clearly is on its way back," said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. "We expect housing starts to total 1.06 million units in 1991, down 12 percent from 1990," he added.
Housing starts peaked in 1986 at an annual rate of 1.8 million units.

The Iron Horse Makes A Comeback Out West

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., March 15

 BODY:
In the past decade, even those with a fierce pride in Wyoming's elbow room had begun to worry about the declining number of elbows.
With agriculture and the oil-drilling business hard hit, the state's population declined by 3 percent, or 14,000 people, in the 1980's. And when Amtrak pulled up stakes in Wyoming eight years ago, the state's future seemed especially lonely and bleak. 
 But soon Wyoming will have an influx of people by the trainload, even if they are only passing through. Amtrak is returning to Wyoming.
Earlier this month the passenger train service announced that its Pioneer line, between Seattle and Chicago, would be re-routed through Wyoming, starting in June, with stops in Cheyenne, Laramie, Rawlins, Rock Springs, Green River and Evanston.
Until now, Wyoming was one of only four states in the contiguous United States without Amtrak service. The others are Maine, Oklahoma and South Dakota.
"It's real good news," said Gunther Krix, a grocery worker in Cheyenne. He did not quite exult over the Amtrak announcement, but rather, in the manner of most Westerners, nodded approvingly.
But if the people here hope that Amtrak's decision symbolizes a vote of confidence in their state, they may be disappointed.
"It really doesn't have very much to do with Wyoming," said R. Clifford Black, a spokesman for Amtrak. "It has more to do with Seattle."
The current Pioneer route, which crosses the Rocky Mountains, is known for its breathtaking scenery. But the rugged landscape, which must be navigated at lower speeds, has often meant delays for the train.
As a result, passengers leaving Seattle had to board at 5 A.M. so that the train would have enough time to make its connection in Denver. Amtrak believes it can attract more passengers in Seattle, a booming market, if the train leaves at a more civilized hour. By crossing southern Wyoming's gentler terrain, the Pioneer can leave Seattle a few hours later.
Under the new route system, no community will lose Amtrak service. Passengers can still choose to ride across the Rockies, on a line that meets in Boise, Idaho, with the Zephyr, the San Francisco-Chicago line.
No matter what the reasons are for the route change, Wyoming residents say they will be happy to hear the rumblings of passenger trains again.
"I can remember years ago taking the sleeper car to Salt Lake City," Charles Hanscum, an 84-year-old retired game warden, said with a pleasant sigh. "It sure beats going on these highways."
Sister Marie Raymond, a Dominican nun who teaches music in Cheyenne, said Amtrak had been missing the boat by bypassing Wyoming.
"We don't have all that many people, but we've got an adventuresome spirit out here," she said.
Sister Marie said she hoped the new train service would make it easier for her to visit friends in the Midwest. "As it is now, if you die and go to hell you've got to go through Denver first," she said. "Now don't say I said that."
Cheyenne was settled in the 1860's by railway workers laying the Union Pacific line, and Wyoming politicians expressed hope that the new rail service will mean another economic boom.
"Most of the passengers will be passing through Wyoming," said Dennis Curran, an aide to Gov. Mike Sullivan. "It will be our job to get them off the train to take advantage of our tourist attractions."
Some people are already making plans to take advanage of the new train route. For Keith Kershisnik, the train could provide one leg of a long commute he makes regularly.
"I live in Rock Springs and work in the oil fields in Alaska," said Mr. Kershisnik, 31, a burly man in a Bart Simpson T-shirt. He was browsing through the Wyoming State Museum in Cheyenne, where the gift shop sells a book about Wyoming entitled, "Courage in a Lonesome Land."
"With all the economic problems we've had, the lack of jobs and all, it's a good sign to get the train back," he said. "In the last several years, even the people with blood going all the way back in Wyoming were starting to wonder if maybe we should all leave. But the real, true Wyoming people know that if we're strong, we won't fail."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
I.B.M. Sees Sharp Drop In Earnings

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings would be about half of its profit a year ago and far short of most analysts' projections. The prediction jolted Wall Street, which took it as a sign that there were new grounds for concern about a stumbling national economic recovery.
The bad news, which was delivered in an early-morning conference call to financial analysts, stunned the stock market. On the New York Stock Exchange, trading in shares of the International Business Machines Corporation was delayed for an hour and a half because of an order imbalance. When trading finally began, the stock was off $9.125 from Monday's close. It ended the day at $115.125, down $12.75, or nearly 10 percent, helping to send the whole market to a sharp fall. 
 I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., attributed the earnings decline to an international economic slowdown and to rising uncertainty surrounding the Persian Gulf war. It added that improvement would not come until there was an economic turnaround.
 
Some Analysts Skeptical
 But several analysts expressed skepticism about whether the company's difficulties could be pinned solely on broader economic events.
"They've done this thing before," said Ulric Weil, a financial analyst at Weil & Associates in Washington. "They've come out of left field and hit everyone with a wet cloth.'
Some analysts suggested that I.B.M.'s weak performance showed it might be having a slow product transition to its new family of mainframe computers introduced last year. But I.B.M. made a special point of rejecting those suggestions. The company said all of its product lines, with the exception of its new RS/6000 work station line and software and services, were hurt equally. The RS/ 6000 came closer to meeting the company's expectations.
The newest sign of a global economic slowdown that is buffeting the world's largest computer maker is particularly troubling, analysts said yesterday, because I.B.M. officials had been saying that the company was skirting broader economic declines.
"There was a lot of spending in the fourth quarter that has distorted earnings for I.B.M. and others," said Daniel Mandresh, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The moment-of-truth time is going to the March quarter."
Economists said economic deterioration had been most pronounced in Western Europe, a market that has been good for many United States computer makers in recent years. "They can certainly blame the world economy and expect more of the same in the first half of this year," said David Hale, chief economist at the Kemper Financial Companies.
The poor I.B.M. performance also suggested that the corporate restructuring engineered by the chairman, John F. Akers, in the last three years might still be incomplete. Last fall the company introduced its first new family of mainframe computers in almost six years and it has maintained that the product transition is proceeding smoothly.
Yesterday an I.B.M. spokesman said the company would continue to cut expenses that would reduce its work force.
In a brief statement, Mr. Akers said the company remained confident of its product line and its relationships with customers, but added, "The ability to take advantage of these strengths in 1991 is contingent on how rapidly the worldwide economic environment improves."
I.B.M. told analysts that sales had slowed in all of its major geographical markets and that the United States market, which has seen slow growth for several years, was hardest hit.
The company said it expected first-quarter earnings to be close to 90 cents a share, far lower than the $1.81 in the first quarter of 1990. Peter Thonis, an I.B.M. spokesman, said that analysts' predictions for the current quarter had been $1.65 to $1.95.
I.B.M.'s warning of a poor first quarter also effected the stocks of a number of other computer makers. The Digital Equipment Corporation's stock also had a delayed start in trading, and ended down $5.25, to $71.375, in what analysts called a reaction to the I.B.M. statement.
Mr. Weil, the analyst, said I.B.M.'s problems could not all be attributed to economic factors. "Akers still hasn't done the right things to get the information flowing from the bottom to the top so that he doesn't get blindsided," he said. "This doesn't speak well for the transformation of I.B.M."
Several analysts also warned that foreign currency factors, which have helped I.B.M. recently, could begin to hurt later this year if the dollar continued to strengthen.
At the Compaq Computer Corporation, Eckhart Pfeiffer, the chief executive, said that his company's outlook had not changed but that the United States outlook was particularly difficult. He said the gulf war had also hurt Compaq's business in Europe.
Several of I.B.M.'s competitors said yesterday that they also saw the possibility of further earnings declines in the quarter.
The Amdahl Corporation, a maker of mainframe computers based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expected earnings for the first quarter to fall well below last year's results.

HEADLINE: U.S. AGENDA URGED BY ASTRONOMERS

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Setting research priorities for the next decade, astronomers today recommended a $3 billion national program to build and operate new telescopes for investigating the presence of planets around other stars, the life cycles of stars, the existence of black holes and the evolution of the universe.
The astronomers, in a report issued by the National Research Council, gave their highest endorsement to proposals for two telescopes for viewing the heavens in infrared wavelengths. 
 One is the $1.3 billion Space Infrared Telescope Facility, which would be a thousand times as sensitive as Earth-based infrared telescopes. The other is an $80 million ground-based telescope that would be the first designed specifically for infrared observations.
"New instruments will reveal previously unimagined aspects of the universe and will lead to new questions about objects that we do not yet know exist," said Dr. John N. Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who headed the study of priorities in astronomy for the 1990's. More than 300 astronomers participated in the study.
 
Peering at Galaxies' Cores
 Dr. Alex Filippenko, an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley, said, for example, that more powerful infrared telescopes should be able to penetrate the cores of galaxies and establish if many of them are, as suspected, inhabited by black holes, regions of matter so compressed that gravitational force does not permit light to escape.
"Infrared telescopes would be able to see whether stars are concentrated at the centers of galaxies," Dr. Filippenko said. "That will be the smoking gun that black holes really do exist."
These telescopes should also be able to detect emissions from possible planetary systems, observe the birth of stars in dust clouds and their death in tremendous explosions and detect the weak light of infant galaxies and galactic clusters formed later across vast regions of the universe.
Dr. Bahcall said at a news briefing that emphasis was placed on infrared astronomy because the technology had reached a high state of maturity and these facilities were not duplicated by telescopes in other countries.
Dr. Carl Sagan, the astronomer from Cornell University, said that the orbiting infrared telescope "has a potential to revolutionize many areas of astronomy."
 
Emphasizing Small Programs
 The astronomers assigned an equally high priority to the more mundane work, mainly financed by the National Science Foundation, of refurbishing present ground-based facilities, establishing computer networks and data archives for astronomy and increasing support for students and theoretical studies. Equipment at many observatories, the report said, has seriously deteriorated and "now poses a threat to the continued success of U.S. astronomy."
In a recommendation aimed primarily at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the astronomers called for an "increased emphasis in the astronomy budget on small and moderate programs," especially in space astronomy. Simpler missions, they said, could be launched more quickly in response to changing technology and new scientific ideas and to train future generations of scientists.
Even so, the study group concluded that some large telescopes were required to answer many of the most fundamental questions in astronomy. The recommended space-based infrared telescope would complete NASA's great observatory program to examine the sky across the electromagnetic spectrum. The orbiting Hubble telescope is designed for optical and ultraviolet observations. The Gamma Ray Observatory is scheduled to be launched next month. And the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility is to be launched in 1998.
Other projects endorsed by the study, in descending order of priority after the orbiting and ground-based infrared telescopes, include the Millimeter Array, a group of radiotelescopes that will observe emissions from the centers of galaxies and from regions of young, hot stars, and a 310-inch optical telescope to be built in the Southern Hemisphere.
The study also endorsed the development of "adaptive optics" to compensate for atmospheric interference and thus improve ground-based observations; a spacecraft called the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopy Explorer; a far-infrared telescope to be flown on a Boeing 747; an increase in the number of small spacecraft for astrophysics, and expansion and refurbishing of the Very Large Array, a cluster of radio antennas in New Mexico.
 
Telescopes on the Moon
 At the request of NASA officials, the astronomers assessed the suitability of the Moon as a base for telescopes. They concluded that "a cost-effective and scientifically productive program would require early technology development."
Both Dr. Bahcall and Dr. Sagan emphasized that a return of astronauts to the Moon could open the way for erecting and operating telescopes there, but that such missions would have to be justified in terms other than their usefulness to astronomy.
For every project the astronomers included in their wish list, Dr. Bahcall said, at least 10 others were rejected for one reason or another in order to keep the recommendations in line with current spending plus an amount to account for inflation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly; Gold Up in Europe and U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar climbed yesterday in a powerful rally inspired by Germany's top monetary official, who said his nation's hasty currency union last year was an economic disaster.
Gold fell in Asia but rose in Europe and the United States. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery edged up 80 cents a troy ounce to settle at $363.80. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $363.00 a troy ounce, up 90 cents from late Monday. 
 The dollar gained against all major currencies but the Japanese yen. The rally came despite a concerted attempt by many of the world's major central banks to satisfy some of the market's voracious demand for dollars by selling them in the foreign exchange markets.
Remarks by Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, suggested the European Community move slowly toward a single currency, or the union could have the same "disastrous" results as Germany's monetary union on July 1, 1990. After the remarks were made, the Bundesbank said Mr. Pohl's comments were "taken out of context."
However, "the damage had already been done," said Mike Faust, foreign exchange analyst at MMS International in Chicago. "It set the stage for a dollar rally."
Mr. Pohl's apparent reference to broad unemployment in the former East Germany and Germany's rising interest rates briefly pushed the dollar to 1.6740 marks, a nine-month high against that currency.
 
Steady Advance of Dollar
 The central banks intervened after Mr. Pohl's remarks, but the move seemed to only marginally dampen enthusiasm for the dollar, which has been gaining steadily since the end of the Persian Gulf war gave rise to optimism about the United States economy.
"There are still people out there who want to buy dollars," said Robert Hatcher, corporate dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C.
In Europe, the dollar ended at 1.6540 German marks, up from 1.6330 late Monday, while in New York it rose to 1.6423 German marks, from 1.6282. The economic optimism was helped by a Commerce Department report that construction of new homes and apartments shot up 16.4 percent last month.
In addition, traders said they were heartened by a Government report that the nation's underlying inflation rate, absent food and energy, was surprisingly high.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 137.98 yen, from 137.65 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 138.15 yen, and in New York, the dollar settled at 137.55 yen, down slightly from late Monday's 137.97 yen. In London, the British pound fell to $1.7655, from $1.7905 late Monday. The pound also weakened in New York, where it fetched $1.7800, less than late Monday's $1.7938.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.4175 Swiss francs, up from 1.4065; 5.5945 French francs, up from 5.5485; 1,225.00 Italian lire, up from 1,214.75, and 1.1549 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1541.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Kurds Alone Viewed as Unlikely to Oust Hussein

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The unrest in Iraqi Kurdistan is the most serious anti-Government revolt in that region in almost two decades, but it alone is unlikely to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Middle East experts say.
Military and political analysts inside and outside the Bush Administration agree that the rebellion by the Kurds, non-Arabs who make up about 20 percent of Iraq's population, could be an important factor in weakening the Hussein Government. But no Kurdish revolt has ever brought down an Iraqi government since the nation gained independence from Britain in 1932, although an inability to quash rebellions contributed to the overthrow of a number of governments before the Baath Party came to power in 1968. 
 This Kurdish rebellion is different from others in that the Baghdad Government has been further weakened by Iraq's humiliating military defeat in Kuwait, the nation's desperate economic situation, the continuing unrest in southern Iraq and the allies' refusal to let Iraq use what remains of its air power against rebels.
"We have seen Kurdish rebellions over and over and over again, but never in the context of such a weak central Government," said Graham Fuller, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation. "It's not the fact of the uprising but the context in which it is taking place that gives it half a chance."
 
Iran Said to Send Arms
 The situation in Kurdistan could become more serious if foreign governments send significant amounts of arms and money to the Kurds, as they did in the 1970's.
Bush Administration officials said today that Iran was sending arms across the border, both to Kurdish guerrillas in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. "There is some support, some arms from Iran," one Administration official said. "Is it a major supply operation? The answer is no."
The Kurds were also heartened last week when President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, reversing a policy of half a century, announced that his Government had opened contacts with Iraqi Kurdish leaders opposed to the Hussein Government. Senior Turkish officials said after the announcement that Turkey would send humanitarian aid to the Kurds and was considering a Kurdish request to serve as a conduit for arms.
"The Kurds are being manipulated one way or the other," Mr. Ozal said. "Everyone else is talking to them. Why not us?"
But any concrete support for Iraq's Kurds could stimulate unrest among Turkey's 12 million Kurds, who are officially referred to as "mountain Turks," and many Turkish military and political leaders oppose Mr. Ozal's approach.
 
Arab Pledges Reported
 Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and one of the Kurdish leaders who met with Turkish officials, has said that Arab nations promised to give his group substantial amounts of arms to fight Baghdad. He did not say which Arab nations had offered arms, although both Syria and Saudi Arabia have actively supported various Iraqi opposition leaders. Mr. Talabani keeps a home in Damascus and is part of the Syrian-backed coalition of opposition leaders.
Bush Administration officials said that they saw no evidence of arms shipments over the Turkish or Syrian borders and that for the most part the arms used in the uprisings in both the north and south were captured from or handed over by Iraqi troops.
Administration officials said today that the Kurds appeared to be expanding their control over large areas of Kurdistan, but had not taken control of the strategic oil-producing city of Kirkuk, despite their assertions that they had.
Until the last several days, Mr. Hussein largely focused on suppressing opposition in Shiite areas in the south of the country, which he traditionally has considered more of a threat to his country's stability. As the unrest in Kurdistan worsens, Mr. Hussein has begun to rush army units back to Kurdistan.
In the first part of the 1970's the Iraqi Government faced a serious rebellion in Kurdistan, which makes up about one-seventh of Iraqi territory. Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, with substantial help from Israel and the Central Intelligence Agency, supplied Iraqi Kurdish rebels with financial and military aid in an attempt to weaken the Baath Party Government. By 1974, the Kurds controlled substantial parts of Kurdistan.
The rebellion was so threatening that Mr. Hussein signed a humiliating accord with the Shah in 1975 under which the Shah agreed to end his activities in Iraq and Mr. Hussein agreed to give up his claim to the entire Shatt al-Arab, the waterway that divides the two countries. After that agreement, tens of thousands of Kurds were arrested and sent to detention camps in southern Iraq.
During the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi Government moved ruthlessly against Kurdish rebels while making conciliatory moves toward those it could coopt and quiet. Mr. Hussein contained unrest in Kurdistan using a combination of repression and rewards. The repression included the relocation of Kurdish civilians and attacks like the chemical-weapons strike at the town of Halabja in 1988 that killed about 5,000 Kurds; the rewards included jobs and the construction of new towns with roads, electricity and running water.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Cheney Wants No Limit On Arms for Gulf Allies

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the United States would not limit the sales of sophisticated conventional weapons to America's allies in the Middle East when their security might be at stake.
Addressing questions from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Cheney said in testimony that he expected foreign military sales to continue and in some cases increase to allies such as Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia so that those countries would be able to defend themselves from aggression long enough for United States forces to come to their aid. 
 The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to pay $15 billion for the Persian Gulf war, but attached language to the spending bill that bars Government funds for military sales to any nation that fails to fulfill its pledge of financial assistance for the war effort. The House has taken a less punitive stance about countries that have yet to complete promised payments for the war. They include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, nd Germany and Korea. The Senate action is viewed primarily as a warning.
In his House testimony, Mr. Cheney said that his principal arms control interest is in preventing the spread of "sophisticated technologies" like ballistic missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons capabilities.
 
Future Arms Sales Questioned
 A number of legislators questioned any policy that would not restrain future sales of conventional weapons -- tanks, warplanes and air defense missiles -- in an unstable region whose history has been marked by a recurring arms race among Arab countries, Iran and Israel.
Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat, voiced one complaint, saying: "Israel is being crushed under the burden of the massive amount of weaponry it needs to deal with the weaponry that we and our allies and the Soviets have been sending to others of our quote 'friends' in the Middle East. This is the same old cycle."
Mr. Cheney said he was willing to consider some restraint in conventional arms sales, "but I think our first concern ought to be to work with our friends and allies to see to it that they're secure."
"The policy we're pursuing now," Mr. Cheney said, "is one in which we want to minimize the U.S. military presence on the ground in the region. It's probably easier to do if we help out friends like the Saudis and the gulf states to have sufficient capability to be able to defend themselves long enough for us to be able to get back."
 
'Pretty Severe Scare'
 Using the Persian Gulf crisis to bolster his argument, Mr. Cheney said: "I don't think there's any question but that there are legitimate security threats to Saudi Arabia. They've just been through a pretty severe scare."
Mr. Cheney's remarks appeared to signal a determination within the Bush Administration to go forward at some point with weapons sales to United States allies in the Middle East. These sales are likely to include top-of-the-line tanks and warplanes to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and Patriot missiles to Israel and perhaps to Saudi Arabia.
The debate over future arms sales in the region may have plenty of time to develop while the Kuwaitis and Saudis take six months to a year to sort out the heavy commitments they have made to finance their share of the military operations, put their domestic economies back in order and rebuild war-damaged facilities.
The Saudis have put their arms purchase requests to Washington on hold, an official said, to give Riyadh time to deal with its cash-flow problems, to determine how much pre-positioned military equipment the Pentagon is willing to leave behind and to avoid a bruising fight with Israel's supporters in Congress just as President Bush is undertaking a peace initiative in the region.
"There is no immediate specific request," from the Saudis, said one official.
 
Availability of Funds Conditional
 In the Senate today, the $15 billion appropriation bill was approved by a vote of 98 to 1. The Senate version said the funds could only be spent if foreign contributions fell short of the amounts pledged by coalition partners.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said foreign nations had paid only $25.6 billion on pledges totaling $54.5 billion. "The pace at which we are receiving contributions from our allies is of real concern to me, particularly with regard to the cash-rich gulf states," the Senator said.
"It is more than just a little disconcerting to see this delay, especially by those countries the defense of which we took up," he added.
Mr. Byrd said Saudi Arabia had paid only $6.1 billion on pledges of $16.8 billion, Kuwait had paid only $5.5 billion on pledges of $16 billion, and the United Arab Emirates had paid only about half of the $4 billion it had pledged.
 
Others Also Lagged
 Other nations that lagged behind in their payments were Germany, which paid $4.6 billion on a pledge of $6.5 billion; Japan, which paid $7.3 billion on a pledge of $10.7 billion, and South Korea, which paid $71 million on a pledge of $385 million.
The House of Representatives approved the appropriation bill on March 7, but merely warned recalcitrant nations that Congress "may consider appropriate action" if their financial commitments were not met.
The White House opposed the Senate prohibition, but did not threaten a veto if the ban survived a House-Senate conference. The Office of Management and Budget said that the prohibition "places unnecessary and inappropriate constraints" on sales, credits and guarantees for military equipment and services to America's allies, whose payment delays were sometimes justified.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 62.13 Points, Or Over 2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were slammed yesterday by the report on consumer prices for February and by I.B.M.'s prediction of sharply lower earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 62.13 points, or more than 2 percent, to 2,867.82, its first close below 2,900 since Feb. 26. It was the largest drop in the Dow since the 3.1 percent decline on Oct. 9. 
 Volume was a modest 177.1 million shares, up slightly from 163.1 million the previous day. Declining issues outstripped those advancing by a ratio of about 2.5 to 1. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 5.52 points, to 366.59, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.46 points, to 462.81.
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose by two-tenths of 1 percent in February, but when price gyrations in energy and food are eliminated, it spurted seven-tenths of 1 percent. That sign of surprisingly high inflation seemed to dash hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease short-term rates soon, and stock prices tumbled.
And trading in I.B.M., the bluest of the blue chips, quickly fell 9 1/8 after its opening was delayed an hour and a half by an order imbalance. The corporation said its first-quarter earnings would probably be about half the current estimates, citing the worldwide economic slowdown and disruption caused by the Persian Gulf war.
Since the stock weighs heavily on the Dow, many investors regard it as a bellwether issue. "It not only supports the market psychologically, it supports the other technology stocks," one trader said. I.B.M. ended the day off 12 3/4, or nearly 10 percent, at 115 1/8, accounting for 25 points of the Dow's plunge.
Edward P. Nicoski, chief market strategist at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said "I.B.M. disappointed most observers, and took technology stocks down hard, while the disappointing core rate of inflation did technological damage to bond market." By late in the day the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond was off about 3/4 point.
"We've got a market that was extremely extended on the upside," Mr. Nicoski said. "And in recent weeks we've begun to see the beginning of investor movement toward the historically defensive stocks, like utilities and health care, in a down market."
In early trading stocks came under heavy pressure and by 11 A.M, with the Dow down 50, a New York Stock Exchange rule kicked in that bars computerized program trading when the last trade is below the previous one. After dropping about 51 points, the Dow backed off to 43 down.
By noon the Dow was down about 48 points, to 2,881.44 on about 85 million shares traded. Stocks had recouped some of their earlier losses, but were still down sharply. A weak bond market, declines in technology and drug stocks continued to tug at the market.
Fifteen minutes later the market was back down 50, it rebounded briefly, then fell below 50 for nearly the rest of the day, tumbling lower minutes before the bell sounded the end of trading.
Unnerved investors sold about 3.6 million I.B.M. shares, taking other tehnology stocks down along the way. Intel fell 1 3/4, to 45 1/4; Compaq Computer was down 3 5/8, to 61 1/4; Digital Equipment dropped 5 1/4, to 71 3/8, and Texas Instruments fell 1 1/4, to 39 7/8.

Tokyo Stocks Lower
 TOKYO, Wednesday, March 20 (Reuters) -- Tokyo stocks closedlower at today after Wall Street's 62.13-point decline on Tuesday and on reports of slow economic growth in Japan for the fourth quarter. The Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 557.31 points, or 2.06 percent, to 26,449.35.

HEADLINE: Exports Help Japan in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 19

 BODY:
Japan's economy was sustained by solid export growth in the fourth quarter of last year, the Government said today, a trend that is likely to contribute to a rebound in the politically sensitive trade surplus.
Over all, as economists had forecast, Japan's economy slowed to a crawl under the strain of high interest rates and the Persian Gulf crisis, the Government figures showed. 
 Still, experts found a far from gloomy message in the much-anticipated figures: the export surge could carry Japan into what would be its longest postwar economic boom.
According to the Economic Planning Agency, the economy grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the October through December period. Although strong compared with the recessionary lull in the United States, that looked anemic compared with Japan's 4.1 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter and the overall expansion of 5.6 percent in 1990.
Few economists were as sanguine as Shinyasu Hoshino, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency, who said the economy was hitting "cruising speed." But several said the figures suggested somewhat greater flexibility in the economy than is expected in tough times. Officially, the Government is forecasting 3.8 percent growth this year, while most private economists are predicting 3 percent or less.
In the patchwork of figures released today, two stood out: while domestic demand declined one-tenth of 1 percent from the previous quarter, as Japanese consumers pulled back in the face of uncertainty, external demand, mainly exports, jumped a healthy six-tenths of 1 percent from the third quarter.
 
Unexpected Stimulus
 "We were not expecting that strong a stimulus from exports," said Paul A. Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming Securities here, who noted that domestic demand had been the engine of growth in recent years as Japan sought to ease trade tensions with the United States.
"This is good for the economy all-in-all, but it means the trade tensions could get worse," he added. Mr. Summerville said that Japan's trade surplus could swell to $66 billion in the fiscal year that begins April 1, from $51 billion in the just-ending fiscal year.
Mr. Summerville said that much of the expansion in exports was to other Asian nations, not to the United States, where consumer buying has also been sluggish. Over the last several years, Japanese companies have been increasing their trade and investment in Asia, particularly with Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Japan's domestic economy showed pronounced weakness in contrast to the external sector. Personal consumption tumbled three-tenths of 1 percent from the third quarter, according to the figures. Housing posted a particularly big decline, largely a product of high interest rates.
"In times of uncertainty, the Japanese consumer cuts back on BMW's and American washing machines," said Jesper Koll, an economist here for S. G. Warburg Securities. "But that meant imports declined, too."
One facet of the domestic sector, capital spending by corporations, was robust. Investment in plants and equipment continued to expand at a double-digit annual rate during the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Israeli Army Chief, Stirring Furor, Suggests the Golan Is Expendable

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 19

 BODY:
The army Chief of Staff, who retires in a month, said in remarks reported today that Israel might safely give up some occupied territories if the nation made satisfactory peace agreements with its Arab neighbors.
The remarks by the officer, Lieut. Gen. Dan Shomron, came after a series of public statements by Israeli Government officials apparently intending to reaffirm how intractably wedded Israel is to the Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria. General Shomron's remarks helped turned a hot debate into a public brawl. 
 Several Cabinet members quickly told the general to keep his views to himself. Some said he should immediately resign, even though he is so close to retirement. Housing Minister Ariel Sharon urged leaders of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to redouble their efforts to build new housing there to affirm resistance to giving up the territories.
The political storm began Sunday, when Health Minister Ehud Olmert gave a speech in Washington. He offered a view that is heretic for a Likud party official by saying that Israel might be willing to discuss territorial issues with Syria. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 war, and Damascus demands its return as a condition for peace.
"We are ready to negotiate all of the issues," Mr. Olmert told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "all of the claims, all of the demands, including the territorial demands of the Syrians and our demands, and conclude peace between our two countries."
As the United States tries to move the nations of the Middle East to make peace, this country's position is that it wants to open talks with Arab countries without any conditions. To many in Washington, Mr. Olmert seemed to be offering only a logical extension of that position. But to Mr. Shamir and others in his Cabinet, Mr. Olmert's remarks smacked of betrayal.
"I am not happy with Olmert," said Mr. Shamir, who counts the Health Minister among his closest advisers. Other members of the governing coalition threatened to bring down the Cabinet unless Mr. Shamir repudiated Mr. Olmert's words.
He did, but then General Shomron offered his view in a briefing for Israeli military correspondents.
"A political arrangement, when it exists, is far more than just territory," he said. "It is linked to limiting weapons, supervision of one country over another. Thus if you are talking about nations at war, without a doubt territory has very great significance. But when you talk about these other arrangements, it is clear that these include various elements that diminish the threat of giving up territory and offer the possibility, for example, of long-range warning."
The statement was oblique, but more than enough to set off this Government.
The issue of the Golan remains a highly emotional one in Israel, where many still remember how, before 1967, Syrians shelled Israeli settlements from the highlands. But with the development and acuuisition of long-range missiles and Awacs reconnaissance planes, some military analysts have contended that a truly demilitarized Golan would have little strategic value.
 
Request, Then Refusal
 Mr. Shamir said on Monday that Israel was ready to talk to Syria without conditions.
"Syria has the right to ask us to withdraw from the Golan Heights," he continued. "If Syria does ask, we shall say we do not agree to withdraw."
Asked what would then be left to discuss, Mr. Shamir said: "We can talk about peace, about the ways of peace, about economic cooperation. There are many things. We say we are ready to negotiate unconditionally with all the Arab states -- nothing more than that."
Mr. Sharon then announced that his ministry had a major building program for new settlers on the Golan Heights.
"At the moment," he said, "we are in different states that range from preparations of infrastructure to actual construction of 1,200 housing units in the Golan Heights, and I intend to add the same number next year.
"There are 11,000 Jews on the Golan today," he added, "and we hope that next year the Jewish population there will be increased up to 20,000."
The statements made by Mr. Shamir and the others ended the weeklong hiatus on rightist public statements, a halt ordered by Mr. Shamir when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Jerusalem.
The statements reported today dealt also with topics other than the Golan Heights. Pressed by political rivals during a committee meeting in Parliament to say what he thought of Mr. Baker's meetings with Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem a week ago, the Prime Minister said he considered these people unfit for negotiations with Israel.
"They met him in the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to express the stand of the P.L.O.," the Prime Minister said. "We shall not talk to people from the P.L.O."

HEADLINE: The Cost of 'Really' Living vs. Just Living

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
It's always fabulous to be rich, and now it's gotten even more fabulous.
Last year, for only the second time in eight years, the inflation rate for a sampling of luxury goods was essentially identical to the inflation rate for the more basic consumer goods that Americans buy. In other words, big spenders could have the same indulgent life and not pay much more. 
 That, at least, is the conclusion of the latest version of the Moet Luxury Index, which Moet & Chandon, the Champagne people, released yesterday. Moet has used the index since 1982 to monitor price changes of luxury goods and services in New York City -- or, as Moet likes to phrase it, the cost of "really" living. Although the index ranks as one of the lesser-watched economic indicators and is not known to have a profound effect on Government economic policy, Moet thinks it is an interesting bit of calculation.
Moet's basket of a dozen luxury items rose 6.2 percent last year, virtually identical to the 6.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. In prior years, the luxury index was sometimes two or three times higher than the consumer index. The one other exception came in 1983, when the consumer index rose 3.8 percent and the luxury index went up just 3.7 percent. Then it was unbelievably fabulous being rich.
 
Rich Also More Cautious
 According to the Moet people, last year's results indicate that the economy was so perilous that businesses needed to keep a tighter lid on high-priced items because the rich were being more cautious, too.
In 1990, Moet pointed out, some luxury items were outright bargains (at least for the people accustomed to buying them without wincing). For instance, the cost of a wash, cut and blow dry at the Bumble and Bumble hair salon didn't change at all. It was still $65. Maid service for a day, according to Maids Unlimited, was also the same $100 it had been in 1989.
What happened to a full-length mink coat at Alixandre Furs was stunning. It fell 11.8 percent in cost, to $15,000, the sole product in the index to decline in price.
A Rolls-Royce Corniche III convertible was only 5 percent more at $226,700. Cuvee Dom Perignon Champagne was up 4 percent, to $79. Hennessy X.O cognac was 4 percent higher at $90.65.
Not everything was tremendous last year for the heavy spenders. A 1.05-ounce portion of Russian beluga caviar was up a nasty 15.8 percent, to $69.50. A pound of Teuscher imported chocolate truffles rose 11 percent, to $40. A round trip from New York to Paris on the Concorde was up 10 percent, to $5,840. And a men's Rolex Oyster perpetual day-date watch with a President bracelet climbed 17.5 percent, to $13,750. Makes you think twice.

A Reverie: Unity on Domestic Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Senator Tom Daschle has this dream: Now that the war is over, the Government and the news media begin to focus on domestic problems with the same intensity they gave the Persian Gulf.
President Bush says money is no object when the future of the nation is at stake, and his budget director, Richard G. Darman, holds daily briefings on the progress of the war against poverty and the battle for supremacy in education. Congressional leaders agree to bury partisan differences. 
 The network anchors fly off to Detroit and Boston and Pine Bluff, Ark., to report from the site of the recession. And in no time at all, the problems are conquered, the American economy is proved to be the strongest on earth and those who worked night and day to turn the country around are given heroes' welcomes when they return to their everyday lives.
Senator Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, laughs at the fantasy. But he said, "Without unity of purpose with a clear objective, without George Bush on television late at night calling the problems to the attention of the American people, without a full-scale debate in Congress and without the full attention of the media, the changes that are needed will not be made."
Whatever their ideology or political perspective, almost all the two dozen Administration officials, lawmakers, economists and political strategists interviewed in the last week agreed with Mr. Daschle's assessment. But they also agreed that such unity was not in the offing, certainly not this year.
"The rest of this year will all be an anticlimax," said Senator Warren B. Rudman, a conservative Republican from New Hampshire.
In the aftermath of the war, the focus here is expected to turn to the same issues the White House and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have been bickering over for years: civil rights and racial quotas, banks and savings and loans, capital punishment and gun control, highways and mass transit, abortion and parental leave, trade and energy, capital gains, individual retirement accounts and Social Security taxes.
But the fundamental problems, those interviewed agreed, lie elsewhere: an education system inadequate for the 21st century, 20 percent of all children in poverty, homelessness and serious crime in nearly every community, soaring medical costs, and savings and productivity rates so low that they threaten Americans' standard of living.
 
Big Hurdle: New Budget Rules
 Those problems are not being addressed, said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, in part because "it's just not clear what the solutions are, even if we could afford them."
But in part it is also because the budget law enacted last year basically proscribes dramatic initiatives.
Under the new rules, the budget is broken down into five categories: military spending, discretionary domestic spending like highways and space exploration, foreign aid, benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security in which payments are made automatically to those who meet the qualifications, and taxes.
In the first three categories, any additional spending must be offset dollar for dollar by a budget cut in the same category. For example, more money for an education program must be balanced by a cut somewhere in other discretionary domestic spending. Money cannot be taken from the military to pay for domestic programs or vice versa.
 
A Case in Point
 In the last two categories, benefit programs and taxes, any extra spending or cut in taxes must be offset by higher taxes or benefit cuts. For instance, increasing welfare benefits could be paid for only by cutting another benefit program, like Medicare, or by raising taxes.
Here is an example of what all this means in practice:
A recently published study of prisoners 10 years after their discharge showed that more than three-quarters of those required to undergo anti-drug therapy while in prison committed no crimes after they left prison.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits on the Judiciary and Budget Committees, was impressed, and he has proposed a $150 million program to provide such treatment to all addicted Federal prisoners.
No one has expressed opposition to the proposal, and under traditional budget rules, it would probably become law. But Mr. Schumer says he will have trouble getting it enacted because it will be difficult to find $150 million to cut elsewhere.
 
Calling an 'Emergency'
 "The budget blocks you and boxes you in," said Mr. Schumer, who was a strong advocate of last year's budget deal and, despite his frustration, says it should not be breached.
The budget does provide for additional spending if the President and Congress declare an "emergency." Two such cases have already arisen this year: more generous veterans' benefits in the afterglow of the war and more money to staff unemployment offices during the recession.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, said that if the "emergency" language "becomes boilerplate for every appropriation," the budget deal would quickly unravel. But he said he did not expect that to happen.
One consequence of the budget restrictions is that many of the battles this year will be fought over issues that cost the Government no money, like capital punishment, gun control, civil rights, trade limits, changes in the banking laws and requirements that businesses grant leaves of absence to new parents.
 
What About the Economy?
 The other fights will be over how to divide the existing pie -- whether, for example, to spend transportation money on highways or mass transit; whether to concentrate student aid on the poor or give smaller amounts to many more college students, including those from middle-income families; whether to withhold Medicare benefits from affluent elderly people so as to avoid cutbacks elsewhere.
Thus, the Government will continue to spend resources on the basis of priorities that were set years ago. Few policy makers starting from scratch now, for instance, would devote such a large share of the budget to the elderly and such a small share to children. Changes in the rules are unlikely unless the economy performs much worse than expected.
"The biggest imponderable is the timing and nature of the economic turnaround," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Like most other economists, he is predicting an end to the recession by this summer.
But economic forecasts are often wrong. If the economy does considerably worse than expected, pressure will develop for tax cuts and spending increases to counter the recession, what Mr. Boskin called "a frontal assault on the budget."
 
What Bush Wants
 For his part, Mr. Bush has a limited domestic agenda. A middle-level White House assistant said he perceived a deliberate political strategy to "lower expectations."
"If we promise too much or ask for too much and fail, people will hold it against us," said the aide, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "But if people expect little and we accomplish something, it will be very much to our advantage."
In his victory speech to Congress on March 6, the President mentioned only two domestic proposals, legislation on crime control and highways, and called on Congress to enact them in 100 days. Few people in the capital think that will happen.
The President's crime bill is essentially the same one Congress rejected last year. It would expand the number of Federal crimes punishable by death, limit appeals by inmates on death row and permit the use in court of illegally obtained evidence if the police acted in good faith. Republicans like the way it allows them to portray the Democratic opponents as soft on crime.
The transportation bill would provide $105 billion over the next five years, holding spending slightly below what would be needed to keep pace with inflation. It would increase state governments' share of highway construction costs, limit direct Federal spending on mass transit and give state officials more leeway to transfer highway funds into mass transit. Democrats plan to rewrite the measure to restore transit money and spread the pork barrel.
 
The Democratic Agenda
 The Democratic agenda is no less driven by politics and hardly bolder than the Administration's. In some cases, they are counterpunching. Mr. Bush proposes capital punishment; the Democrats counter with gun control. The President proposes to cut the capital gains tax; the Democrats fire back with a surtax on incomes over $1 million.
And in a step opposed by nearly every economist outside of organized labor, from the most liberal to the most conservative, the Democrats plan to press this year for further trade restrictions, perhaps blocking a free trade agreement with Mexico or requiring the President to retaliate against Japanese trade practices. They hope, no doubt, with the 1992 election approaching, to position themselves on the side of American workers and to make President Bush appear to be soft on Japan.

HEADLINE: Some Veterans Fear Reopening Psychic Wounds

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif., March 15

 BODY:
Bill Soares returned unheralded from Vietnam 22 years ago and began a tortured slide into cocaine addiction, marital discord and chronic unemployment.
Now, Mr. Soares and his fellow patients at a psychiatric hospital here for the victims of combat stress have been invited to a celebration, in the nearby community of Millbrae, to honor those who served in the Persian Gulf. 
 They will not be going.
The invitation was turned down by Fred D. Gusman, the founder and director of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the model for 20 such in-patient programs at Veterans Affairs medical centers across the country, most of them full to overflowing with the psychiatric casualties of the Vietnam conflict, America's most unpopular war.
"Everyone will be too preoccupied with the Desert Storm people, and it will raise sad memories," said Mr. Gusman, a social worker. "The fact that we've had a military success doesn't mean everyone is healed."
 
Some Lessons Learned
 Mr. Gusman's task these days is a complicated one: preparing to treat the new victims of post-traumatic stress disorder now that the Persian Gulf war has ended, and continuing to nurture the 100 men in his care whose old hurts have been revisited.
A national study found that 15 percent of Vietnam veterans suffer serious combat stress, and experts expect a smaller percentage among the Persian Gulf troops, in large measure because of military and political lessons learned in the Vietnam War and psychiatric lessons learned afterward.
The gulf war was far briefer and less bloody than Vietnam, and ended with a clear victory and an exuberant welcome home. In addition, in the intervening years between Vietnam and the gulf war post-traumatic stress disorder has been recognized as a psychiatric illness, thus making it likely the latest victims will be diagnosed early and will get the best care available.
"Because of what happened to the Vietnam veteran, something different is happening today," said Joan Furey, an Army nurse in Vietnam and the associate director at the Menlo Park program, which was the first of its kind when it opened in 1978.
 
Unflattering Comparisons
 The patients in Menlo Park, on the penisula south of San Francisco, share the nation's postwar euphoria and are proud that their experience has improved the odds for the soldiers that followed them. But they are also racked by the unflattering comparisons being made to the Vietnam War, a long and losing effort that for many veterans brought nightmares and failed marriages rather than yellow ribbons and parades.
Like others here, Mr. Soares is awash in those contradictory emotions. "It brings a pride to see these soldiers treated the way we wanted to be treated and not dropped off on the street corner by the bus," he said. "But it's hard to get rid of 20 years of pain, misdirection and agony. The wounds heal but the scars remain."
In some ways, during the Persian Gulf war life went on as usual at the hospital here, where the walls are hung with combat photographs and maps of Southeast Asia and the book shelves bulge with medical dictionaries, Alcoholics Anonymous manuals and Vietnam retrospectives. Therapy groups continued from morning to night, new patients arrived and others graduated, and men pushed their wheelchairs into the courtyard for cigarette breaks.
But television privleges were expanded from weekends-only to several times a day, Dan Rather came to visit and report, and the patients watched current events unfold through the lense of personal history.
Like Americans elsewhere, some were for the war and others against it; some were angry and others sad. Many were disheartened that the nation would choose to fight yet another foreign war. Others longed to relive the adrenaline surge that combat brings, and had to resist the urge to enlist.
 
Studies on Stress Disorder
 When the ground war was delayed from mid-January until the end of February, the men here were jumpy with anticipation, as if the wait was their own. And when victory came, with a rush of praise for an all-volunteer force that was sober, chaste and efficient, some were insulted at the implication that the Vietnam-era soldiers did not have the right stuff.
Their war produced the research and literature on post-traumatic stress disorder that will shape treatment for years to come. A national study in 1988, done by the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, found that of the 3.1 million Americans who served in combat zones in Vietnam from 1964 to 1973, 15 percent, or 479,000, suffer from the disorder. Another 11 percent, or 350,000 more, suffer a partial form of post-traumatic stress disorder, less intense but warranting professional attention.
Other studies have painted a grim picture of how the Vietnam era combat veterans have fared. One-fourth of them were arrested within two years of discharge, and 200,000 are thought to be addicted to drugs or alchohal. Their divorce rate is twice that of the general population and their suicide rate 23 percent higher. Among the nation's homeless, one-third are said to be veterans of the Vietnam War.
 
Some Hesitant Predictions
 Mr. Gusman and Ms. Furey offered a few hesitant predictions about who among the Persian Gulf veterans is most likely to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. They were careful to note that war zone stress is most common but not limited to those with the longest and most intense exposure to the sights and sounds of combat.
At special risk, they said, were the prisoners of war, the seriously wounded and the people who saw the most bloodshed. They also mentioned members of the National Guard and the Reserves, whose lives were most disrupted by the hostilities and who do not return to a military community, but rather to ordinary jobs and more indifferent neighbors.
Mr. Gusman, Ms. Furey and other experts noted that quick diagnosis of war-related stress lessens the severity of the illness because dysfunction is not heaped upon dysfunction. By the time Mr. Soares entered the hospital last December, for example, he was addicted to cocaine, had been married and divorced four times and was so disruptive that he could no longer find work as a furniture-maker.
With patients like these, "we're not really treating the person who came home from Vietnam," said Mr. Gusman. "We're treating a 40-year-old who has had a lifetime of experiences since then. The longer they wait to get help the more ingrained they are in coping styles that are destructive."
As Mr. Soares prepared for discharge from the hospital later this month, he said he had one bit of advice to offer the soldiers returning from the Persian Gulf so they can save all the time that he has lost. "If you feel anything change within yourself," he said, "go ask for help -- fast."

HEADLINE: CONSUMER PRICES INCREASE, RAISING FEAR OF INFLATION

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
In the second recent dose of surprisingly high inflation figures, the Labor Department reported today that the Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in February but that when price gyrations in energy and food are eliminated there was a jump of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
This surge in so-called core inflation at the retail level, which followed Friday's report of a substantial increase in prices paid to producers, dismayed economists and drove interest rates up again. It also contributed to a big drop in the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 62.13 points, the biggest loss in five months. [Pages D1 and D16.] 
 Many analysts and market participants have concluded that the Federal Reserve is now likely to be worried enough about inflation to defer for perhaps weeks further steps to fight the recession through an easier monetary policy. They generally disregarded the favorable overall consumer index figure today since it included a 4 percent drop in energy that resulted mainly from allied successes in the Persian Gulf war after a sharp price runup.
 
Same 5.4 Percent Pace
 Business downturns are generally expected to curb inflation, but analysts find little evidence of this so far, with overall consumer prices rising at the same 5.4 percent pace during the six months ended in February and the six months ended last August.
"There seems to be very little progress" against inflation in this recession, said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers. He added that the Federal Reserve would almost certainly not act further to spur the economy until March job data are published on April 5 and might not move until it sees whether inflation subsides in reports due a week after that.
Perhaps further encouraging the Fed to wait and see was a Commerce Department report today showing that housing starts jumped 16.4 percent last month above the severely depressed January level. Permits for future construction rose 9 percent.
These were taken as additional early signs that the recession may be approaching its nadir.
Last Friday the Government reported that while prices paid to American producers fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the rate excluding food and energy rose an unsettling four-tenths of 1 percent.
"The Fed cannot ease again until the inflation news gets better, and by then the economy should be showing signs of improvement," said Robert T. McGee, chief economist for the Tokai Bank in New York.
The Consumer Price Index's overall advance of two-tenths of 1 percent was only half as much as in January but the index was held in check by a huge decline, 4 percent, in the price of energy. The price of oil had risen sharply after Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, reaching $40 a barrel in October, but it has retreated to just above $20, near the prewar level, after the allied successes in the war.
Food, which is also subject to wide monthly swings, also contributed to the moderation by falling after a substantial January increase.
"You have got to be concerned" about the core rate, which has run at a 7.7 percent annual pace during the latest three months, said Kathryn L. Kobe, an analyst at Joel Popkin & Company, a consultant specializing in price and wage data. That compares with a 3.9 percent pace for consumer prices overall from December through February.
While some price gains last month, like a 16.1 percent rise in postal rates, will have only a temporary effect on the index, analysts said that increases were relatively widespread and that upward pressure on prices seemed likely to continue. For example, services, which account for nearly 55 percent of the index and whose prices tend to be less restrained by recession or official anti-inflation measures, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month.
Fresh increases in the cost of apparel, out-of-town lodging and alcoholic beverages combined with the postal increases to account for about 40 percent of the overall February rise, the Labor Department said.
Among the seven major subindexes, food and beverages rose two-tenths of 1 percent, with a two-tenths of 1 percent drop in food more than offset by a second straight increase in alcoholic beverages. The latter's 3.1 percent jump resulted in part from higher Federal excise taxes that took effect Jan. 1 but that, because of bimonthly surveying in all but the five biggest metropolitan areas, were not entirely captured in January.
 
1.1 Percent Poultry Increase
 Grocery-store food prices fell five-tenths of 1 percent, with lower prices for beef, pork, fish, seafood and eggs only partly offset by a 1.1 percent rise for poultry. Fruits and vegetables, which were mainly responsible for a hefty January increase in food prices, fell 2.3 percent last month.
Housing rose five-tenths of 1 percent, a moderation that reflected a sharp decline for household fuels and other utilities coupled with a smaller increase in the cost of shelter itself. But household furnishings and operations posted a 1.3 percent increase, its biggest since January 1976, with nearly half this rise reflecting postal rates. An eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in renters' costs largely reflected another greater than seasonal rise in prices at vacation resorts that baffled Labor Department officials.
Apparel jumped 1.6 percent, a second straight hefty increase accounted for mainly by an earlier than usual introduction of spring lines.
The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers now stands at 134.8 -- 34 percent above its 1982-84 average and 5.3 percent above its level of February 1990. Before rounding, the increase last month was 0.2225519 percent, or 2.7 percent at a compounded annual rate. The index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers rose one-tenth of 1 percent overall and seven-tenths of 1 percent without food and energy.

HEADLINE: TAPE FOREVER TIES VICTIM TO BEATING

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 19

 BODY:
Rodney G. King, whose beating at the hands of Los Angeles police officers on March 3 may long be linked in the public's minds to police brutality, is being described by friends and relatives as quiet and gentle.
Yet Mr. King, a 25-year-old high school dropout, pleaded guilty 13 months ago to robbing a grocer of $200. Mr. King, who wielded a tire iron during the robbery, was sentenced to two years in jail and was released on parole in December. 
 Two years ago he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct for soliciting a prostitute. He paid a $352 fine and was placed on probation for one year.
 
$1 Million for Each Blow
 Today a lawyer for Mr. King said Mr. King would seek a $56 million legal award for the beating, videotaped by a witness who was nearby. The lawyer, Steven Lerman, said the figure represented $1 million for each blow struck by the police officers. Mr. Lerman said at a news conference that Mr. King, who remains hospitalized with extensive injuries suffered in the beating, is still afraid that police officers might come after him again.
"I fear the police," Mr. Lerman quoted Mr. King as saying. Mr. King's lawyers have declined all requests to interview him since March 6, when Mr. King held a brief news conference.
In the aftermath of the beating of Mr. King, who is black, by a group of white police officers, a police sergeant and three officers have been indicted, and a Federal investigation of police brutality around the nation has begun.
Mr. King had initially said he did not consider the incident racially motivated. But asked today if Mr. King now believed race was a factor in the incident, Mr. Lerman quoted Mr. King as saying: "I'm scared to say that. I don't want to start a riot."
Mr. Lerman said he planned to file lawsuits on Mr. King's behalf in county and Federal courts.
 
A Model Worker
 Mr. King was unemployed at the time of the beating, but said he had a construction job lined up, and a former employer described him as a model worker.
Mr. King is married. He and his wife, Crystal, live with their two young children and some of Mrs. King's relatives in a neatly tended house on a palm-lined street in Altadena, 10 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Mr. King's friends and family say he is not violent or menacing, despite his criminal record. After pleading guilty in the robbery case last year, he wrote to the judge in June seeking to have his sentence reduced.
"Give me another chance, your honor," Mr. King's letter said. "I have a good job and I have two fine kid who wish me home. I have so much at stake to lose if I don't get that chance. My job and my family awaits me so please reconsider your judgment, your honor. The sky my witness and God knows."
A relative who answered the door at Mr. King's home today said he is kind.
"All I can say is that he is a very nice guy," said the relative, who declined to identify herself. "He's always willing to help around the house."
 
Mr. King's Injuries
 Mr. King remains hospitalized, recovering from what his doctors said were nine skull fractures, a shattered eye socket and cheekbone, a broken leg, a concussion, injuries to both knees and nerve damage that left his face partly paralyzed.
Mr. King has spoken publicly only once since the beating. At the brief news conference three days after the incident, Mr. King -- his face bruised, an eye swollen half closed and a leg in a cast -- said he had done nothing to provoke the beating.
"I was scared," he said. "I was scared for my life. So I laid down real calmly and took it like a man."
The opening seconds of the videotape of the incident show Mr. King jumping up and trying to spin away from the police officers, but it is unclear whether he had been beaten before then. The videotape does not show any evidence that Mr. King resisted attempts by the police to handcuff and arrest him.
Mr. King denied the contention of the police that he was stopped after a high-speed chase, although he acknowledged that he might have been speeding "a little bit." The police said they do not plan to file any charges against Mr. King in the case.
 
No Other Trouble
 Parole officers said Mr. King had not been in any trouble since being released from jail in December.
Mr. King has not given a public account of where he and his two passengers, Bryant Allen and Freddie Helms, were going the night of the beating. John C. Burton, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, said the three men were longtime friends and that they had gone for a drive, perhaps to a park where Mr. King used to go with his father. Mr. Burton said he did not know where the park was.
Mr. Allen and Mr. Helms have declined to be interviewed.
The robbery committed by Mr. King occurred in November 1989 in Monterey Park, a predominantly Asian community east of downtown Los Angeles. According to testimony at a court hearing and an interview with Tae Suck Baik, the victim, Mr. King walked into the store and asked if it accepted food stamps.
When told that it did, Mr. King bought gum, then pulled a tire iron from under his jacket, told Mr. Baik to open the cash register and reached in to take the cash. When Mr. King reached for some checks in the register, Mr. Baik grabbed his arm, and the two men began fighting. Mr. Baik picked up a small metal rod and hit Mr. King several times. Mr. King hit Mr. Baik with a small bread rack, but did not swing the tire iron.
Mr. King ran out of the store, jumped into his white Hyundai -- the same one he was driving the night of the beating -- and sped away. Mr. Baik wrote down the license plate number.
A week later the police searched Mr. King's car and found a check from Mr. Baik's store. Mr. King was arrested, and he pleaded guilty three months later.

HEADLINE: Movie Producers and New York Unions Reach an Accord

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Negotiators for a consortium of Hollywood producers and two New York unions reached a tentative settlement yesterday that would end a 19-week stalemate that had virtually shut down moviemaking in New York City, a vital part of the city's economy.
The unions, representing production crafts workers and cinematographers, agreed to the studios' demands for money-saving work-rule changes that would reduce overtime and weekend pay. 
 In return, the unions won substantial increases in health and pension benefits. While ratification is likely, some rank-and-file members said the loss of the overtime made approval less than certain. The unions will vote on the agreement by mail ballot within the next month.
Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was thrilled to learn of the tentative settlement with the unions, Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators and Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries. Together, the two unions have nearly 3,500 members. The agreement was reached in Sherman Oaks, Calif., where the international alliance has its headquarters.
The producers are Columbia Pictures, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers and <biMGM-United Artists. Orion Pictures also participated as a distributor.
Jaynne C. Keyes, the director of the city's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting, said the city had been pressing for a settlement. But while the Mayor had talked with producers who visited New York and had offered to mediate, City Hall did not in the end appear to play a large role in the accord.
If the unions' memberships ratify the agreement, production could resume by May, Ms. Keyes said. City officials were worried that a prolonged boycott would hurt the city's economy. Moviemaking is estimated to generate between $500 million and $3 billion in fees to the city and in jobs for everyone from actors and camera operators to caterers who feed them between scenes. Some caterers say they have had to lay off workers since the boycott began, and some crafts-services workers like prop makers and electricians have left for cities where there are more opportunities.
But it is hard to quantify the total cost of the filmmaking boycott. Winter is normally a slow time for moviemaking in New York, and this winter has been even slower. The city has granted 25 feature film permits this year, compared with 33 at this time last year, Ms. Keyes said.
To city officials, the larger concern was that movie production has to be scheduled months before the cameras roll. So the city stood to lose a large chunk of business for 1991 unless the two sides came to terms before the warm weather, the prime time for outdoor shooting.
Local 52, which has 1,950 members, provides the sound people, electricians, shop craftsmen, prop people, camera grips and set dressers for the city's film productions. Local 644 has 1,500 members, all cinematographers.
The obstacles in the talks had been about parity between the New York locals and those on the West Coast.
The producers had said they would steer films away from New York City until an agreement was reached. The unions offered to continue working without a contract during the negotiations, but most major producers chose to go elsewhere. One exception was Woody Allen's newest movie project, which went into production in New York under a deal with the unions.
 
Concessions on Night Work
 The new agreement permits the producers to schedule workers for any five consecutive days without having to pay overtime if shooting happens to take place on a Saturday or Sunday, as was the case before. Producers would also be permitted to change the days of an employee's work week once during a shooting without penalty. This follows the pattern of an agreement with the Directors Guild of America.
The agreement also allows for a later daily shooting schedule. Filming would now start as late as 6 P.M. from May 1 to Sept. 31 and at 3 P.M. the rest of the year. Overtime pay, at time and a half, could be collected after eight hours on the job. Overtime pay would go up to double time after 14 hours on the job. Previously, all overtime was at double the hourly wage.
The new terms would mean considerable savings for producers who shoot at night, as most of them do.
Louis D'Agostino, business representative for Local 644, said that the agreement with the cinematographers was "very similar" to the settlement with Local 52. He said that his union had achieved a 65 percent increase in the producers' contributions for health benefits, and that the producers' increased contributions to the pension fund "would allow us to raise the benefit to the membership by 50 percent."
Neither side characterized the settlement as a victory. But some union members suggested that by giving up large amounts of overtime, they would ultimately gain by working more days each year, assuming that production increases in the city.
 
No Share in Residuals
 But the workers would not share residual earnings of films from supplemental markets, like videocassette rentals, a benefit that Local 52's sister locals on the West Coast have won.
Workers would receive a 4 percent pay increase in each of the three years of the contract. For Local 52, the producers would more than double their hourly contribution for health benefits -- from $2.39 to $5 -- and "significantly" increase pension contributions, a participant in the talks said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'The Agreement at a Glance'
 
The Unions:
 Local 52, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada; 1,950 members, including sound technicians, electricians, shop craftspeople, prop people, camera grips and set dressers; jurisdiction is New York City and Long Island.
 Local 644, International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries; 1,500 members; jurisdiction is the East Coast.
 
The Filmmakers:
 Columbia Pictures, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, MGM-United Artists and Orion Pictures.
 
The Agreements:
 Local 52 -- Tentative agreement permits producers to use workers on any five consecutive days out of seven days, without overtime that was previously incurred for shooting on Saturday and Sunday. Producers permitted to change days of employees' work week once during the shoot.
 Agreement also allows for a later daily shooting schedule year round. Filming can start as late as 6 P.M. from May 1 to September 31, and at 3 P.M. the rest of the year, without overtime for the first eight hours. After eight hours, workers receive time and a half, instead of double time.
 Workers receive a 4-percent pay increase in each of the three years of the contract. Producers more than double hourly contribution for health benefits -- from $2.39 to $5 -- and "significantly" increase pension contributions.
 Local 644 -- Similar cost-cutting work rules to those agreed to by Local 52. The union achieves 65 percent increase in producer contributions for health benefits, and a 50 percent increase in contributions to the pension fund.
 The changes, to be voted on by unions in the next few weeks, apply only to productions requiring more than five days of shooting.

HEADLINE: Miramax Films Goes Up Against the Big Guns

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Late last year, when the big Hollywood studios were coming out with such blockbuster movies as "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "The Godfather Part III," Miramax Films released "The Long Walk Home, " a small, intimate story set against the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955, starring Cissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg. Then Miramax watched, chagrined, as one of its favorite films got lost amid the heavy competition.
"There was a meeting of the staff to talk about the films we had going," said Harvey Weinstein, one of two brothers from Queens who started Miramax 11 years ago. "When somebody suggested that maybe the economics of 'Long Walk Home' were so bad we should drop it, 12 people, including my brother and me, threatened to resign if we did." 
 "I think that tells you how we feel about our movies," Mr. Weinstein said.
The story of a small, serious, commercially unspectacular, not-very-successful film dovetails at this point with the story of an ever more prominent film distribution company. "The Long Walk Home," uninteresting to the big studios and not destined for a mass market, is the sort of production Miramax tends to acquire and to promote, often with remarkable critical and commercial success. Among its more striking successes have been "Sex, Lies and Videotape," "My Left Foot," "Cinema Paradiso" and, most recently, "The Grifters," a list that has made Miramax a star distributor, the darling of the world of unusual, sometimes experimental films, a company with a reputation for boldness, creative marketing and a willingness to take risks.
 
For the Underdog
 "Miramax are real street fighters," Richard Pearce, the director of "Long Walk Home," said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. "They love to take on the underdog, fight the big guys."
The company is also known forunusual gestures, and it is making one with "The Long Walk Home." The film portrays two families, one black and one white, during the Montgomery, Ala., anti-segregation campaign that was led by the young Martin Luther King Jr. and that is widely considered the start of the civil rights movement in the South.
Despite the film's poor commercial performance, everyone at Miramax loves it, the Weinsteins say, and they reject accusations of historical innacuracy. They insist that it deals with an important topic and that audiences should have the chance to see movies that are not high-tech spectaculars or fantasy-fulfilling romances. And so, in a move that goes contrary to all conventional wisdom in the movie business, Miramax decided to pull "Long Walk Home" temporarily from the theaters, launch a new publicity campaign, and finally to open it a second time, which they are doing in some 15 to 20 cities on Friday.
"It's a real classic Weinstein move," Mr. Pearce said. "You never know what they are going to do next."
 
Important Intermediaries
 Though generally unnoticed by the moviegoing population, film distributors are the intermediaries between the viewers and the movie theaters. But as one Miramax client, Shirley Sun, the producer and director of "Iron and Silk," puts it, distributors are becoming ever more the key figures for independent film makers and foreign producers.
"It's actually more difficult these days to get a film distributed than it is to get a film made," she said.
In a world where there are fewer and fewer theaters devoted to what used to be called "art" films, distribution has become increasingly difficult in recent years. That is where Miramax and a few other small companies come in, most commonly acquiring the rights to a movie by paying its producer a guarantee against future receipts from ticket sales. Miramax's revenues were estimated by Forbes last year to be $55 million, making it probably the biggest of the independent distributors. New Line Cinema , which made big profits from "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles" last year, and Orion Classics , which specializes in foreign films, are its two biggest competitors.
 
Several Big Winners
 In addition to such sensational finds as "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and "My Left Foot," which the company spotted at film festivals, Miramax has distributed several other big winners, including, characteristically, a few that other distributors were unwilling to take on. Among them were Errol Morris's documentary "The Thin Blue Line," Pedro Almodovar's "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down" and Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover," the last two the sort of sexually daring foreign films viewed as high-risk products in the movie business. Among the company's current releases are "Iron and Silk," "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," "The Nasty Girl" and "Ay, Carmela."
"Bob saw 'The Cook, the Thief,' at the Toronto Film Festival," Harvey Weinstein said, "and he noticed that maybe some 60 or 70 people at a certain point just got up and walked out of the theater." "Then he calls me and says that he loved it and I said: 'Are you crazy? Why would you buy a film that people are walking out of?' But then Bob described it and it was clear that the artistry was there and the uniqueness was there."
How do two guys who are not rich, not connected and not experienced get started in one of the world's most difficult and tightly controlled businesses? This part of the story begins with Harvey and Bob Weinstein, both lovers of Truffaut, Bunuel, Fellini and other cinematic giants, producing rock concerts during their student days at the University of Buffalo and finding themselves in control of a movie house, where they started putting on second- and third-run features costing $50 or $100, which they could afford.
"Then we decided to expand and we went to Cannes," Harvey Weinstein, the elder brother, said. They financed the trip from the proceeds of their college music-producing business.
 
Creative Cutting
 Mr. Weinstein says that he and his brother, who knew only each other in Cannes, quickly discovered that all the commercially interesting films were taken. But they found "The Secret Policeman's Ball," the film of a benefit concert for Amnesty International. It had no takers, so the Weinsteins bought it, cut it in half and joined it with a sequel called "The Secret Policeman's Other Ball," with performances by Monty Python, Sting, Phil Collins and Bob Geldof.
"The two films together became a big art-house hit," Harvey Weinstein said. The brothers and Miramax were, financially speaking, on their way, and now, ll years later, they are movers and shakers. They stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel when they are on the West Coast, and when they go to Cannes for the festival, they have a suite at the Hotel Majestic. But, they say, their basic philosophy has remained the same, and they illustrate that claim with their recent efforts on behalf of "The Long Walk Home."
"I love this movie," the elder Mr. Weinstein said. "It doesn't have sex and violence or any cutting-edge ingredients. It's a picture with a good director, good actors, and it makes you feel good about this country."
"This effort," he said, speaking of the company's plans to give "Long Walk Home" another shot at attracting an audience, "is for everybody who strikes out one time and needs another chance. And if Miramax means anything, its epitaph would be that this was the place that wasn't afraid to break the rules."

Recounting the Lowlights of the Reagan Years

Sleepwalking Through History
America in the Reagan Years
By Haynes Johnson
Illustrated. 524 pages. W. W. Norton . $24.95.
The half-remembered personalities who ruled the airwaves during the Reagan Presidency, some of whom managed to stay out of jail, now appear in a stinging indictment that resembles a cartoon history of the United States in the 1980's as drawn by Herblock in The Washington Post: 
 Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Ivan F. Boesky. Michael K. Deaver. Jerry Falwell. Jessica Hahn and Fawn Hall (one posed topless, the other shredded government documents, but which was which?). Arthur B. Laffer. Dennis B. Levine. Edwin Meese 3d. Michael R. Milken. Lyn Nofziger. Oliver L. North. John M. Poindexter. Oral Roberts. Richard V. Secord. Jimmy Swaggart. Donald J. Trump. E. Bob Wallach. Not to forget Nancy and Ronald Reagan, who dominated the scene.
All these real-life characters turn up as leading or featured players in "Sleepwalking Through History" by Haynes Johnson, a national affairs columnist for The Washington Post and a regular panelist on the television show "Washington Week in Review." What distinguishes this ambitious book as social history is that it uses the Reagan Presidency (Mr. Johnson throws in President Bush's succession to round out the decade) to describe what was happening while the Chief Executive and his spear carriers were, in Mr. Johnson's view, setting the highest standards of greed, immorality and deception.
From all this, Mr. Johnson draws a conclusion for today: that the country is now paying for the Reagan legacy with lowered ideals and a debtor economy. He writes: "Two types of problems typified the ethical misconduct cases of the Reagan years, and both had heavy consequences to citizens everywhere. One stemmed from ideology and deregulatory impulses run amok; the other from classic corruption on a grand scale."
Mr. Johnson draws up a long bill of particulars against the Reagan Administration. He discusses some of the major scandals that stained the popular President's record. All involved what he calls the age-old corruption "formed by the connection between money and politics." One of the cases concerned defense contractors in 12 states, initiating what the author says became "the biggest government procurement scandal in American history."
Some of President Reagan's closest California cronies, in positions of power in Washington, found themselves dodging subpoenas and copping pleas. Was their greed inspired by the President's own hunger for money? Mr. Johnson suggests that there is linkage between the public scandals and the President's private financial desires and his wife's extravagances. Mr. Johnson makes sure to mention that Mr. Reagan's mansion in Bel Air was bought and leased to him by his wealthy friends; that both he and his wife obtained multi-million-dollar book deals; that Mr. Reagan received $2 million for giving two speeches in Japan at the invitation of a Japanese conglomerate whose founder he had once favored with a photo opportunity in the Oval Office, and that it costs the Government $10 million annually for his security, more than double that of any other living former President.
A centerpiece of "Sleepwalking Through History" is, of course, the Iran-contra deception of Congress and the public. It is still fascinating and frightening to read about how a cabal of military and civilian officials ran a government sub rosa with the President's knowledge and winking approval.
Although Mr. Johnson's book was completed before the war in the Persian Gulf, it is doubly interesting to follow the Iran-contra money now. We read about President Reagan's national security advisers secretly soliciting a million dollars a month from the Saudis as a "humanitarian gesture" when Congressional money for the contras was about to run out.
The author notes that President Reagan, Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger were all told of the illegal Saudi arrangement. He writes:
"None of this was communicated, as solemnly pledged, to Congressional intelligence oversight committees. The omission was deliberate and made with full recognition by these highest U.S. officials, including the President, that such a deception could have the most grievous political consequences. Reagan himself and his top aides were well aware that public disclosure could result in impeachment proceedings against the President. They chose to proceed anyway."
Was President Reagan responsible for the growing power of the televangelists, the leveraged-buyout manipulators, the excesses of the new Gilded Age? All typified "a self-indulgent and imitative age when entertainers became public leaders and when celebrities, not pioneers, scientists or artists, became cultural heroes." Mr. Johnson does not say so specifically, but the reader cannot help thinking that by emphasizing the national sleepwalking during the Reagan Presidency, he attributes the inspiration for the worst of times to the Reagan White House.
"Sleepwalking Through History" is an important addition to the growing shelf of works about the Reagan years because of its rich background information. It deserves a place just below Ronnie Dugger's "On Reagan: The Man and His Presidency" and Garry Wills's "Reagan's America: Innocents at Home," both of which are even harsher in their judgments of the President who brought Hollywood to the Potomac.

Saving on Paving

 BODY:
New York City's Planning Commission, the local community board and Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, have approved a Transportation Department plan to build a new asphalt plant in Long Island City, to be owned and operated by the city. So should the City Council Land Use Committee, when it takes up the issue today.
The city's private asphalt vendors have been lobbying hard to maintain their profitable hegemony over the city's asphalt supply. The proposed plant would supply city paving crews in Queens and upper Manhattan, reducing reliance on private vendors by up to 350,000 tons a year. A similar plant in Brooklyn produces asphalt for about $23 per ton, compared with the average $30 per ton charged by private vendors. When recycled asphalt and glass are mixed in, the savings are even greater. Lucius Riccio, the city's Transportation Commissioner, presents persuasive numbers showing that the new plant would also be a sound investment -- even with relatively high building costs.
The proposal and the economic slump have recently driven private asphalt prices to a more reasonable $25 a ton. A vote to approve the Queens site wouldn't commit the city to spend scarce capital to build the new plant if competitive long-term agreements with the private vendors can be reached. But it would, one way or another, assure more asphalt savings for New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Abstract Arguments, Real Births

 BODY:
In the four months since the Food and Drug Administration approved the Norplant System, a five-year, reversible, low-dose contraceptive, there's been a lot of talk about how to coerce the young and poor into using it. The talk is abstract, way off target. The practical question for public debate is how to make Norplant available to every woman who chooses to use it.
Most poor women are as eager as the more affluent to avoid unintended pregnancies. But they frequently lack access to or are suspicious of the most effective contraceptives. One consequence is that the abortion rate for women who are covered by Medicaid is three times that of women who are not. 
 The new Norplant System appears to be remarkably effective and relatively free of side effects. Six tiny tubes of progestin are implanted under the skin of a woman's upper arm, and the hormone is then slowly released into the body over five years. But lack of information and money may keep poor women from taking advantage of it.
A Norplant implant costs $350 and involves several visits to a doctor's office. That's a lot less than it costs to take the pill for five years. Even so, it's an unattainable fortune for a woman who lives in poverty. That's why it's imperative that Norplant be covered by Medicaid.
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which markets Norplant and is training 8,000 physicians in its use, has filed applications with all the state Medicaid organizations. Twelve, among them New York's, have agreed to coverage, and several others are expected to. The remainder, some of which are balking at the cost, would be wise to do so.
The long-run savings for the Medicaid program -- in expenses for unintended pregnancies and state-funded abortions -- are obvious. But it is humanity, not economy, that should compel the states to help poor women obtain Norplant. Just as this country is trying to insure that all America's babies are born equal, so it should insure that all America's women have an equal chance to make reproductive choices.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
A Unified, Weak Iraq

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
President Bush's central postwar strategic objective has been to keep Iraq whole and relatively insulated from regional vultures, even if it required a delay in Saddam Hussein's departure.
 But Mr. Bush is now getting caught up in Iraq's civil war, in protecting the rebels from Baghdad, and he is losing his strategic focus. He thus runs the risk of the rebels -- who are backed by secret deliveries of arms and money by Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia -- transforming Iraq into a second Lebanon. 
 The happiest outcome, of course, would be for the Iraqi opposition (the Kurds, Shiites, Sunnis, Assyrian Christians and exiled democrats) to patch up their historical hatreds and form a harmonious democratic government in Baghdad. But this is a pipe dream whose pursuit will guarantee Iraq's fragmentation, not its democratization.
 The real choice is between Lebanonization and this: a united Iraq with a weakened central government run by some of Saddam's cohorts. The second is the lesser evil for Iraqis and Americans.
 Mr. Bush does not have much power to bring about the lesser-evil solution, but he can make a difference. He can stress to Iraqi military leaders that he favors a united Iraq and the restoration of order as long as they avoid their traditional brutality. He also can tell our coalition partners and Iran to butt out of the civil war. Once they taste blood and oil, there will be no containing their ambitions.
 Mr. Bush was firmly on the right course until the fighting ended two weeks ago. Then, with the Iraqi Army killing rebels in the streets, he sent out confusing signals.
 He warned Baghdad against using chemical weapons on the insurgents, and stopped Iraqi forces from using helicopters and moving fixed-wing aircraft. The impulse here was a good one -- to give Iraqi forces second thoughts about mass killings.
 But the warnings also sent the wrong signal to Iraq's neighbors about U.S. intentions. They thought Mr. Bush was altering course and favoring Iraq's breakup.
 Iran rushed into the opening and supplied small arms to its brothers, the Shiite fundamentalists, in southern Iraq. Turkey dispatched arms to the Kurds in the north, a surprise move given Ankara's usual opposition to Kurdish separatism. Saudi Arabia offered cash to a diverse and untenable new group based in Beirut and Damascus. Syria reached out secretly to its few hidden contacts in Iraq's ruling Baath Party.
 Secretary of State Baker only made matters worse on Sunday. Though he said the U.S. was not secretly providing arms to rebels, he hinted at other covert aid (which Administration officials later denied).
 Washington has to say a clear no to any effort by Iraq's neighbors to pour in arms and exploit the civil war. According to U.S. intelligence experts, more arms for the rebels will not produce their victory. At the most, the rebels can be expected to hold off the Iraqi Army -- and turn their country into fiefs rivaling their tragic brother Arabs in Lebanon.
 Separatism surely sounds sweet to peoples long terrorized by Baghdad and Saddam. But replaying the Lebanese experience would be a nightmare of at least equal proportions. Outside powers would prey on the chaos. The next war and the next eruption of Islamic fundamentalism would be waiting around the corner, with Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the whole Persian Gulf at high risk.
 There is hope for another way if Mr. Bush will focus again, and hard, on preserving one Iraq. That means not destroying the only centralizing forces in the country -- Saddam's Baath Party and the military. It means that holding Iraq together should take priority over Saddam's fast ouster. He can, must and will be removed by economic pressure, later.
 His likely successors, Baath Party and military leaders, will be enervated and beleaguered. Mr. Bush can use that vulnerability to wrest concessions on constitutional reforms and greater local autonomy for the Kurds. Deserved Kurdish autonomy will be more secure if granted by a debilitated Baghdad than if the Kurds have to fight for it every day. Full independence for Kurds would mean independence for the Shiites, and that is not a healthy trade-off.
 Few want to see Saddam remain in power a minute longer than necessary, or see bad guys succeed him in Baghdad. But a unified Iraq with a weak central government may represent the only chance for its people to be at peace with each other and with their neighbors.

HEADLINE: On Not Going Into Engineering Today

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trying to Fill the Shortage of Engineers" (Careers, Feb. 26) amused me because it was the same sad tale I heard when I was an undergraduate engineering student in the mid-1960's. After 25 years in the engineering profession, I still don't believe it. 
 I suspect that the shortage tale is perpetuated by people like James A. Sawyer, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers (of which I am a member), but also chief operating officer of a large engineering company. It is in the best interest of employers of large numbers of engineers to have a big supply available. Supply and demand, simple economics: the more engineers available, the lower the average salary.
I believe that the real reason there may be a shortage of engineers, if there is one, has to do with what the profession lacks: high salary, compared with other professions, and high prestige. For the many long and extremely difficult years of rigorous education and training required to become a professional engineer, the average salary pales compared with that of a lawyer, investment banker and many other professionals.
And as for the prestige of the profession, you quote the head of a university civil engineering department saying, "There is a lot of civil engineering activity now in two areas, transportation . . . and the environment." On all levels of government how many heads of departments of transportation or environment are engineers, and how many are lawyers, business people or politicians?
If I were starting out today and wanted to make a significant contribution in either transportation, the environment or the infrastructure, in general, I think I'd go to law school, business school or into politics -- not engineering!

Causes or Results?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Injustice Taints the 'Just War' " (Op-Ed, March 2), which has the subheading "Blacks see a double standard," Richard Joseph refers among other complaints to "disgraceful public schools." 
 For the last 16 years I have been teaching in the same New York City high school. I recall that just 10 years ago, one of my students asked my advice about whether he should go to Yale or Harvard. He had been accepted by both.
This semester, I have a senior economics class again, in which one student explained her recent absence because her son was sick. Another young female pupil was absent for several days because both of her children were ill. A third sent me a note to let me know that she went in to early labor and would not return for several weeks.
Just two days ago I reprimanded a student in the same class because she wandered into the classroom five minutes after the late bell had rung. Her reply was: "This is not a job. I can come in when I please."
Are these situations the causes or are these the results of "disgraceful schools"?

HEADLINE: Israeli Army Chief, Stirring Furor, Suggests the Golan Is Expendable

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 19

 BODY:
The army Chief of Staff, who retires in a month, said in remarks reported today that Israel might safely give up some occupied territories if the nation made satisfactory peace agreements with its Arab neighbors.
The remarks by the officer, Lieut. Gen. Dan Shomron, came after a series of public statements by Israeli Government officials apparently intending to reaffirm how intractably wedded Israel is to the Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria. General Shomron's remarks helped turned a hot debate into a public brawl. 
 Several Cabinet members quickly told the general to keep his views to himself. Some said he should immediately resign, even though he is so close to retirement. Housing Minister Ariel Sharon urged leaders of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to redouble their efforts to build new housing there to affirm resistance to giving up the territories.
The political storm began Sunday, when Health Minister Ehud Olmert gave a speech in Washington. He offered a view that is heretic for a Likud party official by saying that Israel might be willing to discuss territorial issues with Syria. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 war, and Damascus demands its return as a condition for peace.
"We are ready to negotiate all of the issues," Mr. Olmert told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "all of the claims, all of the demands, including the territorial demands of the Syrians and our demands, and conclude peace between our two countries."
As the United States tries to move the nations of the Middle East to make peace, this country's position is that it wants to open talks with Arab countries without any conditions. To many in Washington, Mr. Olmert seemed to be offering only a logical extension of that position. But to Mr. Shamir and others in his Cabinet, Mr. Olmert's remarks smacked of betrayal.
"I am not happy with Olmert," said Mr. Shamir, who counts the Health Minister among his closest advisers. Other members of the governing coalition threatened to bring down the Cabinet unless Mr. Shamir repudiated Mr. Olmert's words.
He did, but then General Shomron offered his view in a briefing for Israeli military correspondents.
"A political arrangement, when it exists, is far more than just territory," he said. "It is linked to limiting weapons, supervision of one country over another. Thus if you are talking about nations at war, without a doubt territory has very great significance. But when you talk about these other arrangements, it is clear that these include various elements that diminish the threat of giving up territory and offer the possibility, for example, of long-range warning."
The statement was oblique, but more than enough to set off this Government.
The issue of the Golan remains a highly emotional one in Israel, where many still remember how, before 1967, Syrians shelled Israeli settlements from the highlands. But with the development and acuuisition of long-range missiles and Awacs reconnaissance planes, some military analysts have contended that a truly demilitarized Golan would have little strategic value.
 
Request, Then Refusal
 Mr. Shamir said on Monday that Israel was ready to talk to Syria without conditions.
"Syria has the right to ask us to withdraw from the Golan Heights," he continued. "If Syria does ask, we shall say we do not agree to withdraw."
Asked what would then be left to discuss, Mr. Shamir said: "We can talk about peace, about the ways of peace, about economic cooperation. There are many things. We say we are ready to negotiate unconditionally with all the Arab states -- nothing more than that."
Mr. Sharon then announced that his ministry had a major building program for new settlers on the Golan Heights.
"At the moment," he said, "we are in different states that range from preparations of infrastructure to actual construction of 1,200 housing units in the Golan Heights, and I intend to add the same number next year.
"There are 11,000 Jews on the Golan today," he added, "and we hope that next year the Jewish population there will be increased up to 20,000."
The statements made by Mr. Shamir and the others ended the weeklong hiatus on rightist public statements, a halt ordered by Mr. Shamir when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Jerusalem.
The statements reported today dealt also with topics other than the Golan Heights. Pressed by political rivals during a committee meeting in Parliament to say what he thought of Mr. Baker's meetings with Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem a week ago, the Prime Minister said he considered these people unfit for negotiations with Israel.
"They met him in the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to express the stand of the P.L.O.," the Prime Minister said. "We shall not talk to people from the P.L.O."

HEADLINE: First Fidelity Recast for Future

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When Anthony P. Terracciano was named chairman of First Fidelity Bancorporation a year ago, his goal was to recast the Newark-based bank much the way many experts predict the entire banking industry will have to change in coming years.
He has weeded out unnecessary operations, pared costs and payrolls, and focused the bank to serve a potentially lucrative niche in small-business and consumer lending. That kind of housecleaning is needed in almost every corner of the banking industry, experts say, and Mr. Terracciano's formula at First Fidelity is likely to be repeated in hundreds of regional banks around the nation. 
 For First Fidelity, New Jersey's biggest bank and the nation's 23d largest, Mr. Terracciano's cost-cutting program is a warm-up for the widely anticipated round of bank mergers that lies ahead.
"If we do this right," Mr. Terracciano said, First Fidelity, with $29.1 billion of assets, has a chance "to be a player when the consolidation of the industry accelerates."
 
Dramatic Turnaround
 So far, Mr. Terracciano seems to have led a dramatic turnaround at Fidelity, which was for sale shortly before he arrived in February 1990. On Monday, he got both a vote of confidence and capital from Banco Santander, a Spanish bank that agreed to invest $220 million for 9.5 million shares of First Fidelity common stock, or 13 percent of the company.
Banco Santander also agreed to acquire warrants to buy 9.5 million more shares, which would give First Fidelity another $242.4 million and a total stake for Banco Santander of 24.9 percent.
"We looked at some 80 banks in 38 states before deciding to invest in First Fidelity," said Emilio Boton, Santander's chairman.
The confidence shown by Banco Santander would have been unlikely three years ago, when First Fidelity merged with Fidelcor, Philadelphia's largest bank, only to discover that it had bought into a portfolio of troubled loans. Top executives from Fidelcor, who were expected to run the newly merged institution, departed, leaving the bank adrift with interim management.
But Mr. Terracciano arrived last year with a fast-track agenda and a track record that suggested he could bring it off. He had come from the Mellon Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh, where he guided a cost-cutting program that reduced expenses by more than 20 percent from 1987 to 1989. Earlier, he had spent 23 years at the Chase Manhattan Corporation, rising to head of global banking.
Mr. Terracciano describes himself as a "genetically programmed worrier" who is a hard-bitten executive not given to bonhomie. Poorly performing staffs are summoned to Mr. Terracciano's office, where meetings can be painful enough that "people don't really want to talk with me," he acknowledged.
To put First Fidelity among acquirers rather than the acquired, Mr. Terracciano has used the savings from cutting costs to build reserves to cover losses from bad loans. He has also bolstered the capital the company will need if it tries to make acquisitions.
The payroll has been cut by 22 percent through layoffs and attrition, to 10,500 employees, from 13,500 at the end of 1989. The bank hired the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to manage its expensive and inefficient computer center, a move that is one of the major parts of a program to save $115 million a year by the end of 1991.
In 1990, non-interest expenses, like rent, payroll and equipment, were reduced by $86 million, despite the one-time expenses of severance payments and the extraordinary cost of managing a growing number of foreclosed real estate properties.
 
Growth in Small Loans
 Eventually, growth is expected to come from consumer and small-business loans through a network of 550 branches in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. That, according to plan, will provide the capital for acquisitions.
"The new group at First Fidelity has done about as much as they can in terms of improving lending practices and controlling expenses," said Thomas Hanley, a Salomon Brothers banking analyst who expects the bank's profits to grow quickly when the economy improves. "Within another year or 18 months," he said, "there will probably be a major merger in which Terracciano comes out the winner."
In the last seven months, First Fidelity bought 57 branches with $3 billion of deposits from the failed City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., for less than $30 million. The customers at the savings bank branches do not include as many businesses as other branches, but they add to the base of low-cost deposits that has allowed First Fidility to sharply reduce the amount it borrows from large corporations, other banks and the Eurodollar market, all of which are more expensive sources of funds.
 
Return to Profitability
 So far, the plan has worked despite a weak economy. Although bad loans, particularly for commercial real estate, remain a serious drain on profits, First Fidelity returned to profitability in mid-1990 and earned $123.2 million in the second half of that year.
One reason for the rapid success in cutting expenses is that before Mr. Terraciano's arrival, First Fidelity was known as a company with a lot of fat. In the last half of the 1980's, for example, First Fidelity's non-interest expenses averaged about 65 percent of its income, compared with only 54.8 percent at rival Midlantic Banks Inc. of Edison, N.J.
One source of cost savings was eliminating separate computer systems at each of the company's eight banking subsidiaries. That system is being replaced by a centralized system, which will be based in Philadelphia and operated by Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation.
 
Largest Outside Contract
 The bank's $450 million cost for the the 10-year agreement with Electronic Data is less than First Fidelity would have spent if it had handled the work itself. The Electronic Data pact makes First Fidelity the largest banking company to have hired an outside company to manage day-to-day data processing like preparation of monthly account statements.
A centralized computer system also helps the bank develop and introduce new services. With a more streamlined computer operation, in which 250 programs were reduced to 60, simple services like deducting interest payments on small business loans from the owner's personal checking account are easier to offer.
Allan R. DeCotiis, president of Payment Systems Inc., a bank advisory concern in Tampa, Fla., noted that most banks "are better off concentrating on developing their skills in marketing and building relationships with their customers, and leave the actual processing of transactions to specialists in that business."
 
Reorganized Lending Practices
 Lending activities have also been reorganized so that all parts of the company are now following the same standards in evaluating new loans. Real estate appraisals are done through a department separate from the loan officers, providing more objective measurement of risk.
"Before, we had situations where two of our banks were competing with each other for the same business and offering different terms," said Michael L. LaRusso, First Fidelity's executive vice president and head of the internal audit group.
Mr. LaRusso, previously a senior Federal examiner who has seen dozens of banks from the inside, spent much of his first year at First Fidelity sorting through the company's loans to identify the trouble spots. That resulted in a $150.4 million second-quarter loss as the company added $300 million to its reserve for loan losses. But when Government examiners arrived later in the year, they found little to criticize.
First Fidelity could have been in worse shape had it not been preoccupied with the Fidelcor merger during the late 1980's. In 1988 and 1989, when other banks were making real estate loans that are now in deep trouble, First Fidelity was not as aggressive.
At the end of 1990, commercial real estate accounted for about 14.8 percent of First Fidelity's loans, or well below the 32.2 percent at rival Midlantic or 25.6 percent at the UJB Financial Corporation of Princeton, its two large rivals in New Jersey.
"I think they were too distracted by internal problems to be aggressive real estate lenders," said William McCrystal, an analyst at Thompson Bankwatch, a bank rating concern.

2 Buildings To Be Opened In Cleveland

BYLINE: By Jennifer Stoffel

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
TWO new office buildings set to open in downtown Cleveland this year will enhance Cleveland's ability to provide major tenants with first-class space. They have also raised the city's office vacancy rate to 22 percent, a record.
The previous vacancy peak was 16 percent in 1986. With office employment having slowed and the city still trying to absorb the space completed last year, Cleveland is now ranked eighth on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's list of the 10 riskiest cities for new commercial investment. Hartford tops the list. 
 The new buildings themselves are expected to fare well, however. They will draw most of their tenants from older buildings downtown. One is the 1.2-million-square-foot Society Center, already 60 percent leased. The other is Bank One Center, with 485,000 square feet of space, 32 percent of it leased.
"What we have is a flight to quality," said Chandler B. Converse, vice president of office leasing for Cragin Lang Inc., a real estate brokerage firm. "Over the past five years, there has not been enough new product and there is a pent-up demand among large tenants."
For decades, Cleveland lagged behind other urban centers in the development of downtown commercial space. In the early 1980's, new development stalled while buildings erected during the city's booming years in the 1920's fell into disrepair. The first sign of a turnaround came in 1985 with the completion of the 1.5-million-square-foot BPAmerica building on Public Square.
While an additional two million square feet of space was added in 1987 and 1988, following a burst in service jobs and demand for downtown office space, the vacancy rate in commercial space fell below 6 percent in 1989 after peaking at 16 percent in 1986.
All that changed in 1990 with the opening of five major commercial projects totaling two million square feet.
While the overall market for space is not expected to grow, absorption of new space has tended to result from tenants in class B buildings taking advantage of the soft market to move. In 1990, tenants took 549,200 square feet of class A space -- generally defined as buildings under 30 years old -- but vacancies in class B space grew by 277,000 square feet that year, according to Cragin Lang's survey. Older buildings are expected to continue to be hard hit by such moves.
In fact, the current market has created bargains for commercial tenants, especially those willing to take 60,000 square feet or more. Typical landlord concessions or discounts include periods of free rent, moving allowances, lease assumptions and decorating allowances. The cost of office space is expected to drop as much as 30 percent.
Class A space in the central business district is currently renting from $18 to $35 a square foot a year. "We have a slight oversupply right now, but not the G word," said Robert F. Redmond, senior vice president at the Ostendorf-Morris Company, a real estate firm, dismissing suggestions of a glut.
The 57-story Society Center occupies a full city block across from Public Square. Thirty percent of the space has been leased by the Society Corporation, a regional financial services concern and owner of the Society Bank. Also committed are the Squire, Sanders & Dempsey law firm and Deloitte & Touche accounting firm.
Set for a November opening, the project also includes a 402-room, 25-story Marriott Hotel; a two-level, 960-space underground parking lot built for the city, and a private fitness club.
As part of the project, the century-old Society for Savings Building was preserved. Both the original facade and the first floor banking lobby have been renovated. The upper 10 floors were gutted to align the old building with the new.
The other new building, Bank One Center, has been developed by The Galbreath Company of Columbus, Ohio, with Bank One leasing about 100,000 square feet for its headquarters. Bank One currently occupies the Sterling Building on Euclid Avenue, which it will vacate to occupy the new building, at 600 Superior Avenue. The law firm of McDonald, Hopkins, Burke & Haber has signed a lease for 40,000 square feet.
In light of the current market, Richard E. Jacobs and David H. Jacobs, the local developers, announced late last year the indefinite delay of construction of the 60-story, one-million-square-foot Ameritrust Center, also planned for Public Square. It was originally set to open in 1994, with construction to begin in 1991, and to include a 484-room Hyatt Regency Hotel. "The economy has changed tremendously since we signed with Ameritrust," said Martin J. Cleary, president of Jacobs, Visconsi, Jacobs. "At a time like this, a prudent developer is going to move carefully."
When it is built, Ameritrust Center is likely to be Ohio's tallest building, at 900 feet. At this point that honor belongs to Society Center, which topped out a few months ago at 788 feet.

HEADLINE: MEXICO CITY JOURNAL;
A Daring Magazine and Its Awkward Questions

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 20

 BODY:
If the editors of Mexico's newest monthly magazine had merely wanted to print their own views about Mexican politics and society, no one might have cared. What has stirred critics of the new magazine, Este Pais, is a much more delicate editorial goal: to publish what the Mexican people think about themselves.
Started by a group of intellectuals and public servants that spans the spectrum of Mexican politics, the new publication has been designed to include extensive monthly opinion polls and analysis of national attitudes, exploring public feelings on everything from politics to corruption to religious behavior. 
 But in a society where such surveys are carefully managed and seldom published, that proposition has surrounded the magazine with controversy, even before the publication of its first issue, which is scheduled to come out next month.
Government officials portray the magazine as an opposition tool, opposition parties are wary of its electoral implications, and, in general, the idea of putting cherished political myths to a statistical test appears to have challenged the comfortable ambiguity that pervades much of Mexican scholarship and political life.
 
A Tradition Is Lacking
 "If you think about political science in the United States, you think about polls, statistics, that kind of thing," said Federico Reyes Heroles, a 36-year-old political scientist and novelist who is to edit the new publication. "But in Mexico, political science means philosophy. We don't have a tradition of fact in Mexico, even in economics."
Although scientific soundings of national opinion are routinely commissioned by Mexican political parties and the Government itself, they have seldom formed an important part of public debate. Moreover, rarely if ever have they presented a full-scale portrait of values and social attitudes in a country where national stereotypes have long substituted for direct investigations of public thinking.
Among other findings presented in its first few issues, editors say, the new magazine will scrutinize traditional conceptions about Mexican nationalism, citing recent polling data that show just 56 percent of Mexicans to be "very proud" of their nationality, down nearly 10 percent from survey results a decade ago, and fully 20 percent below the corresponding figure for the United States.
Similarly, according to figures compiled by the magazine, the number of Mexicans who are ready to fight for their country in case of war has fallen from 90 percent in 1981 to less than 75 percent last year.
Other issues will deal with delicate social and political questions, ranging from confidence in public institutions to family relations to moral issues. For example, Mexican respondents in recent polls expressed a lower level of trust in their family members than did American or Canadian respondents. And the number of Mexicans who described themselves as "very religious" was just over 40 percent -- less than the corresponding figure for American respondents.
 
Some Are Uneasy
 The striking unpredictability of those figures -- and the prospect of having such data published and analyzed systematically in the pages of Este Pais -- has prompted conspicuous unease from many politicians and business people with a stake in the traditional order of Mexican society.
Citing the opposition ties of Mr. Reyes, who gave up his membership in the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party to form the magazine late last year, many party and Government officials have hurried to denounce the journal as an anti-Government project.
"It seems clear at this point that this is going to be strictly an opposition magazine," a Government official said.
But ownership of the magazine has been structured around a diverse group of 200 principal shareholders, each of whom is permitted only one vote in decisions on magazine policy, regardless of financial investment. And Mr. Reyes and his colleagues have taken care to insure that the group spans the broadest range of Mexican politicians and intellectuals, ranging from opposition economists to sitting Governors from the ruling party.
The magazine's founders' list also includes an eclectic, nonvoting group of foreign associates that includes many of the most distinguished American academic experts on Mexican government and society.
"This is something that could help reduce cynicism about Mexican politics," said Susan Kaufman Purcell, a foreign associate of the magazine who is vice president of the Americas Society, a prominent New York-based group dedicated to the study of Latin American affairs.
"The problem at this point is that the Mexican people don't trust declarations and statements and rhetoric. So to the extent that you can start basing things on more scientific kinds of studies, the people may have more confidence."
As now envisioned, the magazine will conduct many of its own polls, overseen by Miguel Basanez, a well-known Mexican political scientist who is president of the magazine's board of directors. But its editors say they also plan to use polls conducted by academic institutions, foreign experts, multilateral institutions and other investigators, making full disclosure of the samples and methods used in each to provide the clearest possible portrait of Mexican thinking.
Dr. Purcell and others caution that the test of Este Pais's success will lie in the magazine's ability to maintain a political balance in the kinds of questions it seeks to explore, as well as the scientific accuracy of the results. But that concern is viewed more as a challenge than a limitation by the editors of the magazine, who say they have planned from the start to let the political chips fall where they may.
"Everyone is very anxious about what we are going to find," Mr. Reyes said. "But that is exactly the point -- nobody really knows."

Money Market Fund Yields Are Mixed for Third Week

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report for the week that ended yesterday were mixed for the third consecutive week.
Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said the week's results reflected the relative stability in short-term markets. He predicted that short-term markets would continue without dramatic direction for the next few months. 
 "They'll be resting on their oars," Mr. Frank said.
 
Tax-Exempt Funds
 Tax-exempt money funds showed the average number of days that securities are held in portfolios at 50 days, down one day from the previous week. Assets declined $324 million, to $91.1 billion, a moderate decline, Mr. Frank said.
Yields on the tax-exempt funds were largely up for the week. The average seven-day simple yield was at 4.24 percent, up from 4.06 percent the week before. The seven-day compound yield for the week, also known as the effective yield, was at 4.33 percent, up from 4.14 percent. The 30-day simple yield was 4.10 percent, up from 4.07 percent, and the compound, or effective, yield, was 4.18 percent, up from 4.15 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the effective seven-day tax-exempt yield was 6.01 percent in the 28 percent tax bracket and 6.46 percent in the 33 percent bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Calvert Tax-Free Reserves Money Market Fund in Washington produced the best return on investment with a seven-day compound yield of 5.34 percent.
 
Top Yielding Tax-Exempt Funds
 In New York City, the top-yielding tax-exempt fund was Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, at 4.89 percent. New Jersey's top fund was the New Jersey Daily Municipal Income Fund, with a yield of 4.79 percent. In Connecticut, the top yielding fund was the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, with a yield of 4.67 percent.
Assets on taxable funds rose by $6.2 billion, to $464.5 billion. The figure, however, includes the assets of seven new funds added to IBC/Donoghue's list. Without those seven, assets rose $3.4 billion, which was termed a significant increase by Mr. Frank.
The average number of days that taxable securities are held in portfolios remained 54, the same as in the previous week.
The average seven-day simple taxable yield fell to 6.06 percent, from 6.15 percent in the previous week, while the seven-day compound, or effective, yield, was 6.24 percent, down from 6.34 percent. The 30-day simple yield was 6.18 percent, while the 30-day compound, or effective, yield was 6.37 percent, down from 6.46 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return on investments last week was the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, based in New York. It had a seven-day compound yield of 7.19 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds and are included in The Bank Rate Monitor national index, showed the average rate of return at 5.59 percent, unchanged from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Congress Gets Bush Bank Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration sent to Congress today its sweeping proposal to overhaul the banking system.
The 317-page bill is a detailed version of a plan outlined last month by the Treasury Department to repeal laws written as far back as the Depression. The Administration's proposal, a response to the growing crisis in the banking system, would permit the merger of investment and commercial banks and would allow industrial companies to own banks. It would also eliminate barriers to interstate banking. 
 Many elements of the plan have been criticized by some lawmakers, regulators and lobbyists representing smaller banks and other industries; few officials expect Congress to adopt the entire Administration plan. The package is viewed, however, as a starting point for intense negotiations that are expected to continue for months and could ultimately result in significant legislation.
A senior official at the Treasury Department who insisted on anonymity said the measure was intended to bolster the banking industry and prevent a taxpayer-paid bailout, while also offering consumers a wider variety of services at banks, like insurance and mutual funds.
The official said that adoption of the measure would almost inevitably cause consolidation among banks but that the department had not calculated how many banks would survive.
"What we are saying to banks is either get strong or get out," the official said.
The proposal that has received the strongest support on Capitol Hill would roll back restrictions on interstate banking. The chairmen of the House and Senate banking committees have also said they expect to make big strides in refinancing and changing the bank insurance fund, although they have stopped short of endorsing the Treasury plan to use the Federal Reserve for the refinancing.
The legislation gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the authority to borrow up to $25 billion from the Fed for the dwindling fund that protects bank deposits.
It also consolidates the existing supervisory authority of four banking agencies into two, the Fed and a new agency, while still providing a signifcant role for the F.D.I.C.
The legislation would also close existing loopholes in the laws on deposit insurance so that an individual would be limited to a maximum of $200,000 in protection at any one bank. Protection is now limited to $100,000 per depositor at any one bank, but by using joint accounts with family members that amount can be substantially exceeded.

HEADLINE: Heroin Spreads Among Young in China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUNMING, China

 BODY:
Four decades after China eradicated narcotics use across the country in one of the great achievements of the Communist revolution, heroin is spreading rapidly among young Chinese who are bored and unhappy and looking for diversion.
China's drug problem is still tiny compared with America's or Western Europe's -- or with its levels in the China of the 1940's, when some 20 million Chinese smoked opium. But these days the number of drug abusers seems to be rising quickly in some parts of the country, particularly here in Yunnan Province in southwest China. 
 "Lots of my friends tried heroin, because young people want to find out what it's all about," said a 20-year-old woman who began using heroin two years ago while she was unemployed. She is one of 257 addicts undergoing voluntary detoxification at the Kunming Drug Abuse Research Center, and like others interviewed she asked that her name not be used.
 The narcotics are brought to Yunnan across the long and mostly unpoliced border with Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. A few years ago, drug abuse was concentrated among the peasants who live along the border, and then it spread to the provincial capital, Kunming. Now it is has reached the cities of Xian, Lanzhou and Canton, but in most of the country, including Beijing, narcotics use is still mostly unknown.
"There are several trends," said Dr. Li Jianhua, director of detoxification at the research center. "Heroin has gone from the border area to the interior, from the countryside to the cities, and to younger and younger people."
"Personally, I'm rather pessimistic about how the problem will develop," Dr. Li said.
The resurgence of narcotics has particular resonance in China, where opium is seen as a symbol and a cause of the national humiliation and decay suffered from the early 19th century until the middle of this century. Opium arrived in China in the 1720's, and when the Government tried to crack down, Britain waged the Opium War of 1839-42 to force China to end restrictions on foreign trade.
"To be a Chinese is to know the pain of the history of drugs," said Chen Cunyi, a director of the narcotics police in Yunnan Province. "Drugs brought such harm to China, and we can't allow them to proliferate once more."
No one seems to have a firm idea how many addicts there are in China. Mr. Chen estimated that there may be 10,000 in Yunnan, while one of the addicts in the drug abuse research center said there could be 50,000 in the city of Kunming alone.
 
Ruthless Measures Worked
 After the 1949 revolution, the Communists wiped out opium by mobilizing the population to shoot traffickers and insure that addicts were forced to quit abruptly. The measures were ruthless, but superbly organized. At that time, in contrast to the present, a feeling of optimism prevailed, and ordinary people wanted to take part in efforts to "build the nation" and wipe out drug use, prostitution and other problems.
These days, young people feel no such sense of purpose, and many complain that it is boredom and curiosity that drives them to narcotics and on to an array of related problems.
A Chinese newspaper reported recently that 43 people died of drug overdoses in Yunnan Province in the first 10 months of last year, and that 70 percent of crime in Yunnan was drug-related, as addicts turn to theft, robbery and prostitution to support their habits. In addition, criminal gangs flourish on the trafficking business, and drug abuse spreads the AIDS virus because of the use of shared needles.
"People know about AIDS, but they want their high," said a 21-year-old addict in the center. He said that he, along with about half of addicts, injected heroin; the rest either smoke it in cigarettes or "chase the dragon" by heating the heroin and inhaling the vapors.
 
410 Chinese With AIDS Virus
 By international standards, AIDS is a minuscule problem in China, as only 410 Chinese are known to carry the AIDS virus. But 397 of them are from Yunnan Province. While hypodermic needles are available over the counter in China, addicts say it is common to share needles at least on some occasions.
The research center was established in 1989 to try to help addicts kick the habit, using methadone, counseling and the traditional breathing exercises known as qi gong. But while the addicts have all come voluntarily, paying for the treatment themselves, one follow-up survey found that of 81 addicts who left the center, all but three resumed their drug abuse.
The Government has shown growing concern about the drug problem. Although people arrested for possession of small amounts of heroin are normally released the first time and a second offense brings a two-year sentence, a new narcotics law provides for execution of major traffickers.
"The only way to stop them is to execute them," a 34-year-old addict in the research center said as other addicts nodded approval. "They make so much in profits that even if they're sentenced to 20 years in prison, it's still worth it for them. If a pusher is arrested, his wife will continue, because the profits are so great."
A large-scale trafficker importing heroin from Myanmar can make more than $10,000 a month, the addict said. That compares with an average wage in China of about $25 a month.
 
Four Traffickers Executed
 In February the Government said four drug traffickers had been executed in Yunnan. In the southern Yunnan town of Jinghong, a photo on a public bulletin boad offers a stark warning: it shows a young drug trafficker kneeling at the execution site, about to be shot in the head.
Yunnan's newly strengthened force of 1,300 anti-drug police officers seized 3,185 pounds of heroin last year, up from 646 pounds in 1989. But Mr. Chen, the police director, said the increase reflected more effective police work rather than greater drug use.
Much of the narcotics brought to Yunnan is not intended to be consumed here, but is transported to Hong Kong or to other international ports or airports to be shipped to the West. Tighter enforcement in Southeast Asia apparently has made China an alternative shipping route from the Golden Triangle to the West.
Most of the drug users appear to be private entrepreneurs, who have the money to afford heroin at about $10 per dose, or bored young people who have not yet been assigned a job.
Marijuana grows wild in many parts of China, but it is ignored by Chinese and sought only by young foreign tourists and students. The authorities say Chinese do not know that marijuana can be smoked.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Light Day After Gains Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in light trading yesterday as traders took profits to exploit this week's sharp rise in the currency.
Currency trading was relatively quiet as the market caught its breath after a surge in the dollar. On Tuesday, the dollar flirted with nine-month highs against the German mark after remarks by Germany's monetary chief prompted wide concern about his nation's economic reunion last year. 
 "Traders have seen just fabulous volatility in the last few days, and there are an awful lot of people who don't want to get mixed up in it," said Mike Casey, an economist for Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
Mr. Casey said several United States currency speculators bought dollars early in the session to try to increase the currency's value in the thinly traded market. But after an initial surge to 1.6630 German marks, the dollar was pushed down by traders seeking to profit from their earlier dollar purchases.
The dollar settled at 1.6425 marks, up from 1.6423 marks late on Tuesday.
Market participants said several European central banks, including Germany's Bundesbank, sold dollars to try to quell the currency's surge, but the intervention was seen as too limited to have much effect.
Traders remained cautious, however, that a concerted intervention on the scale of earlier dollar sales by central banks would hit the market.
Analysts viewed yesterday's mixed performance as an aberration in a longer upward trend. The dollar, which has risen 14 percent in the last month, is expected to climb even higher on strong postwar optimism about the economy, as well as on continued restlessness in Eastern Europe and Germany's fizzling economy.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7770, from $1.7655 late on Tuesday. Sterling also gained against the dollar in New York, settling at $1.7855, up from late Tuesday's $1.7800.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing of 138.30 Japanese yen, from 137.98 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 138.60 yen. In New York, it settled at 138.30 yen, up from 137.55 late on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4175; 5.5950 French francs, up from 5.5945; 1,123.00 Italian lire, down from 1,225.00, and 1.1574 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1549.

HEADLINE: Suspect in Fatal Arson Had Called Fire a 'Nightmare'

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
"I heard a lot of people screaming," a 16-year-old said on March 13 at a fire in the South Bronx that killed six people. "The block was full of smoke. The fire was going like a torch. It was a nightmare on this block."
The youth was Luis Morales, who was arrested on Tuesday night and charged with setting the fire. He also wanted to have his picture taken the night of the fire, telling a photographer, "Take my picture." Afterward, he asked whether it would be in the newspaper. 
 The youth said of Donald Stephens, the owner of the building, at 1074 Fox Street, who died in the fire: "Mr. Stephens was really nice. He would let me sleep there if I had no place."
Mr. Morales was charged yesterday in State Supreme Court with 12 counts of second-degree murder, first-degree arson and reckless endangerment. The two murder counts for each death consist of counts of murder by depraved indifference to human life and murder by arson, a spokesman for Bronx District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said.
The police described Mr. Morales as an unemployed high school dropout with a long criminal record who has recently lived in the streets. The police also said he had argued with residents of the building on Fox Street, whose owner often let in the homeless.
 
Troubled and With a Bad Temper
 Intertwining her fingers, Mr. Morales's mother, Cecelia, sat in her living room a 900 East 167th Street insisting that her son was incapable of such a crime.
"My son has a bad temper," she said. "He argues with people. He argues with me. But he wouldn't harm anyone. He did not do this thing."
Mrs. Morales and another son, Roberto, and several neighborhood residents depicted Mr. Morales as a troubled youth whose slight mental retardation had long subjected him to failure in school and classmates' taunts.
Mrs. Morales said Luis left about a year ago and had been arrested in a burglary and crack sales. But she added that although he sometimes stayed away from the family apartment, he was staying with friends, and not on the streets.
 
'A Lot of Pain This Week'
 A mile away, another family struggled. Jacqueline and Jeannette Mitchell prepared to bury their mother, Alberta, who died in the fire. Mrs. Mitchell, 42, began as a part-time custodial worker about a year ago at Public School 150, across the street from the burned building. She became a permanent employee in September, her daughters and school officials said.
"We've been in a lot of pain this last week, a lot of confusion," said Jacqueline Mitchell. Referring to the suspect, she added: "He should understand what he's done to us. He's made a lot of people very unhappy."
Neither the prosecutor's office nor the police would comment on Mr. Morales's record.
Roberto Morales said that shortly after he and his brother had arrived to look at the fire, two detectives took Luis into custody and questioned him at the 41st Precinct station house, almost directly behind the burning building. Mr. Morales said his brother was released shortly after that and went home.
Neighbors remembered Mr. Stephens, a retired seaman, as a good samaritan who had helped neighborhood residents and who had opened his building to many in need of shelter.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in light trading yesterday, as at least some investors apparently decided that after recent sharp declines, notes and bonds were being offered at attractive levels.
On Tuesday an alarming inflation report, the second in less than a week, helped to push bond yields close to 8.40 percent, their highest level since mid-January. 
 Traders said little real buying took place yesterday, but analysts said the rebound in prices might have been caused by a calmer reassessment of the inflation outlook.
"The inflation numbers clearly were disturbing, but the outlook is not that bad," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "With the unemployment rate more than a full percentage point above its recent low, and the economy weak, we should see an abatement in inflation this year."
 
Market Participants Wary
 Still, market participants said they remained wary.
"It's very easy to say that these yields are so attractive you need to buy them," one government bond trader said. "But the Street is awash in paper, and foreign institutions are selling. Still, I don't think the economy has bottomed out yet."
Over the last month, foreign central banks and Middle Eastern investors have been heavy sellers of Treasury issues.
Traders are also wary of a rush of new issues that will begin to come to market next week.
Yesterday the Treasury announced that it would sell $11.5 billion of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $8.5 billion worth of new five-year notes on Wednesday.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.15 percent. The five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.87 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 94 30/32, up 21/ 32, to yield 8.33 percent, down from 8.39 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 1/4, up 14/32, to yield 8.15 percent. And the outstanding 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 9/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.14 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.85 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.88 percent.
Traders said that short-term rates may have been helped by an article in U.S. News & World Report, the news weekly, which suggested that Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, does not believe the trough of the recession has been reached.
 
Investment-Grade Bonds
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Montreal Urban Community offered $135 million of 10-year debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9 1/8 percent securities, which mature March 15, 2001, were priced at $99.382, to yield 9.22 percent, 1.03 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in sluggish trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that a spurt of buying late in the session helped to push prices of most widely quoted issues up by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Up Slightly, To $7 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit grew moderately to $7 billion in January as imports rebounded, the Commerce Department reported today. But the import growth was substantially offset by stronger exports.
Economists generally welcomed the rise in exports, which they hope will continue and eventually help pull the economy out of recession later this year. They cautioned, however, that the trade figures for January were unusually difficult to interpret because of the weak dollar, turn-of-the-year distortions and irregular shipments because of congestion in ports as a result of the Persian Gulf war. The trade gap was $6.3 billion in December. 
 Figures on merchandise trade are also reported with a greater lag than most other economic indicators, many of which have already been published for February.
 
Consumer Goods Exports
 Still, analysts said they were encouraged by a $1.2 billion, or 3.6 percent, rise in exports to $34.5 billion, the second-highest level on record. Exports of consumer goods climbed over $4 billion for the first time.
"Exports are holding up pretty nicely" despite slowing or contracting economies of various American trading partners, said Michael L. Penzer, senior economist at the Bank of America. The record of $35 billion was posted in October.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher noted in a statement that exports were 9.9 percent above the January 1990 level and said it was "most gratifying to see that U.S. manufacturers are clearly aggressively seeking out markets overseas" for a broad range of products.
Meanwhile, imports for January rose $1.9 billion, or 4.8 percent, to $41.5 billion. Much of the rise reflected higher prices caused by the dollar's low international value.
 
Bill for Oil Climbs
 In addition, the nation's bill for imported oil climbed $300 million above the December level. The cost of additional volume was not entirely offset by lower prices.
January imports climbed to 170 million barrels, as the price eased to an average of $22.98 a barrel, from $25.70. At $3.9 billion, crude oil represented 55.7 percent of the total January trade deficit.
This, however, has a positive side for the future, analysts said, in that Middle Eastern producers will be using oil revenue in the aftermath of the war to buy goods and services in this country.
In contrast to the nearly 10 percent growth of exports over the last year, imports last month were virtually unchanged from the level of January 1990.
As recession gripped the economy, depressing demand, imports fell $3.6 billion in December to push the trade deficit down to $6.3 billion, a six-month low. The 11.1 percent widening of the deficit in January was a bit less than expected.
 
Reassuring Sign of Strength
 "It's reassuring that maybe there really is some economic strength out there," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, referring to the increases for both exports and imports.
The department said the export gain was paced by an $800 million rise for automotive vehicles and parts, a $500 million rise for industrial supplies and materials and a $300 million rise in consumer goods. "Other" merchandise was $600 million lower and capital goods were about unchanged.
Among imports, there were increases of $800 million for industrial supplies, $700 million for automotive goods and $300 million for consumer goods.
 
Regional Differences
 The trade report also showed that the American surplus with Western Europe fell to $1.1 billion last month, from $1.6 billion in December, while the deficit with Japan edged up to $3.5 billion, from $3.4 billion. The deficit with three of the four newly industrialized economies of the Far East -- Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong -- narrowed substantially, but a $100 million widening with Taiwan cut the overall improvement to $200 million, at $1 billion for the month.
Unlike the other figures, those for geographical entities and energy are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
Today's report also showed the overall deficit to have been $6.9 billion for January when not seasonally adjusted. On the basis of constant 1987 dollars, the seasonally adjusted deficit jumped to $5.1 billion, from $4.1 billion.
Yet another gauge -- the deficit on a three-month moving average in current dollars -- showed a decline to $7.4 billion, from $8.7 billion in December.

A series of anonymous advertisements ran in newspapers around the country last week. "57 MIPS, under $12K," said one. And at the bottom in parentheses it added, "If you guess Sun, you guess wrong."
The teaser ads, referring to new a computer able to execute 57 milllion instructions a second and costing about $12,000, were an unsual step for the Hewlett-Packard Company, known for solid engineering but an almost complete lack of marketing flair. 
 The ads also reflect the importance that Hewlett-Packard is placing on new computer work stations it will introduce on Tuesday. Industry executives said the company would start selling three new computers in the HP 9000 Series. The machines will be at least twice as fast, and in some cases several times as fast, as those offered at similar prices by other companies, including the industry leader, Sun Microsystems.
The machines could revive Hewlett's prospects in the important area of work stations, which are desktop computers more powerful than personal computers. Designed for the intense industrial computing needs of engineers and scientists, work stations are one of the fastest-growing segments of the computer business and accounted for $7.4 billion in revenues last year.
Besides the Model 720, which executes 57 million instructions per second, or MIPS, a second machine, the 730, will perform 76 MIPS at a price of about $20,000. The model 750, a more fully equipped version of the 730, will sell for about $43,000.
On a standard speed rating system known as the Specmark, the Model 720 scored over 55 and the Model 730 over 72, according to industry executives. By contrast, the $15,000 Sun Sparcstation 2 has a Specmark of 21 and a new $20,000 I.B.M. work station is rated at 32.4.
The ads for these computers are also a sign of renewed vigor and confidence throughout the proud and tradition-rich organization that has been suffering from missed opportunities and unsatisfying financial performance.
"The enthusiasm just vibrates," John A. Young, the company's president and chief executive, said in an interview at corporate headquarters here. Referring to the new computers, which the company code-named "snakes" in the hope they will be deadly to the competition, he added, "All you have to do is get close to that thing."
 
Trouble Last Fall
 Just last fall, Mr. Young was under pressure. Hewlett-Packard's computer business, which accounts for two-thirds of the company's $13 billion in revenues, had gaping problems. The company's stock price of $25 was at its lowest level in years.
In October, the company announced a reorganization that moved the chief operating officer, Dean O. Morton, into the chief executive's office with Mr. Young, seeming to cast doubt on Mr. Young's future. And David Packard, the 78-year-old co-founder and chairman of the company, began to take a more active role in the company to try to fix some problems.
Hewlett-Packard now appears to be bouncing back. The stock has recovered, closing on the New York Stock Exchange today at $45.625, buoyed by higher than expected earnings in its latest quarter and the projections by some analysts that the company's decade-long slide in operating profit margins is over. The reorganization last fall is already resulting in improved efficiencies, executives and analysts say.
Company executives also say that Mr. Young is still firmly in power. It now seems clear that the creation of the chief executive's office was more a way to prepare for the retirement of Mr. Morton and other top executives than a challenge to Mr. Young.
Indeed, Mr. Young, who is 58 years old, will reach retirement age in the next few years, as will most of the company's top officers, setting the stage for a large change in management. It would be only the second such change in the company's 53-year history, the first being in 1978 when Mr. Young took over from the founders, William Hewlett and Mr. Packard.
 
'An Inflection Point'
 All this could mean that the company is on the verge of a new era. "You're at an inflection point today," said Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
To be sure, a weak economy is hurting many high-technology companies, as reflected in Tuesday's announcement by the International Business Machines Corporation that its first-quarter earnings would be about half what analysts had expected. That casts a cloud over Hewlett-Packard as well. William Terry, an executive vice president, said the company was "wary" about the economy but that it was too early in the quarter to predict results.
Moreover, one new computer family does not a company make, especially a company like Hewlett, which has more than 10,000 products, from calculators and minicomputers to oscilloscopes, medical diagnostic equipment and analytical chemistry instruments for measuring pollution.
Still, succeeding in work stations is especially important to the company because those machines are taking over the jobs once performed by larger minicomputers.
 
Ranked Third in '90
 In 1990, Hewlett-Packard ranked third in market share of work stations shipped, with 16.6 percent, according to Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., company that tracks the computer industry. That was just behind Digital's 17.5 percent, but a far cry from Sun Microsystem's 37.5 percent.
The Model 700 machines could do a lot to restore Hewlett's momentum in work stations, though it will not go all the way. For one thing, competitors could catch up by year-end with their own machines. For another, Hewlett lacks low-priced machines, selling for less than $10,000. In a few months, the company is expected to introduce a machine for less than $10,000, a segment of the market that has the highest sales volumes and in which Sun excels.
The new work stations will use technology known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, which operates faster than conventional microprocessors. Hewlett was one of the first to embrace RISC, but used it first only in its minicomputers. That let Sun, I.B.M. and Digital Equipment get the jump on RISC work stations.
 
Lost Market Share
 Hewlett continued to rely on more conventional microprocessors made by Motorola Inc. and lost market share last year when Motorola was late with its newest chip, the 68040. The company has also had problems merging Apollo Computer, a work station company it bought in 1989, although, Mr. Young said, "We still have a strong belief in the wisdom" of the acquisition.
The company, which was founded in a garage in 1938 by two Stanford University electrical engineering graduates, once specialized in electronic and chemical instruments that were designed by engineers for other engineers.
The computer business is much more rough-and-tumble, requiring more aggressive marketing tactics than the classy company had used in the past. Profit margins are also lower than in instruments, especially as the computer industry has shifted toward smaller machines based on industry standards.
Hewlett, which has long been considered one of the nation's best-managed companies, has fared far better than most of its competitors. Some other minicomputer companies, like Data General and Wang Laboratories, have suffered heavy losses, and even I.B.M. and Digital have gone through jarring readjustments.
Hewlett, partly because of its non-computer businesses, has remained profitable and has grown at about 10 to 20 percent a year.
Still the company's operating profit margins have shrunk steadily since 1980, said Mr. Willman, the analyst. The company also suffered from slow decision-making by committee and a centralized marketing organization could not focus well on individual product areas.
The reorganization in October tried to correct those problems. It returned marketing duties to individual product groups and split computers into two divisions. One, headed by Lewis E. Platt, handles minicomputers, work stations and other products sold directly to customers. The other division, headed by Richard A. Hackborn, handles printers, calculators and personal computers, products sold through retailers.
Mr. Hackborn is perhaps the closest thing Hewlett has to a free spirit. He is based at the printer division in Boise, Idaho, and has refused all requests to move back to Silicon Valley, which he considers too congested.
Mr. Hackborn led the company to its dominance of laser printers for computers, which now account for about $2 billion in revenues. He is also being charged with injecting new life into the company's personal computer business, where it has never broken out of the pack.
Hewlett will jump into a potentially exciting part of the market in April when it starts selling a handheld computer that will come with the Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3 spreadsheet software built in.

HEADLINE: Big Losses For Airlines

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The world airline industry suffered substantial losses in January and February and will probably lose more than $2 billion for the year, the head of the International Air Transport Association said yesterday.
Gunter Eser, director general of the association, told reporters after a speech to airline industry executives that airlines had been hit by a severe drop in passenger traffic caused by the Persian Gulf war and weak economies in the United States and elsewhere.
He said the industry was also being hurt by severely rising costs for fuel and labor.
Mr. Eser said in his speech that a survey of the 202 member airlines had shown that industry revenues were down more than $1 billion in January. Incomplete figures for February so far indicate that the revenue decline last month was worse. The world industry lost $2 billion in 1990.

HEADLINE: Friend Relives Night of Police Beating

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 20

 BODY:
As Rodney G. King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers on March 3, other officers seized one of Mr. King's passengers, Bryant Allen, who says he was manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him.
In an interview, Mr. Allen said he feared for his life as he was made to crawl along the ground, hearing at the same time his friend's screams and the sounds of police batons from the far side of the car. 
 "He was screaming, 'Stop!' " said Mr. Allen, who said he heard but did not see his friend being beaten. "Then he kind of quit, and all you could hear was like bones being broken, a crunching, like a whip sound."
In the first complete account of the incident from one who was there, Mr. Allen, 25 years old, said he believed the beating of Mr. King and the blows directed at him and a second passenger, Freddie Helms, were racially motivated. All three men in the car were black. The police officers were white. As many as 21 Los Angeles police officers were present; a sergeant and three officers have been indicted on assault charges.
 
Watching the 7 Minutes
 Mr. Allen's lawyer, John C. Burton, said he would file a Federal civil rights suit. Mr. King's lawyer said Tuesday he also would file a suit. None of the three men in the car have been charged.
Mr. Allen tapped his foot slowly as he sat with his lawyer Tuesday night, watching for the first time the full seven-minute videotape, which includes the two-minute beating that has been shown repeatedly on national television. The videotape has led to calls for the resignation of Chief Daryl F. Gates and prompted inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide.
Speaking quietly, Mr. Allen described Mr. King's erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when Mr. King had trouble with his seat belt as he was complying with police orders to leave his car.
He said that at one point a female officer intervened when he himself was threatened with violence. "She's the one who had her hand out saying I didn't do anything wrong," Mr. Allen recalled. She was saying, 'He's the one that had his hands up.' "
 
An Attempt to Provoke?
 Nevertheless, he said, he was kicked and manhandled and threatened by officers who said: "You want to be like your home boy? You want to be like your home boy?"
He said Mr. Helms was bloody at the end of the evening after apparently being struck on the head with a baton.
Mr. Allen said he believed that remarks like "home boy," along with his physical treatment, were part of an attempt to provoke him. "They were trying to get me to respond to that, because I'm a black kid," he said.
Asked why else he thought the incident was racial, he added, "Three blacks in a car, all white policemen, the way they look at us."
When the beating was over, the police officers left him and Mr. Helms standing by the side of the road, he said. "They said, 'Guess what?' I said, 'What?' They said, 'You're in a Crips neighborhood.' They laughed and took off." Mr. Allen said he and his friends, all unemployed, came from a neighborhood claimed by the Bloods, a rival to the Crips gang.
 
Friends Since Boyhood
 Since the incident, he said, he had spoken twice with Mr. King, who suffered multiple fractures and what his lawyer said may be permanent brain damage. Mr. King initially declined to characterize the incident as racial.
He and Mr. King have known each other at least since they were 13, Mr. Allen said. As a boy, he said, Mr. King, who is also now 25, enjoyed working on bicycles, and his father taught him to fix automobiles.
On his recent visits, he said, Mr. King was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way. "It sounded like he was talking in riddles, all mixed up," Mr. Allen said.
As Mr. Allen recalls it, the late-night incident began with the three men speeding down the Foothill Freeway in northern Los Angeles at what might have been as fast as 80 miles an hour. Mr. Burton said the men had each drunk a 40-ounce bottle of Old English 800 malt liquor.
Mr. Burton said, "Drugs had absolutely nothing to do with this incident." Medical tests also showed that Mr. King was free of drugs.
 
Saw Flashing Lights
 After visiting at Mr. Allen's house, the young man said, Mr. King told his friends he was taking them to a park where he had gone in the past with his father.
When he saw the flashing lights of a California Highway Patrol car behind them, Mr. Allen said: "I told him, 'Rodney, pull over, stop.' He just kept on going, kept on driving."
He said Mr. King continued driving on the freeway for about five minutes, with the patrol car behind them, during which time he continued to urge him to pull over.
"I was scared," he said, adding that he thought his friend was acting odd. "I was thinking, 'Why doesn't he pull over?' " But, Mr. Allen said, "He wasn't saying nothing, just driving."
Then, he said: "I thought he was pulling over, but he was going down the off-ramp. We stopped at the stop sign, and then we were driving again. I said, 'Rodney, pull over.' We were still driving, and the lights were flashing. I could hear a lot of cars.
"We stopped at a red light and took off again. We came to another red light. I told him, 'Rodney, stop,' and he finally went to pull over and he stopped."
 
In Glare of Light
 Their small white Hyundai was surrounded by police cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights. It was at this point, he said, that the other passenger, Mr. Helms, who had been asleep in the front seat, woke up.
"The police ordered us, 'Driver, put your hands out the window,' " Mr. Allen continued. "They said, 'Take your left hand outside the door and step out.' Rodney had the seat belt, and it kind of yanked him back. The police were getting nervous too. They told him to lie flat down, and he lay flat down."
Mr. Allen said he and Mr. Helms left the car on the opposite side, beside a large, dark park, and also lay down.
"The police put the handcuffs on me, and that's when I heard Rodney screaming," Mr. Allen went on. "He was screaming like he was getting a whupping.
"When I was little I used to get whuppings. This sounded different, like they wanted to hurt him. He's a real tough man, and he was like, 'Help!' He was screaming, 'Stop!' "
 
'They Made Me Crawl'
 After the screaming stopped, he said, he continued to hear the whipping sound of the nightsticks through the clatter of a hovering helicopter. Police officers in Los Angeles use standard-issue PR-24 aluminum nightsticks that are 24 inches long and weigh 27 ounces.
On the far side of the car, he said, he was ordered to crawl in the direction of the park, his hands still manacled behind him.
"They made me crawl a certain way, to scoot. I was flat down. I was definitely frightened. I thought I was going to get shot or something. I thought they were trying to get me to scoot somewhere real dark so they could hurt me. I had already been kicked twice."
Later, he said, "They slapped me twice against the car," threatening that he could get beaten like his friend, frisking him and covering his face so he could not see what was happening.
By that time, he said, Mr. King had stopped screaming. "I just closed my eyes," Mr. Allen said. "Whatever was happening to him, I didn't want to see."

HEADLINE: Capital-Hungry Banks Fatten Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Reflecting higher confidence among investors, the banking industry has already raised more capital in stock offerings this year than it did during all of 1990.
The rush to market -- through a flurry of offerings of common and preferred stock, most of them this month -- is a sign not only of improved demand for bank stocks but also of a recognition by bankers that they must have more capital if they are to expand into new businesses or acquire other banks. 
 Led by Citicorp, which privately sold $1.28 billion of convertible preferred stock to more than three dozen investors around the world, banks have raised $2.78 billion of equity capital this year, compared with only $2.08 billion in all of 1990.
 
A Surge in Financings
 Including bond sales, which do not count toward equity capital but are an important indication of banks' financial strength, public financings this year total $4.08 billion, compared with $4.44 billion in all of last year.
The nearly $2.8 billion in equity investment raised this year is small compared with the more than $200 billion of capital in the industry. But the ability of healthy banks to raise new capital at a price they find acceptable is a sign that investors are not shunning all banks, despite heavy loan losses at some.
Federal Reserve officials, who have often urged banks to strengthen their financial base, are encouraging the financings by acting quickly when their approval is needed. The officials are also assuring potential buyers of large blocks of a bank holding company's stock that the buyers would not have to supply all the additional capital that might be needed if the company's subsidiary banks got into serious trouble -- even though such large buyers would have a controlling interest in the banking company under Federal regulations.
"The Fed is really trying to encourage various transactions which would produce more capital for the banking industry," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking specialist and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm.
One example of this cooperative attitude involves Banco Santander's planned purchase of 13 percent of the stock of the First Fidelity Bancorporation, which was announced Monday. Mr. Cohen said Fed officials had indicated they would not hold the Spanish bank solely responsible for supplying additional capital if First Fidelity's subsidiary banks were to encounter serious difficulty.
The Spanish bank, which agreed to buy about 9.5 million First Fidelity shares for $220 million, will have two seats on the board of the bank, which is based in Newark. Banco Santander could eventually own 24.9 percent of First Fidelity if it exercises an option to buy 9.5 million more shares.
 
Investors Coming Back
 Analysts have warned that many banks will continue to report increases in loan losses and delinquent loans in the first half of this year. Still, "there are many investors who had made a decision to be out of bank stocks entirely, but have moved back into the group as stock prices improved," said James Schmidt, portfolio manager for the Freedom Regional Bank Fund, a Boston-based mutual fund.
Bank stock prices have increased by 50.4 percent from their lows on Oct. 31, 1990, according to an index maintained by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, the securities firm. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has increased 20.6 percent during the same period. During late 1989 and most of 1990, banking companies were among the worst performers in the stock market, as losses from bad loans discouraged many investors.
"Reinvestment opportunities for banks who are raising capital have never been better," said Richard Barrett, a managing director at Salomon Brothers and one of many investment bankers who have been advising banks to issue new securities.
The problems of some banks and savings institions have created "a target-rich environment" for banks with the money to make acquisitions, he said.
 
A Stronger Balance Sheet
 The Norwest Corporation, a Minneapolis banking company that bought a large bank in Wisconsin last year and has received approval to buy the largest banking company in Colorado, raised $192 million through a common stock offering in late February. The money was not needed to pay for the recent deals, said John D. Crumrine, treasurer. "But we think," he said, "that banks with the strongest balance sheet will be the most highly regarded in the marketplace and will have the most flexibility in the future."
Among the companies that have recently issued new common stock or securities convertible into stock, Norwest, Keycorp of Albany, and NBD Bancorp of Detroit are among the banking stocks recommended frequently by Wall Street analysts. The BankAmerica Corporation, another company whose stock is frequently recommended, was arranging a $125 million issue of preferred stock yesterday.
Other than the Citicorp private placement, the largest stock offering by a bank so far the year was for $689.3 million by the MBNA Corporation, a company whose only business is the credit card operation previously owned by MNC Financial of Baltimore.
Except for Citicorp, large New York City banks have not been raising new equity capital, even though their ratios of capital to assets are low by industry standards. Stock prices of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation have risen, but they remain far below book value, or the value of each share if the company's assets were divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Jeffrey Peek, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, said recently that "capital would come out of the woodwork" if some of the weakly capitalized banks were to announce merger plans that would lead to sharp cost reductions and the opportunity for bigger profits.

HEADLINE: Bush Greets Walesa With Debt Relief

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Welcoming Lech Walesa to the White House for the first time since he was elected President of Poland, President Bush forgave an additional $800 million in Polish debt payments today.
With that decision the United States has now agreed to wipe clean 70 percent of Poland's $3.8 billion debt to Washington, 
 Administration officials said the debt reduction was intended to encourage the American business community to invest in Poland and to convince any resurgent Soviet hard-liners that Washington would continue to stand by and bolster emerging reformist Governments in Eastern Europe. Mr. Bush and Mr. Walesa followed up the debt-relief announcement by signing a joint statement declaring "a new era of cooperation and partnership."
A senior State Department official said the declaration was meant to serve as a demonstration of Washington's commitment to Poland's national security as well as its economy.
Addressing Mr. Walesa during a wind blown welcoming ceremony on the White House South Lawn, Mr Bush declared, "So, as you can see, Mr. President, we want your economic transformation to succeed, your new democracy to flourish."
He noted that by moving to eliminating 70 percent of Poland's debt, the United States was going beyond the 50 percent debt reduction set last week by the Paris Club, the consortium of Western creditor countries who among them hold $33 billion dollars of Poland's debts. "And we call on other nations to follow our example," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Walesa, the former shipyard electrician and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, speaks only Polish. But he concluded his remarks with the English phrase "God bless America," at which point, Mr. Bush turned to him and responded, "Beautiful, thank you, so sweet."
Mr. Walesa responded to the debt-reduction announcement by noting that "it gives us new, great possibilities." He said Poland's economic recovery "is needed by the whole free world, for it extends its boundaries to the central region of the continent." "It extends the zone of democracy and security," he continued.
Obviously concerned that the generosity shown Poland not raise the hopes and appeals of other debtors, a State Department official said the action taken was "a very rare step" and that that scale of forgiveness would be limited to only Poland and Egypt. The Administration last year cancelled Cairo's $7.1 billion debt for sales of military hardware in gratitude for its role in the gulf crisis. Egypt has since asked its creditors for more relief.
 
Painful Economic Changes
 "These are unique circumstances," the official said, explaining that Egypt had played a critical role in the coalition that waged and won the gulf war. As for the Polish Government, he described it as "a new regime that more than any other country is undergoing a radical, comprehensive economic reform program," which he said made it "worthy of Western support."
Poland has gone farther in imposing often painful economic changes than any formerly Communist country. By ending subsidies and allowing prices to find their own level, Poland has succeeded in sharply lowering inflation and establishing a stable and convertible currency, although unemployment has risen in the process.
The American-Polish community is important politically in a number of cities.
The two leaders took a stroll through the Rose Garden, where Mr. Bush offered Mr. Walesa a flowering bud from a dogwood tree. During a one-hour meeting primarily devoted to economics, Mr. Walesa reported progress in Polish negotiations with Moscow to step up the scheduled withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops who are still stationed in Poland.
Mr. Bush's warmth, Administration officials said, reflects a belief that Poland's economic and political future is fundamental to the development of healthy democracies in neighboring countries struggling out of their Communist past. They said that even though Poland has been slow to privitize many state-owned industries, the Administration views Poland as the leader of Eastern European change and a hopeful example for its neighbors.
In terms of purely American politics, Mr. Bush was well aware that M. Walesa is a popular hero within the influential Polish-American communities, while Mr. Walesa was similarly well aware that these days Mr. Bush is also popular in those communities.

HEADLINE: Mayor Seeks 10% Tax Rise And Layoffs In Stamford

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., March 20

 BODY:
The Mayor of this Fairfield County corporate center is proposing to lay off 174 city workers and raise property taxes 10 percent in a budget that reflects the impact of reduced state and Federal aid as well as a slowdown in Stamford's once-booming economy.
In his $264.3 million budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning July 1, Mayor Thom Serrani on Tuesday proposed eliminating 44 vacant positions and laying off 174 of the city's 1,449 employees outside the school system. Eighty-four layoffs would come from eliminating the trash-collection division of the Department of Public Works, replacing it with private trash collectors. 
 "It is essential to live within one's budget and to occasionally accept the necessity of personal sacrifice," Mr. Serrani said in a letter to the city's Board of Finance and Board of Representatives, citing slower growth in tax revenues and a cut in state aid proposed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. that would cost the city $7.2 million. The two boards have the power to reduce but not increase Mr. Serrani's budget.
 
Unions Unhappy
 Last summer, Stamford laid off 57 city workers, mostly clerical and public-works employees, to keep a deficit from developing in the current budget of $257.5 million.
Union leaders representing city employees expressed dismay at Mr. Serrani's decision to lay off more workers. "It just doesn't seem to be the appropriate solution for Stamford," said Peter Thor, staff representative for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and a spokesman for the Stamford Municipal Coalition, which represents nine city unions. "If this was Bridgeport, I wouldn't be saying that."
In the last two decades, this city of 108,000 became almost synonymous with suburban affluence and was the hub of Fairfield County's growth. Scores of corporations, many from New York City, relocated here. And city coffers swelled with additional property tax revenue from new homes, shopping centers, industrial parks, office towers and condominiums.
But in the last year, slower growth in the tax base and cuts in state and Federal aid have helped bring an end to that economic era, here and in other Connecticut cities.
Bridgeport, which has been flirting with bankruptcy, has been embroiled in bitter negotiations with a state fiscal oversight panel that is demanding reductions in services and layoffs of at least 58 employees to erase a $7.6 million deficit for the current fiscal year. Projections suggest that the city, which is the largest in the state, could accumulate budget shortfalls of $34 million next year and $200 million over five years.
The outlook is almost as bleak in New Haven, which is planning to lay off 236 employees to close a $6.2 million budget gap for the current year and a projected deficit of $40 million for the next fiscal year.
Though the budget proposal in Stamford entails less Draconian personnel cuts and a smaller tax increase than in Bridgeport or New Haven, officials in this prosperous city are not as accustomed to acts of austerity.
Paul A. Pacter, a professor of accounting at the University of Connecticut at Stamford and the city's Commissioner of Finance from 1984 to last October, warned that Stamford's troubles could become as dire as those in Bridgeport and New Haven.
He blamed the problems principally on the slower growth in taxable property, although other factors -- such as big pay increases awarded to city unions in arbitration proceedings -- helped make annual spending increases of 8 to 10 percent almost automatic during the 1980's. Mr. Serrani's 1991-92 spending proposal is a 3 percent increase over the current budget.
 
Some Positive Elements
 The total assessed value of taxable property in Stamford is expected to rise by $56 million, or 1.9 percent, for the next fiscal year, compared with increases of 5.1 percent last year and annual rises of about 6 to 8 percent during the previous five years.
Mr. Pacter noted, though, that Stamford, the state's fifth-largest city, has many positive fiscal attributes: no budget deficits since 1983, a moderate property-tax rate, high municipal bond ratings and a large and diversified commercial tax base.
"I really don't think Stamford is suffering from any mismanagement or overspending," he said.
Another major factor is the decrease in state and Federal aid. In the mid-1970's, 70 percent of Stamford's revenue came from property taxes, 20 percent from state and Federal funds and 10 percent from other sources. Now, 80 percent comes from property taxes, and 8 to 9 percent from the state and Federal governments.
Mr. Serrani, a Democrat who has been mayor for seven years, said the proposed tax increase would have been 6.5 percent instead of 10 percent if Governor Weicker had not proposed reducing state aid to Stamford. Stamford's property-tax rate rose by 4.5 percent last year. Tax increases during the previous six years ranged from 2 to 6 percent.
 
School Cuts Suggested
 The Mayor has proposed cuts in every city department for which he can set the budget, except the departments of health and welfare. By law, Stamford's mayor cannot reduce the budget of the Board of Education, which makes up $103.2 million of the Mayor's overall 1991-92 budget proposal. But he did urged the Board of Finance and the Board of Representatives to make reductions in the school department, which has about 1,700 employees.
All day Tuesday, workers in the city's Government Center commiserated with those who had been notified that they were to be laid off. "My greatest fear right now is if I can't make my mortgage, I might lose my condo," said one employee, Diana M. Crouse, the director of the city's Fair Rent Commission and a city employee for 17 years. "There is nothing out there. I don't even have my resume ready."
Union leaders and political opponents of Mr. Serrani have attributed Stamford's budget problems in part to mismanagement.
But even the critics concede that external factors, like the nation's recession and the slumping real estate market in the Northeast, have been a big factor. "Stamford is not growing at the dizzying pace of the 1980's," said Mr. Thor, the union leader. "But nothing is growing at that rate."

HEADLINE: At Newsstands Soon: a Daily Slugfest

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
A battle royal among New York City's tabloid newspapers is about to begin.
By this weekend, The Daily News should be back on most newsstands, and television commercials urging readers and advertisers to come back to the paper are scheduled to start. 
 "You can look to us to fight back for our place," said Robert Maxwell, the paper's new owner whose stewardship is to begin with tomorrow's issue. The News's founder, the Tribune Company of Chicago, sold the paper after it lost most of its circulation and advertising in a crippling strike.
 But the city's two other daily tabloid papers, New York Newsday and The New York Post, say they are going to fight just as hard to keep the significant gains in circulation and advertising they have made since the strike began on Oct. 25.
 
Campaigns Are Ready
 "We don't anticipate keeping everything that we got, but we also do not expect to shrink to anywhere near pre-strike levels," said Robert M. Johnson, the publisher of New York Newsday and the larger Newsday on Long Island. He said he had his own promotional campaign ready to run.
Peter S. Kalikow, owner of The Post, said that he had "a little" radio and television promotion planned and that he would compete with The News by "putting out the best paper we can."
Mr. Kalikow has said that his main strategy is to keep his costs down and make a modest profit, which he thinks is possible as long as The News's circulation does not swamp his own, as it did before the strike.
While regaining some advertising right away would be a vote of confidence for The News, all parties agree that the major battle will be over circulation.
Before the strike, The News had daily circulation in the New York City area of just over 1 million and Sunday sales of 1.3 million, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The paper says it now has a daily and Sunday circulation of about 600,000, but the unions say it is about 400,000.
 
Circulations Went Up
 The New York Times gained little of the circulation lost by The News, and several newspaper analysts say it will not be one of the main combatants in the newspaper war.
During the strike, New York Newsday's weekday circulation rose about 120,000 and The Post, which has no Sunday paper, added about 200,000.
Even more damaging to The News, New York Newsday has sold almost 300,000 more copies on Sunday than it did before the strike. Sunday's issue is the most important of the week because it is packed with advertising.
In theory, if The News rebuilds its circulation its advertising will probably return as well.
Mr. Maxwell has already had success in luring some of the paper's largest advertisers back, at least for the moment, and some are gleeful at the prospect of a revived News.
"We're anxious to get back in the paper," said Bob Cole, advertising manager for Stern's, a department store chain with two large stores in Queens. Stern's ads have already begun appearing again in The News.
An executive of a company that places coupon ads in Sunday papers said his company could be back in The News by early April if the Sunday circulation returns. The executive, who would speak only anonymously, said The News would attract more ads in proportion to its circulation increases.
But several newspaper executives said that translating circulation gains into advertising gains would be far more difficult because the city is in an economic slump that has been devastating to overall advertising sales. In effect, The News will be battling for a larger share of a shrunken pie.
 
The Personality Factor
 The probable outcome boils down to anybody's guess.
"A lot of it has to do with Maxwell's personality and how much confidence he inspires in readers and advertisers," said W. Dean Singleton, chief executive of Media News Group Inc., a newspaper chain that includes papers in Passaic and Union City, N.J.
Mr. Singleton was one of those approached by unions in their quest for a buyer, and he characterizes Mr. Maxwell's gamble that The News can be successfully revived as "very risky."
Over the long term, Mr. Singleton said, New York Newsday would prevail as the city's leading tabloid, in large part because its owner, the Times Mirror Company of Los Angeles, is committed to remaining and has vast resources to fight indefinitely.
"If anybody gets squeezed out, it's going to be The Post," he said.
Mr. Kalikow, of The Post, disagrees. He said that The Post had long-term contracts with many of its advertisers and that he expected to cut costs further to reflect the concessions won from unions by Mr. Maxwell.
Because his costs are relatively low, Mr. Kalikow said The Post could lose some of its circulation and still survive. He said the main fight will be between The News and New York Newsday over dominance on Sunday.
Mr. Johnson, publisher of Newsday, said that New York Newsday's strong presence in Queens and Brooklyn means that the paper would be vital to the city's advertisers, barring a catastrophic decline in circulation.
Mr. Maxwell, who seems to be practicing his American slang in anticipation of a donnybrook, said of Newsday, "They ain't seen nothin' yet."

HEADLINE: Air Traffic Drops 26.8%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
International airline passenger traffic dropped by 26.8 percent last month on United States airlines amid a recession and the fear of terrorism, the Air Transport Association says.
Passenger traffic on routes inside the United States fell 5.5 percent, producing a total decrease of more than 10 percent, the steepest drop in nearly 25 years, the airline trade association said on Monday. The declines are measured against traffic in the corresponding month a year earlier. 
 Passenger miles for February fell to 5.15 million from 7.04 million internationally, to 23.2 million from 24.5 million domestically and to 28.3 million from 31.5 million over all.
"Revenues are expected to be way off," said Tim Neale, a spokesman for the association.
The losses are particularly troublesome to an industry in which two leading airlines, Continental and Pan Am, are operating under bankruptcy protection and several others are having severe financial problems.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises by 4.21; I.B.M. Drops Further

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
One day after its worst session in more than five months, the stock market brushed itself off yesterday and posted a small gain in nervous trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.21 points to close at 2872.03. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was fairly heavy, at 196.8 million shares, and advances led declines by a small amount. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed up 1.33 points, to 367.92, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.28 points, to 466.09.
In early trading, stocks moved within a narrow range as bargain hunters sought values after Tuesday's 62-point Dow selloff.
Investors and traders kept a wary eye on I.B.M., which was a big factor in Tuesday's decline after it announced lower expected earnings. Shares of the computer maker closed down 1 yesterday, to 114 1/8, on four million shares traded.
"Basically, the market stabilized after the trauma of yesterday," said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman Inc. Investors searched for safety, he added, "as they continue to sell high-tech issues and move money toward consumer nondurable stocks like foods, drugs and tobaccos."
Utilities showed some strength yesterday, he noted, reflecting the lower inflation fears in the bond market, and possibly the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court to allow the Commonwealth Edison Company to put into effect an already approved rate increase over the objections of consumer groups. The utility's stock was up 5/8, to 39 1/4.
Mr. Hill said yesterday's "real strength came from a reversal in bonds, indicating that inflation expectations are not getting worse, providing a base of confidence to retain stocks."
Concern over first-quarter earnings continued to worry the market, however. Some traders felt early in the session that I.B.M.'s stock price could hold and that the worst of Tuesday's decline was over. But others remained skeptical, and declining issues took an early 5-to-1 lead over stocks advancing.
 
Other Computer Stocks
 Among the personal computer stocks following I.B.M. down were Compaq Computer, down 1 3/4, to 59 1/2, and Apple Computer, down 1 3/4, to 67 3/4. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 2 1/8, to 87 1/2, also on a poor earnings outlook.
In Tokyo, the stock market was closed today for Spring Equinox Day. Yesterday, the Nikkei index slipped 557.31 points, or 2 percent, to close at 26,449.35.
Toward noon, the New York market made a small run on bargain hunting, with advances taking a slight lead over declines. But by early afternoon, the Dow had slipped into the negative side in directionless trading.
Choppy trading persisted into late afternoon, with stocks moving toward their highs as bonds posted further gains. "The market has room to rebound further," Mr. Hill said. "You had more volume on a slightly up day like today than the lighter volume on a bad day like yesterday."
Among the stocks posting gains was NCR, up 3 1/4, to 98, after A.T.& T. said it would increase its offer for the computer company to $100 a share if NCR removed its board next week. But traders and analysts noted that shares stopped short of that price, an indication that investors were unconvinced that A.T.& T. would clinch the deal. A.T.& T. shares slipped 3/8, to 34.
In the health-care sector, C.R. Bard, principally engaged in hospital and surgical specialties, rose 1 1/4, to 21 1/4, on speculation of favorable first-quarter results. The company is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval of its Probe III angioplasty catheter
Other health-sector stocks that performed well were Pfizer, up 3 3/8, to 104; Schering-Plough, up 1 1/8, to 50 1/8; Merck, up 2 1/4, to 103 3/4, and American Cyanamid, up 1 1/2, to 53 1/4.
Warner Lambert rose 3, to 74, following a buy recommendation from a Dean Witter analyst, Jerome Brimeyer, who said the company's Cognex drug for Alzheimer's disease could be approved by the end of 1991.
Airlines were narrowly mixed, while auto stocks were down. Chrysler slipped 3/8, to 14 1/2, and General Motors fell 1 1/4, to 37 3/8.

HEADLINE: Study Finds U.S. Behind In Key Fields

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The United States, which had a commanding lead in high technology a decade ago, is now losing badly to foreign competitors in a number of fields considered crucial, a group of executives said today.
The Council on Competitiveness, a nonprofit organization of leaders in business, education and labor, reviewed America's position in technologies. Ninety-four technologies were reviewed. 
 The council found the United States was still either the leader or competitive in about two-thirds of the technologies. But in a third, the council said, United States companies were far behind and were no longer a factor in world markets or were expected to fall hopelessly behind over the next five years.
 
Disturbing Decline
 The council said this was a disturbing decline from a decade ago, when the United States would have been judged to be the leader in virtually all of the technologies surveyed.
The council's report, "Gaining New Ground: Technology Priorities for America's Future," gave each technology one of four rankings. A "strong" ranking means United States industry is in a leading world position and is in no danger of losing that position over the next five years; "competitive" means United States industry is roughly even with the world's best; "weak," means the United States is behind or likely to fall behind in the next five years, and "losing badly or lost" means the United States is no longer a factor or not likely to have a presence in the next five years.
Following are the findings:
 
STRONG

Powertrain and propulsion: Air-breathing propulsion, low-emission engines and rocket propulsion.
 
COMPETITIVE
Materials and associated processing: Catalysts, chemical synthesis, magnetic materials, metal matrix composites, net shape forming, optical materials, photo resists, polymers, polymer matrix composites, process controls and superconductors.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Asks Unions to Give Back Gains to Help Shrink Government

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins asked municipal labor leaders yesterday to roll back health-insurance costs and other benefits as he, for the first time, proposed a long-term strategy to close a soaring city budget gap by permanently shrinking the size and cost of the government.
Mr. Dinkins provided few details, but he said the concessions he was seeking were "sizable" and could offset the need for thousands of layoffs and hundreds of millions in additional budget cuts that city agencies were directed to prepare yesterday. The actions are intended to close a $3.1 billion gap in a budget of about $29 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
 "I have every confidence we can reach an accord," Mr. Dinkins said after meeting with the labor leaders. "They can read and write and count just like I can, and they will recognize the devastating impact if we don't get some assistance from them in some of these quarters."
The sweeping request goes far beyond other concessions previously sought by the Mayor and is part of a new approach to the city's worsening fiscal situation sketched out by Mr. Dinkins in briefings at Gracie Mansion for business executives, labor and civic leaders and commissioners.
After months of criticism for what many fiscal analysts viewed as an inconsistent and piecemeal effort to close city budget gaps, Mr. Dinkins said the administration had to deal forcefully with a pattern in which the city is continuing to spend more on services than it is receiving in taxes.
With the local economy in a deep recession, he said, the city could afford no new taxes above the $1 billion increases already called for in the Mayor's financial plan. Instead he called for permanent labor concessions -- he called them "labor contributions" -- and permanent cuts in city services and the city work force.
Labor leaders, who were being asked to give back benefits won in negotiations over the last decade, including some won from Mr. Dinkins only months ago, said that they could not support the concessions Mr. Dinkins sought.
"Absolutely no givebacks," Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said after the meeting. "We are not going to open these contracts again."
At the meeting, other labor leaders said they were willing to do their fair share but were not willing to see the city "balance the budget on the backs of city workers," according to one participant.
But the labor leaders said they had agreed with the Mayor that the city's fiscal problems were serious, and they said they were impressed with Mr. Dinkins's efforts to take charge. They agreed to meet with him again this morning to continue discussions.
In addition to giving back benefits, Mr. Dinkins asked the labor leaders to consider such permanent concessions as some holidays without pay, changes in work rules and the repeal of recent state legislation increasing workmen's compensation benefits. Earlier drafts of the city's new plan called for $300 million in labor concessions, but yesterday no figures were given.
 
1970's Crisis Recalled
 The concessions sought were reminiscent of those won from municipal unions during the fiscal crisis in the 1970's, when pension and other benefits were cut back. In the early stages of that crisis, the Mayor then, Abraham D. Beame, negotiated concessions in work rules from unions to avert layoffs in one year, but sweeping layoffs were required the following year.
Behind Mr. Dinkins's efforts was a realization that the city's fiscal situation had worsened in the last few weeks with a projected reduction of $600 million in state aid and tax revenues below projections.
Mr. Dinkins, in a statement to city commissioners, called fiscal problems the "defining reality" of his administration.
Yesterday, underscoring this concern, both the city and state comptrollers issued reports showing that in the current fiscal year tax revenues were falling below the city's projections, while the number of city employees, though declining, remained above the level forecast.
 
$800 Million in Cuts Asked
 The administration said that in the next fiscal year the city faced a new budget gap of $910 million on top of the $2.2 billion gap it had reported since November. To close the new gap, Mr. Dinkins asked his commissioners to prepare more than $800 million in budget cuts, some of which would be offset by concessions he hoped to get from labor leaders.
Agencies were being asked to cut spending an average of 13 percent, in addition to severe cuts adopted within the last few months. A memo from the Mayor to agency heads said the Sanitation Department and the Department of Parks and Recreation would be hit with cuts of about 25 percent, while the Fire, Correction and Police Departments would face much lower cuts.
"We are certainly going to have some problems, and I don't want to sugarcoat that," Mr. Dinkins told reporters. "but I think it is also important to understand that part of this effort is to try to do certain things with lesser personnel, try to be more efficient."
He said he was "confident that we have the brainpower, the ingenuity and the will to get the job done."
Mr. Dinkins is also calling for a $2 billion cut in projects now included in the city's $20 billion capital budget over the next four years. But city officials said yesterday that all but $600 million of the cut projects would be replaced by other high-priority projects.
New York City spends $1 billion a year in health and welfare costs, and in its latest contracts agreed to increase city payments to union welfare funds by $100 a year for each employee. The funds typically pay for dental care, eyeglass benefits and other services.
"It is an area that virtually every employer, public and private, around the country is looking at for savings," said Robert W. Linn, a former city labor negotiator and now a labor consultant.
City health plan costs have been rising at a staggering rate. In 1984 the city agreed to cover the enrollment of each worker in what was viewed as a typical health plan, the Health Insurance Plan of New York.
But since then the cost of the H.I.P. plan has risen far above the increases in other health services; it rose by more than 30 percent in the last two years alone, said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the state's Financial Control Board.
 
Stronger Mayoral Role Praised
 For weeks, both labor and business leaders have asked Mr. Dinkins to take a stronger role in leading the city out of its fiscal crisis and in giving them a say in the process.
Yesterday, as Mr. Dinkins called the leaders to meet with him, business executives applauded the Mayor's new proposals, and labor leaders objected to them. But both praised him for taking the lead.
Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a business group, said it was a "very dramatic change in directions."
"This is the first time I heard the Mayor say there was a structural deficit that will be addressed by recurring savings," Mr. Shelp said.
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said: "We hollered at the Mayor to take charge, and he took charge. We were not happy with what he was saying, but he was running things and doing it well."

HEADLINE: Bizarre Priorities on Arms

 BODY:
It's a propitious moment to curb arms sales. Iraq has just demonstrated the perils of arming states to the teeth in the Middle East. And arms buyers and sellers are looking to Washington for leadership. But instead of trying to negotiate restraints, President Bush seems eager to reopen the Middle East arms bazaar. It's up to Congress to reverse his priorities.
Responding to pressures from U.S. defense contractors and their Congressional backers, Mr. Bush wants the Export-Import Bank, a Government agency, to underwrite sales of arms to states that can't afford them by guaranteeing up to $1 billion in bank loans. That would supplement the loan guarantees the Pentagon already provides. 
 And just weeks after forgiving billions in loans to Egypt, Mr. Bush intends to sell it $1.6 billion in new weapons. That deal represents just a fraction of the $18 billion in arms that the Administration is planning to sell to the Middle East in the coming year.
Oddly, in his speech to Congress on March 6, Mr. Bush put a high priority on curbing chemical, biological and nuclear arms in the region. But he said nothing about conventional arms, which suggests that he has yet to learn one of the larger lessons of the Persian Gulf war: in this unstable region, arms have a nasty way of outlasting alliances. Congress can get him to reconsider. It can hold up the Egyptian sale and vote down the Ex-Im Bank credits.
Why the rush to sell more arms? For one thing, the defense budget is on the way down, and U.S. arms makers are lobbying hard to boost sales abroad to offset declining Pentagon purchases. For another, the gulf war alarmed Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other states in the region, sharpening their appetite for weapons.
Defense Secretary Cheney even tries to justify the sales as a way to minimize U.S. presence on the ground. But he overlooks the Saudi Army's tentative performance in the war, which suggests that even new weapons won't enable the Saudis to defend themselves. And he ignores purposes other than self-defense that new weapons could serve buyers. Just look at Iraq.
Other circumstances make a rare opportunity to slow arms trafficking. Hungry buyers now want American-made weapons. Thus the usual argument that they will turn elsewhere if the U.S. doesn't satisfy their needs may not apply. Impressed by preliminary reports of U.S. technological prowess, buyers are less likely to settle for second-best.
That gives Washington extra leverage on its competitors in the arms market to cooperate in trimming sales. And other suppliers, like the Soviet Union, seem ready to cooperate.
Middle Eastern buyers will also have trouble paying for new arms. Egypt and Turkey are in poor shape economically. Israel is preoccupied with providing for the resettlement of Soviet Jews. Even oil-rich Saudi Arabia is borrowing to pay its share of the costs of the gulf war.
Seldom has the chance to restrain arms peddling been greater than it is today. If President Bush wants a really new world order, he could start by trying to negotiate constraints on arms sales.

HEADLINE: Milking Poor Families

 BODY:
What's one of the first things you'd do if you wanted to devastate poor families with young children? Raise milk prices. That's exactly what the Senate has approved, without hearings, as an amendment to an emergency appropriations bill. The provision would raise the price of whole milk by as much as 26 cents per gallon and low-fat milk by as much as 40 cents per gallon.
The sponsors, led by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, contend that higher milk prices are needed to save dairy farmers victimized by a 25 percent drop in prices during the past year. The plight of dairy farmers is real, and some may go broke if milk prices don't recover. But their plight is not unique; millions of other Americans have been victimized by recession. Besides, if Congress wants to bail out dairy farmers, there are a lot of better ways than to take milk away from poor children. 
 The sponsors say their bill won't increase consumer prices very much because it affects only the price paid to dairy farmers. The basis for this claim is that because milk processors and retailers have successfully avoided passing plummeting raw milk prices on to consumers, they will now charitably choose to absorb the new price hikes. That's a novel but unconvincing assumption. The amendment would also raise the cost of food stamps and other Federal programs in ways the sponsors only partially recognize and offset.
It's no mystery why Senator Leahy wants to help Vermont dairy farmers with higher prices, whose origin few consumers will understand, rather than with higher taxes, which everyone will understand. What's odd is why 59 other senators, many from non-dairy states, went along with this outrageous affront to low-income families.

HEADLINE: Here We Go Again -- Arming the Mideast

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is senior columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Momentum for a new arms race in the Middle East is already building. As Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations points out, everybody was so awed by America's high-tech weapons in the gulf war that every country in the Middle East is clamoring for something similar.
The Soviet Union is concerned about U.S. plans to deliver important new weapons to its allies -- the Arab nations as well as Israel -- and doubtless Mikhail Gorbachev brought it up with Secretary of State James Baker in their Moscow meeting. Mr. Vorontsov says Moscow favors a club of arms suppliers to prevent the kind of unrestrained buildup that made Iraq such a menace. 
 Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a Frankenstein monster, created by oil revenues, competition for the lucrative weapons market and political rivalry. It could happen again, if not in Iraq then in some neighboring, unstable regimes. Nobody can guarantee that today's friend won't become tomorrow's enemy.
There is a common interest -- between East and West, Arabs and Israelis and among regional players -- to head off a new capacity for aggression and vast new arms expenditures that undermine the development of civil societies. The international coalition against Iraq is likely to remain intact until there is assurance that Iraq's stocks of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons materials have been destroyed. Soviet officials say Iraq has a lot more Scuds than it used, maybe hundreds more, and these also must be found and destroyed.
But the longer term goal of security can be compromised by renewing the regional arms race. The tangle of national and economic interests is creating intense pressures to override the common interest.
Mr. Vorontsov claims Moscow is determined not to revive old habits. He says it has refused Syria's plea for better and more weapons and parity with Israel, though it continues to provide parts to resupply existing Syrian forces. He says he is confident his Government will resist the desires of its own military-industrial complex for larger sales.
But Middle East arms control is going to be a lot harder than arms control in Europe. Israel argues, effectively, that its survival depends on keeping well ahead of its enemies. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran can show that the gulf war proved their need for truly modern defenses. The U.S. says it wants to maintain "balance," but it always seeks it at a higher level.
It isn't politically possible, and would certainly be undesirable, to establish big American bases in the gulf as the Pentagon once hoped. But the U.S. military can point to the difficulty and danger of relying on shipping equipment after a crisis starts.
The compromise tempting Washington is "prepositioning," which means to sell the Saudis and gulf emirates more arms than they can manage themselves to serve as stockpiles if American forces should have to return. The Russians say this is "old thinking," a reflex rather than a search for security based on an international agreement among leading arms suppliers.
The U.S. as yet has no initiative to propose. The Soviets are thinking of an approach that would distinguish between defensive and offensive arms, worked out initially among the five permanent members of the Security Council. Other suppliers, such as Germany, Argentina, Brazil and perhaps Switzerland and Sweden, would have to be brought in. But the Soviets argue that would be much easier if the Big Five set an example.
The simplicity of the idea should not mask the difficulty of the task. But it is urgent and specific and would be lost if utopian notions of disarmament were allowed to block concrete proposals. Moscow seems to be willing. Washington must avoid hasty commitments to allies and come up with a plan.

HEADLINE: Tax Burden Drives People From New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Read Mario Bush's Lips" by State Senator Franz S. Leichter (Op-Ed, March 9), which advocates higher taxes for the wealthy in New York State, is a remarkable distortion and frightening coming from a legislator.
For several years I served on the New York City Industrial Development Corporation in an attempt to lure business into New York City. In contrast to Mr. Leichter's theories, the heavy rate of New York taxation was one of the leading reasons businesses were dissuaded from coming into New York City, along with poor quality of life and exceedingly difficult labor unions. 
 We live in a very mobile society where individuals and companies move freely to other locations where the business climate is considered less hostile. As it is, the citizens of New York City are taxed more heavily than any other municipality. We have lost a great many affluent people and large business organizations who could have provided jobs for many of our unemployed. To increase the tax burden further on the wealthy will continue to drive out business at an unprecedented rate.
It may interest Senator Leichter to know that every responsible study I have seen shows that the wealthy pay a very heavy proportion of the tax burden on Federal and state levels. If they remain wealthy despite this burden, it is not because they are not taxed enough, but perhaps because they are superachievers to begin with.

HEADLINE: A Hogan Can Be as Good as a Log Cabin

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One word mars your otherwise excellent article on the Shiprock, N.M., girls' high school basketball team ("A Team Spawns Pride in a Land of Despair," sports pages, Feb. 25). Navajos do not use ceremonial "huts," but they do use "hogans," a perfectly good American word, according to Webster's New World Dictionary (third college edition).
The hogans around Shiprock are built from earth and wood, and hundreds are used as people's houses, as well as for ceremonies. The best-built ones are as finely crafted as a Maine log cabin, and more than a few are larger and in better shape than plenty of New York City apartments. 
 It might seem trivial, but calling Navajo dwellings huts disparages the homes of tens of thousands of people spread across a territory as large as West Virginia. As the rest of your article shows, Navajos are not primitives holding ceremonies in crude huts. They are simply people, struggling to maintain their culture and provide for their families in the face of difficult economic and social conditions.

HEADLINE: The Limits of What Reparations Can Achieve;
War Guilt and Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While it may be a legitimate principle that an aggressor owes reparations to compensate for war losses ("Reparations, Without Retribution," editorial, March 4), Iraq has few resources to compensate Kuwait for the damages to its economy. Iraq, with about one-third the population of Vietnam and the economic output of Kentucky, has suffered possibly $100 billion of damages to its own economy.
While you point out that Germany paid 15 billion gold marks ($3.5 billion) reparations from World War I, the total reparations assessed against it were 132 billion gold marks ($31.4 billion). The economic disaster of the 1920's (and political disaster of the 30's) resulted from the Allies' attempt to extract payments. 
 Resistance by debtor countries crystallizes as domestic opposition to the macroeconomic measures necessary to make reparations develops. This contributes to the degeneration of the country's finances, making the economy less productive and the obligation more burdensome.
German obligations did not remain constant as you imply, but evolved through a series of negotiations that rescheduled old debts and arranged new loans. The original London schedule of 1921-23 differed substantially from the Dawes plan of 1924-29 and the final Young plan of 1929-31.
The fiscal-austerity program required by the debtor country is politically unsustainable because it lowers incomes and makes the distribution less equal. We must keep in mind that war guilt does not have anything to do with the ability of a country to pay; to force Iraq to pay reparations will prove not only futile, but also harmful to future United States interests in the region.

HEADLINE: U.S Motor Vehicle Population Gaining

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One historically tested solution to this country's growing energy -- that is, oil -- problems, implicit in a Senate document of 1974, still merits examination and debate. In that report, made by B. D. Snell, special counsel to the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, it was stated that:
"One bus can eliminate 35 automobiles; one streetcar or rail transport vehicle can supplant 50 passenger cars; one train can displace 1,000 cars or a fleet of 150 cargo-laden trucks." 
 In 1974, we had 129.9 million motor vehicle registrations in a population of 211.9 million. This came to a density of one motor vehicle for every 1.63 Americans. By 1988, the last year for which we have Census Bureau data, our human population had increased by 16.11 percent to 245 million. In that year, our motor vehicle registrations increased by 41.24 percent to 183.5 million cars, trucks and buses -- for a ratio of one motor vehicle for every 1.34 people.
The environmental damage caused by this incremental combustion of gasoline and diesel oil in the 15 years since this Senate document was published can only be estimated. Environmentalists will estimate the adverse effects of automotive air pollution at somehat higher levels than refiners of crude oil and manufacturers of oil-burning vehicles will.
Far less arguable are the Government data on motor vehicle accidents and deaths. In 1989, the last year for which we have final figures, there were 34.4 million motor vehicle accidents. They caused 46,900 deaths and 5.56 million injuries. In 1989 alone, according to the Insurance Information Institute, the economic losses caused by these traffic accidents came to nearly $94 billion.
During the 15 years between the Senate calculation that one street-car carries as many people as 50 passenger cars and 1989, this country suffered 775,257 deaths in motor vehicle accidents, for an average of 48,454 car crash deaths a year.
This total of traffic-accident fatalities comes to 112,791 more deaths in the 15 years since 1974 than the total of 662,565 Americans killed in all of our wars from the start of the American Revolution in 1776 to the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.
If for no other reason than the clearly estimable numbers of lives it would save daily, the national revival of the formerly common electric-powered streetcar, commuter train and even trolley-bus mass transportation systems as low-cost alternatives or supplements to the one-person, one-car system of daily transportation that sprang into being after World War II is one approach to our predictable oil shortages that is eminently worth our serious consideration.

HEADLINE: For Design Mart, East River May Yet Prove Unbridgeable

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
IT is quiet these days at the International Design Center, New York, in Long Island City, Queens. The corridors are virtually empty. The 10-acre $150 million complex of furniture showrooms, which seemed so promising when it opened in 1985, seems to have aged prematurely.
Gretchen Bellinger , a fabric showroom, vacated its 4,000-square-foot space in December, and the lights are off at the Artemide lighting showroom, whose designs are now shown in Manhattan. Signs at Knoll, in crisp Helvetica type, direct customers down the hall to the Westinghouse showroom. 
 And at the American Standard showroom, the faucets have been turned off at the aquatic extravaganza -- a cascade of sinks with a moat -- designed by the Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman.
These are not the best of times for makers of designer furniture, an $8 billion annual business that has been synonymous with avant-garde design for at least the past 30 years. Manufacturers, whose primary customers are architects and decorators, cite many troubles: recession, competition from manufacturers who copy and discount classic designs, the expense of flamboyant showrooms, the high cost of European imports, and a flurry of mergers and acquisitions.
Stendig Inc., a company that epitomized the buoyant market of the 60's and 70's, went out of business in October. Westinghouse Electric bought Knoll International on Oct. 1 and created a new subsidiary, the Knoll Group. And Tinicum bought International Contract Furnishings from the Chartwell Group in October.
Many of the people long associated with the smaller, innovative companies are no longer on the scene. For example, Stephen Kiviat, president of Atelier International, which made its reputation with Italian imports like the Corbusier chaise longue, resigned on March 4 after 22 years with the company.
"The 60's were not only the Doors," said Samuel Friedman, the founder of International Contract Furnishings. "There were a lot of people who also wanted to be the flower children of the furniture industry. "And when these smaller firms became profitable it became evident to the bigger firms that they needed the piquant mustard they offered."
Now these out-of-the mainstream firms are going the way of the hippie.
The International Design Center, New York (informally, I.D.C.N.Y.), was an attempt to create a new, relatively inexpensive hub away from two of Manhattan's designer furniture "districts," one around Third Avenue and 58th Street, the other around Lexington Avenue and 33d Street. The center was developed by the Lazard Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Lazard Freres ,the investment banking concern, and opened to enthusiastic responses from design-conscious New Yorkers.
Arthur Katz, executive vice president of the I.D.C.N.Y., said rent per square foot is "in the $20 range."
Showroom space in the Architects and Designers Building at Third Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan averages $35 a square foot. Robert Beguelin, the building manager, said that of the 172,000 square feet alloted to showroom space in the building, 8 percent is currently available.
Six years after the design center opened, in spite of valiant promotional efforts, it is still difficult to get designers and their clients to cross the East River from Manhattan. Today, the center looks like an archeological site.
The two large buildings at the I.D.C.N.Y., Center One and Center Two, total about a million square feet. "Right now," Mr. Katz said, "we're about 20 percent vacant."
And much of the space in use is not filled with the spectacular furniture once envisioned. The New York City School Construction Authority now occupies 150,000 square feet. A photocopying company and a steam-fitting concern are also recent tenants.
Color Day '91, a symposium sponsored by the Color Association of the United States, Contract Design magazine and Allied Fibers , drew a crowd of about 300 people to Queens on March 12. They sat on white folding chairs in the soaring atrium of Center Two to hear the future of color in textiles discussed. But that was just one day.
"The way business is being done and who is doing it is changing," said Alexia Lalli, senior vice president, marketing and communications, at the center. "We're trying to work with our tenants and the industry to maintain the I.D.C.N.Y. as a major contract furniture showplace." Contract furniture is the industry's term for office furniture. She added, "We are also looking for other kinds of compatible tenants."
"It's a very quiet exodus," said Linda Foa, the former director of the 24-year-old organization known as Designer's Saturday. "Firms are slowly migrating back to the city." Many newer independent showrooms have settled in the Chelsea and SoHo districts of Manhattan.
George Kordaris, managing director in this country for Vitra Seating, a German furniture company, said: "Originally, everyone had great hopes of the I.D.C. being the vibrant center of design in the world. Now no one is buying furniture." Mr. Kordaris said that when employees are being laid off, new chairs are not needed. He was the host last week of a support group for out-of-work designers and furniture buyers in his company's Manhattan showroom.
"There's a whole new industry out there called 'used office furniture,' " he said. "Refurbishing and selling -- now that's a new business."
Mr. Kiviat, formerly of Atelier International, said building the center was like building a new bicycle factory just at the time that half the cyclists in the country gave up riding.
Even so there are plans for yet another design center, the New York Resource Center, which would be housed in the former B. Altman & Company store on Fifth Avenue at 34th Street. It is the idea of Judson Spencer, a marketing consultant.
"I felt the building had everything: location, freight docks, freight and passenger elevators, escalators, high ceilings, columns," he said.
Five months ago Mr. Spencer approached the building's owners, Mall Properties , a New York real-estate development company, with his plan.
"Although it's all far from being finalized, my ideas were enthusiastically received," Mr. Spencer said. "We'll see what happens. We'll know what to expect in the next 60 days."

Sterling Optical Appoints Chief and No. 2 Executive

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The Sterling Optical Corporation named two top executives yesterday.
Robert K. Low, 53, was appointed chairman and chief executive. Mr. Low, a director of Sterling since 1959, replaces Richard Block, who had been chairman, president and chief executive. No reason was given for Mr. Block's replacement.
And George Casabona, the company's executive vice president, assumes the additional title of chief operating officer. Mr. Casabona, 42, will be in charge of Sterling's day-to-day operations. 
 Mr. Low was a founder and, until 1982, the president of the Savin Corporation, a maker of copying equipment. Mr. Low was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Mr. Casabona, a graduate of St. John's University and a certified public accountant, joined Sterling a year and half ago after working Silor Optical Inc., where he was an executive for 10 years.
As head of operations, Mr. Casobona said, "I'll be meeting with financial institutions and shareholders, and I'll visit stores to interface with employees."
Sterling, which lost money in the 1988 and 1990 fiscal years, has recently changed its focus to concentrate on its core business of operating and franchising its nationwide chain of 247 optical stores.
"We are the fourth-largest optical chain," Mr. Casabona said yesterday. "Half of our stores are company-owned." He noted that the Hackensack, N.J., company was installing a computerized point-of-sale to maintain better inventory control.
Turning to profits, he said, "As of Dec. 30, 1990, we continued to lose money and it looks as if we will for fiscal 1991, which ends this June 30."
Mr. Casabona said he expected the company to post a profit in the 1992 fiscal year as a result of its refocusing. "We hope to weather the economic storm in good shape and we are seeing a rebound now," he said.
To concentrate its efforts and obtain working capital, Sterling sold its Whitestone Products subsidiary, a maker of diapers, and its Uniforms by Gilson division in 1989, and its Whaledent division, a maker of dental equipment, in 1990.
Sterling's stock gained 25 cents yesterday, to $3.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Prices Drop Sharply; Gasoline Up on Supply Data

BYLINE: By Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices fell sharply yesterday, erasing Tuesday's gains, after the market failed to rise above recent highs. Other precious metals prices also fell.
Gasoline futures surged on a mixed day for the energy markets; grains and soybeans were mostly lower, and livestock and meat futures fell. 
 Silver futures settled 8.5 cents to 10.4 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in March at $3.936 an ounce.
Gold futures ended 80 cents to $1 lower on the Commodity Exchange, with March at $363 an ounce; platinum finished $2 to $2.10 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with April at $396.70 an ounce.
Yesterday's selloff was led by speculators after they failed to bid the May delivery price above the high of $4.10 an ounce posted Tuesday, when the metal had risen as much as 8.8 cents an ounce for the day, said Peter Cardillo, research director with Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York.
William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch, said the drop in silver prices during the last week represents a fading of the euphoria that came with the end of the Persian Gulf war three weeks ago.
Prices of stocks and of industrial metals like silver and platinum rose strongly after the war, fed by hopes that the end of fighting would hasten an economic recovery in the United States.
Mr. O'Neill said those hopes were being replaced by "a more realistic view," adding, "Sure, the recession probably will be over in three to six months, but it still will probably be a relatively slow recovery, not a super boom."
Unleaded gasoline futures surged on the New York Merc, largely in reaction to the American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report Tuesday showing an unexpectedly large drop in gasoline stocks to 216.4 million barrels, compared with 241.2 million a year ago.
The gasoline market also continued to be supported by the shutdown of a large Mexico City refinery that produces 40,000 barrels of gasoline daily, analysts said.
"We're heading into the peak driving period and gasoline stocks are in a tenuous situation," Mr. O'Neill said.
The April contract for crude oil expired yesterday at $20.38 a barrel, down 23 cents. Other contracts for crude oil settled 10 cents to 17 cents higher, with May at $20.05 a barrel; heating oil was 0.05 cent lower to 0.29 cent higher, with April at 57.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.85 cent to 2.02 cents higher, with April at 73.78 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Problems of Homeless: The Individual Stories

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In his documentary "Home Less Home," Bill Brand does something that should not be as unusual as it is. He approaches homeless people with a camera crew and asks who they are, how they became homeless and what they do to survive. The answers, while not surprising, give individual faces to problems that are too easily reduced to generalities. "The American ideal of freedom and justice is out of sync with the facts," he concludes, after having amassed sad and persuasive evidence to corroborate that statement.
 The testimony of many homeless people would have been a sufficiently urgent basis for any documentary film on this subject. But Mr. Brand goes further, offering a disquisition on the connections between the condition of the homeless and the consequences of studying it as a series of images. Those images, he maintains, have the effect of distancing a viewer from reality. That point may be accurate, but for a film maker it is also academic and somewhat self-defeating. 
 "It's not that we can't examine what it's like," Mr. Brand says of homelessness. "It's that we need to examine the sources of our imagination." So the film includes scenes from Preston Sturges's famous "Sullivan's Travels," in which a successful film maker (Joel McCrea) and his wisecracking companion (Veronica Lake) impersonate hobos and hitch a ride on a freight train. "This screwball comedy supports the idea that we can only understand what we experience," Mr. Brand observes.
 The film looks back frequently to earlier images of homelessness, mostly from the Depression; there are still photographs by Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Berenice Abbott, Jacob Riis and many others. But these glimpses, says Mr. Brand, "help create a distance in me, so that even as I'm experiencing the present I'm imagining another place and time." Even the film's scenes of contemporary homeless people living near the Port Authority Bus Terminal or in City Hall Park or at shelters around New York City take on a degree of unreality in this context. "We're so accustomed to homeless people as voiceless victims that when they speak, we no longer believe they are homeless," Mr. Brand says. 
 The homeless people interviewed in the film are exceptionally calm, articulate and intelligent by any standard. Even the former psychiatric patients heard here sound unusually sane. Mr. Brand maintains that the idea that many homeless people are mentally ill is one more way of oversimplifying homelessness and keeping it at a distance. He argues for a more all-embracing way of understanding homelessness, one that takes into account the interplay between unemployment, drugs, poor health care, inflated housing costs and other contributing factors. 
 The film's outright evidence is often more effective than its academic analysis. Mr. Brand offers cogent examples of media distortion in reporting on homelessness (as in a television account of a windshield washer who claims to make $180 on a good day), and provides facts and figures to attest to the impossibility of escaping homelessness once it has set in. Still, this bleak and disturbing film concludes on a hopeful note, as two homeless young boys eagerly discuss their ambitions. Even in this disheartening atmosphere, ideas of becoming a policeman or a rock star or a world-famous boxer are not out of the question. 
 On the same program at the New Directors/New Films series is "Blackwater Summer," Christopher Dudman's prettily executed, slightly precious account of a young girl's last carefree days during a vacation that is interrupted by family tragedy. This film's romantic seashore setting is in marked contrast to anything Mr. Brand's film contains. Both can be seen tonight at 6 and Sunday at 9 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Hunting for Elk On the Terrain Of Imagination

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

DATELINE: BETHEL, Conn.

 BODY:
Sadly, but not surprisingly, not one single elk responded to the magnificent elk calls of Mark Shea here the other night. That's probably because the last recorded elk in Connecticut was shot and eaten some 200 years ago.
The lack of elk response could also have been because, while capturing first place in the evening's elk-calling competition, Mr. Shea was inside a noisy motel dining room, not exactly prime elk habitat. But the place was full of elk enthusiasts enjoying an evening of socializing, eating and tax-deductible auction bidding. 
 The elk backers wore everything from tweed coats to cowboy hats, and while the state's fragile economy somewhat dimmed their enthusiasm for parting with money, everyone there was 100 percent behind elk. "It's just so important," said Bill Joyce, who organized the special elk evening again this year.
The outgoing Mr. Joyce normally sells air freight. But in recent weeks, to his wife's dismay, he was consumed with preparations for the Second Annual Big Game Banquet of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Connecticut Chapter. The seven-year-old foundation is not as well known as Ducks Unlimited or the Ruffed Grouse Society, but the goals are similar.
The eventual survival of such species is seriously threatened by increasing urbanization and recreational development of the American countryside, where the modern definition of a conservationist is someone who built his sec ond home last year.
So these private groups use a variety of techniques to raise money to buy property or conservation easements on the property of others to protect the differing natural habitats of these wild creatures. The elk foundation also makes grants to states to finance improvement of existing forage for elk or even to transplant elk into a new area, as Mr. Joyce hopes will occur in northwestern Connecticut shortly.
The foundation was the brainchild of three men in the rural northwest corner of Montana, where big game still outnumbers humans. Although the largest support springs from 13 Western states where many elk still roam, a growing number of the 80,000 members are in the East. The most successful fund raiser is a banquet like this one, where elk fanciers gather to watch slides, buy raffle tickets, swap tall tales and eat (the big game dinner turned out to be beef or chicken). Members also bid on everything from collectors' knives and rifles to color lithographs and wilderness expeditions.
Last year, Connecticut's was among 138 elk dinners held nationally, attracting more than 32,000 guests. That night, about 250 state residents donated $30,000 of the foundation's $2.3 million in banquet receipts. Elk foundation officers profess no surprise that hundreds of elk enthusiasts exist even in areas with zero elk. "Wherever you find deer hunters," said Terry Cloutier, a regional supervisor, "you'll find elk hunters or wannabes. It's the logical next step up."
Some elk foundation dinners attract 600 or more people, 95 percent of whom are hunters. "But this year," said Mr. Joyce, "we got slammed by the economy in this state and all the talk about a new income tax." Barely 200 people showed up and contributed $24,000. Some auction items even went for under cost.
While hunting remains an accepted part of everyday life in many rural areas, some hunters in metropolitan areas like New York can find themselves on the defensive against animal-rightists and nonhunters who may date their distaste for hunting to imagining what happened to Bambi's mom off screen. A few banquetgoers seemed to sense some paradox in supporting the population and improved lives of elk so that they can be stalked, felled by sure shots, gutted, eaten and have their huge heads stuffed and mounted on strong walls.
Phil Young, who hands out cards for his own sanitation service ("It May Be Sewage To You, But It's Our Bread and Butter") in New Preston, was so proud of the elk he shot last fall that he brought the head along to this year's banquet.
But for Don Stickles, hunting's main attraction is being outdoors with his dogs, trying to outwit a wily wild creature on its home turf. A carpenter and new elk foundation member, Mr. Stickles has saved for an elk-hunting expedition this fall. But he says he's unsure about slaying anything so majestic. "Frankly," he said, "I don't know if I will. I know I want to be out there, though."
Does he ever feel sad killing animals for recreation? "Every single time," he said. "When you kill an animal, you take responsibility for that creature, just like I'm sure you do when you buy part of a cow wrapped in plastic."

HEADLINE: House Backs Bailout Bill, Sending It to Bush

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Following a subdued debate of barely 25 minutes today, the House approved the $30 billion bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry that it had rejected last week, and sent the measure to the President.
Some economists have estimated that the savings and loan crisis, the worst financial debacle in American history, could ultimately cost taxpayers $500 billion. The $30 billion measure, adopted by voice vote in the Senate on Tuesday evening, a minute after it was introduced, and passed by the House by 225 to 188 today, raises to $80 billion the amount appropriated since the fall of 1989, when the effort began. 
 In addition, an estimated $69 billion is expected to be lost on insolvent savings associations seized by the Government in 1988.
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, who endorsed the House savings and loan measure, summed up the mood of his colleagues.
"The main problem has been that this is paying for dead horses," Mr. Foley said. "I don't think there is anyone who votes for it with great enthusiasm."
The measure was supported by 106 Democrats and 119 Republicans. During the brief debate, only one Representative, Bernard Sanders, rose to speak out against it. The first-term member from Vermont and the House's sole independent, argued that the bailout should be financed by increasing taxes on families with higher incomes and not by increasing Government borrowings.
"It's a curious bill," Representative Sanders said. "On one side, we have the President of the United States and the leadership of both parties. On the other side, I suspect we have the vast majority of the United States."
The financing is expected to last only until this fall, when the Administration will be forced to return to Congress for more money. The General Accounting Office has estimated that regulators will need $50 billion more for next year.
After the rejection of the financing measure last week, lawmakers, feeling pressure from both Democratic and Republican leaders who saw the issue of delay as a potentially greater political disaster than the actual financing, sought to move quickly to complete legislation before Congress leaves for a two-week recess beginning Monday.
"Every day we delay results in throwing away additional money," said Representative Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee.
Today's legislation included a measure that expands the affordable housing program of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout, by about 7,100 homes. The legislation the House rejected last week included a measure that would have required Resolution Trust to make a greater effort to employ contracting companies controlled by women and minorities. Another measure that was defeated would have required that any new money for the bailout be raised by either increasing taxes or cutting spending on other Federal programs. The current program is financed through borrowing.
Lawmakers have said they will seek changes in the bailout process the next time the Administration seeks financing.
"As we move forward, I will insist on a host of reforms," said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the Banking Committee.
Regulators have said they intend to use the $30 billion and borrow another $47 billion for working capital to sell, transfer or close 225 savings associations, about 10 percent of the industry, with assets of $145 billion.
Peter Monroe, president of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which sets policy for the bailout, said the effort had already protected 12 million depositors holding an average of $10,000. He said the new funds would go toward protecting 8 million more.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
A Question Of Fairness In Social Security

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
In agencies and re search institutes, at the Library of Congress and in universities around town, thousands of bureaucrats and scholars here spend their days studying the most arcane elements of the Government. Just this week, for instance, the General Accounting Office, the Government's chief auditor, published studies on minority representation at the National Agriculture Statistics Service (basically satisfactory) and on postage costs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (excessive).
But a fundamental aspect of the Government's largest program has never been fully explored. No one knows for sure whether the Social Security system, on balance, is progressive or regressive -- whether, in other words, the taxes and benefits tilt in favor of the rich or the poor. 
 "No one has ever done the work to actually show how people come out under Social Security throughout their entire lives," said Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security Administrator and one of the foremost experts on social insurance programs.
The question is especially pertinent this year, because an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats in Congress is pressing for a cut in the Social Security tax. One argument for such a reduction, which is opposed by the Bush Administration and many Congressional leaders, is that taken alone the tax is the most regressive faced by Americans.
A policy is said by economists to be regressive if the poor bear a greater burden than the rich. It is said to be progressive if the reverse is true. The income tax system, for example, is progressive because the tax rate increases as income goes up.
For Social Security, on the other hand, each worker and each employer pay a flat 6.2 percent on each dollar of wages up to $53,400. No tax is paid on wages above that level. And no Social Security tax is paid at all on interest, dividends and investment profit, which are much more likely to be received by the rich.
That means that a husband and a wife, say schoolteachers, who each earn $50,000 a year pay a total of $6,200 in Social Security taxes. Their employers pay another $6,200, all or part of which the teachers presumably could have been paid had it not been for the tax. But a corporate executive who earns a $500,000 salary and receives another $500,000 in dividends and capital gains pays only a couple of hundred dollars more than either teacher. The maximum Social Security tax is $3,310.80.
To liberals, that seems unfair. But what they often do not take into account is that Social Security benefits are quite progressive.
Here is how the benefits generally work. When people retire or become disabled, the wages on which they paid Social Security taxes through their working lives are adjusted for inflation into current dollars and then averaged. The benefits are 90 percent of the first $356 of average monthly income, 32 percent of the amount between $356 and $2,145, and 15 percent of the amount over $2,145.
According to the Social Security Administration, the typical retired low-wage earner last year received 57 percent of his or her average monthly wages in benefits, while people who earned exactly the maximum on which Social Security taxes were paid each year received 24 percent of their average monthly incomes.
In the case of the schoolteachers and the corporate executive, the teachers could expect retirement benefits of about $2,400 a month, assuming that $50,000 was the average annual salary of each, while the executive would get only about $1,000.
But the issue is complicated by other factors. People who are better off frequently live longer and receive benefits for more years. Moreover, affluent men are more likely to have wives who never worked and thus paid no Social Security taxes but who are entitled to benefits for spouses. Both factors add to the regressivity.
Among the factors adding to the progressivity is the greater likelihood of poor workers' becoming disabled and receiving full benefits before retirement age.
The consensus of experts is that, all things considered, the system is probably somewhat progressive, although no one knows how much so. "Somewhere in all this," said Robert J. Shapiro, director of economic studies at the Progressive Policy Institute, "is a tenure-quality Ph.D. thesis."

HEADLINE: In Face of Cuts, Fernandez Calls for Increase in Budget

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of chopping $505 million out of next year's budget, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez yesterday resorted to stiff-necked bargaining tactics: He asked for $26 million more to spend.
The Chancellor initiated the annual haggling ritual as he unveiled his request for a record $7.568 billion budget, including pensions and debt service. That is $300 million more than the Board of Education will spend in the current fiscal year that ends June 30. 
 Much of that $300 million increase would be the natural result of costs necessitated by inflation, contract settlements with teachers and expenses outside his control like $66 million that is passed through the Board of Education but is destined for private and parochial schools.
But at least $26 million was Mr. Fernandez's request for brand new money for repairing crumbling buildings, for enticing parents to take a more active role in schools and for enhancing his signature program to give schools more independence in decision making.
 
Budget as 'Road Map'
 By its most recent reckoning, the Dinkins administration has told Mr. Fernandez that he must cut $505 miilion from existing programs, after taking into account those unavoidable cost increases.
But in his budget proposal -- despite the certainty of some cuts -- the Chancellor made no effort to incorporate them. In a briefing for reporters at his downtown Brooklyn office, he acknowledged that the budget document was a "road map" of the school system's priorities as the city and state begin solidifying the allocations they will give to the schools.
He maintained that he had not included any prospective cuts in his new budget document because he did not know what his final allocations from the city and the state would be.
"You don't have a budget until the budget is adopted," he said. "There will be a lot of changes before the smoke settles."
"I have to be an advocate for the school system," he said. But he also admitted, "I have to understand we are part of the city and the state."
Traditionally, chancellors have always put forward daring budget documents knowing that mayors and legislators will still find plenty to gnaw away. Last year, Mr. Fernandez sought $217 million for new or enhanced programs but ended up trimming his budget by $275 million.
Despite his oratory yesterday, Mr. Fernandez is already working to save more than $200 million of the proposed budget by asking the state's Board of Regents for relief from class-size limits for learning-disabled students, by transferring more costs of caring for handicapped students to Federal Medicaid and by seeking retirement inducements for the most senior and highest paid teachers.
 
Taking Case to Albany
 Mr. Fernandez left for Albany immediately after the briefing to make his case for relief from some state mandates to the Regents, the state's highest educational policy-making board. Until Wednesday, Mayor David N. Dinkins had been telling Mr. Fernandez that he must cut $429 million, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had been saying Mr. Fernandez must cut $221 million.
The total of $650 million was reduced to $505 million Wednesday night when Mr. Dinkins decided to redistribute the overall state cut to other city agencies, softening the impact on the schools.
Mr. Fernandez has said that cutting $650 million would, if nothing else were done, require cuts of 15 teachers for each of the system's 1,000 schools. Without layoffs, he has warned, cuts of that magnitude could then mean the elimination of full-day kindergarten and most summer school and afterschool programs.
How Mr. Fernandez ends up cutting his budget may not be entirely within his discretion. Officials close to the seven-member Board of Education said yesterday that several members, led by Ninfa Segarra of the Bronx, were demanding to find out what was in the budget and looking for spending pockets they might prefer to pare.
Mr. Fernandez got some other bad news this week. The capital budget that finances the construction of new schools and the renovation of old ones will have to be cut again because the Dinkins administration wants to reduce its annual interest payments.
The $43 billion, four-year plan had already been slashed by $640 million and on Wednesday an additional $245 million was cut. That would eventually mean a sharp reduction in the number of new schools the badly overcrowded and decaying system had hoped to build.
Although New York City has the largest portion of the state's lagging readers, impoverished and disabled students and overcrowded classes, the document said that it spends only $5,080 a pupil compared with $5,586 for the rest of the state and $7,775 a pupil in places like Nassau County.
Mr. Fernandez argued that despite his fiscal problems he had been able to improve attendance slightly and increase mathematics scores, and should be given $26 million for new programs.
These include $16 million for repairs for a system with a backlog of 42,000 repair orders; $1.9 million for "SWAT repair teams" that would be assigned to the boroughs for more efficient service; $2 million for replacement of school desks and other furniture; $1.25 million for "family-resource centers' to encourage more parent participation, and $3 million to train staff members at the 200 schools taking part in Mr. Fernandez's self-management experiment.

HEADLINE: When Patients Pay for Charity to Patients

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J.

 BODY:
A growing financial crisis in the care of uninsured hospital patients in New Jersey is nowhere as apparent as in urban hospitals like St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center here.
Left since January to go it alone in caring for the poor and uninsured, St. Joseph's clinics and emergency rooms provide each day the only medical care a large working-poor population has ever known. As a result, the bills of patients who have health insurance or who can otherwise pay are marked up 33 percent, the surcharge going to pay for charity care. 
 "We take care of everyone who comes to our door," said Sister Jane Frances Brady, the hospital's president.In January the Legislature let lapse a state trust that collected a surcharge on all hospital bills and distributed the proceeds among hospitals that cared for non-paying patients. The surcharge, which had reached 19 percent, was blamed for pushing up insurance costs, forcing growing numbers of employers to drop health coverage for their work forces and making individual policies too expensive.
 
Care for All, but Who Pays?
 Gov. Jim Florio's administration and the Legislature have been wrestling with proposals to make health insurance more widely available and to provide community health services as a less expensive alternative to hospital visits. But they have yet to agree on how to pay for the state's guarantee of medical care for everyone. This has forced urban hospitals, which care for the most uninsured patients, to add "markups" to their bills ranging from 30 percent to 60 percent and higher.
Suburban hospitals meanwhile, with few non-paying patients, have been able to keep their surcharges as low as 4 percent.
"It looks almost as though they're trying to force urban hospitals to cut off care for the poor," said Sister Jane Frances. "But we're not going to cut out anything; we'll keep on providing care and arguing."
When surcharges for uncompensated care and charity care for prior years are added to St. Joseph's 33 percent surcharge, a paying patient who receives care costing $2,000 gets a bill for about $3,000. The bill shows both the actual charge and the mark up. "The only reason this has not caused a revolution is that most people simply turn the bill over to their insurers," Sister Jane Frances said. "But if they must pay the bill themselves, or any part of it, they are furious.
"They can appeal the added $1,000 to the state, and everytime they appeal, they win. Soon you're losing your credibility."
People then say the hospital has "plenty of money," Sister Jane Frances said.
The disadvantage that urban hospitals find themselves in because of the loss of the trust-fund subsidy has prompted Standard & Poor's to place five hospitals on a "credit watch," which could be the first step to grading their bonds downward.
The situation also has led officials of union health and welfare plans to say they intend to steer their members away from the more expensive urban hospitals and send them to the suburbs for medical care. But this may not be as easy as it sounds.
 
Some Physicians Balk
 Michael J. Sniffen, president and chief executive officer of Overlook Hospital in Summit, where the markup for charity care is 6 percent, said that while anyone could go to any hospital in the state, the physicians might not be willing to accept the discounted fees that the union plans usually called for.
"We're operating at 90 percent of capacity," he said. "It's an individual decision for the physicians."
St. Joseph's, started in 1867 by the Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth in a wooden house with 12 beds, and Overlook, founded in 1906 by Dr. William H. Lawrence Jr., are among New Jersey's largest and most diverse medical institutions. St. Joseph's has 701 beds and is completing a $78 million expansion that will add 51 beds. Overlook, which started with 30 beds, now has 590.
Each has more than 600 staff physicians and admits more than 20,000 patients a year. Emergency-room visits range from 30,000 at Overlook to 40,000 at St. Joseph's and out-patient visits from 170,000 to 200,000.
The main difference is their patients. Overlook cares for indigents, but it also serves residents of some of the state's most affluent communities. This enabled the hospital to finish with a surplus last year, while St. Joseph's had its worst cash problems in memory.
 
Cost of Supplies Affected
 As a result, Overlook was able to pay its suppliers on time and qualify for discounts based on the quantity of its purchases. St. Joseph could not pay its suppliers for as long as seven months and ended up paying penalties.
"We couldn't pay early enough to avoid the extra charges or to take advantage of cash discounts we should be entitled to," Sister Jane Frances said. "In these tough economic times, the vendors needed their money."
Mr. Sniffen said the state should end the system of forcing hospitals to include a hidden tax on their patient bills to finance care for the poor. "What is needed is some kind of broad-based tax, just what kind is a political question and one for the Governor and the Legislature," he said.
Governor Florio's Commission on Health Costs called last fall for a payroll tax to finance charity care; this was among 92 recommended changes in the health-care system. Thus far a payroll tax has found little support in the Legislature, which is up for election this year.
To put the financing question off until next year, the Governor's office and some lawmakers are considering reviving the system of surcharges on all hospitals equally and distributing the proceeds to the neediest hospitals for 12 months, starting in June.
 
Some Credit Ratings Drop
 It's a solution that pleases no one, but it is designed to reverse the growing disparity in hospital charges between urban and suburban hospitals and eliminate the credit cloud that has been placed by Standard & Poor's over Beth Israel Hospital in Passaic, East Orange General Hospital, Elizabeth General Medical Center, the Helene Fuld Medical Center in Trenton and St. Elizabeth in Elizabeth.
Fred Hillmann, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, said the surcharge on hospital bills was a major cause of rising medical insurance premiums. At present, he said, 30 cents of every dollar that Blue Cross pays in claims goes to cover surcharges and not medical care.
Mr. Hillmann also said another hidden cost was rising faster than charity care, and that is the difference between what Medicare pays for those on Social Security and the actual cost of their hospital bills. Until 1988 Medicare paid the full cost of hospital bills, but costs were rising so fast in New Jersey that the Federal program set its own limits, leaving a gap that has become another surcharge in all hospital bills.
St. Joseph's, which received state permission this year to make up in its patient bills for unpaid charity care dating to 1986, adds the Medicare gap to those charges.
"If you try tell people how New Jersey's hospital reimbursement system works," Sister Jane Frances said. "You sound like you're making it up."

HEADLINE: British Air Giving Away 50,000 Tickets

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 21

 BODY:
Impatient to fill seats emptied by the war, British Airways announced a bold promotional campaign today aimed at coaxing people into the air again. The airline, Europe's largest, will give away about 50,000 tickets on international flights as part of a broad program of incentives and promotions.
Fear of terrorism "evaporates with a free ticket," Lord King, the chairman of British Airways P.L.C., said at a news conference announcing the program. 
 British Airways, the leading carrier between Britain and the United States, will hold a lottery in 67 countries and will give away all seats on its international flights on April 23 to and from Britain. The winners of round-trip tickets will have to return to their home country by May 31.
 
Automatic Winners
 The 20,000 people who have already booked a British Airways international flight on April 23 will be automatic winners; they will get vouchers for the value of their original one-way tickets to or from London, good toward future travel.
In addition, 30,000 round-trip tickets will be awarded to people who apply by April 1 through forms available in newspaper advertisements or at travel agencies and British Airways ticket offices. [An advertisement appears in The New York Times today on pages A12 and A13.]
British Airways said nearly 6,000 of the 50,000 available seats would be on flights from the United States to Britain, including about 1,600 seats from New York. Even seats aboard the Concorde will be free on April 23. But more than half of the seats aboard flights from the United States have already been booked, so that only about 2,800 round-trip tickets will be given away in the United States.
In addition, the carrier said 250 American winners would also win two round-trip tickets for future flights from London to anywhere in the world that British Airways serves. Similar offers are not being made in other countries.
April 23, a Tuesday, was chosen because relatively few people start international vacations on Tuesdays. The fact that the date is also Shakespeare's birthday is coincidental.
 
'It Needs a Kick Start'
 At his news conference, Lord King explained the purpose of the promotion. "The engine of consumer demand did not just idle in neutral, it sputtered to a complete stop" during the Persian Gulf war and "now it needs a kick start," he said.
Although airline travel is recovering slowly, analysts predicted that other airlines would also take strong steps. On March 13, American Airlines announced sweeping cuts in its domestic and international fares.
The airlines "are worried they will miss out on a lot of summer traffic," said Richard Hannah, a securities analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew.
Analysts said that with British Airways continuing to lose money on many underbooked flights, the promotional benefits of the giveaway would outweigh the cost. "It probably will work out to be a quite cheap means of promotion," said Colin Fell of Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.
Lord King said British Airways was seeing "some patchy signs of improvement" in its business. "But the road to full recovery will not be easy," he said. "It will take a full six months to build stability back and to get real business growth."
British Airways described the free tickets as "the spearhead" of a broad promotional and incentive program that it is offering through Aug. 31 with the support of others in the British tourist industry.
A record 17.7 million overseas visitors came to Britain last year, injecting about 7.5 billion, or roughly $14.5 billion, into the British economy. The British Tourist Authority said that about 6 percent of jobs in the country depended on tourism.
A spokesman for the authority said inquiries from Americans, which were 50 percent below normal during the gulf war, had returned to normal. But many of those inquiries are not translating into bookings. A spokesman for British Airways said its bookings for the summer were "significantly below" those a year ago.
The British tourism incentives include such giveaways as a lifetime of holidays at a Scottish castle and a nobility title and discounts on hotels, car rentals, restaurants and theaters.
The promotional campaign comes as British Airways faces rising competition on its all-important London-United States routes.
A March 11 agreement between the United States and Britain permits American Airlines and United Airlines, America's two strongest carriers, to fly to Heathrow, the London airport preferred by international passengers. British Airways, the leading carrier at Heathrow, was angry that the treaty allowed the transfer of most Heathrow rights from two of America's weakest airlines, Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines.
British Airways was also upset about the British Government's recent decision to open Heathrow to new carriers.
 
Move by Virgin Atlantic
 Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., the main British competitor of British Airways on the North Atlantic routes, has announced that it will try to take advantage of that decision. Virgin Atlantic now operates from Gatwick Airport in London.
British Airways also announced plans to introduce unspecified "long-term incentives, rewards and special services" aimed at attracting corporate accounts and business travelers. It declined to say whether it might include a frequent-flier program. No large European carrier offers frequent-flier programs comparable to those in the United States, although some participate in the programs of United States carriers.
British Airways participates in the programs of United, American and USAir. But its executives worry that some airlines might kick British Airways out of their programs as competition on the North Atlantic routes intensifies and it might lose business travelers. The success of British Airways in attracting higher-paying business travelers has played a big role in its transformation from a loss-plagued, state-owned airline into one of the world's most profitable investor-owned carriers.
 
30 Percent Drop in Traffic
 After the outbreak of the gulf war, British Airways' passenger traffic dropped by as much as 30 percent. In response, the carrier tried to make steep cuts in fares between the United States and Britain. But after some initial ticket sales, United States officials blocked the fare cuts.
British Airways' business has improved, but so far this month the airline's passenger traffic is still 11 percent below the level of a year ago.
The 50,000 tickets would represent an estimated 10 million, or roughly $18 million, in lost revenues if sales were strong. But, Lord King noted, "we're not actually having good days."
Judging from the flood of calls to British Airways' reservation center in New York today and the thousands of people who swamped the airline's ticket office on Regent Street in London, he is right.
 
Competitors' Comments
 Timothy Smith, an American Airlines spokesman, said American had no immediate plans to match the British Airways program.
A United spokeswoman said her carrier had no immediate comment.
Richard Branson, the chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said: "We strongly urge you to fly British Airways on April 23. As for the other 364 days of the year, you will still find the best fares and best service on Virgin Atlantic."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Displaced Iraqis Streaming Into Allied-Held Zone

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, March 21

 BODY:
Thousands of Iraqi civilians have streamed into small villages and isolated desert communities in Iraqi territory controlled by allied forces, United States Army officials said today.
The majority of the people are returning home after fleeing advancing allied ground forces. But many others are refugees from the civil unrest that has engulfed several towns and cities in southern Iraq, the officials said. 
 Coalition troops, mainly the United States Army, control 15 to 20 percent of Iraq, and under the Geneva Convention are responsible for the welfare of civilians in the occupied area. The head of the Army's civil affairs operations said today that American forces were trying to leave as many administrative and governmental functions as possible in the hands of Iraqi officials.
"Except for our presence, we're trying to keep this business-as-usual," the Army officer, Col. James T. Kerr Jr., said in an interview. The approach reflects Washington's oft-stated position that it has no plans to occupy any part of Iraq longer than it takes to reach a permanent cease-fire.
 
Feeding the Needy
 American officials have given needy Iraqi civilians emergency food, shelter and other relief in certain areas. But Colonel Kerr said the occupation would have to extend six to eight more weeks before American officials would begin to consider the possibility of assuming control of public services like schools, the police and sanitation.
The occupied zone embraces more than 25,000 square miles -- it is about the size of West Virginia -- and the bulk of it is desert. About 6,500 Bedouin herders live in the desert, and more than 10,000 others live in the eastern part of the area. The Euphrates River marks the zone's northern boundary, from just south of Basra and encompassing the village of Samawa. From there, the demarcation line runs southwest to the Saudi border.
Tiny rural communities dot the southern banks of the Euphrates, supporting a small but robust mercantile economy, and a few farming areas, principally onions and grasses like hay, Colonel Kerr said. Lively commerce has resumed in those areas, he said.
The civilian communities under allied control seem to have escaped much of the devastation plaguing areas of Iraq near military targets that were bombed by allied warplanes.
 
Slightly Better Conditions
 While there are some shortages of food and water certain areas, Colonel Kerr said the limited communications and sanitation systems that existed before the war were largely functional. For the most part, he said, buildings are not damaged. "Most people are picking up where they left off," he said.
In Safwan, a town of 3,000 people on the Kuwaiti border, where allied and Iraqi commanders have held cease-fire talks, farmers are returning to harvest the region's onion crop.
In the western desert, the village of Salman is showing signs of life again as an important hub for food, fuel and medical supplies for Bedouins who live within 100 miles, Colonel Kerr said.
Before the fighting started, allied planes dropped leaflets on Salman, which had a prewar population 4,500, and other communities in southern Iraq, urging residents to evacuate the combat zone. "The message was, 'Get out of Dodge,' and most people did," said Colonel Kerr, who added that only the Mayor of Salman and 11 of his friends and family stayed on.
French forces, who during the ground war protected the allies' westernmost flank, have occupied Salman. A delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the town this week, Colonel Kerr said.
He said the Army had set up checkpoints along Highway 8, the main thoroughfare between Basra and Baghdad that runs inside the northern boundary of the occupied territory, inspecting vehicles for arms and ammunition.
There has been no resistance from Iraqis in the occupied zone, and no reports of gun-smuggling from across the demarcation line with Baghdad-controlled Iraq, he said. Iraqi Army units are not permitted to cross the line. While many Iraqis are now returning home, a large but dwindling flow of refugees fleeing strife just north of the occupied territory pose a potential problem for American forces.
Along the Euphrates south of Nasiriya, a former work camp for third-country nationals had filled with about 2,000 Iraqis escaping the fighting between troops loyal to President Saddam Hussein and Shiite Muslim groups. By today, though, that number had shrunk to 200, Colonel Kerr said, suggesting that the Government was regaining control in the city.
 
Iraq Frees More Kuwaitis
 RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 21 (AP) -- Iraq freed 1,150 Kuwaitis today in compliance with the terms set by the allies in cease-fire talks.
The Kuwaitis were brought in buses across the Iraqi-Saudi border near the Saudi town of Arar, 550 miles northwest of Riyadh, said Roland Huguenin, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. He said he had no information on the freed Kuwaitis, and did not know how many were civilians and how many were soldiers.
Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross, said about 4,900 Kuwaitis were still held by Iraq.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
A Question Of Fairness In Social Security

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
In agencies and re search institutes, at the Library of Congress and in universities around town, thousands of bureaucrats and scholars here spend their days studying the most arcane elements of the Government. Just this week, for instance, the General Accounting Office, the Government's chief auditor, published studies on minority representation at the National Agriculture Statistics Service (basically satisfactory) and on postage costs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (excessive).
But a fundamental aspect of the Government's largest program has never been fully explored. No one knows for sure whether the Social Security system, on balance, is progressive or regressive -- whether, in other words, the taxes and benefits tilt in favor of the rich or the poor. 
 "No one has ever done the work to actually show how people come out under Social Security throughout their entire lives," said Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security Administrator and one of the foremost experts on social insurance programs.
The question is especially pertinent this year, because an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats in Congress is pressing for a cut in the Social Security tax. One argument for such a reduction, which is opposed by the Bush Administration and many Congressional leaders, is that taken alone the tax is the most regressive faced by Americans.
A policy is said by economists to be regressive if the poor bear a greater burden than the rich. It is said to be progressive if the reverse is true. The income tax system, for example, is progressive because the tax rate increases as income goes up.
For Social Security, on the other hand, each worker and each employer pay a flat 6.2 percent on each dollar of wages up to $53,400. No tax is paid on wages above that level. And no Social Security tax is paid at all on interest, dividends and investment profit, which are much more likely to be received by the rich.
That means that a husband and a wife, say schoolteachers, who each earn $50,000 a year pay a total of $6,200 in Social Security taxes. Their employers pay another $6,200, all or part of which the teachers presumably could have been paid had it not been for the tax. But a corporate executive who earns a $500,000 salary and receives another $500,000 in dividends and capital gains pays only a couple of hundred dollars more than either teacher. The maximum Social Security tax is $3,310.80.
To liberals, that seems unfair. But what they often do not take into account is that Social Security benefits are quite progressive.
Here is how the benefits generally work. When people retire or become disabled, the wages on which they paid Social Security taxes through their working lives are adjusted for inflation into current dollars and then averaged. The benefits are 90 percent of the first $356 of average monthly income, 32 percent of the amount between $356 and $2,145, and 15 percent of the amount over $2,145.
According to the Social Security Administration, the typical retired low-wage earner last year received 57 percent of his or her average monthly wages in benefits, while people who earned exactly the maximum on which Social Security taxes were paid each year received 24 percent of their average monthly incomes.
In the case of the schoolteachers and the corporate executive, the teachers could expect retirement benefits of about $2,400 a month, assuming that $50,000 was the average annual salary of each, while the executive would get only about $1,000.
But the issue is complicated by other factors. People who are better off frequently live longer and receive benefits for more years. Moreover, affluent men are more likely to have wives who never worked and thus paid no Social Security taxes but who are entitled to benefits for spouses. Both factors add to the regressivity.
Among the factors adding to the progressivity is the greater likelihood of poor workers' becoming disabled and receiving full benefits before retirement age.
The consensus of experts is that, all things considered, the system is probably somewhat progressive, although no one knows how much so. "Somewhere in all this," said Robert J. Shapiro, director of economic studies at the Progressive Policy Institute, "is a tenure-quality Ph.D. thesis."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 23, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
The Washington Talk column yesterday about the Social Security system gave an incorrect example of benefits. The married couple who were schoolteachers and whose average annual salary was $50,000 each would together receive almost $2,044 a month, double the maximum benefit to any one individual.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Top Management Is Named at Bonwit

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
Pyramid Companies, the mall developer based in Syracuse, yesterday named new top management for its Bonwit Teller chain and said it would relocate the store's headquarters to Syracuse from New York City.
Frank Doroff, Bonwit's chairman and chief executive, will resign after a 60-day transition period, Pyramid said, along with two members of his team, Tom DeRogatis, chief operating officer, and Teresa Pineda, general merchandise manager. Executives close to Bonwit said the departure of the Doroff team, which had been expected in light of the headquarters move, resulted from a combination of expense pressure on Bonwit and Mr. Doroff's reluctance to move to Syracuse. 
 Named to replace them were two executives of J. W. Rhodes, an Ithaca, N.Y., department store also owned by Pyramid. Murray Daitchman, currently president and chief executive officer of J.W. Rhodes, and Roberta Benvenuti, the vice president and chief operating officer at J. W. Rhodes, will serve as a consolidated management of both Bonwit and J. W. Rhodes.
Pyramid, which operates 16 shopping centers in New York State and New England, is the largest mall developer in the Northeast. It bought Bonwit's stores in Buffalo and Boston and the use of its name at a bankruptcy auction last May. In October, a third Bonwit store was opened in a Pyramid mall, the Carousel Mall, in Syracuse.
The Bonwit corporate offices will be relocated to Syracuse "in order to benefit from a corporate synergy with Pyramid," said Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's managing partner. "This decision is based on the rapidly changing retail marketplace and the economic realities of doing business today in New York City."
Mr. Doroff, 42 years old, who was chairman and chief executive of the Federated/ Allied Merchandising Services before joining Bonwit 10 months ago, said he planned to pursue other opportunities in retailing.
Bonwit has 50 employees in its main office, but Mr. Doroff said it was not known yet how many would move to Syracuse.
A fashion retailer mostly aimed at the affluent customer, Bonwit Teller was founded in 1895 and grew to 17 stores. It experienced severe financial problems after it was bought in 1988 by the Hooker Company, an Australian developer that went into voluntary bankruptcy in the United States in 1989.
Yesterday, Mr. Congel said, "Bonwit Teller continues to thrive, and Pyramid's efforts to revitalize it are proceeding as planned." He said that three more stores would be opened in the next three years: in Albany, in 1992; Harrisburg, Pa., in 1993, and in Providence, R.I. in 1994.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Much Bigger Amount To Shore Up Bank Deposit Fund

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said today that the Bush Administration's plan to shore up the ailing program that protects deposits in the nation's banks calls for an increase in his agency's borrowing authority of $70 billion, not the $25 billion the Administration proposed earlier this week.
 Mr. Seidman disclosed the higher figure during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee as he sought to reassure the legislators that the bank insurance fund would have enough money available if needed. But instead, his discussion of the additional $45 billion in borrowing ability raised concerns among lawmakers and industry experts that the banking crisis is significantly more severe than has been portrayed by the Government and that a taxpayer bailout of the industry might be inevitable. 
It's a real surprise," said Mark Riedy, president of the National Council of Savings Institutions. "It seems to be a formal recognition that the problem is considerably larger than the Administration has been willing to talk about."
 
More for Savings Bailout
 Lawmakers have already been struggling with the highly unpopular taxpayer bailout of the nation's savings and loans. Shortly after the disclosure on the bank insurance fund, the House approved $30 billion it had rejected last week to continue the savings bailout, and sent the measure to the President. [Page D1.]
 Earlier this week the Administration said it was asking Congress to provide the F.D.I.C. with the authority to borrow $25 billion from the Federal Reserve System, which would be repaid with interest by increasing the premiums from banks to the insurance program. But also tucked into the 317-page legislative proposal sent to the lawmakers was a technical measure modifying a cap on the amount the F.D.I.C. may borrow.
 Mr. Seidman said today that the modification would permit the F.D.I.C. to treat its existing $5 billion credit line from the Treasury Department as equity. Under existing law, which allows the F.D.I.C. to borrow nine times its net worth, the agency could then use the $5 billion as collateral for borrowing an additional $45 billion.
 But Mr. Seidman predicted that the F.D.I.C. would need to borrow only $10 billion this year and that under a "pessimistic economic scenario," it would need to borrow a total of $30 billion to $35 billion over the next three years. His estimate today was consistent with earlier forecasts he had made that covered only the next two years.
 The bank insurance fund currently has $8.4 billion, or about 43 cents per $100 in deposits, and it is estimated that that will drop to 19 cents by the end of the year, But estimates by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office predict that the fund will be insolvent within the next two years. According to Federal law, the fund should have at least $1.25 per $100 in deposits.
 James Barth, a professor at Auburn University who has served as a Government economist, said the Administration's proposal to seek so much borrowing authority for the bank fund was an ominous sign.
 "You don't ask for such large amounts of borrowing authority if you don't intend to spend it," he said. "It is an admission of serious problems, apparently far more serious than we have been led to believe."
 "This strongly suggests that we're moving closer to the admission that taxpayers will have to be involved in assisting the banks," he added. "Otherwise they would simply go to the banks to get additional capital."
 Although Mr. Seidman's comments to the committee were intended to win support for the Administration plan, it had the effect of increasing lawmakers' fears of a replay of the savings and loan debacle.
 
Concern for Taxpayers
 "We simply must not get into the position where the taxpayer in the end has to pick up the bill," said Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
 Mr. Seidman sought to allay the concerns of the Senators, saying taxpayer money would be used only as a last resort. "Only if the industry is in such shape that it cannot pay premiums would the taxpayer be called upon," he said. "That is highly unlikely, but it is possible."
 He emphasized that the increased borrowing authority was a "standby plan" to be used only if the economy does not recover.
 "We will be dedicating bank premiums so that the banks will be required to pay for these loans over time," Mr. Seidman said. The F.D.I.C. is expected to raise bank premiums on June 30 to 23 cents for every $100 in deposits, from 19.5 cents, to pay the interest on the $10 billion that it plans to borrow this year. Any further borrowings, Mr. Seidman and the Administration have proposed, would be repaid through increases in the bank premiums, although the legislative proposal includes a cap on premiums at 30 cents for every $100 in deposits.
 The $45 billion in additional borrowing, which would provide working capital for the agency, would be available from the Federal Financing Bank, which was created in 1973 to coordinate the financing activities of Federal agencies whose obligations are guaranteed by the Government. The remaining $25 billion would be available from the Federal Reserve, which would lend from the pool of bank reserves it holds.
 
No Attempt to Hide
 A Treasury official who insisted on not being identified said the Administration had not been trying to hide the full amount requested for borrowing authority for working capital for the F.D.I.C. The official said the $45 billion had not been highlighted by the Administration in earlier summaries or discussions of the legislation this week because it does not significantly change the existing law since the F.D.I.C. already has the ability to borrow up to nine times its net worth.
 "If the fund is left with no equity, this will be needed to resolve problems at institutions," the official said. He added that using money from the $45 billion would be "fully collateralized" by assets from failed banks that could easily be sold.
 But critics said it was highly unusual to use a credit line as equity for the purposes of securing loans and that the whole point of pegging borrowing authority to net worth was to insure that the loans would be repaid. The move was viewed by critics as a contortion to avoid taxpayer financing of the bank insurance fund.
 "It's counterproductive for them to be leveraging their credit line," Mr. Riedy said. Professor Barth said he had never heard of the use of a credit line to serve as collateral for another loan.

HEADLINE: Envoy Denounces Soviet TV for Scapegoating U.S.

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 21

 BODY:
The United States Ambassador to Moscow today assailed the main Soviet evening television news program for reviving the old practice of blaming foreign interference and connivance for Soviet problems.
 The Ambassador, Jack F. Matlock Jr., took the program Vremya (Time) to task at a briefing for Soviet reporters, which was reported by the Interfax news agency. The sharpness and openness of the criticism was a departure from the Ambassador's usual background briefings for the press, and appeared to signal his readiness to challenge the revival of anti-American reporting on the evening news show. 
Mr. Matlock's specific target was a report on Vremya last Saturday in which the newsreader, Dmitri Biryukov, accused the A.F.L.-C.I.O. of interfering in internal Soviet affairs by declaring solidarity with striking Soviet coal miners, giving them financial assistance and inviting them to the United States.
 Mr. Matlock opened the briefing by playing a tape of the program. According the Interfax account, which was confirmed by the Embassy spokesman, the Ambassador said he was "staggered" by the presentation.
 He asked, "Is there not the slogan, 'Workers of the World, Unite' on Pravda's front page? Or does this slogan not imply help? Or perhaps Vremya commentators simply do not read Pravda?"
 Mr. Matlock said that American miners and trade unions did have contacts with their Soviet colleagues, and that representatives of independent Soviet miners' unions had been invited to the United States under the International Visitor Program, along with Soviet writers, actors, medical workers and staffers of the state television and radio company.
Mr. Biryukov also alleged that American diplomats were attending rallies of striking miners with unfriendly intentions. The Ambassador declared that there was nothing untoward in these actions: "We seek to understand what is taking place in the country and what processes are under way. We do everything openly."
 
New Television Director
 The Ambassador charged that over the past two months Vremya had resumed a xenophobic stance. He said that under Leonid P. Kravchenko, the new director of state television appointed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last November, Vremya had passed beyind editorial commentary to expressing the opinions of specific state structures.
 The transformation of state television under Mr. Kravchenko, and especially the undisguised use of Vremya as a vehicle for the Kremlin, have been one of the most visible aspects of Mr. Gorbachev's new politics, and a major target of the liberal opposition.
 Before Mr. Gorbachev introduced his "new thinking" in foreign policy five years ago, it was a mainstay of Soviet propaganda to imply that foreign plotters and secret services were always seeking to do harm to the Soviet Union. The insinuations served both to perpetuate a suspicion of foreigners in the population, and to create scapegoats for Moscow's own problems.
 Mr. Gorbachev's shift from liberal advisers to an alliance with conservative forces in recent months has included a revival of the practice. The President himself on a recent visit to Byelorussia insinuated that there was something suspicious in the fact that "democrats" were frequently invited to travel abroad, although he frequently travels in foreign countries himself.
 According to the report, the Ambassador also said that American economists doubted that the economic changes such as price increases now being put in practice by the Kremlin could have positive results. "We would like to maintain mutually beneficial economic relations with the Soviet Union, but we just do not know of any way to maintain them with the command and administrative system," Mr. Matlock was quoted as saying.
 But the Ambassador was also quoted as saying that American-Soviet relations were developing in the right direction, and that there could be no return to the cold war.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
A Second U.S. Victory

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Brace yourself, everybody: they are at it again.
 Some of the very experts who told Americans that Saddam Hussein would fight in the desert for months, maybe years, and would slaughter thousands of Americans, but that somehow this martial monster would crumble if we avoided war and just kept the embargo, that Muslims from Damascus to Detroit would rise up if Iraq were attacked, these same experts are again advising American readers, TV viewers and President Bush about what we ought to do, or not to do, about this same Saddam Hussein. 
This time they tell us in newspaper editorials and columns and on TV talk shows that we must rush out of Iraq right away lest we get stuck in Iraqi politics, that we should not do much more about eliminating Saddam Hussein than talk mean, but not very mean, that we must not help the rebels, that fostering democracy in Iraq is not our business, that we must not destroy the "centralizing" force in the country, which what do you know turns out to be the very same Baath Party through which Saddam Hussein slaughtered his countrymen for so long. And they tell us we must make sure that Iraq remains forever "unified."
 Would you believe it?
 All of a sudden it becomes our job to boycott the people who have risen against Saddam Hussein. It becomes our duty to make sure that Iraq, which was cobbled together after World War I by European foreign offices, remains inviolably one down the ages, something like a new Jerusalem.
 The new threat-word is "Lebanonization." We are supposed to be terrified of the idea that Iraq might split up. Remember "body bags"? Or how "the streets" -- meaning the Arab world -- were "resonating" with "resentment" against the coalition for "humiliating" Saddam Hussein?
Would any of these experts have said just before the fall of Berlin that the Nazi Party should be kept together as a centralizing force lest Germany break up? Or warned against trying to kill Hitler lest his sympathizers abroad be fearfully annoyed?
 Of course not. But then the Germans were Europeans while all we have in the Middle East is a bunch of Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds running around, who knows them, and anyway they will never understand democracy, what a thought.
 We do not have to jump into the trap of trying to manage Iraq's political life or keep troops there indefinitely.
 And with common sense we can avoid the danger of being lost in the great burning political desert of the Middle East. That is the hatred of Arab against Arab, Muslim against Muslim, created and cultivated by the same monarchies, dictatorships and religious stake-tenders who fire Arab hatred of Jews and foreigners.
 Our responsibilities are three, all within our capabilities. First is to give the Iraqi rebels a chance to get at Saddam Hussein before he massacres them with the heavy weapons he still commands -- get at him, overturn him and, praise the thought, kill him.
 Denying Saddam Hussein full use of those weapons by air attack is militarily feasible and morally inescapable. Thousands of Iraqi civilians died in the war caused by his aggression. Now we should not permit him to use his remaining armed power to exact a further price against his own people. Most of those weapons were sold to him by Western and Communist nations, the money courtesy of our present Arab allies.
 Mr. Bush has ordered Iraqi planes and helicopter gunships grounded. For this he deserves the appreciation of the world. Now Saddam Hussein should be ordered not to use his artillery and tanks to crush the rebels. Perhaps that would encourage his generals to gather close around him, revolvers finally in hand.
 The second responsibility is to tell the Iranians and Syrians not to set their Iraqi puppets in power. We and our Arab allies could use persuasion: denial of economic and military aid. It won't work completely but it might slow them down while the U.S. meets its third responsibility.
 The President should state precisely what it is he wishes for Iraq: the end of dictatorship of any kind. American representatives should seek out Iraqis, Arab or Kurd, who believe their countrymen deserve better than more tyranny and are capable of carrying out something entirely new for the Muslim Middle East: a decent election.
 By then, American troops would be gone from Iraq. But Iraq's political liberation would be their second victory in the desert, and one day it will be counted the greater.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
House Speaker Opposes Bill Withholding $55 Million From Jordan

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House, today supported President Bush's opposition to a measure passed by the Senate that would rescind $55 million in military and economic aid to Jordan, as House and Senate negotiators began debating the issue.
 "I hope the President can be given greater latitude," said Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat. 
The Speaker said he found it "understandable that Americans felt a sense of resentment and anger" at Jordan's support of President Saddam Hussein during the Persian Gulf war.
 "But it serves no purpose that I can imagine for there to be any destabilization of the Government of Jordan, and so I hope that the President's wish will be respected," Mr. Foley said.
 Late tonight, House and Senate negotiators agreed to ease the restriction on aid to Jordan, The Associate Press reported. The legislators agreed that President Bush could restore the aid if he found that King Hussein was helping advance the Middle East peace process, The A.P. said.
 
Threat of White House Veto
 The White House has threatened to veto the bill unless the restriction is lifted. Under the Senate measure, the money would be restored if the President certified to Congress that Jordan had taken steps to advance the peace process in the Middle East. The measure would not affect humanitarian aid, nor $246 million already in the pipeline in the form of pending contracts.
 Mr. Foley also supported the President's opposition to a Senate measure that would bar money for military sales to nations that had not fulfilled financial aid pledges for the war. That restriction is contained in a $15 billion appropriations bill that the Speaker expected to clear Congress on Friday.
 The White House announced today that Japan would make a $5.7 billion contribution to the allied war effort on Friday, as an initial installment on its $9 billion pledge for 1991.
 
$42.6 Billion Gulf War
 Senators expressed special resentment over the payment delays by Arab nations.
 Saudi Arabia has paid only $6.1 billion on pledges of $16.8 billion, Kuwait has paid only $5.5 billion on pledges of $16 billion and the United Arab Emirates had paid only half of the $4 billion they had pledged.
 The Administration has put the price tag of the desert operation at $42.6 billion, and the amount is growing daily. Allies have pledged $54.5 billion, but paid only $25.6 billion.
 The House and Senate meanwhile approved a compromise agreement on a bill to authorize $15 billion for the gulf war as a last resort, if there were insufficient funds from America's allies. The bill included expanded medical, educational and health benefits for veterans and their families. The Senate approved the bill by voice vote, while the House approved the bill by a vote of 396 to 4.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.N. SURVEY CALLS IRAQ'S WAR DAMAGE NEAR-APOCALYPTIC

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 21

 BODY:
A United Nations survey of civilian damage caused by the allied bombardment of Iraq calls the results "near apocalyptic." The survey, which was made public today, recommends an immediate end to the embargo on imports of food and other essential supplies to prevent "imminent catastrophe."
 The report, prepared by a United Nations team that visited the country between March 10 and March 17, says the bombing has relegated Iraq "to a pre-industrial age" and warns that the nation could face "epidemic and famine if massive life-supporting needs are not rapidly met." 
It calls for "a major mobilization and movement of resources" to provide immediate substantial supplies of food, agricultural equipment, fuel, electrical generators and machinery for water purification, garbage disposal and sewage treatment.
 
U.S. Position on Sanctions
 The report was prepared by Under Secretary General Martti Ahtisaari, who was sent by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He was accompanied by representatives of Unicef, the United Nations Development Program, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Mr. Ahtisaari, a Finn, earned praise in 1989 for his handling of Namibia's move to independence.
 A White House spokesman said the Administration would "give the report careful study," but declined to comment on its findings.
 The report seemed to be at odds with allied military officials' insistence that the damage in Iraq was largely confined to military sites and transportation links. But allied briefers acknowledged that they had destroyed power plants and oil refineries, and the United Nations report stresses that the lack of electricity and fuel is paralyzing hospitals, water purification and sewage treatment plants and irrigation projects.
 It says the monthly allocation of food staples to the population fell from 343,000 tons last September to 135,000 tons in January.
 
Most Workers Are Idle
 The report says 90 percent of Iraq's industrial workers "have been reduced to inactivity and will be deprived of income as of the end of March." Most families already "lack access to adequate rations or the purchasing power to meet normal minimal standards."
 The report says that until Iraq acquires fuel and electrical generating equipment, "food that is imported cannot be distributed; water cannot be purified; sewage cannot be pumped away and cleansed; crops cannot be irrigated; medicines cannot be conveyed where they are required; needs cannot even be effectively assessed."
 Diplomats say the report's findings are likely to bring pressure for a substantial relaxation in the trade sanctions against Iraq when the special committee monitoring compliance with the restrictions meets on Friday.
 The United States has said sanctions should be lifted only when Baghdad fulfills all the allies' conditions for a permanent cease-fire. The special committee can grant a waiver on food and shipments of humanitarian aid, but the entire embargo may be lifted only by a Security Council resolution.
 Ever since the trade embargo was imposed on Aug. 6, after the invasion of Kuwait, the United States has argued against any premature relaxation in the belief that by making life uncomfortable for the Iraqi people it will eventually encourage them to remove President Saddam Hussein from power.
 
Complex New Resolution
 An American draft of a proposed resolution on a permanent cease-fire that has been circulating here indicates that the Bush Administration wants the Security Council to lift only the ban on food shipments after adopting the complex new resolution.
 Under the American draft, even after a permanent cease-fire is set, Council permission would still be needed for imports of "materials and supplies for essential civilian needs," though the Council would examine this requirement every 60 days in the light of Baghdad's compliance and could eventually lift it.
 As expected, the American draft also requires Iraq to agree to the destruction of its ballistic missile systems as well as chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
 
1963 Frontier Cited
 Only when Iraq formally agrees to all provisions of the draft, which is still under discussion, would a cease-fire become effective.
 The United States draft says Iraq must accept the boundary agreement it made with Kuwait in 1963 but subsequently rejected. And it empowers the Security Council to guarantee that frontier with "all necessary means," a phrase that would permit the use of military force against any violator.
In addition, it calls for deployment of a United Nations military observer force along the frontier to monitor possible cease-fire violations and establishes a special fund to pay compensation for damage caused by Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.
 The draft maintains a complete ban on sales of military equipment to Iraq as well as dangerous technologies used in making chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and sets out a four-month timetable for Iraq to comply with all these provisions.
 The original sanctions banned all trade and financial dealings with Iraq and occupied Kuwait, except for the provision of medicine. Food was allowed when the committee judged that humanitarian circumstances required it.
 This month the committee agreed to speed approval of shipments of food and humanitarian aid, but the call for lifting the restrictions appears to go further than the United States envisages at present.
 
At Odds With U.S. Position
 Assessing the effects of allied bombing and the trade embargo on Iraq's economy, the report says "the recent conflict has wrought near-apocalyptic results upon the infrastructure of what had been until January 1991 a rather highly urbanized and mechanized society."
 The report says that about 9,000 Iraqi homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair during the war, including 2,500 in Baghdad and another 1,900 in Basra, and that about 72,000 people have been left homeless.
 It says "most means of modern life support have been destroyed or rendered tenuous" and warns that "for some time to come" the country has been "relegated to a pre-industrial age but with all the disabilities of post-industrial dependency on an intensive use of energy and technology."
 After surveying the food shortage and warning that this year's harvest may fail, the report recommends that "sanctions in respect of food supplies should be immediately removed, as should those relating to the import agricultural equipment and supplies."
 The report concludes: "It is unmistakable that the Iraqi people may soon face a further imminent catastrophe, which could include epidemic and famine, if massive life-supporting needs are not rapidly met. The long summer, with its often 45 or even 50 degree temperatures (113-122 degrees Fahrenheit) is only weeks away. Time is short."

HEADLINE: California Rains Make Hard Decisions Harder

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 21

 BODY:
Three weeks of torrential storms from one end of California to the other have eased the state's water crisis but could be a mixed blessing.
 Predictions of economic calamity in the nation's largest state have been scaled back and some communities are abandoning water rationing. But experts are concerned that the will to overhaul inefficent water policies will fade with the sense of emergency. 
From the point of view of water policy and planning it's a disaster," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is vice chairman of a Congressional committee that deals with water issues. "It allows people to avoid the difficult questions."
 
Snow, Mud and Green Hillsides
 As he spoke, the latest in a series of fierce Alaskan weather systems brought avalanches to the Sierra Nevada, which had been bare of snow most of the winter, and flash floods and mudslides to the Central Coast near Santa Barbara, the most drought-stricken region in a state, which last received normal percipitation in 1986. Hillsides parched blond are lush and green, streams are running high and smaller reservoirs are filled to overflowing.
 In the Central Valley, where dry irrigation systems forced farmers to idle acreage, highways were closed by blowing snow and fields were ankle-deep in slush. Here in San Francisco, wind and rain pummeled cars on the bridges that span the frothy bay and pedestrians were battered with sheets of sleet and hail. There were downed power lines in Los Angeles and reports of tornadoes in San Bernardino County and funnel clouds in San Diego, where rain and severe turbulence may have contributed to a fatal crash of two Navy aircraft today.
 Last month, when the drought was most severe, political leaders seemed poised for major policy changes. Among the issues under discussion were water pricing and distribution, which are wildly uneven from district to district and farm to farm, and water marketing, in which the state can buy water from farmers at rates higher than those they pay and then sell it to strapped water districts.
 Also under discussion, as never before, were environmental issues related to the drought and strategies for conservation that do not penalize those who have already been saving water.
 The leading environmental issue is danger to Chinook salmon, which need more fresh water for spawning than is now available in the dammed Sacramento River.
 The conservation conundrum revolves around many of the rationing plans, which force household cuts of a certain percentage, regardless of how much they used in the past.
 These issues, and others, are troublesome for politicians because any redistribution takes something away from somebody, potentially costing votes. "When you allocate water, you apportion pain," said Representative Miller, vice chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. "And political people prefer to put that off as long as they can."
 
A Lot of Rain Is Not Enough
 When the reservoirs were bone dry, the motivation was high for tackling these issues, but now the sense of urgency may be ebbing. "Institutions are so hidebound and attitudes so entrenched that things may have to get desperate first," said Marc Reisner, the author of "Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water" (Penguin, 1986).
 The recent cavalcade of storms, one every other day or so, began on Feb. 28, when high pressure off the Pacific Coast moved aside and opened a weather pathway that had been shut for the better part of five years.
 But the rain pounding the windows and streaming from roof gutters does not tell the whole story. Statewide precipitation so far this year is 50 percent of normal, the system of 1,200 reservoirs is at half of normal and the snowpack, the primary source of spring runoff, is at 52 percent.
 "It's just not enough to make a complete difference," said Sandra Salazar of the state Drought Center in Sacramento. "We'll probably see some of the hardship lessening in specific parts of the state, but overall we're still going to have a critically dry year."
 With every new storm, Federal, state and local water officials face increased pressure to deliver more water rather than hold it in reserve.
 In each of the last four dry years, both the Federal and state water systems assumed the rains would come and maintained nearly normal deliveries, a practice that critics say led to the current crisis. But so far the huge government systems are not planning to release more water to customers, although the managers say they may reconsider on April 1, when the moisture content of the Sierra snowpack is next measured.
Farmers do not expect either system to release additional water, but they hope for relief in other ways. If the situation improves in urban and suburban areas, several growers in Fresno and Kern Counties said, extra water might be available through the "water bank," a marketing apparatus introduced last month by Governor Pete Wilson, which so far has signed contracts to buy more than 300,000 acre feet of water.
 An acre foot is 326,000 gallons, about enough to irrigate a third of an acre of farm land for a year or supply water to two typical households for a year.
 
Watering the Natural Way
 In a more immediate sense, growers say, the rain has provided some natural irrigation for the permanent crops like nut and fruit trees that were facing death. The rain in Fresno County, for instance, has been the equivalent of 24 hours of irrigation, said Ron Khachigian, vice president of an 11,000-acre orchard near Lost Hills in the San Joaquin Valley. Nut and fruit growers need about 13 such 24-hour irrigating days in a growing season, Mr. Khachigian said.
 With the rain, local water districts in urban and suburban areas have made sharply contrasting decisions.
 At one extreme is the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, which on March 12 lifted a rationing plan because its tiny reservoir, down to a 125-day supply last month, had filled to the brim. On the other hand, the Purissima Hills Water District in the Silicon Valley a day later imposed 75 percent rationing in the affluent community of Los Altos Hills.
 Elsewhere in the state, Los Angeles has postponed a stricter rationing plan. San Francisco, which canceled rationing after heavy March rains in 1989, has not budged this time.
 The confusion is nowhere more apparant than in Marin County, which this month imposed one of the state's most rigorous rationing plans: 50 gallons a day for each person, along with higher rates and harsh penalties for exceeding allotments. In the weeks since the plan was approved, more than 15 inches of rain have fallen in the county, bringing the seven reservoirs, which supply 90 percent of the district's water, to 48 percent of capacity, up from 31 percent.
 The board of directors of the Marin County Water District plans to review the situation in April. But for now tight rationing continues and long-suffering county residents, who coined the motto "save water -- shower with a friend" in the 1976-77 drought, are bragging about new ultra-low-flush toilets and conservationist tooth brushing.
The paradox was evident last month when the water district began distributing free conservation devises to its 170,000 customers. In a driving rain, residents in foul-weather gear lined up at a table in a parking lot for low-flow shower heads, toilet displacement bags and faucet restrictors.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Urged to Cut Rates

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The Joint Economic Committee of Congress urged the Federal Reserve Board today to lower interest rates as "insurance" against a long recession.
 The recommendation, carried in the committee's annual report, added the voice of the Democratic majority to that of the Bush Administration, which has urged the Fed to ease rates. 
Congressional Republicans on the committee, however, stopped short of joining the call for lower rates.
 "I frankly don't often presume to tell the chairman of the Federal Reserve what his monetary policy options should be," said Representative Richard Armey of Texas, the ranking Republican on the committee.
 But asked whether the Fed should ease credit, Mr. Armey said, "If the chairman chooses that option, I would applaud him for doing so."
 Committee chairman Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, said the nation should act to buy an "insurance policy" of measures to ward off a longer or deeper recession.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
New Concerns Over U.S. Science

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN November 1944, with the end of World War II in sight, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Vannevar Bush, the distinguished engineer who headed the Office of Scientific Research and Development, to ask his advice on four fundamental questions:
 *What could be done, consistent with military security, to make known to the world, as soon as possible, the contributions made during the war effort to science and technology? "The diffusion of such knowledge," Roosevelt said, "should help us stimulate new enterprises, provide jobs for our returning servicemen and other workers, and make possible great strides for the improvement of the national well-being." 
What could be done to organize a program for continuing the research, spurred by the war, in medicine and related sciences?
 *What could the Government do to aid research activities by public and private organizations and deal with the interrelation between them?
 *Could an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing scientific talent in American youth, to assure the future of scientific research in this country?
 Dr. Bush's response set forth the blueprint for America's postwar investment in research and education, and led to the establishment of the National Science Foundation.
 This week, a group of leading scientists, assembled by the Carnegie Institution of Washington to honor Dr. Bush's memory, found that the four questions were still alive -- but in urgent need of fresh answers.
 Despite progress in many scientific areas, the United States has been falling behind in its industrial and economic development, with unwanted feedbacks on science itself. Some scientists at the Bush Symposium argued that a revival of manufacturing here was essential to the future of American science and technology.
 "It is not just lack of vision or pig-headedness that causes American manufacturing industries to resist introducing new materials or advanced processes," said James S. Langer of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of California. "The cost of introducing new technologies in this country is enormous; capital is expensive; licensing can be risky and time-consuming, and if the product is really novel, the materials manufacturer is exposed to a variety of legal hazards."
 The problem of lagging American investment in materials, equipment and research also has macroeconomic roots: the low national savings rate and chronic Federal budget deficits curb capital formation for many individual concerns and for the nation as a whole, and permit competitors in other countries to take the lead. But can the American response be focused not primarily on manufacturing but on services ranging from medical care to education to computing and telecommunications to arts and entertainment, which are the wave of the future?
 The wide diffusion of scientific and technological knowledge that Roosevelt called for has been increasingly inhibited by the fierce competition among corporations and research groups. "Traditionally, science has been an open subject," said Sir John Kendrew, a Nobel laureate in biology at Cambridge University. "But now there is a change, even within national communities of scientists, and in particular of biologists. Nowadays they don't talk to one another so freely, because each feels that his research may be important industrially -- in other words, that there may be money in it, and specifically money in it for him or her."
The change in science toward secrecy has been gathering momentum, both in Europe and the United States, and, Sir John added, there has been a concomitant increase in the number of cases of scientific fraud and disputes about priorities that are settled only in the courts. "In my opinion," Sir John told the symposium, "this is no coincidence; rather, I believe there is a causal relationship between the two phenomena."
 "For whatever reasons," Professor Langer said, "there is a real crisis of confidence throughout all of U.S. science these days, and this crisis is particularly acute for the young men and women who should be devoting their energies" to innovative and interdisciplinary research. He called for "a less adversarial" National Science Foundation to control the competitive pressures and restore more sense of inquiry and adventure to scientific research.
 The relationship among industry, government and science -- and between research and economic growth -- is extremely complex. Big spending on research has led to rapid development of many fields -- and to big profits for some organizations. But the quest for profits and grants may hurt science itself, and thereby choke off economic growth. A new Vannevar Bush report is needed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower in Hectic Day As Central Banks Stem Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Action by the world's leading central banks slowed the dollar's strength yesterday, generating a steady decline that was interrupted briefly by a rumor that Germany's embattled monetary chief might resign.
 Gold mostly slipped, with the price for current delivery unchanged from late on Wednesday on the Commodity Exchange in New York at $363. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $361.80 an ounce, down 40 cents. 
Currency traders said at least eight European central banks sold $500 million to $1 billion in dollars to stem the currency's advance.
 The dollar has risen by about 14 percent since the end of the Persian Gulf war on confidence in the American economy's potential to rebound. That has raised fears that the dollar's rise could ultimately have a negative effect on the economy.
 Besides the concerted intervention, the dollar was hurt by a report that unemployment claims for the week that ended on March 9, the first week after the war, rose to their highest level in eight years.
 Hillel Waxman, the vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York, said the jobs report temporarily stole some of the postwar euphoria that buoyed the dollar in the last month.
 He said, however, that he did not think the report alone was enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to move to lower interest rates, a step that could stimulate the economy but also erode the dollar's value.
 The dollar was bumped briefly higher in the morning by rumors, later proved untrue, that Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, might resign. He has come under fire from German officials after remarking earlier this week that the country's economic reunion was a failure.
 "It was just a rumor, but it was good enough to move the dollar up to the high levels of the day," said Lorenzo Troni, the vice president of foreign exchange at Paine Webber International Inc., also in New York
 Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.6315 marks, from 1.6425 marks on Wednesday.
 The financial markets were closed yesterday in Japan for a national holiday. In London, the dollar closed at 137.55 yen, lower than its close of 138.30 yen on Wednesday in Tokyo. In trading in New York, the dollar closed at 136.73 yen, down from late Wednesday's 138.30 yen.
 In London, the British pound rose to $1.7930, from $1.7770 late on Wednesday. The pound also rose in New York, fetching $1.7995 by the end of the day, more than late Wednesday's $1.7855.
 Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Wednesday, included: 1.4055 Swiss francs, down from 1.4150; 5.5555 French francs, down from 5.5950; 1,215.50 Italian lire, down from 1,223.00.
