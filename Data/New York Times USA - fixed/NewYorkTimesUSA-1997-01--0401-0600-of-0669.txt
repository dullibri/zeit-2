HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE FUTURE;
Clinton's Triumph Prompts Democratic Soul-Searching

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
As he stands on the threshold of his second inauguration, Bill Clinton poses a paradox for the party he leads.
Like no Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt, he has managed to capture the White House for a second term. Yet he did so by accepting many basic principles of the Republicans, while staving off their most ambitious assaults on Government. 
 Mr. Clinton was not able to carry Democrats back into control of Congress. He built much of his political comeback on distancing himself equally from both parties in Congress. Now as he prepares to take his second oath of office on Monday, the question is whether this ever-fluid leader stands as a party of one or whether he can redefine the Democrats and keep peace among factions that submerged their differences in 1996 in the interest of preventing the Republicans from winning both Congress and the White House.
"It's very fundamental," said Will Marshall, the president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research organization of centrist Democrats. "Democrats have yet to coalesce around a post-New Deal governing philosophy."
Just where Mr. Clinton is taking the Democrats is still uncharted. He himself has said his agenda "isn't liberal or conservative -- it's both and it's different."
Appearing before centrist Democrats late last year, he reminded them of the themes on which he had first run for President: "This era requires a Government that neither attempts to solve problems for people, nor leaves them alone to fend for themselves. Instead we envision a Government that gives people the tools to solve their own problems and make the most of their own lives."
Yet what that means in practice remains elusive, for Mr. Clinton has had two such distinct periods in his Presidency that his aides acknowledge they could be viewed as separate terms. In his first two years in office, he failed to persuade a Democratic Congress to enact a number of the fundamental changes he had promised the country: universal health care coverage, restructuring of the welfare system and a cleansing of the campaign finance system.
After the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, he staved off what he called their most extreme proposals by making a stand for Medicaid, Medicare, education programs and the environment. Yet he acceded to the Republicans' goal of creating a balanced budget and he signed a Republican welfare bill that went further than anything he had previously envisioned.
Mr. Clinton's partisans say the President reminded Americans at the height of the Republican Revolution of what they value in Government. Noting that the Republicans have moderated their tone on issues like education and the environment, Vice President Al Gore said, "It's a measure of how far President Clinton has come in defining not only the Democratic Party but also the center of gravity in our country."
Yet even those who share his "New Democrat" credentials say Mr. Clinton, in his final term, must persuade doubters within his own party that his promise is real, that Government can be not only smaller but also activist and more effective.
"There is a new political debate which is struggling to be born here, and the prize will then go to the person or political party who sees and then seizes the terms of debate," said Bill Curry, who recently resigned as counselor to the President to teach at Yale University.
"The New Democrats have much of what is required," Mr. Curry said, "a belief in the devolution of power, fiscal restraint, smallness of scale, public-private partnerships and free markets. The question is, if that's all there is to it, then there's also a really useful name for the people who believe in it -- Republicans."
Much of what Mr. Clinton provided for his party in the campaign was a new symbolism. He used small-scale family-based proposals to show middle-class America that he shared its values on issues like crime, education and welfare and that Democrats did not stand simply for redistribution of middle-class tax dollars to the poor and for 60's counterculture values.
"He's buried the daggers that were aimed at our heart," said Mr. Clinton's former adviser George Stephanopoulos, "weak on crime, weak on welfare, weak on defense, and that's a significant accomplishment." At the same time, many Democrats applaud him for being able to keep their party in favor of abortion rights and gun control.
The symbolism came linked to proposals that are a shadow of what Mr. Clinton once represented. But his approach reflects an understanding, his aides say, that Americans at this moment do not want grand change but do want some help in taking control of their lives.
Where once Mr. Clinton wanted universal health care coverage, now he has called for legislation to allow laid-off workers to be able to keep their health insurance for six months. His budget proposal is also expected to extend Medicaid coverage to more poor children.
Where he once had a welfare plan with the premise that putting people to work would be more expensive than giving them checks, now the President, who signed into law $54 billion in savings as part of the Republican welfare overhaul, is trying to ameliorate what he signed and restore $16.4 billion.
Mr. Clinton remains committed to promoting education and training and has said he would delegate students from the National Service program to be reading tutors to promote third grade literacy. Using two separate proposals -- a $10,000 tax deduction or a $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of postsecondary school -- Mr. Clinton has also said he wants to make two years of higher education as universal as high school.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said his top priority for his last term is to balance the budget by the year 2002, an action his advisers believe will end a debate that has divided Congress for more than a decade.
Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's new chief of staff, calls the achievement of a balanced budget essential for economic growth.
"You free up an enormous amount of capital that would go to deficits so that it can go to the private sector to invest in new tools and equipment and machinery that makes American companies more competitive and more productive," Mr. Bowles said. "By being such they can earn higher profits and therefore pay higher wages and we can do something about this darn wage stagnation that's been bedeviling this country for a long time. Is that liberal of conservative? Who knows, O.K.? But wage stagnation is something we've got to deal with in this country."
Yet it is precisely on questions of budget priorities, and economic policy that the Democratic Party is most divided. Democrats, as well as Republicans, still face decisions on how much to rein in spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as what kinds of trade-offs to make in cutting domestic programs or the military.
As a result, two distinct Democratic camps have emerged, distinguished largely by how they view the global information age.
On one side, moderate New Democrats joined by architects of Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign say Democrats should concentrate on ways to help the family and make pensions and health insurance portable at a time when workers can no longer count on lifetime job security. This faction is more amenable to scaling back and reshaping the entitlement programs of Medicare and Social Security. And it contends that the Government should stress education to better prepare workers for the age of technology.
On the other side, a coalition of liberals and organized labor , including some strategists of Mr. Clinton's first campaign, argue that Democrats should safeguard the existing entitlement programs and make deeper cuts in military programs to free up money for domestic needs.
They are leery of free trade agreements that do not include provisions to discourage American business from moving across borders for cheaper labor. And they would like to see Government use the tax code to goad corporations to invest more in their own workers.
"You will see the progressive wing of the Democratic Party start to reassert itself," said Robert L. Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a research group established to counter the centrist Democrats. "It will be beginning on fights over the budget, depending on what the President does, and real fights on trade."
If Mr. Clinton's hopes of being able to work with the Republicans to build a "vital center" are met, he can navigate without liberal Democratic defectors in Congress to enact a legislative program.
But at what cost to his heir apparent, Vice President Gore? Many Democrats predict that today's divisions will solidify into a primary challenge to Mr. Gore for the Democratic nomination in four years.
"You'll start to see more of the traditional debates in the Democratic Party," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who was the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "How that debate is waged, how acrimonious it is will determine whether it is helpful or harmful."

HEADLINE: Students Need Smaller Classes, Not Computers;
Welfare Cuts?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If Gov. George E. Pataki really had proposed increases for welfare recipients, he would deserve the credit you give him for proposing "welcome new spending initiatives" ("The Governor's Divisive Cuts," editorial, Jan. 16). 
 In fact, Governor Pataki has proposed large cuts in state public assistance eligibility and benefits. The cuts include the elimination of entitlements for rent and utility arrears, a grant reduction of at least 10 percent for families that need aid for more than 18 cumulative months, a 60-month lifetime limit on cash aid for children and their parents and the elimination of cash public assistance for most aged and disabled legal immigrants and for unemployed "single" adults.
The Governor's welfare cut proposals will undoubtedly drive hunger and homelessness to unprecedented levels. They merit the same criticism you heap on his proposals to cut education and health care.

HEADLINE: Banc One Is Said to Plan Bid Of $7 Billion for First USA

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Climbing toward the top of the profitable but precarious credit card market, the Banc One Corporation is expected to announce this morning that it has reached an agreement to buy First USA Inc. for about $7 billion, people familiar with the transaction said last night.
The deal would vault Banc One to rank third in the credit card market, after Citicorp and the MBNA Corporation, with $33 billion in credit card loans. 
 Banc One is offering about $52 a share for First USA, a premium of about 41 percent more than the company's closing price on Friday. First USA's shares had gained $2.125 Friday to end trading at $36.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Executives of both companies have gathered in New York for a presentation to analysts scheduled for this morning, the people familiar with the transaction said. Spokesmen for the two companies could not be reached for comment last night.
It could not be learned last night whether Banc One would use any cash in the deal; the company has paid for past acquisitions with stock. Banc One's shares closed Friday at $45.125, up 12.5 cents.
First USA, based in Dallas, has been one of the fastest-growing credit card issuers in the country, with 16 million customers who owe a total of $22.4 billion on their Mastercard and Visa accounts.
Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, was an early pioneer in the credit card business. But like many regional banks, it has lost ground to specialized companies like First USA.
Industry experts said that this deal was likely to spur further consolidation in the credit card industry. Late last year, Citicorp was in talks to acquire the American Express Company, though those discussions seem to be dormant for the moment. And other specialized credit card companies, like the Capital One Financial Corporation, could decide that now is the right time to sell out.
Banc One's proposed acquisition of First USA is bound to be controversial, however. On Friday, First USA shares were already priced at 19 times the company's earnings, far higher than those of most banking companies.
Moreover, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the credit card market. Consumer debt is approaching an all-time high, with a growing number of card holders falling behind on payments. And even though unemployment is at relatively low levels, more than one million households filed for personal bankruptcy last year, the most ever in a single year. Some analysts have predicted that if the economy slows and unemployment rises, losses would soar for credit card issuers.
How First USA would fare in such a downturn is a subject of much industry speculation. The company has grown faster than nearly any other card issuer, increasing its lending by 28 percent last year, and rapid growth is often seen as a precursor to problems in banking.
Yet its management is widely seen as among the most sophisticated in the card industry, and its computerized credit analysis systems are among the most advanced. These systems help First USA pick out the most creditworthy customers in advance and they monitor accounts for early signs of trouble.
In its second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, First USA said that 5.19 percent of its accounts were delinquent, compared with 5.03 percent in its first quarter. Losses were 4.76 percent of loans, up from 4.49 percent.
First USA's initial growth spurt was built on using its computers to select the most creditworthy customers from the big banks and lure them with gold cards that featured low interest rates. As this tactic became less effective, First USA has moved to "affiliation cards," tying its cards with companies and charities, ranging from the World Wildlife Fund to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Banc One, the nation's 10th-largest banking company, has mostly been on the sidelines of the merger game after a 25-year string of ever-bigger acquisitions that turned it into a national banking powerhouse. The company's stock price was hit by a series of wrongheaded investments involving derivatives in 1993 and by inefficiencies created by its decentralized management structure. Now with the derivatives behind it and a new centralization campaign, Banc One is slowly regaining favor on Wall Street.
Last year, Nationsbank beat Banc One in the bidding for Boatmen's Bancshares, a St. Louis company that was long seen as Banc One's ideal mate. But in December, Banc One did agree to buy the Liberty Bancorporation of Oklahoma City for $546 million in stock.
Also late yesterday, First USA reported earnings for its second quarter that slightly exceeded analyst estimates. Net income for the quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, rose 34 percent, to $79.1 million, or 58 cents a share, from $58.9 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. The average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. Inc. was for earnings of 56 cents a share.

Maneuvering on Casino Plan
Support for a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling has eroded among the State Senate's Republican majority. And some Democrats have complained that the measure does nothing for New York City. The drop in support seemed a stunning turnaround for an amendment that had appeared to be on a fast track to passage. But the measure is far from dead. While it clearly is in trouble, it has become the object of an awkward pas de deux involving the Senate's 35 Republicans and 26 Democrats that may yet result in its passage. [Page A1.]
 
Shelters Filled in Cold Snap
As New York City neared the end of its most serious cold snap so far this winter and the city's shelter system filled almost to capacity over the weekend, many homeless men complained that they were once again being shuttled from shelter to shelter, in what has become an annual search for beds. [B1.]
 
Rebuilding, Despite Nature
Overnight, it seems, a village is springing up again at the west end of Dune Road in the Hamptons. That the tiny community of West Hampton Dunes exists at all is remarkable, considering the hurdles it had to overcome: an erosion control project that destroyed the beach instead; a raging sea that tore the barrier island in two. Oh, and the piping plover. The plover, an endangered shore bird, mates and nests between March and September, a schedule that collides with construction season. That is why during this frigid month, the village is in the midst of a building boom. [B1.]
 
Teacher's Lesson in Reading
"I will never take the adult world all that seriously," said Ted Kesler, 35. It is his childlike sensibility, Mr. Kesler said, that helps him relate to the 8- and 9-year-old occupants of Room 3-223 at Public School 75 on the Upper West Side, where he is a third grade teacher. But it is as he labors to teach his students to read -- in a year when Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has made third-grade literacy his top priority -- that Mr. Kesler, through his own childhood, identifies most powerfully with their struggles and frustrations. [B1.]
 
Criticism Over Food Stamps
Religious leaders and advocates for the poor are criticizing Governor Pataki's decision not to seek a waiver that would soften a provision of a new Federal law, which could end food stamp eligibility for thousands of New Yorkers starting next month. "There's a meanspiritedness in this that's an indictment against our whole society," said the Rev. William A. Greenlaw of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Manhattan. Metro Matters by Elizabeth Kolbert. [B1.]
 
Molinari: Will He or Won't He?
For nearly 25 years, Guy V. Molinari has been a fixture in Staten Island politics. So much so that he is known to most residents of the city's least populous borough simply as Guy. It is no wonder that Mr. Molinari has sent tremors through political circles on Staten Island by engaging in very public contemplation over whether to seek another term as borough president. [B3.]
 
West Point Faces Rape Trial
The prosecution contends the victim was assaulted while she was too drunk to give consent. The defense says the sex was consensual. These have become familiar arguments at acquaintance-rape trials. But at the United States Military Academy in West Point, there is nothing familiar about it. Cadet James P. Engelbrecht is to be tried at a general court martial on charges that he raped a fellow cadet, the first such trial at West Point since women were admitted as students in 1976. [B4.]
 
Arrested Pastor to Step Down
On the Sunday after their pastor was charged with selling drugs out of their church, about 90 people attending services at St. John's Episcopal Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, heard a bishop tell them that their minister, the Rev. Chester LaRue, would be stepping down. [B4]
 
Debating Pataki's Budget Plan
At first blush, New York State's balance sheet looks pretty good. The state, more flush with cash than in many years, expects to end its fiscal year March 31 with a $1.3 billion surplus, thanks to a strong economy and a boom on Wall Street. But independent analysts say that Governor Pataki's proposed $66.1 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 squanders a rare chance to use the surplus to correct longterm problems, instead making them worse. Nonetheless, the Governor's office calls it "a responsible, well-balanced plan." News analysis. [B5.]

Plan to Save House Threatened
A plan to save a 19th century Westport mansion by moving it over water to Sherwood Island State Park has fallen through after the State Department of Environmental Protection reversed its initial approval. Environmental officials say too many questions remain about whether the Eno house would hurt wetlands and wildlife at Sherwood Island, a park on Long Island Sound. [B5.]

 BODY:
Forget about pay telephones here. Since nearly a third of Finland's five million people carry mobile phones and the number increases by 27 percent a year, fixed phones are becoming something quaint, almost a relic.
Indeed, even standard mobile phones are becoming a bit old-fashioned. The latest cellular phones now send electronic mail and permit users to wander through the news groups and World Wide Web sites of the Internet. Nokia's new model 9000 communicator, a phone and computer hybrid no bigger than the cellular phones of a decade ago, allows Internet access to a user who may be riding a train, sitting in a cafe or standing at a street corner. 
 That such a device would be produced by a Finnish company like the big telecommunications maker Nokia is fitting: this Nordic nation is the most wired in the world. Banking, shopping and socializing are migrating from the real world into the virtual one faster here than anywhere else. Habits that distinguish high-technology regions like Silicon Valley in California are a national phenomenon here.
Why this country, once a buffer between the old Soviet Union and the capitalist centers of northern Europe, became a microcosm of an electronic future is unclear. Reasons being cited include Finland's high educational level, public spending on basic research and long winter nights.
Whatever the reasons, the facts are striking: According to recent monthly figures released by John Quarterman, president of Matrix Information and Directory Services, a research firm in Austin, Tex., there are 62 Internet host computers for each 1,000 Finns, twice the proportion in the United States. In the last year, Finland outstripped the former leader, Iceland (population, 270,000), which now has 42 for each 1,000 people.
David Farber, a telecommunications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote: "Technically Finland is a leader in the telecommunications area. They have the first public Internet access capability and have the highest penetration of cellular in the world."
Finns use the Internet to chat about their problems and for academic research. They use "electronic wallets" and cash systems to order postage stamps, pick lottery tickets, bank, play roulette in an electronic arcade, shop for groceries, read newspapers and attend courses given hundreds of miles away.
As in much of the United States, universities offer Internet access free to students, as do public libraries, which dedicate one or more connected computers for an hour to anyone who requests it. And municipalities, computer makers and the Government all subsidize the campaign to offer as many ties to computers and cellular phones as possible.
"There is something decidedly unusual about Finland," Mr. Quarterman wrote in an E-mail message. "Perhaps it comes from being between the first and second worlds for all those years; perhaps from a high standard of living and high literacy, perhaps even from needing something to do during those long cold nights. I don't know the cause, but the phenomenon is undeniable."
He also pointed out that the five Nordic countries -- Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark -- were among the top 15 in having proportionately the most Internet-connected computers.
"Because Finland is so small, homogenous and has a high level of education, Internet use is becoming a part of the democratic access in society to government and institutions," said Minna Puirava, a project manager in marketing studies at the University of Tampere, about 100 miles north of Helsinki. "Of course, America has an electronic culture that is very advanced but it is concentrated in small groups of the population. Here, it is really widespread."
Finland's Education Minister, Olli-Pekka Heinonen, who is 33, said in an interview that in less than two years the country would be spending 2.9 percent of its gross national product on research and development in computer fields. This year, he said, the Government and private industry would together spend two billion Finnish markka ($417.5 million) to educate 600,000 students and 400,000 adults on Internet use. By 2000, he continued, all of the nation's 5,000 schools would be hooked into the Internet.
The objective: "A society where competence is based on knowledge, know-how and the creation of new economic wealth," Mr. Heinonen said.
Nearly 30 percent of Finnish homes currently have portable computers, and about 60 percent of the people have access to the Internet either at home, at work or through a local institution like a library, according to Johan Helsingus, chief executive of Eunet Finland, one of Europe's largest Internet service providers.
Merita, the nation's largest bank, already provides more than three million account holders with secure electronic access by computer.
The state-owned Telecom Finland is beginning a limited Internet phone service, allowing customers to talk to each other at their computer terminals. Most such calls would be made through local phone numbers, and this promises in time to become the cheapest way to call.
Laboring in a mood as dark as a Finnish December afternoon, a 32-year-old recovering alcoholic, who requested that his name not be used, surfed the Internet for an hour recently. Since he learned a few months before how to get on the Internet, he has gone to the stately Rikhardinkadun public library three hours a week to chat with other recovering alcoholics halfway around the world.
Why not do his chatting locally, at Alcoholics Anonymous?
"Oh, I do that, too, but the Net is different," he said barely shifting his eyes from the computer screen. "On the Net, feelings are true. For me, it is more about self-help -- a different kind of therapy."
That same evening, in another library in a Helsinki suburb, Vantaa, a woman was glued to a computer in the airy atrium downstairs as she searched the Internet. Upstairs, Jean-Erik Ekberg, 27, was about to start a class on how to use the Internet, in a room filled with computers donated by industry and the municipality.
Scattered around were a freelance translator, a grandfather with his granddaughter and grandson, and a banker on the verge of retirement who had decided that Internet surfing would be an amusing thing to do in his free time.
Jarno Subanto, 26, who is studying education, has access to a computer at home and at the university. "My parents keep their portable computer in the bedroom," he said. "Some of my friends move it to the breakfast table to read newspapers."
He does not have his own PC, but goes on line at Tampere University, where Internet access is free. "I am at a point where I feel positively weird if I turn on my PC to find no E-mail," he said. "It means the connection is broken."
According to various estimates corroborated by universities, Internet providers and phone companies, more than 1 percent of the population -- roughly 570,000 Finns -- used the Internet in a recent three-month period -- a 21 percent increase over the previous three months.
"It's a snowball reaction that is fast changing people's lives," said Petri Vuorimaa, director of the Digital Media Institute at Tampere University.
Mr. Helsingus, chief executive of Eunet Finland, said: "In my company, staff is wired 24 hours a day. When people get up they start chatting. Two weeks ago, I asked my secretary to get someone on the phone and her answer was, 'Oh, he just stepped into the shower,' " he recalled with a chuckle.
"But this is no joke," he said. "Being wired all the time is the shape of the future."

HEADLINE: Survey of 100 U.S. Coastal Sites Shows Pollution Is Declining

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
POLLUTION levels have fallen at more than 100 sites along the nation's coastline, a Federal program that closely monitors contaminant levels in mussels and oysters has found.
But coastal pollution is still a major problem in many areas of the United States, with numerous shores closed to swimming and shellfishing, and some undergoing expensive cleanup programs. 
 The study monitored 14 elements and compounds. The trace elements under study were arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium and zinc, all of which can be harmful to humans and sea life in high concentrations.
The organic compounds under study were DDT, chlordane, dieldrin (all pesticides), butyltin (a paint additive), PCB (an electrical industry chemical) and PAH (a widespread byproduct of industrial and oil pollution). In high concentrations, many of these compounds can cause cancer and genetic mutations or can interfere with reproduction.
Dr. Thomas P. O'Connor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the head of the study, said in an interview that many of the 14 chemicals had been outlawed or restricted in their use or discharge into waterways. In other cases, he said, the declines appeared to be caused by voluntary cutbacks or economic changes that reduced industrial reliance on the dangerous chemicals.
"There are lots of decreases and some increases," he said, adding that the declines were comforting but not wholly unexpected, given the increasing efforts in recent years to stem coastal pollution.
The study monitored mussels and oysters at 154 sites from coast to coast and found 217 decreases in chemicals and 41 increases. The main finding in the vast majority of cases, however, was no change of concentration, with 1,898 such readings out of a total of 2,156 samples.
The greatest number of decreases were for chlordane (43), PCB (26), DDT (24) and cadmium (20). The greatest increases were for mercury (7), lead (7), zinc (6) and arsenic (5).
The study, "Trends in Chemical Concentrations in Mussels and Oysters Collected Along the U.S. Coasts from 1986 to 1993," was published last year in the journal Marine Environmental Research. The ocean agency also published a version of the report titled, "Recent Trends in Coastal Environmental Quality: Results from the Mussel Watch Project."
The effort began in 1986. A report in 1992 found that concentration trends, where evident, tended downward over the program's first five years. The current report shows that the downward trend is continuing and illustrates it with greater statistical strength.
Shellfish are used for the continuing study because they rapidly absorb environmental contaminants and are easy to collect and examine. Since no single species is common to all coasts, seven different kinds are being collected, including the blue mussel and the American oyster.
Mussels live either partly buried in the sea bottom or attached to rocky surfaces by means of threads. Adult oysters attach themselves to seabed objects with either cement or tough threads.
The shellfish were sampled from sites that average 12 miles apart in estuaries and bays, and 43 miles apart along open coastlines. Almost half the sites are near urban areas, which were selected on the assumption that chemical contamination is higher there and more likely to have undesirable biological effects.
The reported findings are broken down by sampling site. For instance, the waters around Brewster Island in Boston Harbor showed declines in copper, chlordane and dieldrin. Hempstead Harbor on Long Island Sound had drops in arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc, chlordane, DDT and PCB.
Hog Point in Chesapeake Bay showed declines in chlordane, DDT, dieldrin and PCB. And Harbor Island in San Diego Bay had drops in cadmium, nickel, lead, zinc and butyltin.
Despite the general downward trend, the study noted that 21 sites had high and increasing concentrations of chemicals, and called for them to get special attention from cleanup experts. The upward trends, the ocean agency report said, "should be interpreted as indicating that ongoing human activity is increasing chemical contamination."
The sites of concern included the Shark River in New Jersey, Naples Bay in Florida, Biloxi Bay in Mississippi, Lovers Point in Pacific Grove, Calif., and Keehi Lagoon in Honolulu Harbor.
Lead was the only chemical measured by the program whose concentration was repeatedly found to be above a public health guideline in many places. The only other chemicals above a safe level were PCB's found one year in Buzzards Bay, Mass., and cadmium found one year in Lake Pontchartrain, La.

Dollar Soars vs. Yen as Tokyo Hints Central Bank Won't Act

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar reached its highest point against the yen in almost four years yesterday as the Tokyo stock market tumbled and expectations grew that the the Bank of Japan would not move to prop up the yen.
The dollar also jumped to two-and-a-half-year highs against the German mark and the Swiss franc. 
 The dollar rose as high as 118.21 yen, the highest since March 1993, before settling in New York at 118.06 yen, up from 117.38 yen Friday.
The dollar traded as high as 1.6313 marks in European trading, the highest since mid-June 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6264 marks, up from 1.6174 marks. The dollar rose to 1.4159 Swiss francs from 1.3989 francs. The British pound fell to $1.6622 from $1.6674.
The dollar's advance may have been exaggerated by light trading in the United States on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, traders said.
In Japan, an unidentified official at the Economic Planning Agency said the economy could suffer if the central bank bought yen to bolster the currency, because such a move would pull yen out of the banking system, news services reported. His remarks doused speculation that Japan would try to prevent the yen from falling further. Adding to the yen's woes was a 3.4 percent slump in the Nikkei 225 stock index.
"With the weakness of the stock market, the E.P.A. official's comments aren't surprising," said Bill Sterling, global investment strategist at BEA Associates, a money management firm with $30 billion of assets. "They need a weaker yen to get their economy going."
The Japanese official's remarks damped speculation that the central bank was poised to aid the yen.
That concern intensified after several top Japanese officials warned earlier this month against an "excessive" decline by their currency. The dollar rose 3.3 percent versus the yen in the last month.
"As long as the dollar's rise is orderly, it appears there won't be intervention," said Richard Vullo, manager of currency sales at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank. "Putting that together with their economy being in the tank and their stock market going only lower, you don't have to be a genius to decide where to put your money -- in the U.S."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
We Hardly Know Him

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
For the oppressed of the earth, the victims of dictatorships and religious tyrannies, the most important sentences in President Clinton's Inaugural speech came toward the end.
"Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom," he said. "Their cause is America's cause." 
 The passage is a matter of American belief, history and value, yes. But long before the Inaugural he put it forward as also the essence of American self-interest.
With lucidity he had explained that governments based on political and religious freedom for their people have to consult their citizens on matters of importance. So they are less likely to go to war or build economic and propaganda blackmail into their relations with other nations.
Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy aides gave it a name: democratic realism, as contrasted to the old Realpolitik that caused so many wars.
But Mr. Clinton, we hardly know you.
It was four years ago that he delivered that passage, in his first Inaugural. In his second, he had the decency not to repeat it or its substance.
After he was elected in 1992, he killed his own policy of tying trade with Communist China to progress on human rights -- not real democracy and freedom, just some easing of the arrests, torture, slave labor, religious persecution and forced abortions that the Communists use to control China and occupied Tibet.
Without a U.S. human rights policy, the oppression of dissidents in China and Tibet increased sharply.
Mr. Clinton responded by inviting to the White House the very general who ordered the slaughter at Tiananmen Square. Talk of democratic realism and U.S. support for the causes of freedom became ugly to the ear.
How long should it take to know a man you encounter every day by listening, thinking, hearing about him? Four years and we do not know him. He does a variety of good things abroad -- sometimes in action, as in Haiti, sometimes through influence, as in the Mideast.
And sometimes in word. He preaches the religious and racial harmony he plainly believes necessary for the peace of the individual soul and of nations.
But the same man permits the clandestine sale of weapons to the Bosnian Muslims by Iran. This helps give the enemy of religious harmony a foothold in a slice of Europe that can never live in peace without it.
He talks about helping the poorest children of America. But he goes along with a welfare revision that would allow states to reduce help to dependent children before their parents have a job.
He lectures on the imperative need to stop proliferation of weapons of mass death but looks away when China sells missiles and nuclear technology to other dictatorships.
The President believes in diversity. But as new inspiration he puts forward the vanillaization of American politics -- the blending of spicily different Republican and Democratic philosophies into a bland milkshake.
He talks about fighting drugs but never has the energy or desire to lead the struggle. The same is true about individual responsibility, a theme of the second Inaugural Address.
Mr. Clinton blames only his aides for scandals from the purloined F.B.I. files to the payments by foreign businesses to the Democratic treasury.
I voted for Mr. Clinton. Twice. The first time was with enthusiasm, for two reasons. Democratic realism is my political passion. And to Saddam Hussein's astonishment, President Bush left him alive and in power.
The second time I voted with grump. The Republicans gave me no choice I could accept. Bob Dole on Chinese human rights and welfare kids seemed a Clinton clone -- and was also against decent gun control.
Anyway, in my late teens I discovered I could not name the exact day of my arrival from Canada at the age of 4. That made me an illegal alien. I was allowed to finish a free college; nobody suggested otherwise. The thought did occur to me that if Mr. Dole had had his way I would have been thrown out of kindergarten.
I figure the President owes me something, me and the others who voted with grump, so that after eight years we might say, pleasantly, that we know the man. Constancy is the word I am thinking of.

HEADLINE: Ideal Economy, but Fed Has Its Guard Up

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve say they believe the economy is finely balanced between healthy growth and inflation, and they are almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged when they meet early next month to consider monetary policy for the first time in 1997.
But in interviews and in speeches over the last week, four Federal Reserve governors and several of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents suggested that despite the current ideal combination of steady growth, low unemployment and low inflation, they were likely to move swiftly to raise rates if they saw any acceleration in wages or prices later in the year. 
 "It's like being at the top of a mountain," Laurence H. Meyer, who was named to the Fed's board of governors by President Clinton last year, said in a speech last week. "There is an exhilaration from getting there and the view is great, but all paths are downhill."
The Fed officials outlined a series of issues that they said could influence the economy this year, from rising levels of consumer debt to the possibility of an agreement to balance the Federal budget to whether reductions in health care inflation can be sustained.
And they said that reading the economy's direction was becoming more complex as old assumptions about the relationship among growth, unemployment and inflation were called into question, making policy decisions that much more difficult. Until last year, for example, it was an article of economic faith that if unemployment remained below 6 percent for any length of time while the economy continued to grow, the inevitable result would be inflation. Instead, unemployment has remained below 5.5 percent, and while wages have been rising moderately, inflation has remained dormant.
On Wall Street, the emerging consensus is that the Fed is growing increasingly wary of rising wages, and will raise rates, perhaps as early as March, in a pre-emptive strike against inflation.
"In the absence of a full-scale retreat in demand growth in the early months of 1997, officials are likely to conclude that higher underlying inflation may be unavoidable without the insurance of tighter policy," Salomon Brothers told clients in a report on Friday.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, whose views on monetary policy remain decisive within the institution, is to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Budget Committee.
Including Mr. Greenspan, there are seven seats on the Fed's board of governors, although two seats are currently vacant. All the governors plus five of the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks get a vote on monetary policy.
Fed officials offered these analyses of the economy last week:

Alice M. Rivlin
Mrs. Rivlin, who was the White House budget chief before being named vice chairwoman of the Fed by President Clinton last year, said there were opportunities in the tight labor markets.
"For the long-run future it's very important to keep the labor markets as tight as possible without accelerating inflation," she said in an interview. "People get more training. They get promoted into better jobs. There's an incentive to hire people who might otherwise not get hired."
Indeed, she said, it was particularly important to keep unemployment rates low as the nation begins to carry out welfare reform, a process that will require moving millions of low-skilled benefit recipients into jobs in coming years. To succeed in that goal will require stamping out inflationary pressures before they take root, she said, so the country can avoid the traditional business cycle of high interest rates followed by recession.
"Welfare reform will be difficult at best, and impossible in a recession," she said.
On the plus side for the economy, she said, the outlook for Congress and the White House for reaching agreement on a balanced budget is good. To help do so, she said, Congress could temporarily reduce the cost-of-living index used to set Social Security and other benefit payments by half a percentage point or so below the Consumer Price Index, which is widely judged to overstate inflation, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics works on a long-range fix.

Laurence H. Meyer
In looking at how inflation has remained relatively dormant in the face of low unemployment, Mr. Meyer, who was appointed to the Fed last year and is one of the nation's foremost economic forecasters, starts with what he called "a series of favorable supply shocks."
By that he means falling prices in several categories that are not usually included in the traditional models of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Health care inflation is declining as companies move employees into managed care programs, reducing corporate benefit costs, holding down overall compensation and lessening pressure on companies to raise prices. Computer prices are declining sharply. And import prices declined last year as the dollar strengthened.
Because those developments are likely to be temporary, Mr. Meyer said, there may be "some gradual increase in core inflation this year," although any increase could be "more than offset in 1997 by a slowing of the increase in food prices and a partial reversal of the recent increase in energy prices."
Mr. Meyer said there was some evidence that concern about job security was tempering demands for wage increases, helping to keep the traditional wage-price spiral from being activated. But he offered an alternative view based on the idea that the inability of companies to raise prices had altered the wage-price dynamic.
"The point of departure is the perceived inability of firms to pass forward increases in prices," Mr. Meyer said in a speech last Thursday. "That dictates an obsession by firms with containing costs. That means bargaining aggressively to avoid increases in wage costs, intensive efforts to offset any wage increases with productivity gains, and the necessity of absorbing in profit margins increases in costs that cannot be offset."
And why are companies so constrained in raising prices?
"The absence of pricing leverage may simply reflect the fact that product markets are not tight, compared to labor markets," Mr. Meyer said. "There may be some excess demand in labor markets, but the effect on wages and prices is being offset for the moment by favorable supply shocks. On the other hand, capacity utilization rates show no signs of excess demand in product markets."

Susan M. Phillips
"One worrying area is consumer debt," said Ms. Phillips, who was appointed by President George Bush in 1991. "Consumers have been financing a lot of their purchases with credit, especially credit cards. More recently, banks appear to be switching more to home equity-type loans -- they want more collateral."
Although consumer-debt delinquencies have been rising, employment and consumer confidence remain strong, and many consumers feel financially secure in part because of the rapid increase of any investments they have in the stock market, she said.
But even if high levels of consumer debt do not become a big problem, they are likely to put a crimp into spending plans by limiting the amount of additional debt people can afford to take on, she said.
"Probably all they can do is continue to spend at their income level," Ms. Phillips said.

Edward W. Kelley Jr.
Mr. Kelley, who has served as a Fed governor since 1987, said it was unclear to him whether the current, benign economic conditions indicated a fundamental change in the way the economy works or whether the continuing expansion, now almost six years old, is just part of an extended business cycle.
"I have no notion whatsoever that the business cycle has been extinguished," he said in an interview. "Tempered? That's a more interesting question. We had a long expansion through the 1980's. Then we had a rather brief and not very severe recession that might not even have happened without the gulf war interlude. Now we're into another long expansion.
"You could say this country has been in an expansion with only a brief hiatus since 1982. There is a strength and a vitality in this economy that is not immediately apparent in the statistics."

HEADLINE: Health Care Costs Edging Up And a Bigger Surge Is Feared

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Medical costs, which have risen less than inflation for the last three years, are beginning to inch ahead and may be poised for a sharp rise, especially for small businesses, according to employers, actuaries and industry consultants.
Employers across the country said their health care costs were headed for a 4 percent increase this year, according to a survey released yesterday. And some health care experts project 5 to 10 percent growth in medical costs in 1998. 
 Prices are under growing pressure as managed care companies strive to make up for the thin profits they tolerated while holding down prices and pushing for new members.
And the underlying forces that drove up health care costs in the 1980's are still powerful: the aging population, compounded now by middle-aged baby boomers who require more medical services; more expensive medical technology like bone marrow transplants to help cancer patients, and new drug combinations, like those for AIDS that can cost $12,000 a year.
Costs might also rise fractionally from new Federal and state laws that prohibit some cost-cutting efforts, such as insurers' limiting of hospital stays after childbirth.
Hospitals and doctors in some cities, meanwhile, have increased their ability to demand higher fees by forming alliances and merging into bigger entities.
Higher prices are expected to fall especially heavily on private employers as the Government squeezes Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors and health maintenance organizations. Many H.M.O.'s have been getting relatively generous Medicare fees, which make it easier to offer low prices to employers and workers in the private sector.
Employers predicted that their medical costs would grow by 4 percent in 1997, a jump from the 2.5 percent average rise last year, according to a survey of 3,200 employers with 10 or more workers published yesterday by the Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm.
The combined annual premiums paid by employers and employees averaged $3,915 an employee in 1996, compared with $3,821 in 1995 and $3,741 in 1994, which was the only recent year when premiums fell (by 1.1 percent), the Higgins survey said.
The Labor Department said consumers' medical costs rose 3 percent last year while the overall Consumer Price Index was up 3.3 percent.
Aetna Inc., for example, one of the biggest health insurance companies, said its premiums were 3 percent to 6 percent higher than last year in managed care plans and up to 10 percent higher for traditional fee-for-service insurance. Premiums had been flat during 1996 at both Aetna and its U.S. Healthcare unit.
Some who track medical costs say the increases, which are already reflected in managed care premiums in some regions, may surge in 1998 as a number of inflationary trends come together. "With the changes in Medicare, we might see a return to double-digit health care inflation in 1998," said John Erb, a principal at Foster Higgins and the chief analyst for the survey.
Peter Reilly, an actuary with Milliman & Robertson, another benefits consulting firm, said his calculations projected increases of 3 to 5 percent this year and 5 to 8 percent in 1998.
"Everything we hear is that prices are beginning to tick up again to high single digits and even double digits," said Rob Fowler, executive director of the Council of Smaller Enterprises, a coalition of 12,500 employers in northeastern Ohio.
Beverly Sloan, executive director of health benefits at U S West, the Denver-based telecommunications company, said the company's health costs rose 5 percent in 1996, after three years of increases of 2 percent or less.
"Medicare is the 800-pound gorilla," she said. If the Government clamps down on Medicare to reduce Federal spending, that will increase the pressure on insurers and health care providers to raise charges to private employers, she said.
Trying to fend off that possibility, U S West, like many big companies, is requiring its health plans to offer three-year contracts.
Bob Dankmyer, a vice president of Marriott International, said his company was demanding "multiyear rate guarantees" that would limit increases to the growth in the Consumer Price Index.
"If you are big and strong and a good negotiator, you pay less," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at the Sanford C. Bernstein & Company securities firm.
But small employers may not be able to stop the H.M.O.'s and providers of health care from "slam-dunking the private sector," as Ms. Sloan put it. BB Graphics, a printing company with seven employees in Merrillville, Ind., had a 25 percent rise in its costs last year and expects a further 7 percent increase in May, said William Stack, the owner.
Stuart Altman, a health policy professor at Brandeis University, said, "We haven't broken the cycle of people wanting more health care." As evidence, he pointed to the popularity of health plans that still allow members to select physicians and influence their own care.
"Most managed care companies have done a decent job of getting discounts from providers," he said, "but they have not fundamentally changed the practice of medicine. With managed care, health care costs are going up more slowly, but they are still going up."
Mr. Fowler of the Ohio coalition said, "We may have squeezed out all that we can through managed care."
And Mr. Abramowitz said: "The pendulum is swinging. The news media tell you to consume more health care. You have your rights to the drugs and doctors you need. Drug companies are advertising direct to the consumer and hospitals are marketing themselves." All the pressure to consume adds to costs, he said.
In New York State, higher hospital charges following rate deregulation may add 2 percent to costs in 1997, for a total increase of 6 percent, said David Snow, an executive vice president with Oxford Health Plans. Paul Philpott, a senior vice president of Physicians Health Services, said deregulation might raise premiums beyond 6 percent in New York.
Professor Altman of Brandeis said the return of medical inflation would reflect "the old insurance cycle: they overestimate their ability to control costs and lose money for a couple of years, then they make it up by raising their premiums."
Mr. Reilly of Milliman & Robertson said insurance companies and H.M.O.'s "don't forecast the future growth of costs very well."
"They look at their past experience," he said. "It's like they were driving a car with their eyes on the rearview mirror."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION
<HEADLINE>Transcript of President Clinton's Second Inaugural Address to the Nation

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the inaugural address that President Clinton delivered today:
My fellow citizens: 
 At this last Presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century. It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only on the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs, a moment that will define our course and our character for decades to come. We must keep our old democracy forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.
The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal. It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the Union and abolished the scourge of slavery.
Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American century.
What a century it has been! America became the world's mightiest industrial power, saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war, and time and again reached across the globe to millions who longed for the blessings of liberty.
Along the way, Americans produced the great middle class and security in old age, built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all, split the atom and explored the heavens, invented the computer and the microchip, and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African-Americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.
Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose. We began the 19th century with a choice to spread our nation from coast to coast. We began the 20th century with a choice to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation and human decency. Those choices made all the difference.
At the dawn of the 21st century, a free people must choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society to unleash the limitless potential of all our people and form a more perfect Union.
When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today. We vowed then to set a clear course, to renew our nation.
In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.
Once again, our economy is the strongest on earth.
Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment. Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer, and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.
And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government. Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We, the American people, we are the solution. Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams.
As times change, so government must change. We need a new government for a new century, a government humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves, a government that is smaller, lives within its means and does more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests around the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less. The pre-eminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity -- not a guarantee, but a real opportunity -- to build better lives.
Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our Union depends upon responsible citizenship.
And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century. There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read, hiring people off welfare rolls, coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime, taking time out from our own lives to serve others.
Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our nation.
Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.
The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future: Will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny -- or not? Will we all come together, or come apart?
The divide of race has been America's constant curse. Each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction, are no different. They have nearly destroyed us in the past. They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror. They torment the lives of millions in fractured nations around the world.
These obsessions cripple both those who are hated and, of course, those who hate, robbing both of what they might become.
We cannot -- we will not -- succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul, everywhere. We shall overcome them, and we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.
Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a godsend in the 21st century. Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.
As this new era approaches, we can already see its broad outlines. Ten years ago the Internet was the mystical province of physicists. Today it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren. Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.
The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries. Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.
My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, "Can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy?" To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding yes.
This is the heart of our task. With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey. The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.
In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession. Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy. And the doors of higher education will be open to all.
The knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just to the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child. Parents and children will have time not only to work but to read and play together. And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.
Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who can work will work, with today's permanent underclass part of tomorrow's growing middle class.
New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now but the children and hard-working families too long denied. We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction. Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.
Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations, a nation that balances its budget but never loses the balance of its values; a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time; a nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air and majestic land.
And in this land of new promise we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interest, regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.
Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens. Prosperity and power -- yes, they are important, and we must maintain them. But let us never forget, the greatest progress we have made and the greatest progress we have yet to make is in the human heart. In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.
Thirty-four years ago the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there at the other end of this Mall in words that moved the conscience of a nation. Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart.
Martin Luther King's dream was the American dream. His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed.
Our history has been built on such dreams and labors, and by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century. To that effort, I pledge all my strength and every power of my office.
I ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another. Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they call all of us instead to be repairers of the breach and to move on with America's mission. America demands and deserves big things from us, and nothing big ever came from being small.
Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin when facing the end of his own life. He said, "It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division."
Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time, for all of us are on that same journey of our lives. And our journey too will come to an end, but the journey of our America must go on.
And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare. The demands of our time are great, and they are different. Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful, happy heart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history.
Yes, let us build our bridge, a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise. May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American dream alive for all her children, with the American promise of a more perfect Union a reality for all her people, with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world.
From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth. May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead, and always, always bless our America.

HEADLINE: Stores Hail First Two Days Without Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Encouraged by the combination of fat clearance racks and a one-week suspension of the sales tax on clothing, shoppers went to New York stores in droves over the weekend, giving many merchants 20 percent to 250 percent sales increases over the same period last year, retailers said yesterday.
At a J. C. Penney store on Staten Island, they came for frilly Holy Communion dresses. In Albany, they loaded up on warm hats. And all over New York City, shopping bags full of everything from cashmere to clogs dotted the streets as New Yorkers, who pride themselves on never paying full price, braved bitter winds to save a few dollars. 
 "I expected a huge increase, but I didn't expect it to be as good as it was," said Greg Cabral, the store manager of Today's Man in Chelsea, who said that sales were up 250 percent compared with the third weekend of last January. "They were buying big-ticket items. Suits, sports coats, you name it."
Sales were also up 80 percent versus the weekend before the sale began, he said, which suggests that customers may have deliberately delayed their shopping to take advantage of the tax moratorium.
Saturday was the start of the week-long tax exemption on clothing and accessories instituted by the State Legislature and the city of New York. The state and city both agreed to drop their respective 4 percent retail sales taxes on apparel costing less than $500 as part of an experiment to see whether shoppers would drop their habit of going to New Jersey and other nearby areas where retail tax is lower or nonexistent.
All but 8 of New York's 62 counties chose to match the state's tax exemption, and in New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax, which is one-quarter of 1 percent, was waived as well.
To be sure, the tasty sales figures have more in them than a tax break. The middle of January tends to be a high-clearance month for retailers, as they slash prices to get rid of winter merchandise. And last year at this time, the New York region was hammered with snow and rain, which discouraged shopping.
Economists have warned that a single week is not long enough to generate a true cost-benefit analysis of the tax break, particularly when shoppers have simply shifted their spending from one weekend to the next. Officials expected the city to lose $7 million in revenues for the week, and the state closer to $10 million to $20 million.
Estimates of the losses in tax revenue for the weekend were not available yesterday. But advocates for a permanent sales-tax cut, which is supported by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has already included one in his 1997 budget, were joyous. "The early indications suggest that this is a resounding success," said Ted Potrikus, vice president of public affairs for the Retail Council of New York State, a trade group. "If the intent was to attract shoppers, it worked."
At Cashmere Cashmere, a store selling just that on Madison Avenue, sales were up about 40 percent from the previous weekend, the store manager, Nilda Ruiz, said, and the shop was full again yesterday as many shoppers took advantage of the Martin Luther King Birthday holiday to empty their wallets for something warm. "There are so many people in here," Ms. Ruiz said, "I haven't even had time to finish my cup of coffee."
In Staten Island, where retailers have moaned the loudest about losing business to New Jersey, merchants were gleeful yesterday.
"It was awesome-wonderful-incredible," said Bill Praschil, the general manager of the Sears store there. Mr. Praschil said that his business had "tripled" over the same period last year, and was double what it had been the previous weekend. Particularly strong areas in the store, he said, were men's clothing, footwear and anything warm.
"We were up 150 percent on Saturday and 154 percent on Sunday," said Joseph Bruno, the store manager for the Staten Island J. C. Penney, comparing sales to those of last year. Sales at the store were up 105 percent over the previous Sunday, and gained 63 percent over the previous Saturday.
"All the stores in Long Island and New York were up over 100 percent," Mr. Bruno said, scrolling down his computer screen, adding that sales at J. C. Penneys in New Jersey did not keep pace. "The guys over the river had more like 20 percent increases."
"All the tollbooths were open on Sunday on the Goethals Bridge," he said. "I knew right then and there things went great." On an average Sunday, he said, lines of cars returning from shopping trips to New Jersey form at the tollbooths.
New Jersey retailers, many of whom ran big promotions of their own, have said that they are unconcerned about one little week of New York tax breaks, given that they offer them all year.
"This weekend we were very busy," said Janet Roller, the marketing director for the Mall at Short Hills. "Honestly, the people who shop here shop for the mix. I'm sure the tax situation helps, but you can't find this mix of stores under one roof anywhere else in the world."
Neiman Marcus, which has three stores in the New York area, said that its New Jersey stores felt no pain.
"Westchester benefited," said Jodie Corley, a spokeswoman for the company, which is based in Dallas. "But in New Jersey, we did not feel a negative impact at all. They had a great weekend."
Of course, retailers tend to use the weather as an explanation for why sales are great or terrible, depending on their meteorological viewpoint on that particular day. Last weekend was no exception.
Michael Gould, the chief executive of Bloomingdale's, said that the cold weather actually stimulated sales of gloves, hats and the like. But at Cashmere Cashmere, Ms. Ruiz said that she knew her strong sales were owing to the tax break, because cold weather keeps people out of her stores.
Clearly, there was some confusion caused by the short tax holiday. At a Kmart store in lower Manhattan, a woman buying little black boots had to convince a sales clerk that footwear was indeed tax exempt. The same sales clerk rang up the next shopper's socks and included tax. At the Staten Island Sears, sales clerks puzzled out what they should do with return items that were sold with tax included.
Cities that did not match the state tax break did less well, Mr. Potrikus of the Retail Council said, which he said underscored that shoppers would flock to surrounding counties the same way they usually go to New Jersey to get lower prices.
"The loss of sales tax, plus the low prices, plus the cold worked together," he said. "Now, we have to figure out what to do from here."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Goes After a Russian Religion: Vodka

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 20

 BODY:
She may not look the part, but Tamara Chernyshkova recently became one of Russia's most wanted criminals. Feeble, aged and practically blind, she is nonetheless a foot soldier in this country's most profitable illegal enterprise.
Mrs. Chernyshkova peddles bootleg vodka. Stationed outside one of this city's most heavily used subway stops, the 63-year-old former schoolteacher sells up to 100 bottles of homemade liquor each day to a clientele that would gladly buy more. 
 "I have never gone home with extra bottles," she explained as she burrowed in an old green sack for a sample of her wares. "But now the cops are after us and the bribes are getting hard to pay. Yeltsin thinks he's going to solve Russia's problems by putting us out of business. Let him try."
Desperate to wipe out Russia's $3 billion debt to its own labor force, President Boris N. Yeltsin has decided to double taxes on vodka to the equivalent of $7 a liter, to restore the state monopoly on the production and sale of the liquor, and to rein in the counterfeiters and smugglers who now account for an astonishing 70 percent of Russia's gargantuan market.
Mr. Yeltsin loves a challenge, but this may be one of his biggest. Russians don't just drink vodka, they worship it. There is no better way to judge the chaos of Russia's unruly marketplace, the porousness of its borders, the failures of its tax system, or -- most important of all -- the bleak health of its citizens, than by looking at vodka consumption.
"This bacchanalia must stop," said Anatoly B. Chubais, Mr. Yeltsin's chief of staff, who is widely assumed to have been responsible for Mr. Yeltsin's decree. "It is a political decision. We have no other choice."
That may be true, but it is hard to imagine any task more futile for a Russian leader than coming between its people and their ubiquitous drink. On advice from Lenin (one of the few teetotaling Russian leaders), Stalin thought seriously for a while about limiting vodka sales. He quickly came to his senses. When the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, made a major effort to curb drinking in 1985, he was ridiculed as Mr. Mineral Water. To most of the world, Dmitri Mendeleyev is known as the great chemist who devised the periodic table of elements. Here, he is at least as well-known -- and far more fondly -- as the Russian who first realized that 40 percent is the best proportion of alcohol for vodka.
"This country is insane from that drink," said Galina B. Tkachenko, who is in charge of the Health Ministry's uphill effort to teach people about the dangers of alcohol. "I don't even think it's worth trying to show people over 30 what vodka is doing to them. We are mostly just trying to stop the children before they start."
In 1995, according to Health Ministry statistics, an average of 4.1 gallons of spirits were consumed by each Russian citizen, a count that includes infants and those too ill to drink at all. No country drinks more hard liquor, and it shows. Reported cases of alcohol poisoning, long an epidemic that has cut horribly into productivity, health and harmony, rose by more than 25 percent in the last year, according to the Government.
Alcohol abuse is a direct cause of what demographers and politicians regard as potentially the greatest threat facing Russia: its sharp and continuing drop in life expectancy. According to the Center for Alcohol Policy, an advocacy group here, half of adult men and nearly a third of the women suffer some physical consequences of long-term drinking. The group estimates that half of all deaths in the nation can be attributed at least partly to alcohol.
Other health researchers decline to speculate, noting that alcohol abuse is only one reason -- dietary habits, smoking, living conditions, the environment, and stress are others -- that the Russian death rate is higher than in any other industrial country.
"We don't feel comfortable throwing around hard figures," said Dr. Tkachenko, "because these things are very hard to separate. But anyone with eyes can see that drinking has for many years ruined our health and ruined our economy."
The Yeltsin Administration seems to be focusing on the financial part of this equation. In Mr. Yeltsin's tough talk about cracking down on vodka makers, health was never mentioned. There has been no talk of cutting production, only of the Government getting its fair share of taxes.
Nothing has greater potential to supply a quick fix for Russia's tax mess. The measures suggested by Mr. Yeltsin would bring in at least $350 million a month.
No matter what the shape of Russia's economy, vodka here has always been a big part of it. In 1900, its sale accounted for 50 percent of revenues for the Czar's government. By 1988 the figure had fallen to 35 percent of the Soviet budget. But today, vodka generates less than 5 percent of revenues.
Like most other branches of Russian industry, vodka distilleries were unable to react to the pressures of a free market. Famous brand names like Stolichnaya and Smirnov could not compete and were quickly trapped in battles over their valuable names (Smirnov is fighting Smirnoff, an American make) as smugglers and bootleggers stepped in to meet the nation's insatiable demands.
With people like Mrs. Chernyshkova selling millions of bottles of vodka every day at kiosks, train stations and street corners, usually for less than $2 each, the warehouses where vodka is produced illegally are working overtime. Bootleggers get two or three deliveries a day, and get to keep about a dime for every bottle they sell. Five hundred bottles a week translates into $200 a month for the seller, twice as much as the average industrial wage.
"We are well aware that vodka can be a cash cow," said Levon S. Marutyan, director of the Dolgoprudny Integrated Works, one of 85 vodka distilleries officially sanctioned in the Moscow region. "But we are nearly bankrupt. We are trying to make a quality product with the right ingredients. We are willing to pay taxes of course. But how can we compete if thousands of people with stills and oak buckets can turn out something they call vodka, put it into a bottle and sell it on any street corner?"
He can't, as a quick visit to any of Moscow's outdoor markets will show. At Davydkovo, one such market, there are dozens of kiosks selling vodka by the crate. There is pepper vodka, honey vodka and vodka with every type of fruit mixed in. There is vodka in plastic cups, ram's horns and soccer balls. Most of all, there is just plain vodka by the truckload.
"I'm getting married," said a man from Voronezh, in southern Russia, as he dragged a pallet with 200 bottles he just bought for $250 across a snow-covered lot. "You can't beat the prices."
Much of the pure alcohol in Russia today is smuggled in from Belarus and Ukraine, where border crossings are not closely monitored. It is then diluted with water and bottled here. In Russia's western Kaliningrad enclave, a free trade zone, customs officials seized more than 25 tons of pure alcohol from Europe in December alone.
"This is a true crisis for Russia," said Anatoly K. Kravchenko, the chief of the state office on production and sale of spirits. It is Mr. Kravchenko's job to regulate the struggling industry. And as he sat one recent day with five types of vodka lined up in shot glasses for a visitor to sample, he admitted that this battle would be a tough one.
"This is our national product," he said, glumly. "Can you imagine Japan struggling to produce its own rice, or France its own wine? We are fighting for our identity."

HEADLINE: The Politics of Reconciliation

 BODY:
Inaugural addresses often evoke a sense of triumph and a vision of battles to come. For lovers of such sailing rhetoric, President Clinton's address yesterday was distinctly earthbound. But it was also notable for its ennobling appeal to conciliation and what he called "a new spirit of community for a new century." The overarching theme of the entire ceremony, in fact, was of racial healing, drawing from the celebration the same day of the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday. The selection of speakers such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson at a morning prayer service and a series of inclusive religious and musical events during the day were especially appropriate for the swearing in of Mr. Clinton and another Southerner, Vice President Gore. Dr. King's message was that Southern politicians could one day become the healers rather than promoters of what Mr. Clinton called the "constant curse" of racism in American history.
Looking beyond race, Mr. Clinton appealed for an end to partisan squabbling in Congress. That was exactly the right sentiment at a time when, paradoxically, the nation's unusual run of economic prosperity has been accompanied by rising bitterness and resentment, cutting across racial, cultural and political lines. 
 But there was also an element of strategy in Mr. Clinton's plea, which came after a week in which he called for a resolution to House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethics case, and awarded a Medal of Freedom to Senator Bob Dole. His actions challenged Mr. Gingrich and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to join his crusade against "petty bickering" or emerge as defenders of gridlock.
For government to work, of course, it needs to regain the people's trust. The President's only reference to the scandals of the last year came when he looked toward a time when "the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interest." These were perfunctory words in view of the public hunger for cleaner politics.
To offset its more plodding passages, the speech contained a fine sense of history, as if the President were attempting to respond to some of the memorable phrases and moments of his predecessors. Sixteen years ago, for example, Ronald Reagan declared in his first Inaugural Address: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." Mr. Clinton updated that moment with a nice populist flourish when he said: "Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We, the American people, we are the solution." He was clearly savoring the consensus in the last election that government is something more than the enemy of Americans.
The President's appeals for racial harmony sprang in part from a central accomplishment of his first term. By tackling welfare and gun control and presiding over a decline in crime, he has eased the ugliness of race in American politics and restored the Democrats' authority on divisive issues. We continue to feel that the welfare law, if left as Mr. Clinton signed it, will hurt the poor. But if he keeps building on what he has done, he can carve a revitalized consensus in support of jobs and education for those on welfare.
Mr. Clinton waited until the end of his speech to mention his obligatory "bridge to the 21st century." More interesting was his invocation of other turns of the century in American history. The transition from the 18th to the 19th century brought a continent conquered and tamed. The transition to the 20th was more similar to what Americans face today. Rising economic inequality and ethnic diversity in the country led to the Progressive Era and the government activism that Mr. Clinton seeks to revive. History was a reminder, then, that for all the President's desire for harmony, it is government -- and in these next four years a mixture of Presidential determination and Congressional cooperation -- that will make his dream succeed or fail.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: VOICES;
Priorities for the Nation: Education and Housing

 BODY:
The New York Times asked a variety of political and public figures the following question: "If you could get the Democratic President and the Republican Congress to set aside their differences and get one thing done, what would it be?"
Here are some of their answers: 

 
Robert A. Caro
Author of biographies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Robert Moses
The one thing is education. That looms over everything else. Lyndon Johnson said that "if there isn't anything in the Constitution on the subject of education, there ought to have been."
He, at least, made a Titanic effort to stamp education firmly onto the national agenda but for many reasons, Vietnam first among them, he did not achieve what he wanted. During the years since he left office, moreover, America has, decade by decade, failed dismally to educate its young people adequately for the modern world. There must be a determination by the President and Congress alike to raise both funding and standards.

The Rev. Edward A. Malloy
President of the University of Notre Dame
I would like to advocate the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for Washington, D.C., the capital city. I was born and raised in Washington. And although there have been some recent proposals, including an initiative from the White House, I think our country deserves a capital city that is well-run, attractive, and a model for the quality of urban life for the country.
If you've been to Paris and London and Rome, you know the capital cities of many European countries have special consideration and treatment, and become sort of icons for the representation of those countries. I think we have a reverse situation in our country.

Representative John Lewis
Georgia Democrat and a civil rights leader
More than anything else, in order to set the right tone and give the American people a greater sense of trust, faith and confidence in our political system, we must do something about campaign finance reform. By taking a great deal of money out of the political system, the elected officials in Washington, including those that run for President, the House and the Senate, I think we will spend more time taking care of the business of the people, rather than dialing for dollars.

John F. Smith Jr.
Chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation
What comes to my mind rather quickly would be to eliminate a lot of the government regulations that is nonvalue added to business and to the community at large, and hopefully we can do that. Democrats and Republicans should also work to eliminate the budget deficit.

Carol Steele
President of Friends of Cabrini Homes and housing project tenant
It would be to put more funds in public housing. They need to empower more residents to do resident management. Who knows more about what residents need than the residents themselves? If we can untangle the bureaucracy and make our own decisions and get (rid of) red tape for repairs, we can rehabilitate the homes better. We need more low-rise; they provide more of a home atmosphere. We need good security. With the welfare reform, people are going to need jobs to sustain themselves. The people in Washington need to be creative and come up with ideas for jobs.

Doris Kearns Goodwin
Wrote "No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt"
Most of all, we need fundamental and substantial campaign finance reform to reopen the political system to the ordinary citizen. As it stands now, money buys access to privilege and legislation.
I believe changing that system now should be the priority of the Congress and the President. All of the other issues which the nation needs to face, from the growing income disparity between rich and poor, from our racial divide, to our inadequate education and the devastation of our inner cities, cannot be dealt with without restructuring the political system so that it is not so dependent on and responsive to the privileged few.

Gov. Gary Locke
Elected in Washington as the first Chinese-American governor
I'd like them to work on increasing the economic security of working families so that they can meet their needs for better education, affordable health care and security and dignity for their elders. I see this as part of their economic and tax policies. Families want more education not just for their kids but for the parents, continuing education and job retraining. Families are very much concerned about the rising cost of health care and that a major illness could bankrupt them if they have no insurance.

Roberto C. Goizueta
Chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company
I was honored to address immigrants taking the oath of citizenship on Independence Day 1995. As a naturalized citizen myself, I encouraged them to work hard to prove the inherent superiority of a democratic society, the lasting stability of a democratic capitalistic system and to show the world that people can indeed be trusted with governing themselves.
President Clinton and the Congress have the opportunity on a world stage every day to prove the superiority of that democratic society and our capitalistic system. Abandon personal attack. Persuade your opponent, don't destroy him. Learn to listen and acknowledge. By doing so, you show the American people you have put the nation's interests ahead of your own personal interests and show by your own actions that self-government is the most effective form of government.

Dr. David Baltimore
Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
We need to start a massive program in infrastructure development, housing and transportation. It would require finding money that has not been made available for years, possibly by cutting the defense budget or using the lower estimate of inflation or raising taxes.
I firmly believe that the education of young people is the most important thing we can do to give them a place in the future economy and at the same time to insure the strength of the economy.
In communication, I'm thinking of things like shoring up the strength of the Internet so it doesn't get overloaded. We need to keep it publicly available rather than seeing it privatized.

Derek Bok
Teaches at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government
I would choose a campaign finance law with partial public funding, which would keep political parties and politicians from receiving private donations large enough to influence public policy. Although such a reform would not directly alleviate poverty, improve schools or preserve Social Security, it would help to address a remarkable number of weaknesses that hamper our ability to deal with such national problems.
Curbing the influence of private money in politics would lessen the disadvantages of the poor and other unorganized groups in defending their interests in Washington. Effective campaign finance rules would also ease some of the pressures that currently make legislative compromise so difficult and lead to ungainly laws that are hard to implement properly. Furthermore, such rules would reduce pressures to give undeserved tax breaks, subsidies, and other pork-barrel benefits which add to the government waste so distasteful to Americans. Finally, campaign finance reform would help relieve suspicion and cynicism toward government.

Gov. George W. Bush
Texas Republican
"A real balanced budget."

HEADLINE: Plutonium Had Been Removed from Vietnam

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The failed 1975 effort to retrieve a canister of plutonium from the Dalat nuclear reactor in the Central Highlands of Vietnam described in your Jan. 16 news article should have been unnecessary.
Years earlier, the nuclear material had been removed from South Vietnam, but was then returned, creating one of the most egregious misuses of the Atoms for Peace program. 
 About the time of the Tet offensive in 1968, I took my concerns about the Dalat reactor to the White House, where Hans Heymann, a Rand Corporation colleague on loan from the think tank, had been recruited to work on Vietnam problems. He set in motion a White House request to the Pentagon that it remove the nuclear fuel from Dalat.
That was done. The two Rand "culprits," myself included, then felt the full fury of the Atomic Energy Commission, which declared that removing the fuel was a damaging symbolic act, undermining the United States commitment to Vietnam.
The more important symbolism would have been a strong dedication to strict international controls over nuclear materials. But seeing otherwise, the commission directed that the nuclear fuel be returned to Vietnam in the midst of escalation of the war.
And so the radioactive materials sat at Dalat until the final Vietcong assault in 1975. Vietnamese officials say some of the plutonium is still there (news item, Jan. 19).
This episode raises questions as to whether Energy Department efforts to bring to light the hidden secrets of the nuclear era may still not reflect the complete stories and the lessons that might be drawn from them.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
NATO or Tomato?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Sometimes the news is in the noise and sometimes the news is in the silence. If you want to understand what's wrong with NATO expansion -- the new Clinton Administration's first major foreign-policy challenge -- then you should listen to the silence, the silence of Europeans on this subject. Don't get me wrong, the West Europeans support NATO expansion, but it's nothing they ever seem to talk much about or debate. They treat it as something America will take care of, something America will finesse with the Russians and something America will pay for.
And that's the news. The West European states are the ones supposedly most threatened by a resurgent Russia, which is right next door. They are the ones supposedly most in need of the East Europeans' joining NATO to create a buffer with Russia. And yet the members of the European Union seem about as interested in NATO expansion as they are in the Super Bowl. Why? Because the West Europeans think the real threat to them is not Russia, but Eastern Europe. 
 Yes, the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and others clamoring to join NATO are the ones who really scare the E.U. Because the E.U. members know that Russia is no threat to them now. What threatens them right now are all those new East European free-market democracies, whose factories and farmers want to export to Western Europe at prices that will undercut the West Europeans and whose workers all want to flock to Western Europe for jobs, which would drive down wages. Russian missiles and Russian tanks are a nebulous and distant danger to Western Europe. But Polish hams and Polish workers are a clear and present danger.
So NATO expansion is the bone E.U. members throw the East Europeans instead of letting them into the European common market, which is what the East Europeans really want and need. That's what would really bolster their democracies. For the West Europeans NATO expansion is the ideal way to block the East Europeans from becoming members of the E.U. -- without feeling guilty about it. As Prof. Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins deftly noted: "We are going to extend the NATO nuclear umbrella to the Eastern Europeans, so that the Western Europeans won't have to buy their tomatoes." It's like America telling Mexico it can join NATO but not Nafta.
The E.U. assumes the U.S. will just go along with this sham. But the E.U. should take note of some alarm bells that have just been rung here. The first came from Secretary of Defense William Perry, who began a farewell interview by remarking to me that the Russians are still not on board at all for NATO expansion.
"I believe it's going to be very difficult," said Mr. Perry. "The Russians, at all levels, are opposed to NATO enlargement. At all levels they are still nervous, suspicious and fearful of NATO." Mr. Perry said he still believed in NATO expansion and that the Russians must persuade their public that this poses no threat to them. But he also argued it was imperative that NATO forge a NATO-Russia charter that will provide a framework for involving Russia in some NATO decision-making and therefore calm Moscow's concerns. A NATO team was in Moscow Monday to explore such a charter.
But even if it succeeds, the Europeans should heed a second alarm from Senator Joseph Biden, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who says: "I have serious reservations about NATO expansion."
Mr. Biden explained that he did not object to NATO enlargement in principle; but he is not yet convinced it can be done without undermining U.S. arms-control treaties with Russia or the course of reform there, and even if it can, whether the benefits to the U.S. will be worth the price. He also wonders whether NATO actually is the best way to bolster democracy in East Europe. "If we are really going to alienate the Russians," he asks, "what are we going to get for it?"
None of this has been debated by the U.S. public or Congress, said Mr. Biden, and until it is, anyone who assumes Congress is on board for this is making a big mistake. As he put it: "Right now, if I stand up and start talking with my constituents about the price, if I tell them 'We are about to extend our nuclear umbrella to Slovakia,' I wonder how many people in Dagsboro, Del., are going to say, 'Hey, that's a great idea.' "

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases Against the Yen On Mixed Signals From Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened slightly against the yen yesterday on remarks by a Japanese official about the yen's value, but ended higher against some other key currencies.
A cut in Italian interest rates, fresh evidence of economic weakness in Germany and a generally upbeat assessment of the American economy by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped underpin the dollar. 
 The American currency has been rallying fairly steadily for a few weeks and is trading near 46-month highs against the yen and two-and-a- half-year highs against the German mark and the Swiss franc. Continuing weakness in Japan and in much of Europe has also lent strength against those nations' currencies.
"The dollar is clearly in demand," said John Hazelton, chief currency trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York. "We've certainly been going one way for a long time. There's no reason to think it won't continue, though it will stop and start as people take some profits."
Yesterday, the dollar touched an intraday high of 118.28 yen in Asian trading, and settled in New York at 117.94 yen, down from 118.06 on Monday. The dollar fetched 1.6286 marks, up from 1.6264. But the British pound rose to $1.6628, from $1.6622.
Early in the day, Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said at a news conference that he thought the yen was too weak, pushing down the dollar for a time. It began to recover when the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William J. McDonough, who had just conferred with Mr. Mitsuzuka in Tokyo, said a strong dollar was in the United States' interest.
The dollar derived some strength against the mark from a report by the Ifo Institute for economic research in Munich that business confidence in western Germany fell in December for the second month.
The report provided further evidence that Germany's recovery was faltering, suggesting in turn that the Bundesbank might lower interest rates, perhaps as early as tomorrow.
The dollar was also helped by a three-quarters of a point cut in the Italian discount rate, to 6.75 percent, amid subdued inflation. The move was seen as part of a trend toward lower European interest rates.

Character Issue R.I.P.

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
As Bill Clinton sailed into his second term so tranquilly that his Inaugural Address all but invited the nation to join him in a cozy nap, he made Houdini look like an amateur. Despite Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Paula Jones and campaign-finance shenanigans with a shady cast large enough to populate a new Coppola epic, he took the oath of office not in manacles but with an approval rating rivaling Ronald Reagan's.
How does the President escape hit after hit on what can now be referred to nostalgically as "the character issue"? As with speculative explanations of Houdini's illusions, the answer keeps changing. 
 During the campaign, when polls showed that Mr. Clinton was popular despite his character shortcomings, conventional wisdom had it that the American public was so cynical, so selfishly preoccupied with its own burgeoning economic prosperity, that it had no character itself and didn't care about ethics and morals.
Once the election was over, Mr. Clinton's defeated opponents offered a new explanation: The President had triumphed because his scandals were hidden from the public by the liberally biased mainstream media, which dismissed Paula Jones and underplayed Whitewater to get its pet re-elected. Even if this theory were true, however, it hardly can be said to apply now, after the Jones case has ensnared the Supreme Court. Yet not even Ms. Jones's prominence in late-night TV monologues or on Newsweek's cover has derailed Mr. Clinton's approval ratings.
A new explanation is thus needed, and this week it has come from David Brock, the right-wing journalistic assassin best known for branding Anita Hill as "a bit nutty, and a bit slutty." Writing in The Weekly Standard, Mr. Brock signs on to a theory that some of us have been postulating for three years: scandal overkill by Mr. Clinton's most rabid opponents. "The case against the character and ethics of President Clinton," he writes, has been "undermined and trivialized" by "indiscriminate and sometimes patently absurd allegations that delegitimize and discredit more serious charges."
Mr. Brock names the names of betrayers of the anti-Clinton cause. Hilton Kramer of The New York Post is ridiculed for promoting the "wild claim" that Mr. Clinton's refusal to release his medical records had a connection to what Paula Jones called his "distinguishing characteristic." ("Was this what the conservative case against Clinton had boiled down to -- talk about the President's private parts?" asks Mr. Brock contemptuously.) Also indicted are Reed Irvine's Accuracy in Media, for spreading "outlandish claims about the circumstances of Vincent Foster's death," and the Wall Street Journal editorial page, for promoting Gary Aldrich's rumor-stuffed book "Unlimited Access."
It's hard to dispute Mr. Brock's case that the "exaggeration, overstatement and outright dissimulation about the Clintons," complete with Byzantine conspiratorial subplots involving drug-running schemes and unsolved murders in deepest Arkansas, have backfired. The Clinton-haters' most lurid hyperbole may have tainted genuine stories to the point where the public lumps them all together as shrill partisan sniping and tunes them out. Where Mr. Brock is less forthcoming is in downplaying the size of his own role in creating the very syndrome he now decries: he's the founding father of private-parts political journalism. It was his wildly prurient piece for The American Spectator about Troopergate, which even took Mrs. Clinton to task for allegedly using state troopers "to fetch feminine napkins," that helped undermine the Paula Jones story the first time around. For him now to lecture others about abject scandalmongering is akin to a drug lord imploring junkies to "just say no."
But in Washington, opportunism can be its own reward. In only a few months Mr. Brock has morphed from scourge of the Clintons to Hillary Clinton defender (in a bizarre book published last fall) to moderate critic of the same right-wing journalists who invented him. What's next -- a Sunday morning talk show? You know Bill Clinton has triumphed over his tormentors when the most savage of them has repackaged himself with an audacity that is positively Clintonesque.

HEADLINE: The Ballplayer Who Opened the Door

 BODY:
The 1969 letter from the outfielder Curt Flood to Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was plain but powerful. "Dear Mr. Kuhn," it began. "After twelve years in the major leagues, I do not feel that I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes. I believe that any system that produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen."
What Flood was complaining about was a form of economic servitude shaped by organized baseball's reserve clause, which kept players tied to the same team forever unless they were traded or sold. The system prevented players from marketing their talents to the highest bidder. 
 Flood was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1969 after a distinguished career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He refused to report and asked Kuhn for permission to bargain with other clubs. The commissioner turned him down, so Flood filed a lawsuit charging that baseball was a monopoly and that its reserve clause violated the antitrust law.
Although Flood lost his case in the Supreme Court in 1972, he had put the issue into play. In 1975 an arbitrator ruled that a player was bound only for the length of his contract, and granted free agency to two pitchers, Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally. When that ruling was upheld in Federal court, the owners abandoned the fight.
Flood never made a dime from his courage. He left baseball for a year and his skills eroded. But by the time he died on Monday, at age 59, he had earned the gratitude of an entire generation of players who have profited hugely from the freedoms that he made possible.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Boeing eliminates a program, and its investors are happy.

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher 

 BODY:
SHARES in the Boeing Company rose sharply yesterday after the company decided not to proceed with a multibillion-dollar plan to develop two larger, longer-range versions of its 747 jetliner.
The decision, which Boeing announced on Monday night, appears to concede the high end of the airline market to Boeing's archrival, the Airbus Industrie consortium of Europe. Airbus yesterday reconfirmed its intent to proceed with a new 500-seat super jumbo jet. 
 But analysts said they doubted that Boeing was really conceding anything. If Boeing found no ready market for a super jumbo, then Airbus will not be able to sell its still-larger proposed aircraft in sufficient numbers to justify the cost of its development, they said. Should a market develop, Boeing could always restart the "stretch 747" program in less time than Airbus can develop an entirely new airplane.
In the meantime, Boeing will reap considerable cost savings. Estimates of the research and development cost for the stretch 747 ran from $4 billion to $7 billion. Scrapping the program should translate to added per-share earnings of $1.50 between 1997 and 2000, said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with NatWest Securities. Boeing shares, which rose $7.375, to $113.875, yesterday, could reach $125 within three to six months and $150 within 12 to 18 months, he said, reaffirming an aggressive "buy" rating on the stock.
With the program's demise, "you lose the biggest remaining uncertainty regarding this stock," Mr. Heymann said. "You make this money available to enhance shareholder value in other ways."
Boeing has said that it will proceed with development of the 767-400 ERX, a larger, longer-range version of its midsize jet, and with more variants of the 777, a new wide-body that is sized between the 767 and the 747. The company is also developing a "digitized" version of the 747, which will incorporate the avionics display developed by Honeywell Inc. for the 777 cockpit. A Boeing spokesman said that these programs would make use of the personnel and manufacturing capacity gained through the proposed acquisition of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Mr. Heymann said that Boeing's 250- to 400-seat models better served today's market than a new super jumbo would. Increasingly, airlines are fragmenting their service, with more direct routes between smaller cities in the United States and abroad, rather than connecting services through hubs like London and Tokyo. These flights do not require the capacity of a 747 and are more economically served with a smaller airplane, he said.
On some level, the announcements out of Boeing and Airbus amount to a game of chicken. By announcing plans for a bigger 747 before it had any customers locked up, Boeing pushed Airbus to announce a larger plane, too. Now, by dropping its effort, just as Airbus has announced plans to reorganize as a single company from its current status as a consortium of several European concerns, Boeing may gain breathing room.
"Airbus is preoccupied with its restructuring and is talking a 2003 delivery" for the proposed new jet, said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities. Because Singapore Airlines and British Airways, two major potential customers, said they would not decide to buy such jets without seeing both competing designs, it makes no sense for Boeing to commit to a design now, he said. "Two years from now they may be able to see more clearly," he said.
Though today's fragmented route structure argues for more midsize jets than jumbos, the market could still evolve for a larger plane, Mr. Demisch said. And though investors were cheered by the near-term cost savings from killing the program, Boeing has yet to say what it will do with that cash, Mr. Demisch said.
The elimination of the stretch 747 "does leave a window open for Airbus. Clearly one reason Boeing had hoped to get this airplane off the ground was to lock up the high end of the market for another 20 years," Mr. Demisch said. "There is going to be a real dog fight for the large-airplane market some time in the next decade," he said.

HEADLINE: Scholars Attack Public School TV Program

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
In separate research, professors from Vassar and Johns Hopkins sharply attack Channel One, the 12-minute television program seen daily by an estimated eight million public school students in the United States, as an advertising vehicle loaded with superficial, biased and sometimes hurtful programming.
"It's real function is not journalistic but commercial," Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at Johns Hopkins University, said in a paper entitled "How to Be Stupid: The Teachings of Channel One." 
 "It is meant primarily to get us ready for the ads," he writes. "It must keep itself from saying anything too powerful or even interesting, must never cut too deep or raise any really troubling questions, because it cannot ever be permitted to detract in any way from the commercials."
Working independently, Professor Miller and a Vassar College sociologist, William Hoynes, did two studies coordinated by the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a liberal media watchdog group based in New York City. They analyzed videotapes of 36 shows distributed in 1995 and 1996. These programs, they said, contained a total of 91 news stories and 177 on-camera sources.
In response to the studies, a company spokeswoman, Claudia Peters, said the findings were irrelevant, given the program's popularity.
"Channel One," she said, "has been evaluated and reviewed by educators in 12,000 schools nationwide and renewed at a rate of 99 percent. A recent study by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan found that 93 percent of all teachers would recommend Channel One to other schools and teachers."
Noting that some members of the Public Broadcasting System carry some Channel One programming, she said, "The fact that Channel One news coverage of Rwaanda, Bosnia and Tibet is available on PBS stations nationwide speaks for itself." Ms. Peters also noted that Channel One has received more than 100 education and journalism awards, including the George Foster Peabody Award in broadcasting.
Ever since 1990, when Whittle Communications introduced Channel One into middle and high schools, the daily programs, which include two minutes of advertising, have aroused controversy over the role of commercial television in the classroom. Only one state, New York, bans Channel One from its public schools.
Channel One, which was purchased in 1994 for $250 million by K-III Communications, provides its program to more than 12,000 schools in the United States. The audience is believed to include more than 40 percent of the nation's teen-agers.
While critics accuse Channel One of exploiting students for profit, supporters maintain that the advertising is a small price to pay for bringing a lively discussion of current events into the schools.
The study on the content of Channel One's news programming finds that only 20 percent of its air time is spent on coverage of "recent political, economic, social and cultural stories." The other 80 percent is advertising, sports, weather and natural disasters.
Professor Hoynes, the Vassar sociologist, said in his report that even what passes for news on Channel One -- oversimplified political stories, the promotion of Channel One personalities and frivolous contests -- must not be taken at face value.
"It is dubious whether such news provides educational or civic benefits to either students or educators at schools that receive Channel One," his report said. "Instead of taking the news quality of Channel One for granted, this research suggests that we need to systematically study Channel One programming to determine the nature of this news."
Professor Miller said the program is objectionable also because its commercials teach children "that you can and should surrender to your craving right away."
Such criticism of Channel One was challenged by Jeffrey Cole, director of the U.C.L.A. Center for Communication Policy.
"The Channel One news programming is quite sound," he said. "They have higher standards for advertising in that they won't take ads for beer, liquor and X-rated movies. The news they give you is a whole lot better than what you get on most local television news programs."
Especially controversial is the fact that nearly all the students in subscribing schools cannot avoid watching the programs. And unlike textbooks, the programs have not been previously reviewed by the faculty.
In exchange for providing the program, 19-inch television sets for each classroom, two VCR's, wiring and a satellite link, the Channel One contract requires each school to show programs every school day.
Longtime critics of Channel One, like the Center for Commercial-Free Public Education, were quick to embrace the reports. The group's executive director, Marianne Manilov, said of Channel One: "They will tell you that the students don't have to watch, but in practice they can't opt out. Channel One is promoted as an educational tool, but I would question its value."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Is Upbeat On Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an upbeat assessment of the economy today, saying that after nearly six years of uninterrupted growth it had retained "considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions."
But living up to his reputation as ever-vigilant for trouble ahead, Mr. Greenspan said that a long period in which relatively small wage increases had helped to hold down inflation "may already be running its course." 
 His comments helped start a rally in the financial markets, which saw his statements as evidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 4. After falling more than 40 points early in the day before Mr. Greenspan spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded and finished the day up 40.03 points to close at 6,883.90, another record.
Mr. Greenspan also appeared to be dropping a broad hint that the central bank saw a strong possibility of larger wage increases starting to fuel rising prices later in the year, and that the Federal Reserve was determined to squelch that.
In wide-ranging testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan also made these points:
*He said his comments in a speech last month about "irrational exuberance" in the financial markets, which set off a brief but sharp decline in stock prices, were not a "shot from the hip," but were intended to raise an important question about how to factor rapidly rising asset prices into the economic outlook. He also characterized the run-up in stock prices last year as "breathtaking," a remark that apparently had no effect on market psychology today.
*He reiterated his support for eliminating the Federal deficit, but opposed the balanced budget amendment currently before Congress, saying technical constraints on economic policy should not be placed within the Constitution. Republicans are pushing for a vote within a month or two on the amendment, which the Clinton Administration is lobbying heavily to defeat.
*He said the researchers at the Federal Reserve agreed with the conclusions of a Congressionally appointed panel that the Consumer Price Index overstates increases in the cost of living by around one percentage point. Although he warned that fixing the index would not be a fiscal cure-all, his statement gave new ammunition to proponents of reducing the cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs as a way to reduce Federal spending and make it easier to balance the budget.
*He said he was skeptical that there was a fixed unemployment rate below which inflation would inevitably rise, and said that the Federal Reserve should not try to manage inflation by fine-tuning the unemployment rate.
The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee has left monetary policy unchanged for nearly a year, since it reduced the two short-term interest rates it controls, the Federal funds target rate and the discount rate, to 5 percent from 5.25 percent, last Jan. 31.
Since then the Fed has stood by as growth accelerated and then moderated, leaving unemployment below 5.5 percent for most of last year but not generating the increases in inflation that traditional economics models predicted.
Average hourly earnings last year increased 3.8 percent, the sharpest rise since 1990. But increases in overall compensation were held down by a reduction in the growth of health care costs as companies move employees to managed care programs. And while the Consumer Price Index rose 3.3 percent last year, compared with 2.5 percent in 1995, the figure most closely watched by economists -- the "core" index, which factors out volatile food and energy prices -- declined to 2.6 percent last year from 3 percent in 1995.
Mr. Greenspan devoted much of his formal testimony today to exploring how old assumptions about the interplay among growth, unemployment and inflation had been opened to question by the restrained increases in wages and prices over the last year.
He said that job insecurity appeared to play some role, since workers were more concerned about keeping their jobs and retaining access to on-the-job training programs than about getting a raise. At the same time, he said, companies have been reluctant to raise prices on their products and services, fearing that competitors, anxious to capture market share, will not follow suit. Moreover, he said, companies can afford to hold the line on prices because their profits and rates of return on capital remain strong.
But Mr. Greenspan said the trade-off that workers had been making -- subdued wage demands in return for job security -- was "transitional" and would ultimately come to an end, especially if unemployment remained so low that companies must bid up wages to attract workers.
"The unknown is how long the transition will last," Mr. Greenspan said. "Indeed, the recent pickup in some measures of wages suggests that the transition may already be running its course. If so, the important question from a monetary policy point of view is whether prospective labor market conditions will be consistent with the maintenance of satisfactory price performance."
Asked by Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to explain his comments last month about whether stock and other asset prices were flying too high, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he was aware that his comments could roil the markets, but said that he was only trying to discuss the relationship among asset prices, the economy and monetary policy in a general way.
"We thought long and in detail that any such statement could very well have immediate market effects," Mr. Greenspan said, suggesting how carefully he weighs every word he utters in public. "Our judgment, however, is that if we are endeavoring to explain, as I was in that speech, the full structure of policy-making as the Federal Open Market Committee implements it, then it would be important to make certain that everybody knows what we look at."
To considerable laughter, Mr. Greenspan said the speech succeeded in the sense that "everyone noticed what I was saying," but that it also failed in that people "didn't read as much of the context in which that was being stated as I would have preferred."
On the Consumer Price Index, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had studied the issue from two perspectives. First, he said, Fed researchers had examined the array of macro-economic statistics and determined that they did not add up to a consistent picture, suggesting that at least one important gauge of economic performance was faulty. The most likely culprit, he said, is the price index.
The Fed has also studied the price index itself and came to much the same conclusion as the panel headed by Michael J. Boskin, an economist at Stanford University, which reported to Congress last month that the index overstated inflation by around 1.1 percentage points.

Chart: "Greenspan As Market Mover"
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is listened to closely whenever he speaks, often moves stock and bonds prices, even if investors misinterpret his message.
 
YESTERDAY -- Mr. Greenspan said that American investors had "experienced an enormous further accretion of net worth as the stock market continued to climb at a breathtaking rate." The remark was a reminder of his use of "irrational exuberance" in December. But this time, the Dow Jones industrial average rose, climbing 40.03 points to 6,883.90, while the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.78 percent, from 6.83 on Friday.
 
DEC. 5 and 6 -- In a speech on Dec. 5, Mr. Greenspan asked ". . . how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpectedand prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?"
The impact came Dec. 6 as many analysts concluded that the remark could be a prelude to a rise in interest rates. Markets in Asia and Europe plunged. The Dow fell 55 points and was down as much as 144 points. The yield on the 30-year bond rose sharply at first but ended up just slightly, at 6.51 percent.
Reflecting on his use of the phrase "irrational exuberance," Mr. Greenspan told a Senate panel yesterday that "It was not a shot from the hip. . . . We thought long and in detail that any such statement could very well have immediate market effects."
 
JULY 18 -- Mr. Greenspan said ". . . there are a number of reasons to expect demand to moderate and economic activity to settle back toward a more sustainable pace in the months ahead." Stock market investors took this as a signal that short-term interest rates would not be raised soon. The Dow jumped 87.30 points, or 1.62 percent.
But bond investors saw a signal that the Fed might raise interest rates when Mr. Greenspan said that "the Federal Reserve has had to become especially vigilant to incipient inflation pressures." The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.92 percent, from 7.02 percent.
 
FEB. 20 and 21 -- On Feb. 20, Mr. Greenspan said "a number of fundamentals point to an economy basically on track for sustained growth, so any weakness is likely to be temporary." This was seen as a rejection of further cuts in short-term interest rates. The Dow fell nearly 45 points, while the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.40 percent, from 6.24 percent.
But when Mr. Greenspan restated his testimony before on Feb. 21, the market interpretation was reversed: the Dow jumped 57.44 points and yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.37 percent. (pg. D9)

Reich Takes Brandeis Post Over a Return to Harvard

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 21

 BODY:
Robert B. Reich, the outgoing Labor Secretary, will not return to Harvard, where he spent most of his career, but will instead join the faculty of Brandeis University next fall as a professor of social and economic policy, Brandeis announced today.
Mr. Reich will establish a Center on Jobs, the Economy and Society at the Heller Graduate School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis, continuing the work that has filled his career, first at Harvard University and later in the Cabinet. 
 "I have dedicated my life to ensuring that the economy works for everyone," Mr. Reich said. "A central tenet of my writings and the policies I put into place as Labor Secretary is that our ability to thrive as a nation depends on the capacities of our people who work productively together -- both as participants in an economy and as members of a society."
In his four years in Washington, Mr. Reich fought for pension plan protections and a higher minimum wage, earning a reputation as an outspoken liberal voice in the Cabinet. The university hopes that he will attract other public officials and academics to the center to work on the problem of economic inequality, which Mr. Reich calls a dangerously growing trend.
Before joining President Clinton's team in 1992, Mr. Reich lectured for 12 years at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Asked today why he was not returning to Harvard, he said at a news conference: "I'm of the belief that you don't go back to what you did before. I maintain the highest regard for the institution, but it's time to do something else. This is a marvelous opportunity."
Mr. Reich, 50, resigned shortly after Mr. Clinton's re-election, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. He has two sons, aged 12 and 15, with his wife, Clare Dalton, an associate dean at Northeastern University Law School in Boston.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Shift on Gifts May Affect Coffers Less Than Image

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Democratic Party's decision to reject donations from American subsidiaries of foreign companies could prove to be unworkable in the global economy of the late 1990's.
And if the party really does limit contributions to $100,000 a year from any one donor, it might find itself at a serious financial disadvantage. But the party can probably stretch the voluntary rules it established today so that the limit has little effect. 
 Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the new general chairman of the party, said at a news conference today that the limits on contributions were "a serious step that's going to cost us."
But nonpartisan authorities on campaign finance practices described the Democrats' announcement today as more public relations gloss than substantive reform. Kent Cooper, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group, called the party's restrictions on contributions "methadone treatment for the money-in-politics drug."
"It's a good first step," Mr. Cooper said, "but it doesn't cure the addiction."
First, consider the party's decision to reject contributions from subsidiaries of foreign companies. Under the law, such donations are legal as long as they are directed by American employees and the money does not come from the foreign parent. (Candidates cannot take corporate donations, but parties can.)
In the last campaign, American subsidiaries of foreign concerns gave millions of dollars to the political parties. Republicans received more, but the Democrats still got a pile. The largest such donor to the Democrats was the American branch of the Seagram Company, the Canadian liquor conglomerate, which gave at least $1.2 million. The company also gave more than $650,000 to the Republican party.
Restricting donations from these subsidiaries might be popular, especially at a time when the Democratic party is under fire for taking questionable contributions from foreigners. The problem is that it is often difficult to decide just what is an American company at a time when American corporations are increasingly buying stakes in operations overseas and European and Asian companies have extensive interests in this country.
Take, for example, Honda America, a unit of the Honda Motor Company of Japan. It has 12,000 employees in Ohio, makes cars from parts fabricated at American tool-and-die shops and sells the cars mainly to American customers through American dealers. Is this an American company or a Japanese company?
And when the M.C.I. Communications Corporation, the second largest long-distance telephone carrier in the United States, becomes part of British Telecommunications, does that mean it can no longer participate in American politics?
American companies give their shareholders' money to political parties for one main reason: They think it will expand their influence on the decisions of the American Government, and they are doubtless right.
So say a Democratic President or a Democratic Congress is working on opening up the telephone market in Singapore to American companies. Does the restriction imposed by the Democrats mean that AT&T is free to give money to get a foot in the door, but M.C.I. is not?
As of today, that seems to be the case. "If the ultimate owner of an entity is a foreign company, then we would not take that contribution period," said Steven Grossman, the party's chief operating officer.
Governor Romer conceded that the application might be unfair to companies like M.C.I. "This is a crude instrument," he said, "but it's the best we have."
Now consider the Democrats' announcement that they will take no more than $100,000 a year from any single source. This too has a popular ring after an election campaign in which dozens of companies, unions and trade associations gave more than a million dollars each.
Mr. Romer said that if the rule had been in effect in 1996, it would have cost the party $6.5 million.
But here's the rub. The $100,000 limit (and, for that matter, the restriction on donations from subsidiaries of foreign companies) applies only to the Democratic National Committee. It does not apply to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which raise money for candidates for the House and Senate. Nor does it apply to the state party operations.
No one expects the Democrats to commit suicide. So if the new funding restrictions pose too much of a disadvantage, party officials will surely channel contributions to the state parties or the House and Senate operations.
"This doesn't clean up the system," said Ann McBride, president of Common Cause, another watchdog group. "It gives the illusion of solving the problem, but it's still going to allow a lot of big money into the party."

HEADLINE: Justices Void Federal Law Restricting Indian Estates

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today declared unconstitutional a Federal law that prohibits members of Indian tribes who own very small pieces of land within a reservation from passing the property on to their heirs.
Under the 1984 law, the property reverts at the owner's death to the tribe, which becomes in effect the only legal heir. The owner's estate receives no payment. In an 8-to-1 opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court said the law violated the Fifth Amendment, which bars the Government from taking private property without compensation. 
 Congress passed the law, the Indian Land Consolidation Act, to address a longstanding and increasingly serious land ownership problem on the reservations. Tracts of 40 to 320 acres that had been allotted to Indian families a century ago have, through inheritance, acquired so many owners that individual stakes are now as small as a few square feet or even inches. Some tracts have hundreds of owners. The purpose of the law was to consolidate these fractional shares under tribal ownership so that the land could be put to an economically efficient use.
The law was challenged in 1993 by the children of William Youpee, a member of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes who died with a will that left to his children his fractional shares in 34 parcels on three reservations in Montana and North and South Dakota. The shares were small and had a total value of under $2,000. An administrative law judge of the Department of the Interior found that the land met the definition of property that must revert to the tribe.
The children sued the Interior Department on the ground that the law amounted to an unconstitutional taking. They won in both the Federal District Court in Montana and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which called the law "an extraordinary and impermissible regulation of Indian lands."
In upholding the Ninth Circuit's ruling in her opinion today, Babbitt v. Youpee, No. 95-1595, Justice Ginsburg relied heavily on a 1987 Supreme Court opinion that declared unconstitutional an earlier version of the Indian Land Consolidation Act. Congress responded to that decision by amending the law, but Justice Ginsburg said the changes were too minimal to make a difference.
The sole dissenter today was Justice John Paul Stevens, who said the law was justified by the Government's "valid interest in removing legal impediments to the productive development of real estate."
Under the law, a property interest reverts to the tribe if it represents 2 percent or less of the original tract and is "incapable" of generating at least $100 in any of the five years following the owner's death. If it did not generate at least $100 in any of the five years preceding the death, the legal presumption is that the test has been met.
In a brief filed on behalf of the Youpee children, a group of tribal landowners said the economic test was inadequate to measure the value of property that could be used for hunting, recreation or religious ceremonies.
Separately today, the Court asked the Clinton Administration for its views in a prominent affirmative action case that followed the dismissal of a white public high school teacher in Piscataway, N.J. The Court has not yet decided whether to hear the case.
The Piscataway school board, faced in 1989 with having to shrink the business education department in which the two most junior faculty members had been hired on the same day, chose to keep the black teacher and dismiss the white one.
The Justice Department, under the Administration of President George Bush, sued the school board on behalf of the white teacher, Sharon Taxman, who was rehired in 1992. The Federal District Court in Newark, ruling that the dismissal violated the Federal law against racial discrimination in the workplace, awarded Mrs. Taxman $134,000 in back pay.
By the time the case was on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, the Clinton Administration was in office and switched sides to support the school board. The appeals court refused to accept the Administration's brief and upheld the district court's ruling in a sweeping decision that rejected the argument that achieving or maintaining diversity could ever be a valid reason for basing an employment decision on race.
The decision to switch sides was criticized within the Clinton Administration itself, including by Walter Dellinger, then an Assistant Attorney General and now the acting Solicitor General. But the Administration did not take a position in October when the school board filed its Supreme Court appeal, Piscataway Board of Education v. Taxman, No. 96-679. Now the Administration cannot avoid declaring itself once again.

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge On Remarks By Greenspan

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices surged higher yesterday, continuing their torrid January pace, on stronger-than-expected earnings reports and what many investors believed were "conciliatory" remarks about the stock market from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 40.03 points, to close at 6,883.90 in heavy trading, notching its 10th record this year. 
 Although stock prices dropped about 40 points in early trading, the Dow bounced back in the early afternoon, nearly hitting the 6,900 mark after word spread that Mr. Greenspan had told the Senate Budget Committee that the economy remained strong and that there were few immediate signs of inflation.
Analysts cheered the remarks by Mr. Greenspan, who last December had hinted at a stock market that may have been infected by "irrational exuberance." Yesterday, Mr. Greenspan played down that remark and spoke instead of Americans benefiting from the market's "breathtaking" climb.
"Basically, the cautionary fears about Greenspan's remarks gave way to a sigh of relief," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "It looks like Mr. Greenspan is not going to take the punch bowl away from the bull market."
A steady stream of better-than-expected earnings reports also bolstered the market.
Although Wells Fargo's net income was down because of acquisition costs, its operating profit rose; shares of the bank holding company advanced 9, to 288 3/4.
Chrysler and Citicorp reported higher-than-expected earnings, lifting both stocks. Chrysler gained 1 1/2, to 36, and Citicorp advanced 2 7/8, to 112 1/8.
I.B.M., Boeing and Philip Morris accounted for more than 38 points of the Dow's 40-point gain yesterday, with Boeing alone, which jumped 7 3/8, to 113 7/8, accounting for 23.5 points. The aerospace company's shares shot up after it announced that it had scrapped plans to spend $7 billion on a more sophisticated version of the 747.
Shares of I.B.M. rose as high as 170 1/8, before ending at 168, a gain of 1 on expectations that the company would report strong earnings after the close of the market. The company's earnings were in line or slightly below expectations.
Philip Morris gained 2 3/8, to 119 5/8.
The Dow's big loser was Caterpillar, which fell 2 1/8, to 76 3/8, after the company reported that 1997 earnings would probably not be much higher than those of 1996. Caterpillar did, however, report better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings yesterday.
Broader market indexes once again outpaced the blue-chip barometer. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 6.02 points, to 782.72, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 12.69 points, to 1,376.97.
Analysts said the broad market advances had been powered by a confluence of events: a strong dollar, strong fourth-quarter earnings reports, large seasonal inflows into mutual funds and news of Mr. Greenspan's "conciliatory" remarks.
"You put that together and that's a powerful mix for equities; it's a very potent cocktail," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company. "I think the market wants to go higher. That's been the tenor of the last few weeks."
Mr. Pradilla said investors continue to bet on blue-chip stocks and technology "bellwethers," such as Microsoft and Intel, which are lifting the entire sector.
For the second consecutive day, Microsoft was the most actively traded issue, gaining 4 1/4, to 95. Shares of Microsoft have risen nearly $13 in the last two weeks, partly on last Friday's higher-than-expected earnings report.
Intel rose 2 13/16, to 148 1/16. McAfee Associates, the software developer, rose 6, to 56 1/4.
Oil, airline and financial services stocks also fared well. Shares of Salomon rose 2 5/8, to 51 3/4, after the company said its net income increased to $1.98 a share, beating analysts' estimates. Shares of Merrill Lynch gained 2 1/4, to 86 5/8.
Analysts said that market momentum was surprisingly strong, and that the Dow, which is up nearly 7 percent so far this year, could soon reach 7,000. "The big story is momentum," Mr. Metz of Oppenheimer said. "That's what people are playing."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Reports Its Second-Best Year Ever

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Brisk sales of Jeeps, pickup trucks and mini-vans allowed the Chrysler Corporation to announce unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results today that closed out the company's second-best year ever.
Chrysler earned $807 million, or $1.12 a share, in the fourth quarter, down 22 percent from the comparable period a year earlier but well above most Wall Street analysts' predictions. The company's earnings were damped by $279 million in special charges that wiped from its books some high-interest debt, pension costs, a charge from a subsidiary it sold and early retirement plan costs. Excluding those actions, net earnings would have hit $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share, Chrysler's highest quarterly results ever. 
 Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said that he was optimistic about 1997. "We've had three strong years and as we look ahead, we don't see anything besides clear sailing," he said. Nevertheless, he said the company had taken precautions against unforeseen trouble. "We are prepared if the market turns down for any reason," Mr. Eaton said.
Because Chrysler has always foundered in hard times, many are waiting to see whether it can survive the next round. Mr. Eaton repeated that Chrysler believed it had saved enough cash for the next rainy day to avoid cuts in its product development plans or restraints on its efforts to continue to increase its auto business.
"We're getting more and more confident that we can go through the next downturn, largely getting through it on operating earnings, and that would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities," Mr. Eaton said.
Chrysler has long said that its automotive operations need about $7.5 billion in cash reserves -- which now total $6.95 billion -- to help weather its next recession without cutting back on its car and truck development plans.
For the year, Chrysler earned $3.53 billion, or $4.77 a share, up from $2.03 billion, or $2.65 a share, in 1995. Indeed, excluding special charges, earnings for the year were Chrysler's highest ever. Revenue grew 15 percent, to $61.4 billion, from $53.2 billion in 1995.
Chrysler stock rose $1.50, to close at $36, after the results were announced. Other auto stocks also rallied, with General Motors Corporation shares rising $1.25, to $62, and Ford Motor Company stock rising 50 cents, to $33.625.
Chrysler -- whose best year was 1994 when it earned $3.71 billion -- was the first of the Big Three to report its fourth-quarter earnings. G.M. is expected to announce its results next Tuesday, with Ford's due the following day. The consensus among analysts is that G.M. will earn 49 cents a share and that Ford will earn $1.02 a share, according to First Call Corporation, a Boston firm that tracks analysts' estimates. The figures exclude one-time charges.
Wall Street analysts said Chrysler's results were strong all around. "This company is extremely well positioned," said Stephen J. Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley. "The stars are starting to align for them," he said, pointing to Chrysler's improved profitability.
In 1995, Chrysler earned worldwide profits of $1,235 for every car or truck it sold. In 1996, it earned $1,925 a vehicle. And in the last quarter, it earned $2,115 for each vehicle, far higher than other auto makers.
But some analysts cautioned that despite Chrysler's strong performance last year -- it ended the year with 15.9 percent of the United States market, up 1.6 percentage points -- it will have to work hard to maintain the gains.
"If you want to look at the company in a vacuum you'd probably see nothing but higher sales and better times," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Bear, Stearns. Chrysler's success came in part because "they capitalized on G.M.'s misfortune," he added.
This year, G.M. is unlikely to face the prolonged strikes that slowed production last year, and has more than a dozen new models replacing several tired designs. That should stiffen the competition, Mr. Lobaccaro said.
Nearly 80,000 union workers at Chrysler will share in the company's good fortune. On average, hourly workers will receive a bonus of $7,900 for 1996, up from $3,200 last year but below the 1994 record of $8,000.
Shareholders also benefited as Chrysler continued its stock buyback spree. Chrysler said it still planned to buy back $2 billion in stock this year, having already bought back 14 percent of its outstanding common stock since early 1995.
Chrysler's fourth-quarter results included an after-tax loss of $191 million incurred as the company retired $550 million in high-interest debt. Chrysler expects to issue about $550 million in lower-interest debt.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says State Budget On School Aid Is Skimpy

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani today gingerly contested Gov. George E. Pataki's claim that his proposed budget would narrow the disparity between state spending on New York City's schools and others across the state.
At a legislative hearing, the Mayor said that under the proposed budget, the disparity would actually increase. He said Mr. Pataki's proposal would increase school aid statewide by too little to keep pace with inflation and with increased enrollment in New York City. 
 Appearing at a joint session of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, the Mayor first took note of Mr. Pataki's plan to move closer to parity in school aid over five years, saying, "I commend the Governor for moving in that direction."
New York City has more than 37 percent of the state's public school students, but it receives less than 35 percent of state school aid.
The Mayor did not overtly appeal for more aid. But he said that under the Governor's budget, "We'll actually move in the wrong direction in the first year, possibly the second year of that proposal."
He added that even after five years, "We're still getting considerably less" than the city's full share.
In a mayoral election year, Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, is caught between his need to be seen valiantly defending the city's interests in Albany, and his need to keep the peace with Mr. Pataki, a fellow Republican, and the Legislature. And he must watch his political flank on education spending. His Democratic rivals have been making nearly the same criticism against him that by implication he made against the Governor today: that the Mayor's education budget has not kept up with rising enrollment and expenses.
Mr. Giuliani's remarks were milder than those he made last year, when he complained about the school finance disparity, also saying Mr. Pataki had not done enough to cut the city's Medicaid costs. Mr. Giuliani spoke of Medicaid only when prompted by legislators, saying he would reserve judgment on the Governor's proposals for cuts in Medicaid spending until later in the process.
Of Mr. Giuliani's remarks, Mr. Pataki said, "I would think that probably every community in the state will be asking for more money for their schools, and have a good case for it."
As he announced his 1997-98 budget last week, Mr. Pataki proposed a five-year effort to help the city catch up with the rest of the state. When transportation and construction assistance are left out, as the Governor says they should be, Mr. Pataki's budget narrows the gap slightly next year. But with those categories included, the disparity grows slightly.
Mr. Giuliani did not ask for more school aid, but said the city's schools would need $300 million to $500 million more in support next year just to keep pace with inflation and enrollment. Mr. Pataki's budget calls for $309 million more in aid to schools statewide, a 3 percent increase.
In his annual budget-season pilgrimage to Albany, Mr. Giuliani met with Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, and appeared with the Governor to sign a watershed agreement.
His complaint, though muted, was the same one Mayors have made for years: that the state shortchanges the city. He also argued that Mr. Pataki's property tax relief plan is unfair, giving New York City residents less than 10 percent of the benefit because it leaves out renters and co-op owners.
He also said that the city, which has reduced welfare rolls, should share in the Federal money the state will receive for reducing the number of recipients.
Mr. Giuliani called on state lawmakers to make permanent the experiment in eliminating the sales tax on clothing items under $500.
The Mayor urged legislators not to heed Senator Bruno's call to end rent regulation. He predicted that, in the end, the Legislature would do no more than tinker with the rent laws.
To that, Mr. Bruno said, "The Mayor is not always right in everything he says or does."

HEADLINE: Studies Show Need to Track and Prevent Hospital Drug Reactions

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Adverse reactions to drugs and mistakes in prescribing them commonly cause illness and sometimes death among hospital patients in this country, three new studies have shown.
Up to half of the problems were avoidable, said the authors of the studies, to be published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The studies differed in the way they were conducted but added to existing evidence of these dangers. 
 One problem is an allergic reaction that cannot be predicted or prevented -- which can occur the first time an individual takes a drug. Another reaction can occur if a patient has a known drug allergy that doctors, nurses and pharmacists fail to note before the medication is administered. A reaction can also occur when a patient is given a combination of drugs, even when each drug presents no problems individually.
Some hospitals have begun to develop computerized systems to identify adverse drug reactions and take other steps to prevent them. Nevertheless, more rigorous tracking is needed because hospitals, professional organizations and government, which pay much of the cost of medical care in this country, have focused too little attention on the problem, the authors wrote.
The rates of adverse drug events varied widely in earlier studies, in part because of the way hospitals and those doing studies identify the rates. One study found that about 30 percent of hospital patients had adverse drug events and that 3 percent to 28 percent of hospital admissions were related to such events.
Studies also have suggested that adverse drug reactions may account for as many as 140,000, or nearly 6 percent, of the 2.3 million deaths that occur each year in the United States. Currently, hospitals are believed to be detecting only an estimated 5 percent of such reactions.
But researchers need more documentation of adverse drug events before widespread enthusiasm about prevention can develop, said Dr. David C. Classen's team at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, which conducted one of the studies.
Although not all adverse drug events result from errors, the study of the problem is part of a small but growing focus of broader research on errors in medicine. Such research suggests that hospital errors could be caught systematically through management techniques and computer systems analogous to those used in industry to control the quality of manufactured products.
Using a sophisticated computerized surveillance system, Dr. Classen's team found that unwanted drug reactions affected 2.43 percent of 91,574 patients admitted to the LDS Hospital from Jan. 1, 1990 to Jan. 1, 1994. On average, the adverse events nearly doubled the patients' risk of death and lengthened their stay by nearly two days -- at an added cost of $2,013. Even a mild reaction like itching can be costly, because of treatment for the reaction and tests for other possible causes. In 1992, direct costs to the hospital were $1.1 million, excluding costs of liability or injuries to patients.
If other hospitals have rates similar to that of LDS Hospital, then an estimated 770,000 patients in this country have adverse drug reactions each year, at a cost of $1.56 billion. Earlier studies estimated the costs to be as much as $79 billion a year.
The study also documented some false economies. To save $5,000 a year, LDS Hospital pharmacy officials switched brands of vancomycin, an antibiotic. However, the hospital's drug monitoring system found that the new brand produced 25 more adverse events, for reasons that were not explained, and cost the hospital $50,000. Without the monitoring system, Dr. Classen's team reported, hospital officials would not have known their decision was penny-wise but pound-foolish.
A second study involved 4,108 patients admitted to medical and surgical units at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston during a six-month period in 1993. A team led by Dr. David W. Bates identified 190 adverse drug events, of which 60 were preventable. The team found a surprisingly large difference in the average length of stay between patients who suffered preventable and nonpreventable adverse drug events. The preventable events led to an average added stay of 4.6 days and cost of $5,857 compared with 2.2 additional days costing $3,244 for the nonpreventable ones.
The authors urged caution in extrapolating from their findings, but said that if their conclusions were confirmed, the total cost to the nation would be $4 billion a year.
In the third study, a team headed by Dr. Timothy S. Lesar, a pharmacist at the Albany Medical Center, analyzed every third adverse drug event that hospital pharmacists detected and averted from July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995. The team detected 2,103 errors thought to have potentially dangerous, at a rate of 3.99 per 1,000 orders for medications. Dr. Lesar's team wrote that the most commonly identified factors were "inadequate knowledge, availability, or appreciation of important patient information and drug factors."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Making the Most of an Opportunity

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Felix Burgos's profile in The New York Times during the Neediest Cases Fund campaign in December 1993 was a portrait of a man laboring to keep his self-respect. Out of work for more than a year, he relied on public assistance for a meager existence. He had side-stepped eviction from his Brooklyn apartment by working as an unofficial superintendent for his elderly landlords. "I had maybe $1.30 to my name," he recalled the other day. "I was back in my December rent."
In exchange for his welfare benefits, Mr. Burgos, 51, worked as an unpaid computer operator at Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, a job arranged through the Work Experience Program, the city's workfare program. It was that small fact, near the end of the article in the Saturday newspaper, that caught the interest of Richard Martin, the president of Medical Malpractice Insurance Association on William Street in lower Manhattan. 
 Mr. Martin was looking to hire someone for a job entering insurance policy data into his company's computer system. He called Catholic Charities at 8:30 Monday morning to invite Mr. Burgos to an interview.
Mr. Martin is known for his spur-of-the-moment generosity. He once hired musicians he heard playing in a subway station for his company's Christmas party.
In Mr. Burgos's case, Mr. Martin said, "We happened to have an opening in that area that dealt with computer usage and filing and records retention and we were interviewing people at the time. We just decided to take a look at him. We were very impressed with the interview and hired him on that basis. He is an excellent employee. We're very happy to have him."
Mr. Burgos had no experience with insurance work. For a decade he had worked as a major-domo, cleaning houses, running errands and managing personal schedules for up to a dozen clients at a time. He took two years of business courses at the Fashion Institute of Technology and later worked for a company that made fabric sample books. "When it came to insurance," he said, "all I knew was home insurance and life insurance."
It was the closing of the fabric company that left him unemployed. At Catholic Charities, the computer work suited his meticulous personality (his friends call him Felix Unger), but the agency could not afford to hire him. Instead Catholic Charities, one of seven social-service agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped him with minor expenses and with his job search by printing his resume and paying for new shoes and clothes.
Fifteen minutes after his interview, Mr. Burgos was offered a job as record retention coordinator at Medical Malpractice Insurance Association. He accepted, but there were no guarantees. His supervisor, Joseph Alvear, said, "As much as I like the thought of giving somebody the opportunity, I didn't want dead weight. We gave the guy the opportunity, and the guy worked out."
Mr. Burgos started his new job on Dec. 20, the Monday after his interview. "When I arrived on Wednesday morning, the director of personnel hands me an invitation to their Christmas party and a check for a week's salary," he said. "In a week's time, your life just changes. Six, seven days before you have nothing in your pocket. Seven days later you are having a Christmas party on the 41st floor of a building where there is white glove service and a five-piece string playing Christmas songs. I'm looking down from the 41st floor and pinching myself. Is this happening? Is this real?"
For his co-workers, Mr. Burgos's success has been a sobering inspiration. "It goes to show sometimes you just need to give somebody a chance," Mr. Alvear said. "There might be a lot of worthwhile individuals out there who just don't get the opportunity."
In each of the last three years, Mr. Burgos has contributed to the Neediest Cases Fund. This year he sent $100. "I find myself to be truly blessed and very lucky," he said. "I was hoping that if someone were to read this, maybe they would have a job to help someone else. To help one person at a time is good enough."

HEADLINE: A Classic Boston Brawl Pits Mayor Against New Stadium

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Beefy guys, working on beers, gobbling popcorn and potato chips, pals of Tommy Menino, huddled around a television set not much bigger than an altar two Sundays ago, cheering the New England Patriots to victory over the upstart Jacksonville Jaguars.
"YESSSSSS," they screamed, jumping to their feet and punching the air, as defensive back Otis Smith scooped up a fumble in the fourth quarter and ran 47 yards for a touchdown that guaranteed the home team a trip to New Orleans for the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
 Their battle cry was echoed across state and region and is still reverberating in this sports-mad city. "Jambalaya," they call the giddy mood that has swept over Boston.
But, among this one set of fans, price tags still dangling from new Patriots' caps, there was a curious ambivalence.
"Two more weeks of this," groaned Tommy Menino, who is the Mayor of Boston, putting his head in his hands.
Thomas M. Menino is being hammered unmercifully these days for stubbornly trying to block a proposed new football stadium for the Patriots. He has been denounced by the local press, the powerful downtown business community, the Governor and, above all, a legion of fans euphoric that their team -- once so bad that spectators would put paper bags over their heads as a sign of embarrassment -- is now a winner.
A mayor against a major league stadium? When a winning franchise confers big-time legitimacy on places like Jacksonville, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C.? And in Boston, where the Red Sox, the Celtics and the Bruins are folk religions? In an election year, how could this be?
As the Patriot's owner, Robert K. Kraft, sought to use the brief Jambalaya fever running up to the Super Bowl as leverage to secure the 69,000-seat stadium, political operatives on both sides of the issue outlined a classic brawl in a city where an election is called a "fight," and the loser gets "croaked." In play, they said, were not only the future of the last piece of prime undeveloped waterfront in the city -- a dreary industrial wasteland that is clearly destined to become Boston's next glittering district -- but also the enormous amounts of money at stake in major league sports. And there are towering egos, political rivalries and the suspicions of the tough, tight-knit South Boston neighborhood where Mr. Kraft wants to build.
"It's unbelievable -- any place else you would worry who would be hurt racing to the microphone to take credit first," said one of the operatives working to get the stadium built.
"In Boston, there are only three things: sports, politics -- and revenge. This has all three plus money," he added, pleading for anonymity because of the passions the stadium issue has engendered.
In truth, the struggle is less about football than real estate development, which in Boston is also a contact sport.
And, in an era when the Patriots' 24-year-old quarterback, Drew Bledsoe, has a contract for $42 million over seven years, financing the stadium is about more than selling tickets to eight home games. The project rests on renting public land cheap in an area soon to be flooded with Men in Dark Suits because of development already under way, backed by tens of millions of dollars of improvements by government. These men and their corporate employers, it is reasoned, will want to spend huge amounts of money to belong to the fancy year-round sky-box club attached to the stadium. It is this club, to a large extent, that will support the plan.
Mayor Menino insists that a badly needed new convention center should be the priority for the site.
The Mayor also backs up the fierce objections from South Boston -- in many ways the heartland of the city's traditional politics -- that if the stadium is built, the nearby narrow streets of their densely populated neighborhood will be clogged with thousands of cars. Many Patriot fans are so famously boorish that Monday Night Football would not televise their games for fourteen years, and these fears were hardly assuaged when more than 7,000 fans seeking tickets for the Jaguars game got into an alcohol-fueled melee outside the team's present stadium in Foxborough, throwing punches at each other and bottles at the police.
"It just doesn't work," Mayor Menino said of the stadium proposal in an interview. "It's bad urban planning. The neighborhood is against it; the people in South Boston are adamant. There are other alternative sites; this is one of the most valuable parcels of land in the city. It's not just a stadium issue, the whole thing is being confused."
Mr. Kraft, a cardboard box mogul, says he was traumatized as a youth in 1953 when the baseball Braves moved away, and bought the Patriots three years ago to keep them from going to St. Louis or somewhere else.
He has powerful allies. Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, is determined to make sure the team does not leave the state. And Chad Gifford, the head of the BankBoston Corporation, has a major stake in financing development. He is a key member of "The Vault," an inner circle of bankers and other powers who shape much of the city's economic life, so-called because local lore has it they first met secretly in the vault of a member's bank.
"This is the new Boston, a whole new vista," a person working behind the scenes for the stadium said, displaying maps showing the planned development along the waterfront. "The new frontier, a great, healthy world-class city returning to its seafaring roots, chic, trendy. It's all about to happen, it's undeniably exciting. There's big dollars. Menino doesn't have vision and the neighborhood is parochial."
The infighting is so sharp that when the lights went out for eleven minutes at the rattletrap Foxboro Stadium just as the Patriots were to kick a field goal, people at Mayor Menino's game party hooted and jeered, voicing dark suspicions of a plot to show the need for a new field.
"Whaddeedo, Kraft, throw water on a transformer?" a woman snorted.
For the record, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Electric Company, Karen Berarbino, said the problem was a blown fuse on a pole outside the stadium. Mr. Kraft smilingly denied any sabotage, but was quick to take advantage.
"It was unfortunate, but maybe it makes a point," he told local sportswriters, to chuckles. "But we didn't plan it."
Meanwhile, the owner has been flirting with politicians in Providence, R.I., which the National Football League designated as the host city for the Patriots-Jaguars game, and with the Pequot Indians, who have so much money from their Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., that they could pay for building a stadium nearby. This has increased the pressure on officials here, and there have been profanity-laced telephone exchanges between the Governor and the quick-tempered Mayor.
Mayor Menino declared in his annual State of the City Message that he would not "rush into a deal by sacrificing good urban planning or the people of our neighborhoods." Governor Weld countered with a State of the State Message in which Patriot football metaphors were piled on like linebackers on a quarterback. He wound up by trumpeting, "Jambalaya -- Go Pats."
The Governor, Mayor and owner managed to get together to hold a pep rally for the Patriots this Sunday, where an estimated 15,000 people gathered in City Hall plaza on the coldest day of the year, with a wind-chill factor of minus 10, to cheer the players, wave pompoms and cheese graters -- and drown out the Mayor in a resounding chorus of boos.
"Stadium, stadium," they chanted as the Mayor maintained a frozen smile.
At the moment, it appears that the stadium proponents have the advantage because the 27-acre site is owned by Massport, the state port authority, whose officials are appointed by the Governor, and is thus beyond the Mayor's control. Governor Weld has the procedures in place to have a $500,000-a-year lease approved for Mr. Kraft. The lease would run for 65 years with two optional 16-year extensions and a possible rent increase after 10 years.
Opponents of the stadium have vowed to fight the Governor in the courts and in the State Legislature and the city is reviewing environmental regulations in hopes of tying up the project.
Although Mr. Kraft has insisted in meetings with South Boston leaders that the stadium would only be used for Patriot home football games, the lease terms would allow other events, including rock concerts.
City officials contend that this is a sweetheart deal, estimating that the land should rent for more than three times that much and that the whole area will drastically increase in value soon. This is because the new high-rise towers of the nearby financial district are spreading to the area near the now-desolate site proposed for the stadium, with a new Federal court house, luxury hotel and World Trade Center expansion already in the works. The changes are supported by what the city estimates are about $60-million in government-financed improvements, including toxic waste cleanup and a subway extension.
Mr. Kraft is banking on this business development for a market to sell some 6,000 special mid-field seats at $6,000 a year, with a minimum 10-year purchase necessary, which will give membership in the private, year-round club, with a restaurant, bar and meeting rooms. The stadium will also have an N.F.L. pavilion as a permanent tourist attraction.
The club memberships would provide Mr. Craft with $360 million. He has said that he expects to spend more than $200 million to build the stadium.
"It's certainly an interesting method of financing," one of the Mayor's men said, not without admiration, after producing a series of figures designed to show the project was a land grab at public expense.
Indeed, when Mr. Kraft rented space in the basement of Mr. Gifford's BankBoston for a mockup to encourage potential backers, what he built was not a model of the stadium itself, but of the club. It is a fine thing, testosterone as architecture, all wood-paneled walls, leather chairs, a marble bar, helmets and footballs resting on shelves.
Word leaking out last month about the plan sparked fury in South Boston, the insular, largely Irish neighborhood that feared it would be inundated on game days.
"This could be the last straw for people to pack up and leave," said Jimmy Kelly, the City Council president who first became prominent as an opponent of court-ordered busing for school integration in the neighborhood two decades ago.
"We are an automobile society and they will be taking their cars, tens of thousands of them through the heart of South Boston, and parking all over the neighborhood," he said. "And all the tailgating parties and painting their faces and socializing with their beers and cocktails. That's fine where there's elbow room. But not in somebody's neighborhood."
As a Bostonian, Mr. Kelly, one of the guests at the Mayor's party, became indignant at the suggestion that he was not a sports fan.
"The 1952 Red Sox, I could tell you the starting lineup, all their averages," he said. "But in the 50's they stayed with the team. They don't have the same kind of loyalty today. A lot of people have Patriot fever now and they're thinking with their hearts. But there's no loyalty anymore, they play for the highest bidder and after all the hoopla and the painting faces they could be gone. Its a sad thing its come to this."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK BEGINS SPENDING TO SAVE CITY'S RESERVOIRS

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21

 BODY:
New York City today began spending $660 million on a five-year program to cut the flow of pollution into its upstate reservoirs and avoid the need for a $4 billion filtration plant.
Under an agreement worked out among the city, New York State, Federal environmental officials and a coalition of small watershed communities, a typical New York City water bill of $400 a year will increase regularly until by the year 2002, it will be $435 a year, not counting other unrelated increases. The watershed-agreement increases will buy thousands of acres of land around the reservoirs, upgrade more than 100 aging sewage treatment plants, and support economic development projects in the Catskills. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed a foot-thick agreement today, ending 21 months of negotiations and decades of water-related litigation and bad blood between the city and its neighbors to the north.
The first city checks -- $13 million in "good neighbor" funds for villages and towns around the reservoirs -- are already written and ready to go, said Joel A. Miele Sr., the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner. Within 90 days, the Governor's office said, an additional $38 million will go to Westchester County and $30 million to Putnam County.
Mr. Miele said more than 13,000 acres had already been offered to the city by upstate property owners. With the Mayor's signature today, he said, appraisers and other city water officials could now begin buying parcels that fit the city's priorities.
Mr. Giuliani was joined in a ceremony at the Capitol by Gov. George E. Pataki, Federal environmental officials and local officials from communities around the Catskills and Hudson Valley. Mr. Pataki said the agreement effectively balanced the needs of the communities in the hills and valleys that produce the city's water with those of the millions of people who drink the water.
"It's going to save the city literally billions of dollars," the Governor said. "But it's going to allow a quarter of a million people who live in the watershed communities to have certainty as to what can be developed and how it can be developed."
Besides starting the flow of money, the signing sets in place the first new set of regulations for preventing pollution around the city's 19 upstate reservoirs since 1953. For four decades, the watershed towns have been operating under rules that still governed such things as "two-seat privies," said Michael C. Finnegan, the Governor's counsel and the principal architect of the talks leading to the upstate-downstate deal. But the new rules deal with a range of modern-day threats to clean water: everything from proliferating weekend homes and their septic fields to the possibilities of casinos in the Catkills.
The agreement effectively puts off until at least 2002 a threatened order by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to keep the city's water clean with a filtration plant, which would have been the largest such plant in the world, filtering more than a billion gallons of water a day from reservoirs west of the Hudson River.
"Had the Governor not exercised leadership here," Mr. Giuliani said, "had the city not cooperated with watershed communities, the city would have faced catastrophic costs."
Commissioner Miele said that if regular monitoring over the next 20 years shows the program is working, the city could be granted a permanent waiver of any order to filter the water.
Yesterday, Jeanne M. Fox, the regional administrator of the E.P.A., said she was optimistic that the agreement would protect the water supply, which serves nine million people in the city and surrounding communities. "Protecting public health comes first, and we think this agreement -- if it's complied with -- can work," Ms. Fox said.
Mayor Giuliani said, "This is a wonderful example of the Federal Government working with us rather than imposing mandates."
Some private environmental groups and state legislators said they were concerned about loopholes. An important gap in the deal is the lack of limits on construction of sewage treatment plants, said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group. Added treatment capacity will only encourage more sprawl -- and more pollution, he said.
Nonetheless, other environmental groups enthusiastically praised the deal, saying some flexibility was essential to forging a compromise.
"There are 500 pages of specific things to do," said Chris Meyer, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a private organization that has been a frequent antagonist of the Mayor and the Governor on other environmental issues.

 New York City agreed yesterday to spend $660 million over five years to safeguard its upstate watershed from pollution. Ninety percent of the city's drinking water comes from reservoirs in the Catskills, fed by rivers and streams threatened by sewage and runoff from the region's towns and farms. Inset shows how yesterday's agreement seeks to control the main sources of pollution.
 
SEWAGE PLANTS -- Improvements to 105 plants that discharge partly treated sewage in the watersheds.
 
FARMS -- Incentives to control runoff from fertilizer and livestock wastes.
 
DEVELOPMENT -- New York City will buy land to block new buildings and roads.
 
SEPTIC SYSTEMS -- New rules limiting construction close to streams.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT OFFERS MEDICARE SAVINGS

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
One day after his inauguration, President Clinton made a conciliatory gesture to Congressional Republicans today by announcing that his budget proposal would contain more savings in Medicare than he was willing to consider last year.
At a White House appearance before a strategy session with his economic advisers, Mr. Clinton said his budget for the 1998 fiscal year would propose trimming the growth in Medicare spending by $138 billion over six years. 
 "The only way we can actually balance the budget is if we seize this moment to work together," he said. "And I'm going to do my best to reach out to the Republicans." He added, "I want to meet them halfway on this and on many issues. And I hope they'll meet me halfway."
Prominent Republicans, in fact, said the President had met them halfway, and they gave him high praise. When budget talks between Congress and the President collapsed last January, Republicans were seeking to rein in Medicare spending by $158 billion over six years, and Mr. Clinton had proposed $116 billion in reductions. While it was not clear today whether the President was using precisely the same economic forecasts in his latest proposal, he did appear to be trying to strike a mid-point.
Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, has been one of the most politicized issues dividing Republicans and Democrats as they have sparred over budget proposals over the past two years. Mr. Clinton and the Democrats campaigned hard against the Republicans on the issue in the 1996 campaign, running against the House Republicans' bid in 1995 to make $270 billion in savings over seven years in the program.
Democrats often went so far as to suggest that the Republicans wanted to dismantle Medicare altogether -- charges that the Republicans bitterly repudiated as scare tactics.
But today the tables were turned as influential Republicans praised the President's gesture while Democratic leaders of Congress remained conspicuously closed-mouthed.
"I am very encouraged by President Clinton's decision today to meet Republicans halfway on the Medicare savings level," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. "This is a very positive and very significant development." Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee, said, "This frankly brightens the prospects for being able to get a budget agreement."
Democrats, however, were circumspect. "We have not seen the details of it and I think until we know more about it we have to reserve judgment," said Laura Nichols, the spokeswoman for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader. Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, also had no immediate comment.
Most of the savings in Mr. Clinton's proposal would come from health care providers, with hospitals losing $45 billion in payments over the six years, while health maintenance organizations would lose about $46 billion.
Administration officials said that their ability to propose more savings than they had previously endorsed would be made possible in part through a reduction in Medicare payment rates to H.M.O.'s. The H.M.O.'s are paid 95 percent of what the Government pays for beneficiaries in the standard Medicare program. The Administration would reduce that figure to 90 percent beginning in the year 2000.
Another $18 billion in savings over six years would come from Medicare recipients through the premium charged for Medicare services. Under law, the monthly premium paid by Medicare recipients is expected to drop after 1998 to below 25 percent of the cost of Part B of Medicare, which pays for doctors' services. In Mr. Clinton's proposal however, the percentage would hold relatively steady at 25 percent.
A recipient now pays a monthly premium of $43.80, which is about 26 percent of the Part B program's costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in the year 2002, if current law remains in effect, the premium would be $51.50 a month and would pay for 20.8 percent of those costs. Using these assumptions, Mr. Clinton's proposal would result in a monthly premium of $61.90 in 2002, about 25 percent of the costs.
Bruce C. Vladeck, the adminstrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, defended the increase at a briefing by noting that the Republicans' various Medicare plans had all included even higher premium increases.
On another question affecting Medicare premiums, Mr. Clinton's aides declined to rule out the possibility that the President might agree in negotiations with the Republicans to go further and make premiums contingent on a Medicare recipient's income.
"There are a number of policies that relate to premiums that could very well be acceptable to us in the right context and there are some other approaches that aren't," said Franklin Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
While Mr. Clinton would no longer be in office six years from now, any Medicare agreement he strikes with the Congress could produce long-term annual savings. Unlike most other Government spending, which is set annually in individual bills, changes in the Medicare program would be put into the permanent law and would have long-lasting effects, unless the changes were modified in the future.
The Administration has estimated that without any changes in the Medicare program, the trust fund that pays hospital bills will run out of money in the year 2001.
"In the long term, in the big picture we really do have to get a balanced budget done this year," said Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, "and we do have to address the Medicare trust fund this year."

Just Another Hot Night In Chicago

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
SAME old same old. Bulls-Knicks. Champions versus challengers. Practitioners of elegance versus promoters of ugly.
"Two styles," Phil Jackson declared in an unprepared statement that sounded just enough like another round of his never-ending war with whoever calls himself coach of the Knicks. "One of passing and cutting and shooting, and one of clutching and grabbing and holding." 
 Same old same old. Global icons versus East Coast enigmas. Michael Jordan versus Patrick Ewing. The ultimate Money Player versus a mere depositor of hefty checks.
Scottie Pippen versus Whoever You Think Is the Second-Best Knick.
Last night, that would have been Larry Johnson. Then Allan Houston for a few rousing moments in the fourth quarter. But Jordan had on his classic Knicks game face, and his jumper was falling. He scored 51 points. He screamed a few choice words at Jeff Van Gundy after the Knicks' coach claimed that Jordan offers young players phony friendship to gain a competitive edge, as if he needs one. The Knicks rallied from 17 points behind in the fourth quarter but came up short again, 88-87.
"I don't believe anything's really changed with this rivalry," Jackson said.
Same old same old. Bulls win. Knicks lose. With dignity, of course.
It took almost half the season for the Knicks to come face to face with their longtime playoff tormentors here, more than enough time for Zen Master Jackson to reveal his team's special motivation for thwarting the Knicks' ambitious urban-renewal program implemented last summer in an effort to restore Chicago to the status of Second City.
Jackson's message to his players: the Knicks are still a representation of everything that has gone wrong with professional basketball and it is therefore their duty to preserve the purity of the game, if not (lest we forget that Dennis Rodman once was and hopefully will be again a member of their team) the integrity of the sport.
"It's like Phil was telling us, 'Be ready for another rugby match,' because that's who they are," the reserve guard and 3-point-shooting specialist Steve Kerr said.
Told that the Knicks, despite the expensive additions designed to transfuse badly needed fluidity and fundamental skills into their offense, have nonetheless too often looked ugly this season, Kerr interrupted.
"It doesn't look ugly; it is ugly," he said. "They're sort of at the heart of the N.B.A. controversy -- the physical play, the low scores and people starting to say that they don't like our game anymore. It started with Detroit and then with Riley in New York and, unfortunately, it's spread to Cleveland and Atlanta."
No one quite expected the Knicks, with Ewing still their hub, to become a completely different body of work, but for the $157 million committed to Johnson, Houston and Chris Childs, a facelift should not have been out of the question. They hired Johnson and Houston to rewrite the equation, upscale the offense, free the Knicks from the physical strain of having to win by handcuffing the opposition, or worse. But when the Knicks desperately needed to score last night in the last six minutes of a game that was available for them to steal, they couldn't. They went about five minutes without a field goal. Ewing missed wild shots. Johnson disappeared. Houston finished 5 for 18.
It's a long way to the playoffs, but it is no hysterical contention that Johnson has thus far been the second coming of Charles Smith, while Houston has played like, well, Dallas. So timid has he been defensively that Van Gundy started Childs on Jordan in an obvious effort to spare Houston some pain. Childs exchanged rather unfriendly words with Jordan in the second quarter. Good move. Next time, forget the coach's advice, try a warm embrace. Jordan proceeded to torch all three of the rich new Knicks who took turns guarding him.
 The Knicks didn't quit. They never do. They clawed their way back with a 17-2 run. Then Jordan put them away. Then Pippen claimed that they were better off with Anthony Mason than with Johnson and that John Starks is "much better" than Houston. Then Jackson gave them credit for what he always does.
"Clutching, grabbing, holding," Jackson said. "The Knicks are very good at that."
As long as Jordan's been around, that's never been good enough.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Captain's Place as a Yankee Great Is Secure

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
In "On the Waterfront," Marlon Brando as the boxer Terry Molloy says, "I coulda been a contender." In the Bronx today Don Mattingly could say, "I could have been a Hall of Famer."
Mattingly will be at Yankee Stadium to announce his retirement, a year after he took a leave of absence from baseball. The leave now becomes permanent and wise. 
 A completely healthy Mattingly could still be playing first base for the Yankees, could still be the productive and dangerous hitter he was early in his career. A healthy Mattingly could already have amassed statistics that would have catapulted him to Cooperstown.
But a chronic back problem, one that apparently could not be fixed with surgery, undermined Mattingly, robbed him of his power, his production and his place in the Hall of Fame. Some of his zealous fans will nevertheless argue for that honor, but Mattingly will have to be satisfied with knowing he had some great seasons for the Yankees and he was the No. 1 player in New York for more than a decade.
There was none better than the Mattingly, who was the scourge of American League pitchers from 1984 through 1989. Returning from an educational winter of baseball in Puerto Rico after his first major league season in 1983, the quiet left-hander surprised the Yankees with his new-found power to right field.
He had spent the winter working on pulling the ball and hitting for home-run power, and he graduated summa cum laude. Home runs, doubles, hits of all kinds flowed the next several seasons. He drove in runs, he scored them and he became the most feared hitter in the league.
He hit so well that his defensive play at first base became secondary, but it was first rate, too, also best in the league. At the same time, the two best defensive first basemen played in New York, but as much as Keith Hernandez meant to the Mets, he did not supersede Mattingly.
If Mattingly had any shortcoming in those years, it was his reluctance to use his status to improve economic life for other players. When he was preparing to go to salary arbitration in 1987, after a season in which he batted .352, hit 31 home runs, drove in 113 runs and led the league in hits (238) and doubles (53), Mattingly could have asked for any salary and won.
But for perhaps the only time in his professional life, Mattingly backed away, let himself be cowed by George Steinbrenner. The owner told his star player that if he attained too high a salary in arbitration, he would trade him. It was clearly a bluff -- if Steinbrenner had traded Mattingly, fans would have placed him on the first train out of the Bronx -- but Mattingly fell for it.
Instead of breaking the $2 million arbitration barrier, he sought and won $1,975,000. Too bad Steinbrenner could not have exercised the control over Mattingly's body that he had over his mind. Mattingly never voluntarily let anyone know that he was suffering with a bad back, but eventually his production began slipping and then plummeting. It atrophied along with his back.
A doctor who once examined Mattingly and saw all the test results said years before Mattingly took his leave of absence that he had no business continuing to play, indeed he didn't know how Mattingly did continue to play.
In his final six seasons, Mattingly hit a total of 58 home runs, averaged 64 runs batted in a season and batted .300 only once. In the career Yankees records, he is among the top eight of just about every important offensive category, hobnobbing with Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle and Berra. But their achievements took them to Cooperstown, and his will not. Mattingly, however, has already won a spot in the Yankees fans' Hall of Hearts. He made an impression there that will not soon wither.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Space in the Crowd;
Foreign Car Makers Seek Low End of Sport Utility Niche

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Clutching a white plastic shopping bag full of car brochures, Carolyn Spicer, a 52-year-old credit union manager, stood at the North American International Auto Show here and carefully studied the light-gray, Jeep-like Honda CR-V on the platform. After looking at it from the front and the side, she guessed it would sell for $25,000 when it goes on sale next month.
So she was surprised to learn that the sticker price would be just $19,300 for a well-equipped model. "If they keep that price," she said, "it's going to really go." 
 That's exactly the reaction Honda has been hoping for, and precisely the one Detroit fears. After years of limited success, foreign auto makers are staging an all-out assault on America's sizzling market for sport utility vehicles, the crown jewels of Detroit's Big Three. With imports like the CR-V accounting for most of the new offerings, and with the dollar close to a four-year high against the Japanese yen and climbing against the German mark, foreign auto makers appear poised for big sales gains.
In the next four years, at least 17 Japanese and European companies plan to introduce new four-wheel-drive sport utility models into a market now dominated by Chrysler's Jeeps, Ford's Explorers and Expeditions and G.M.'s giant Suburbans, Tahoes and Yukons. This surge is a clear threat to American auto makers, all of which lose money on their cars while making their profits on sport utility vehicles and, to some extent, mini-vans and pickups.
"Without a doubt, the Japanese are going to be very aggressive" in the sport utility market, said Alexander Trotman, chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. For Detroit-based companies, he said, "the weakness of the yen just makes the task a lot harder."
Not that auto executives or analysts actually expect sales of American-brand sport utility vehicles to fall. Drivers' appetite for these truck-like vehicles is still growing, and most new foreign models are considerably smaller and less powerful than Detroit's brawny road hogs.
But by focusing on more affordable alternatives -- American models often run as much as $30,000 or more -- foreign auto makers may be stealing a march on Detroit. The Chrysler Corporation, Ford and the General Motors Corporation have dominated this market for years because many sport utility vehicles began as little more than pickups with covered beds. With little expertise in truck-building, and with an initial skepticism that the craze would last, foreign auto makers dithered for years, only introducing a few models and not advertising them very heavily.
Now Japanese auto makers are pouring into the market with sport utility vehicles built on the chassis of small and midsized cars. G.M., Ford and Chrysler are all developing similar vehicles -- Chrysler is even looking at a sport utility version of its Neon subcompact -- but still have a couple of years' work to do. The few existing American models that cost less than $20,000, like the Jeep Wrangler and the Geo Tracker, are still quite truck-like.
Executives at the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation, which are making the most ambitious pushes with the new Honda CR-V and the highly successful Toyota RAV4, introduced last year, say each views the other as its main competitor. Both companies say they are particularly eager to offer sport utility models to their millions of remarkably loyal car owners, who might otherwise be tempted by American offerings.
But foreign auto makers also have their eye on people who used to buy upscale foreign sedans and now drive large American sport utilities instead. "The defectors that went to Explorers and these other vehicles are going to come back, because we're going to give them an alternative," said Richard A. Colliver, senior vice president of Honda's auto operations in the United States.
Most new foreign models will also be built abroad, which could add a couple of billion dollars a year to the American trade deficit with Japan in particular and could feed trade tensions. Foreign auto makers want to make sure they can capture a large chunk of the market before investing in new factories here to build sport utility vehicles.
The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, for example, plans to import 30,000 to 35,000 Montero Sports this year, a new model that went on sale in December for $17,620 to $31,110. "You need a minimum of 100,000 vehicles a year" to justify the assembly of a model in the United States, said N. Kevin Ormes, Mitsubishi's group vice president for sales and marketing. "Until you can get that kind of volume, you can't justify the costs."
But the biggest question is how large a share foreign auto makers will capture of this huge and growing market. Sport utility vehicles claimed 14.2 percent of the United States auto market last year, more than twice the 6.7 percent in 1990, and are also catching on in Japan, Latin America and the Middle East.
A statistical analysis by Ward's Autoinfobank and DRI/McGraw-Hill, two data research groups, predicts that as foreign models pour in, the heady growth of the American market will moderate this year.
The new analysis also forecasts that the Asian auto makers will capture 21.6 percent of the sport utility market, or 477,000, this year, up from 19.2 percent last year, or 411,550. European auto makers are predicted to double their share in the next four years, to 2.6 percent in 2000.
These vehicles are fabulously profitable. Ever since G.M. recovered its initial development costs years ago, it makes as much as $10,000 in pretax profit from each mammoth Suburban. Japanese profits are likely to be less because, by and large, they are selling smaller, less expensive vehicles in a more competitive market.
The strong American dollar, which has rebounded nearly 48 percent from its trough against the yen and nearly 27 percent from its trough against the mark both in April 1995, is giving foreign auto makers an extra lift. The dollar's turnaround has produced a sharp reversal in the fortunes of Japanese auto makers' subsidiaries in the United States, which now find it much more cost-effective to import vehicles and parts from Japan.
"It took the negative and turned it into a positive," said Richard L. Chitty, vice president for small cars at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc.
Some American auto executives remain optimistic in the face of the latest competition. They point out, for instance, that most of the new Japanese models -- like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4 -- have four-cylinder engines. Most American sport utility vehicles have more powerful V6 or V8 engines, leading Detroit executives to dismiss foreign offerings as not big or rugged enough to satisfy buyers who dream of barreling down dirt roads in the Rockies.
Robert Lutz, Chrysler's vice chairman, said that the Honda CR-V was likely to steal sales mainly from the Honda Accord and other foreign cars, not his company's Jeeps. "Honda will sell a ton of those things, I'm convinced," said Mr. Lutz, a former Marine pilot, pausing to stir cream into his coffee with a black Swiss Army knife and then lick the blade. But the result of more foreign offerings, he said, will be more import buyers driving sport utility vehicles instead of cars.
The sentiment among some shoppers at the auto show here suggested that Mr. Lutz was right. Jeff Knudsen, a 43-year-old security company supervisor from Redford, Mich., who drives a Plymouth Acclaim but longs for a full-size Chevrolet pickup, took a look at the CR-V and scorned it as too small for the long road trips he takes.
"I like it, but it's not big enough for what I like to do," said Mr. Knudsen, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his shiny blue baseball jacket.
But the CR-V remains roomier than a midsize sedan. And as few as 3 percent of sport utility vehicle owners use them to tackle the rutted dirt roads that are a staple of television ads. So Japanese auto makers contend that their lighter, less powerful vehicles are perfectly adequate.
The Honda CR-V "is as off-road capable as I think anyone will want to drive it," said Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president for automotive operations at the American Honda Motor Company Inc. "We don't expect people to go out and climb rocks with it," he added at Honda's American headquarters in Torrance, Calif.
The smaller engines of many imported sport utility vehicles also make them more fuel-efficient than the gas-guzzling American alternatives. If gasoline prices rise or if the Clinton Administration follows through on hints that it may raise fuel-efficiency standards for these vehicles, foreign producers could collect a bonanza.
Yet for reasons that are not entirely clear to market researchers, buyers of sport utility vehicles tend to be far more brand-loyal than car buyers are. So the relatively small market share of Japanese auto makers in these segments means they cannot count on a lot of previous customers returning to buy the next model.
The weakness of the Japanese economy in the early 1990's has also made Japanese auto makers reluctant to gamble huge sums on entirely new designs. So they have come up with sport versions of cars, like the Subaru Legacy Outback, which is really a station wagon with modest changes like a higher suspension, a stepped-up roof, and a reinforced chassis.
"We're really 10 or 15 years late coming to that market so we had to come with something different," said George T. Muller, the president of Subaru of America Inc., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries based in Cherry Hill, N.J. In August, Subaru plans to introduce the Subaru Forester, which looks more like a traditional sport utility vehicle but is built on a chassis similar to the Outback's.
Japanese auto makers have had the most success selling sport utility vehicles like the Nissan Pathfinder to urban residents on the East and West Coasts. They have had less success selling them to Midwesterners and people who use the vehicles for their intended purposes, such as hunting and fishing trips and traveling to remote areas.
That may not change soon, said Jerry Hirshberg, the president of Nissan's North American design operations. "Pathfinder is not a car we designed with a gun rack in mind," he said.

HEADLINE: Times Expanding Nationwide Distribution

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
The New York Times will begin a series of major changes next month to make the daily more widely available around the country and to offer readers an improved paper with later-breaking news.
The changes illustrate the growing importance of The Times's circulation nationwide, but they will also be evident to readers in the metropolitan New York area who will receive papers with more up-to-date information because of new, later newsroom deadlines. 
 These are among the changes:
*On Feb. 18, The Times will introduce what amounts to another geographic edition, in addition to its local and national editions. It will begin printing at plants outside Boston and Washington for 110,000 Times buyers from Maine to Richmond who now get the New York edition. The new four-section edition will offer later-breaking news and sports results, a separate arts section and local weather and television listings. And the paper will be home-delivered to more distant suburbs in both the Boston and Washington areas.
*Reaching for readers in areas outside the Northeast, The Times has so far contracted with 33 daily newspapers around the country to deliver its national edition along with their own papers. A similar deal with a national magazine distributor will carry The Times to more than 25,000 retail outlets across the country within a year, up from 17,000 now, strengthening a weak link in the distribution of a paper that is often hard to find outside airports and hotels.
*Starting in September, after a $350 million printing plant at College Point, Queens, has begun to operate, The Times will expand its current four-section New York regional edition to six sections most weekdays. The expanded New York edition will have color photography and color advertising seven days a week, starting with sports and gradually working out to the rest of the paper, including the front page, by this time next year.
*Beginning early next year and continuing through 2000, the New York regional edition is expected to add new weekly theme sections -- health and technology are early possibilities -- to expand the paper's appeal to readers and specialty advertisers.
Although the plans have been largely shaped by a desire to offer readers later news and an improved paper, they fit into The Times's increased emphasis on building both nationwide circulation and the national advertising that runs in all editions. Seeking to counter declines in circulation and advertising, The Times sees opportunities both inside and outside metropolitan New York as local papers scale back national and foreign news as well as stock tables, Times executives said.
National advertising currently accounts for 44 percent of the total column inches in all editions, and, because of its premium price, 53 percent of ad revenues, with local and classified advertising providing the rest. By contrast, at The Los Angeles Times, the country's second-biggest seven-a-day-a-week paper after The Times, national advertising amounted to 15 percent of the total column inches in all editions last year.
"We were seeing particularly strong growth in national advertising," said Janet L. Robinson, president and general manager of The Times. "That made us examine where we were going after advertising and where we were going after circulation."
National advertising is not only more profitable than classified or local advertising, it also spreads the sources of revenue across the country, better insulating the paper from local economic slumps, Ms. Robinson said. Advertising revenue pays for two-thirds of the cost of production.
The Times has also sought to build on the encouraging circulation growth of its national edition. Since 1980, 95 percent of The Times's daily circulation gain has come from the national edition, which now has a weekday circulation of 279,000 and a Sunday circulation of 389,000. Subscribers outside the New York metropolitan area have also demonstrated less resistance to increases in the newspaper's price.
For the last few years, executives of The Times have explained their business model with a short, self-confident phrase: "Premium quality, premium price." The Times would deliver top-quality news and features, they explained, and in exchange readers would be willing to pay a high price and advertisers would pay high rates. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, said in an interview that the coming changes will "keep the promise" implicit in the "premium quality, premium price" idea.
The new editions printed in Boston and Washington will go to East Coast readers who live north of Hartford and south of Philadelphia. For those readers, the big change will be later-breaking news and expanded sports results. Currently, papers for these readers are trucked from the New York area, and the newspaper's press time must be early enough -- 9 P.M., currently -- to allow timely delivery.
Tying publication of the early edition to the movement of trucks instead of the events of the day makes little sense, said Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The Times. "We are just not serving our readers as well as we should be with our early edition," he said.
After renegotiating contracts with its production and delivery unions to allow printing in Boston and Washington, The Times will be able to deliver from locations much closer to its readers. That means press times will be pushed back to 10:45 P.M. for papers going outside Boston and Washington, and midnight for papers delivered within those metropolitan areas. The midnight press time will make the paper more competitive with the deadlines of many papers.
The 762,000 buyers of the New York regional edition will also get later news and sports. Press times for that edition will be 11:15 when the overhaul begins in September and 11:30 starting next January. Some readers, primarily in outlying areas of the New York metropolitan area, now get papers produced as early as 9 P.M.
The new edition will allow The Times for the first time to extend home delivery beyond Boston and Washington and their close-in suburbs, into towns like Nashua and Manchester in New Hampshire and perhaps as far south as Richmond, Norfolk and Charlottesville in Virginia. The Times insists, and Wall Street analysts generally agree, that the added presence in New England will not hurt sales of The Boston Globe, which is owned by The Times, because the two publications do not compete on local news.
Using other newspapers to make home deliveries and Magazines Distribution Inc. to stock The Times on retail shelves is far cheaper than having the paper do those tasks itself. The Times's home delivery agreement with The Chicago Tribune, for example, will permit home deliveries beyond the close-in suburbs of Chicago, adding such markets as Joliet, Aurora and Elgin in Illinois and Hammond, Ind.
Ms. Robinson predicts that along with early distribution of a nationwide Sunday Preview edition, which began last May, these initiatives will add 7,000 to 10,000 in daily circulation and 10,000 to 15,000 to the Sunday paper by the end of this year alone. By the end of the century, she said, The Times will have grown by 29,000 on weekdays and 103,000 on Sunday.
The Times's circulation and advertising have fallen from their peaks. Weekday sales have declined by more than 100,000 since 1993, to about 1.1 million, while the Sunday paper has lost about 80,000 in sales, falling to 1.7 million. And total advertising linage has fallen to 3.8 million inches last year from a peak of 6.1 million in 1987.
Aggressive price increases for advertisers and readers in recent years account for, and offset, part of the decline, Times managers maintain. But no newspaper with national ambitions can sustain continuous circulation slippage, analysts contend.
James Dougherty, an advertising and publishing analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, is among those on Wall Street who worry that the circulation and advertising problems many newspapers are experiencing are not easily solvable.
"The things the Times management is doing are absolutely sensible," Mr. Dougherty said. "The paper has a large constituency outside the New York area, and the easier it is for people to get the paper, the better off it will be. However, they don't solve the big issue, which is that you have a lot of people who aren't reading papers anymore, and a lot of advertisers who just are not buying into newspapers."
Steven N. Barlow, senior media analyst with Smith Barney, is more optimistic on The Times's outlook, crediting relatively mundane events. Lower newsprint prices, aggressive staff reductions and other cost-cutting at The Times are the basis for his prediction that the company's earnings will grow to $2.15 a share this year from his estimate of $1.80 last year, and that the stock price, currently at $40.625, will reach about $45 by next year. The stock price stood at $29 a year ago.
The new edition for the Northeast and the Washington area along with the College Point plant "are like a $1 billion face lift for the Old Gray Lady," said Mr. Barlow, who now rates The New York Times Company a strong buy. "That is going to make investors start paying attention."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Big Industrial Nations Signal Confidence in Strong Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surpassed 119 yen for the first time in nearly four years yesterday and rallied against other currencies on signs that the richest industrialized nations want the United States currency to strengthen.
The dollar also benefited from an optimistic appraisal of the American economy on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. It was aided as well by a growing suspicion that the Bank of Japan, the Japanese central bank, would not intervene to protect the yen and fresh evidence of economic weakness in Japan and Germany. 
 It was one of the broadest one-day gains in the dollar since the currency began appreciating sharply against the mark and yen late last year. The latest rally has pushed the dollar up nearly 3 percent against the yen and nearly 7 percent against the mark in the first three weeks of 1997.
"Basically we've had some substantial dollar moves today," Jesse Torres, vice president and chief dealer at the New York branch of Bank Austria, said. "People realize that the dollar continues to be a good investment."
The dollar hit an intraday high of 119.20 yen, the strongest since February 1993, before settling late in New York at 119.03 yen, up from 117.94 on Tuesday. The dollar also traded as high as 1.6454 marks, the strongest since June 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6427, up from 1.6286 on Tuesday. The pound fell sharply on the dollar's strength to $1.6300, from $1.6628 on Tuesday. It was the weakest level in nearly three months.
Traders said the main force driving the dollar came from remarks by Japanese and French officials suggesting that the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- all want the dollar to continue to rise.
Backing off his statement of concern about the yen's weakness on Tuesday, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mutsuzuka of Japan said the major industrialized nations support the encouragement of a strong dollar.
The mark's weakness partly reflected new indications of a faltering German economy in data from the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, which convenes its policy making council today amid speculation that it might lower interest rates.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Rises to 5-Month High And Gold Tumbles Further

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices jumped to a five-month high on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York yesterday amid concern that a Colombian dock workers' strike and a disappointing Brazilian crop would reduce exports from the world's two top producers.
On other markets, gold dropped to its lowest price since September 1993 and soybeans fell. 
 A strike at Colombia's key Pacific port of Buenaventura entered its ninth day, delaying shipment of at least 210,000 132-pound bags, the Colombia Coffee Growers Federation said.
At the same time, concern is mounting that Brazil's coffee crop will fall well short of Department of Agriculture projections of 27 million bags. Brazilian officials said on Monday that the nation's harvest, normally one-fourth of global supplies, could be as low as 18 million bags.
Coffee for March delivery rose 5.65 cents, to $1.353 a pound, on the highest price for an active contract since Aug. 26.
Gold dropped as the dollar surged against major currencies, raising the cost to foreign investors.
The dollar climbed to a 47-month high against then yen and a two-and-a- half-year high against the Deutsche mark, powered by expectations that the major industrial nations would not act to halt its rise.
Gold prices, suffering from forecasts for muted inflation and the prospect of central bank sales, are down 4.7 percent so far this year as investors look for more attractive returns elsewhere.
"Gold has suffered all around the world from asset relocation," said Bridget Fraser, a vice president of commodity-based derivatives at Bankers Trust in New York. "The traditional gold holders are looking for alternative investments -- the outlook for gold isn't great. Prices are going lower."
Gold for February delivery fell $2.10, to $351.70 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division, its lowest closing price since Sept. 17, 1993.
Soybean futures fell amid expectations that recent rains in South America could cause a bumper harvest.
Soybeans for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell to $7.405 a bushel, down 6.25 cents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says New York Outdid Suburbs in '96 Job Growth

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
One of the tenets of economics in America is that suburbs create more jobs than cities. Last year, New York City broke that pattern. For the first time since 1980, the city outshone its entire suburban encirclement of office parks and edge cities in making new jobs.
Of the 70,000 net new private jobs added in the 27-county region tracked by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 37,000 were in the five boroughs of New York City -- a slim majority, but a majority nonetheless. Over most of the last 17 years, the city has never come even close to that. Through the boom years for job creation from 1979 to 1988, for example, New York accounted for only about one quarter of the one million new jobs created in the region. 
 The changing balance between the growth rates of city and suburbs is partly because suburban job creation has slowed. "The city is driving the growth," said John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner for the statistics bureau. "That's a break in the historic pattern."
Mr. Wieting and other economists said that one year's worth of numbers, while providing a mirror to the growth that New Yorkers have already witnessed in places like Times Square and downtown Brooklyn, do not necessarily suggest the arrival of a long-term trend. Nor do they point to a dazzling economic boom.
New York City's private job base rose only 1.3 percent in the 12 months ending Nov. 30, better than in 1995 but less than in 1994 or 1993, which were both strong years of economic recovery from the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's. Growth in the suburban job base in 1996 slowed even more, rising only 0.8 percent. Both lagged far behind the national growth rate of 2.4 percent in the period, according to Federal figures.
What the New York numbers do suggest -- especially in some major areas like retailing and manufacturing, where the city has long been the weakest link in the regional economic chain -- is a shift, at least for now, in the local balance of power. More people were working in New York in October in the retail trade category, for example -- nearly 571,000 jobs, up 3,000 in 1996 -- than in any comparable October since 1990, according to figures from the New York State Department of Labor.
Equally profound is that the city did better, or at least less badly, than the surrounding counties in holding onto manufacturing jobs. The city lost manufacturing jobs, as it has nearly every year since the early 1970's. But in the suburbs, where corporate downsizing and restructuring continued to be a major force at places like AT&T, New Jersey's largest private employer, the hemorrhage was worse. Of the 19,000 manufacturing jobs that disappeared, only 5,000 were in the city.
Job growth in areas like motion picture production, on the other hand, which contributed 6,600 new jobs, indicate larger national and international changes in which the city stands to benefit uniquely.
An increasing number of internationally produced film projects, in particular, have found New York to be a convenient halfway point between Hollywood and Europe for both financing and production, according to Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Cowan & Company. A strengthened Canadian dollar also helped, he said, by making Toronto -- one of New York's main competitors for urban movie sets -- more expensive.
There were also indications of internal changes in the city's economy.
The securities industry, buoyed by the bull market for stocks, fueled much of the city's job creation. But that growth was mostly in the businesses that serve the needs of Wall Street, like printers, legal services and accountants, which added 12,500 jobs -- making up the single largest component of the job creation.
In what may be a portent of a restructuring industry, job growth in traditional high-paying jobs like brokers increased less than in previous booming stock years, partly because of labor-saving technology, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Another major wrinkle in the city's trajectory is that it continues to be the center of shrinking public employment, as state, Federal and local governments -- especially New York City's government -- reduce their work forces. The city lost more than 9,000 public jobs in the city in 1996, according to state and Federal figures.
If that public employment deficit is subtracted from the net growth in private jobs, the city's total growth shrinks to 28,000 jobs, while the rest of the region -- less affected by government job cuts -- still has a growth of 30,000 jobs.
Another regional wrinkle indicated in the job creation numbers is that some parts of the region outside New York are doing better than others. Long Island, in particular, emerged in 1996 as a center of suburban job growth, according to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Ms. Rosen said that Long Island shares some of the same strengths as New York, with fewer of the city's weaknesses.
"Long Island doesn't have the drag of government layoffs, and it's adding more retail employment," she said.

HEADLINE: Madeleine Albright's Agenda

 BODY:
Riding the magic carpet of yesterday's unanimous Senate confirmation vote, Madeleine Albright becomes Secretary of State today. She can be an eloquent champion of freedom around the world. How skillfully she blends that calling with the pragmatic politics of American diplomacy will define her stewardship at the State Department.
Restoring America's traditional interest in democracy and the rule of law to the heart of Washington's foreign-policy agenda would be a service to the nation and the world. As America's chief diplomat and principal voice on international issues, Ms. Albright must carry out President Clinton's decisions. But she also has an extraordinary opportunity to shape the debate. She should use it to restore a better balance to policies that have become excessively driven by commercial considerations. 
 America's national interests sometimes call for putting commercial or security concerns ahead of human rights issues. It makes sense, for example, to negotiate with Stalinist North Korea on nuclear weapons issues, to expand trade with a less than fully democratic Mexico and to maintain economic exchanges and diplomatic dialogue with a China that torments democrats and dissidents and bullies its smaller neighbors.
But such diplomatic realism does not require Washington to mute its distaste for provocative and repressive policies, as it has most conspicuously done in the case of China. Overlooking such behavior weakens American credibility abroad and feeds cynicism at home. The American people expect their foreign policy to reflect American ideals.
Madeleine Albright is ideally equipped to speak out forcefully on freedom's behalf. Her background as a refugee from both Nazism and Communism has taught her the differences between democracy and dictatorship and made her sensitive to the need to reinforce market and electoral reforms with independent civic institutions. Her strong scholarly grasp of foreign policy has now been seasoned by four years of experience at the United Nations.
She takes office at a propitious moment for new initiatives on democracy and human rights. President Clinton has grown more comfortable and experienced with foreign policy. The notable successes already achieved on trade, Bosnia, relations with Russia, Middle East peace and choosing a new United Nations Secretary General will free Ms. Albright from some of the burdens of crisis management that preoccupied Warren Christopher.
It can be a remarkable match of personal qualities and political opportunity. Ms. Albright should make the most of it.

HEADLINE: The Shrinking Science Budget

 BODY:
The National Academy of Sciences reports that Federal spending on basic research and new technologies in 1997 will barely rise above 1996 levels, despite years of steady decline. Even worse, the five-year deficit reduction plan, as embraced by Congress and President Clinton, will knock 35 percent out of the country's science programs by the year 2002. The trend is ominous because research pays big dividends, accounting for perhaps half the growth in living standards and raising output by 30 cents or more on each invested dollar.
The National Academy estimates that Washington spends about $40 billion on activities that add to scientific knowledge. Biomedical research, primarily at the National Institutes of Health, gets about 30 percent of the science budget. The National Science Foundation, which funnels money into university research, accounts for only about 5 percent. Programs outside the Institutes of Health have fallen by about 10 percent since 1994. 
 If Congress and the President insist on balancing the budget by 2002 while giving away $100 billion in tax cuts, they may have to trim the total spending on all discretionary programs by 30 to 40 percent. But some programs, like border patrols and public health, will be left alone. That will force Congress to take even more from programs like science, where there is no short-term payoff.
Mr. Clinton promised in 1992 that he would promote economic growth through public investments. The budget plan for 1998 that he will deliver to Congress early next month may propose only small reductions. But after 2000, he and Congress will find themselves on a destructive course.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
White Wants Pulpit Between Hash Marks

BYLINE: By Timothy W. Smith 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
They call Packers defensive end Reggie White the minister of defense. It's a clever play on the fact that White is an ordained minister and an associate pastor at the Inner City Church in Knoxville, Tenn., and one of the most menacing pass rushers in the National Football League.
White is a reverent man. He believes that God paved the way for the Packers to get into the Super Bowl so that he could have a platform to advance his ministry. 
 But that platform might not extend beyond the final whistle of the game against the Patriots on Sunday.
If the Packers win the Super Bowl, White may want to use the post-game moments to say a prayer in front of the stadium crowd and, possibly, on live television. Some people in the N.F.L., however, are concerned about this and have discussed it in meetings, according to a person familiar with the situation.
To the league, the post-game platform at the Super Bowl is reserved for presentation ceremonies and live televised interviews of players and coaches.
Players often kneel in prayer on the field during and after a game. But should White be able to express his religious views to a worldwide audience simply because his team was victorious in a football game? Does religion have a place in the N.F.L., sharing space on stage with the league's signature event?
Greg Aiello, a league spokesman, said the N.F.L. had not discussed the situation in any staff meetings and that no request had been made for any formal post-game prayer ceremony.
This is not an issue with any real villains, but it is a delicate situation. If White could espouse religious views, why not someone else with a political agenda? The league can't take away White's First Amendment rights to free speech, but it can deny him a free microphone.
Christianity and spirituality are pervasive in society and in the N.F.L., and they have had a strong presence around the Packers during this Super Bowl week. White's spirituality is a strong influence in the Packers' locker room. He often prays with teammates like receiver Don Beebe and tight end Keith Jackson and has many other believers on the team.
This belief is strong, too. Desmond Howard, the Packers' ace punt-return specialist, said he was troubled by a severe hip injury in training camp. Being a free agent who had bounced around with a couple of teams before joining the Packers, Howard was worried that he would not heal fast enough to make an impact before the final cuts. A former first-round pick by the Redskins, Howard was running out of chances.
"I consulted with Reggie," Howard said. "We prayed together. He prayed for my hip to heal. It got better. I was able to play in the first preseason game and I returned a punt 77 yards."
Jackson said players believe so strongly in White's ministry, which Jackson described as "teaching a man to fish," that several players donated money from an N.F.L. Players Association dues rebate to White's ministry. It totaled about $170,000.
Jackson said the players have a greater awareness of their responsibilities to the outside world.
"It starts with Reggie and guys like me and Don Beebe," Jackson said. "We're willing to take a role-model stance, reach out to kids and say, 'Hey, this is not what you're supposed to be doing.' We're an unselfish team and we echo that message to little league and high school football teams. We accept the role of a role model."
Quarterback Brett Favre, one of the Packers' most irreverant players, doesn't feel he has to rein himself in when he is around White. They do, however, have a very good relationship.
"Whether or not you believe what Reggie believes or not, you have to respect him," Favre said. "He doesn't do anything for himself. Everything he does is for other people. He's a good person and he means well."
White is trying to rebuild his Knoxville church, which was destroyed by arson a year ago.
White has said that through his ministry, he offers low-interest business loans. He said he had been trying to contact Magic Johnson about an idea to build 24-hour basketball gymnasiums next to the movie theaters Johnson is building in inner-city neighborhoods around the country. White said they have a proposal from the city of Indianapolis to build a 24-hour gym.
"To me, when you help people out of their situations you don't have to preach much to them," White said. "In order to meet people's spiritual needs, we have to meet some of their economic needs. That's what we've been working on."
White believes the country will be a better place if people become more spiritually enlightened.
For White, who has said that God has made the football field his pulpit, religion and football are as natural as a three-point stance.
"A lot of people ask me questions about football and religion," he said. "But the thing is that there are people's lives at stake. I don't see the problem. Most of you guys, when we get down in the end zone and pray or get together and pray on the field, you have a real problem when it comes to that.
"But there are people who write me letters, whose lives have changed, who have read my book, who are better fathers, better husbands, better men and women for it. That's what it's all about. That's why I don't understand when you guys have a problem with it when people's lives are being changed."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Selling Missiles It Once Banned

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Just a few years after they ended their nuclear arms race, the United States and Russia are locked in a fierce competition for arms sales to Southeast Asia, with both countries offering potential purchasers some of the world's most sophisticated missiles as incentives.
From Thailand to Malayasia, countries shopping for advanced fighter aircraft are demanding -- and receiving -- the chance to buy deadly accurate, air-to-air missiles that allow a jet pilot to shoot down an enemy plane he can not even see -- indeed, one that might be as far as 30 miles away. 
 When Thailand first asked for the missiles, known as Amraams -- an acronym for their formal name of advanced medium range air-to-air missile -- Clinton Administration officials rejected the request. The officials feared that the sale could cause regional instability and trigger an arms race.
Bangkok immediately said that if the United States blocked the sale of the missiles, it would not buy American-made F-18 jets, a pending deal worth nearly $600 million. The Thais made it clear they were considering the Russian MIG-29, which can carry a similar missile.
Washington eventually capitulated, even though American and Thai officials say Bangkok did not really want to buy a plane from Russia.
The Amraam's journey from a weapon that Washington zealously protected to one that is now available to a range of countries illustrates what happens once arms restrictions are relaxed even a little, American officials and arms control advocates said in interviews.
"Once we've said 'yes' to one, it is hard to say 'no' to the next," said an official in Washington.
American officials said this week that the decision to provide the missile to the Thai Air Force opens the door for other countries in the Association of South East Asian nations to make similar requests, although each would still face a case-by-case review.
The sale of Amraams to Thailand is also a telling illustration of the workings of the global arms bazaar. These days, American officials say, it is business, not ideology, that is driving sales.
During the Cold War, the Pentagon advocated restrictive policies on arms sales, particularly of sophisticated weapons that might fall into enemy hands. Now, the military services push the arms trade as a way of helping defense contractors suffering from cutbacks.
The aim, American officials said, is to drum up sufficient business to keep the defense manufacturers profitable and ready to serve the American military.
The Amraam was one of the most effective weapons for the American-led alliance that routed Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
Navy admirals, whose pilots fly the F-18, were among the earliest advocates of clinching the sale to the Thai Air Force by including Amraams in the deal.
Just a few years ago, the United States would permit the sale of Amraams only to NATO allies.
Then, in 1995, the United Arab Emirates went shopping for 80 combat jets, a deal worth between $6 billion and $8 billion, which the oil-rich country could afford, though there were questions about whether it had enough qualified pilots.
The Emirates demanded various types of sophisticated gear for their planes, and at the top of the list was the Amraam, American officials said.
After an intense debate, and over opposition from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Clinton Administration agreed. With that, Lockheed's F-16 has now emerged as the likely winner of the contract, edging out the French Mirage.
After the sale to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand demanded the same missiles. "We caved to them as well," said a State Department official in Washington. "It shows how the threshold gets passed."
Now, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which have been turned down in the past on requests for Amraams, are expected to come knocking again. And this time it will be hard to say no, American officials said this week.
Because of Amraam's "extremely good" potential to hit aircraft out of visual range, any air force that has it enjoys a clear advantage over the enemy, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, a publication that assesses military weapons systems.
In seeking to buy Amraams, the Thais are not preparing for an imminent war, Western military analysts said. Rather, they are modernizing their air force in line with Bangkok's status as a growing economic and political power.
"Even in the absence of a specific threat, the Thais are correct in their strategic thinking," a senior Western military officer said about Bangkok's purchase of Amraams.
The F-18, the French-built Mirage and Russia's MIG-29 all would have fulfilled Thailand's needs, he and other military analysts said.
The MIG-29 is an extremely good combat plane, and is less expensive than either the French or American jets. But its "Achilles heel," as one Western military officer put, is that maintenance and service are not at the same level. And many countries, including Thailand, are still reluctant to buy from Russia.
The Malaysians bought MIG's three years ago, in large part because the Russians agreed to offset part of the price with the purchase of Malaysian palm oil.
Similarly, in Thailand, McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of the F-18, agreed to buy some Thai products -- from rubber to frozen chickens -- in order to sweeten the deal.
"It was a high stakes game," said a senior Western military official in the region. "Had we called their bluff, it's anyone's guess what might have happened."
With so much money at stake, Washington was not willing to take the risk. A senior American diplomat added, "We couldn't tolerate a treaty ally buying a Russian jet."
The Thais won't get the missile technology right away, not until someone else in the neighborhood gets comparable technology. But that is a question of when, not if, American officials said. Malaysia already has MIG-29's, and it has promises from Russia for eventual sale of the sophisticated missiles.

HEADLINE: A Top Canadian Visits Cuba, Nettling Washington

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In a brief visit that clearly signaled the sharp divisions between the United States and Canada over how to deal with Cuba, Canada's Foreign Minister dined with President Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials on Tuesday before signing joint declarations today on human rights and foreign investment.
In Washington, the State Department criticized the overnight visit by the Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, the highest-ranking Canadian to set foot in Cuba in more than 20 years. 
 "It doesn't make sense to reward a dictator in our hemisphere who is completely behind the times," said the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, even before Mr. Axworthy had arrived in Havana on Tuesday. "You reward him by sending your Foreign Minister down there, by having visits as usual, by trading. We think that's wrong."
Today, however, the State Department tempered its response, with Mr. Burns expressing "the highest personal respect for Minister Axworthy." He reserved critical remarks for Cuba, voicing skepticism that its Government was prepared to take "systematic and meaningful steps that would lead to a transition to democratic rule."
Mr. Axworthy, who has been a vocal critic of American policy toward Cuba and the Clinton Administration's attempt last year to toughen its longstanding economic embargo, called the trip the culmination of a yearlong series of meetings between senior Canadian and Cuban officials. He said it probably signals even closer relations between the two countries, as Canada tries to play a greater role in the hemisphere.
"Cuba comes up on our radar scope as a much higher priority than before," Mr. Axworthy said in an interview on Tuesday. "Canadians are discovering a whole new world south of our southern neighbor."
The substance of the visit consisted of a mildly worded joint statement issued today before Mr. Axworthy's departure saying that Canada would help Cuba do more to respect human rights, but containing no mechanism to force the Cuban Government to do so. The countries agreed to cooperate on human rights by preparing seminars and exchanging human rights experts. The statement also pledged greater protection for foreign investments.
But those declarations were secondary to the imagery of the visit, which came just hours after the end of festivities for President Clinton's second inaugural.
Mr. Axworthy spent much of the time meeting with Cuba's Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina. Mr. Robaina was clearly elated to be host to the most senior Canadian official to be received in Havana since Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1976, a visit that was as much an annoyance to the United States as this trip is now.
"Your country does not share the policy of isolation and blockade," Mr. Robaina said to Mr. Axworthy at the start of the brief working session that preceded the state dinner. "And our country is grateful for that."
Mr. Castro warmly welcomed Mr. Axworthy to the ornate Palace of the Revolution for a formal dinner Tuesday evening of lobster cocktail and baby lamb chops, topped off by Cohiba Esplendidos, expensive Cuban cigars.
Mr. Castro also had lunch with the Canadian officials this afternoon. Reporters were banned from both meetings, but as the Cuban leader was leaving the Canadian Ambassador's residence he said that the visit had produced "better understanding of each other and lots of good conversation."
"We talked of many things, many things, but among friends," Mr. Castro said in pointed reference to the unwillingness of the United States to deal directly with Cuba. "Among friends you can talk about everything."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Axworthy had been taken by Cuban officials to an oil-drilling operation in the beach resort of Varadero that had been taken over recently by a Canadian company, Sherritt International. A huge American-made Caterpillar motor sat there, along with several mud pumps that were clearly marked as having been made in the United States, all in Cuba in violation of the economic blockade.
Cuba's Vice President, Carlos Lage, seemed to best capsulize the importance of the visit when he said that the presence of the American equipment at a Canadian project in Cuba showed how ineffective the United States blockade had been.
"Canada is showing that it is possible to be a friend of the United States and of Cuba too," Mr. Lage said.
Canada and the United States have been at odds over Cuba since the first days of the Cuban revolution 38 years ago. Washington has tried to isolate Cuba and Mr. Castro diplomatically, while imposing increasingly economic blockades.
Mr. Clinton had shown signs of being willing to negotiate more directly with Cuba until two Cuban MIG's shot down a pair of unarmed civilian planes flown by anti-Castro dissidents from Miami in February 1996. Under pressure from Cuban-Americans, the President then shifted direction and signed the Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to punish foreign business executives, including Canadians, who do business with Cuba.
For its part, Canada never severed its diplomatic and commercial ties with the island, arguing that close contact, rather than isolation, would help move Cuba toward democracy.
Canada enjoys a substantial and growing trade with Cuba, with Canadian businesses investing in hotels, restaurants and other businesses that have been closed to companies from the United States.
Last year, trade between Canada and Cuba exceeded $430 million and was growing by more than 10 percent a year. Canada sends down machinery, wheat and other products and buys lobsters, sugar and nickel from Cuba.
Canadians are also among the largest groups of tourists to Cuba, with 156,000 visiting last year, a 10 percent increase over 1995.
In addition, Canada provides financial support to several non-governmental organizations in Cuba, including the Centro Felix Varela, which lobbies for sustainable development and homosexual rights, among other issues, but not broader political change.
"If what the U.S. Congress wants is to see changes take place in Cuba -- and we support those changes, but go about it in a different way -- I can't see what they have to complain about," Mr. Axworthy said.
But Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a sponsor of Helms-Burton, said: "The whole thing is a ruse. If Mr. Axworthy thinks that coming away with a piece of paper signed by Castro is going to make one bit of difference, then I have a bridge I can sell him."
The Helms-Burton Act has created a rift between the United States and its closest allies while prompting Cuban retaliation. Earlier this month, Cuba passed tough new measures that would punish any Americans who filed a suit under the Helms-Burton Act by excluding them from any future compensation for expropriated property.
On Jan. 3, Mr. Clinton delayed for a second six-month period the part of the act that would have allowed Cuban-Americans to file such suits against foreign businesses that have taken over property once owned by American companies in Cuba.
Canada has adopted measures to block the impact of the law. It also has threatened to bring a complaint against the United States because the Helms-Burton Act violates the North American Free Trade Agreement, which guarantees free passage of businessmen in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the three countries that signed the agreement.
Officials of Sherritt International have been denied entry to the United States because the company runs a huge nickel-smelting operation in Cuba that was owned by the American company Freeport-McMoRan of New Orleans before the 1959 revolution.
Mr. Axworthy said no decision had yet been made to go forward with the complaint.

HEADLINE: Albright Picks 2 Diplomats For Top Posts

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Madeleine K. Albright, who was confirmed today by the Senate as Secretary of State by a vote of 99 to 0, has chosen two highly experienced government hands for top jobs in the State Department.
Thomas R. Pickering, 65, the senior professional diplomat in the Foreign Service -- named Ambassador a half-dozen times, most recently serving in Moscow -- will return after a short retirement to become Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the third-ranking job in the State Department, Clinton Administration officials said. He will replace Peter Tarnoff. 
 Stuart E. Eizenstat, 54, a Georgian who ran domestic policy for President Carter and serves as Under Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs, will become Under Secretary for Economic Affairs in the State Department. He succeeds Joan E. Spero.
Ms. Albright, 59 and born in Prague, is expected to be sworn in by President Clinton on Thursday, the first woman to be Secretary of State. By choosing people of such stature for the two appointments, she is understood to be sending a signal to other government departments that she intends that the State Department play the leading foreign-policy role on issues like Mexico, China and Japan, which have had strong economic components.
The Senate vote "signals a new era of bipartisan foreign policy, and I can't wait to get started," Ms. Albright told reporters at the American Mission to the United Nations in New York, where she has been serving as American delegate.
With Mr. Pickering, who has had perhaps the most successful career of any professional diplomat of his generation, Ms. Albright is sending an encouraging message to the Foreign Service officers who are the backbone of the State Department.
Ms. Albright's predecessor, Warren Christopher, was sometimes criticized for letting the Treasury and Commerce Departments, in particular, take the dominant position in policy formulation toward Asia and Latin America.
Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, a close friend of Mr. Clinton's and a prime architect of the Administration's policy toward the former Soviet Union and NATO, will remain in his post for the present. Mr. Talbott, who has been managing the parallel task of NATO expansion and negotiating a document governing NATO's strategic relationship with Russia, is expected to stay at least through July, when the alliance will announce its new members at a Madrid summit conference.
Mr. Pickering stepped down in November as Ambassador to Russia after more than 30 years with the State Department. He was first named an Ambassador in 1974, when he served in Jordan, and has also been Ambassador to Nigeria, El Salvador, Israel and the United Nations.
Mr. Pickering returned to Washington to become director of the Eurasia Foundation, a small, nonprofit organization that works with the post-Soviet states. He is said to have agonized over leaving the foundation so quickly, but both Ms. Albright and Mr. Clinton asked him to take the new job, which he had sought before his retirement.
Mr. Eizenstat, who has also served as American envoy to the European Union, has recently been managing a difficult task: trying to persuade the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other crucial American allies to join Washington in isolating Fidel Castro's Cuba, as called for in the Helms-Burton law, which the President signed last year.
While the European Union still objects to Washington's effort to place sanctions on European companies and business executives for otherwise legal trading ties to Cuba, Mr. Eizenstat has succeeded in getting the Europeans to take a more vocal public stance against Cuban human-rights abuses, enabling Mr. Clinton to renew a waiver of the most contentious part of the law. That section would allow American citizens to bring suit in American courts against foreign companies that operate in property expropriated from Americans, without compensation, when Mr. Castro took power nearly 40 years ago.
In other important positions, Stanley Roth, who had served as the Asia director in Mr. Clinton's National Security Council before joining the U.S. Institute of Peace, a federally financed research institute, is expected to be named Assistant Secretary for East Asia, replacing Winston Lord.
Ms. Albright's chief of staff will be Elaine K. Shocas, a former Federal prosecutor and counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, who served her in the same job at the United Nations. Her spokesman there, James P. Rubin, 36, a former aide to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, will become Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.

HEADLINE: Saul B. Marantz, 85, Pioneer In Hi-Fi Audio Components

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Saul B. Marantz, a pioneer in the development of high-fidelity audio components, died last Thursday at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, N.J. He was 85 and lived in Bridgewater, N.J.
A man of many parts -- photographer, classical guitarist, graphics designer, collector of Chinese and Japanese art -- Mr. Marantz was fascinated by electronics from his boyhood days in Brooklyn. His passion for music led to his first attempts at building audio components. 
 In the 1950's and 60's, the Marantz name became synonymous with audio products that were pleasing to look at, easy to use, durable and sonically first rate. Working with audio engineers like Sidney Smith and Richard Sequerra, Mr. Marantz created a series of vacuum-tube components that became touchstones for the fledgling hi-fi industry. Several of those products, like the Model 9 amplifier and the Model 10B tuner, have become still-working classics that today command as much as $20,000.
With the advent of transistor technology in the early 1960's, Mr. Marantz and his colleagues soon brought forth another benchmark product, the Model 18 receiver. It was an early, high-quality example of what a receiver, which combines the preamplifier, power amplifier and tuner in one box, could be.
To younger audio designers, the Marantz name symbolized clarity of vision and integrity of purpose. When a modern-day audio expert, Mark Levinson, had completed the design of one of his first now-famous components, in 1974, he took it to Mr. Marantz for an appraisal.
"What impressed me about Marantz design was its elegant simplicity, its economy and symmetry," recalled Mr. Levinson, now the president of Cello Music and Film Systems, a high-end electronics company. "In a sense, Marantz was building classics. The equipment was so thoroughly engineered that, once a product was finished, few changes ever were necessary."
After service in the Army during World War II, Mr. Marantz and his wife, Jean Dickey Marantz, settled in Kew Gardens, Queens. One day in 1945, he decided to rip the radio out of his 1940 Mercury, where he rarely listened to it, and put it to more practical use in his house. But that transplant required building additional electronics to make the radio work indoors. Such was the hook that snared Mr. Marantz for life.
Further efforts to refine sound reproduction in his living room led Mr. Marantz to a breakthrough. Piecing together parts and tips he picked up on his frequent visits to a Harvey Radio store in Manhattan, he built a high-quality preamplifier he called the "Consolette."
Word of this musical-sounding new device began to spread across the emerging hi-fi scene, and Mr. Marantz suddenly found himself an entrepreneur, though on a back-room scale. Then into his business walked Mr. Smith, an engineer captivated by Mr. Marantz's sense of the possibilities of sound reproduction. Their creative partnership took the Marantz Company to world prominence.
The two men's shared perfectionism proved to be the original company's downfall. In a recent interview, Mr. Marantz acknowledged that the cost of developing perhaps the most celebrated of all Marantz products, the Model 10B tuner, in which both Mr. Smith and Mr. Sequerra played significant roles, fatally overextended the company's resources.
In 1964, Marantz was sold to Superscope Inc. and has since passed through several hands. The present owner, Philips Electronics N.V., last year reintroduced nearly exact likenesses of the original products under the name of Marantz Classics.
After the sale to Superscope, Mr. Marantz stayed as president until 1968 and then retired -- briefly. In 1972, he co-founded the Dahlquist Company, a maker of high-quality loudspeakers, serving as president until his second retirement in 1978. Last year, he helped to form two new audio businesses, the New Lineage Corporation and Eye Q loudspeakers.
Mr. Marantz was a member of several professional organizations, including the Audio Engineering Society. He served as vice president and member of the board of the Institute of High Fidelity.
He is survived by a daughter, June M. Chamberlain of Bound Brook, N.J.; a brother, Charles E. Marantz of Costa Mesa, Calif.; a sister, Edith M. Marksohn of Oyster Bay Cove, L.I., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Survey Sees 'Moderate' Economic Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Inflation remained subdued despite continued "moderate" growth of the economy, the Federal Reserve's periodic survey of business conditions in all geographic areas showed today.
The findings, which were presaged on Tuesday by comments of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, were a further indication that the central bank was likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting in early February. 
 "District reports provided scattered evidence of increasing wage pressures, particularly for skilled workers, but in general did not indicate significant price pressures other than for energy items," the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said, summarizing the report's findings, which included responses through the second week of January.
The survey, known as the beige book, is a compilation of anecdotes and research from regional Fed banks that is put together to help top Fed officials set policy.
Employers in the Chicago and Richmond districts appeared to have the most trouble filling jobs and were being forced to raise pay accordingly.
In the New York district, which includes the entire state plus northern New Jersey and a small piece of Connecticut, the overall economy "has a slightly firmer tone" than in the preceding survey, on Dec. 4.Holiday retail sales in the district were among the best in the nation.
Among districts that quantified holiday retail sales, New York posted growth of 4 to 8 percent compared with 1995 levels, while sales in Philadelphia rose 5 percent, sales in St. Louis 7 percent and in Minneapolis zero to 2 percent, the Fed survey reported. It also cited a separate poll of small retailers across New York State that showed a gain, before inflation, of 4 to 6 percent for same-store sales, "with the strongest reports coming from Manhattan."
Women's and children's apparel and jewelry were the strongest categories, confirming other appraisals, while electronics and other big-ticket durable items were generally weak.
The survey also cited the New York district, along with Chicago, as having a "firming" of residential real estate prices.
Real estate prices advanced 2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to real estate agents in New York and New Jersey, and the tight New York City-area apartment market seems to have prompted a pickup in construction of buildings.
The pace of permits issued for new apartments more than doubled that of any of the preceding five years, with the bulk of the increase coming in the second half of 1996, the Fed's survey said. Commercial construction was also stronger in the New York district.
In a separate Government report today, the Commerce Department said builders broke ground on single-family homes and apartment buildings at an annual pace of 1,329,000 in December, a decline of 12.2 percent from November.
Although this decline was about triple the consensus estimate, analysts cautioned that the seasonal adjustment process was especially unreliable during the winter months. For all of 1996, starts climbed 8.8 percent, to 1,473,700, the highest total in eight years.
The survey by the Fed of its 12 districts, conducted as part of its preparation for a meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on Feb. 4 and Feb. 5, said, "Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in most parts of the country."
The survey also showed that factory activity expanded or held steady in most areas of the country. Producers of steel and other metals as well as machine tools, construction materials and capital equipment registered the biggest gains.
Wage pressure was most visible in the bidding for skilled factory, administrative and technical workers, especially computer technicians, the Fed reported. "Signs of increasing wage pressures" were reported inChicago, and Richmond characterized these as "more evident." The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis and San Francisco districts also noted worker shortages.
The job market in Spartanburg, S.C., is so tight, the Richmond Fed said, that offers of higher pay for temporary employees were starting to draw workers from low-paying permanent jobs.
The Fed mistakenly posted today's survey on the Internet nearly two hours before its new official release time of 2 P.M. Bob Moore, a Fed aide, said, "We broke our own embargo" but added that officials did not yet know whether the error was related to the fact that until now the beige book was published at noon.
Economic announcements such as this one often move the stock and bond markets, so the releases are carefully timed to prevent some traders from getting unfair advantages from advance knowledge of the data. Mr. Moore said the Fed had received no complaints from traders about the early release of the beige book report.
The Commerce Department's report also showed that the slump in new house and apartment construction was most striking in the West, where starts tumbled 29.2 percent. The Midwest and South declined 7.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, while the Northeast edged down negligibly but from a pace far below that of any other region.
Permits for new homes moved lower by less than 1 percent, to an annual pace of 1,410,000, the Commerce Department's report also showed.
Shipment of mobile homes, for which figures lag a month, eased 4.1 percent in November to a rate of 354,000.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Meeting of Minds: Lebed Meets The Donald

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
During his swing through the corridors of America's business world this week, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general who aspires to be the next President of Russia, hobnobbed with executives at Du Pont in Delaware and sipped tea with Wall Street investors at the Harvard Club in Manhattan.
And then he dropped in on the man who aspires to be the king of New York capitalism. 
 Mr. Lebed, meet Donald Trump.
For almost an hour yesterday, the two men conferred at Trump Tower in a meeting that was declared off-limits to the press. What could be in the works? A five-star hotel and casino smack-dab in Red Square?
Mr. Trump said he did indeed discuss his intentions to build "something major" in Moscow, maybe a hotel, maybe an apartment building. And Mr. Lebed said he was all for it, with one caveat.
"The highest skyscraper in the world cannot be built next to the Kremlin," Mr. Lebed joked. "We cannot allow anyone spitting from the roof of the skyscraper on the Kremlin."
But for all his jokes and witticisms, Mr. Lebed, 46, described his mission as a very serious one. For while the ailing Boris N. Yeltsin remains President of Russia, the campaign to replace him is already under way, at home and abroad. And Mr. Lebed's visit to the United States has been widely viewed as an attempt to win the support of American business executives and to portray himself as the one man who can lead Russia and pave the way for investment and democratic reform there.
"He has come around to the idea that in an attempt to run for the presidency, it's better to have the West in your corner," said Steven Solnick, coordinator of Russian Studies at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. "He may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Bill Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages."
Mr. Lebed received none of that support during his bid for the presidency last year. The retired general, who won the hearts of many ordinary Russians with his critique of the country's hasty embrace of the free market, worried many American politicians and investors with his sometimes autocratic demeanor and crude populist outbursts.
And while his popularity gave him a strong third-place showing at the polls and, briefly, a job as national security chief in the Yeltsin administration, it did not automatically translate into trust from the West.
Mr. Lebed, who was dismissed as security chief in October, took the opportunity provided by an invitation to President Clinton's Inauguration on Monday to visit the United States for the second time in a little more than a month.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, offered the invitation at the behest of an unnamed businessman from his state. And Mr. Lebed used the trip, from Washington to Delaware and on to New York before heading back to Russia yesterday evening, to reassure Americans that as President he would welcome foreign investment and continue the democratic process.
"I want to build a free, democratic Russia," said Mr. Lebed on Tuesday afternoon in his remarks to the United Nations Correspondents Association in New York.
"The only thing I kill now are wars," he added, describing his role in brokering peace accords in Chechnya and Moldova.
He repeatedly stressed similar themes, saying that the Russian Army should not interfere in politics, that obstacles to foreign investment should be removed and that he would not interfere with NATO expansion into Eastern Europe. "Russia should take it calmly," he said. "There should be no hysteria."
But Mr. Lebed also insisted that Russia's brand of democracy would not be transplanted whole from Western soil. Press freedom, he said, would not extend to the publishing of personal affronts to national leaders. And free enterprise would not necessarily include the privatization of the energy, telecommunications and transportation industries.
He left a strong impression on his audience. A bear of a man, with a craggy face and piercing blue eyes, he sat in a wood-paneled dining room at the Harvard Club yesterday in a charcoal-gray suit, his big, restless hands alternately tapping the table and pounding it for emphasis.
But even for those who met him, he remained something of an enigma, especially since he was careful to avoid offering specific details about how he might manage economic and political change. In one meeting, he declared that he would appoint a panel of experts aged 30 to 45 to realign Russia's economic policies, suggesting that anyone older had been psychologically ruined by the Soviet experience.
"While he seems to be aware of the difficulties that investors face," said Jack V. Wirts, the executive vice president of the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization in New York, "I don't think he enunciated any different directions that his government might take."
Still, many of the business people seemed encouraged. A spokeswoman for John A. Krol, president and chief executive of Du Pont, and Jerry A. Blumberg, Du Pont's executive vice president, said their hour-long conference with Mr. Lebed in Delaware on Tuesday morning offered a valuable window into the investment climate in Russia.
"Russia is a key growth market for Du Pont," said Kathy Forte, a spokeswoman for the company.
And Mr. Trump, who gave the retired general a crystal apple as a parting gift, said Mr. Lebed had "a lot of wonderful ideas," though he declined to discuss them.
"He invited me to Russia and I accepted," Mr. Trump said. "I thought he was terrific."
For his part, Mr. Lebed seemed slightly overwhelmed by New York City's technology and architecture. During his visit to Trump Tower, Mr. Trump's steel-and-glass palace on Fifth Avenue, he marveled at the computers on the desks and the automatic lock on the doors. "Very impressive," he said.
And he found the city's skyscrapers a bit unnerving.
"It's hard to get used to the huge towering structures," he said.
Still, Mr. Lebed said the visit had served its purpose.
"I extended the circle of my friends," he said, describing the objectives achieved during his trip. "We made clearer the routes and framework for future cooperation. I've received new guarantees that if I meet certain conditions as President, investments will go to Russia. If the conditions are civilized, the investments will be civilized."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Welfare Chief to Head Social Services in Michigan

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Marva L. Hammons, the head of the sprawling agency that distributes welfare benefits to nearly a million people in New York City, is resigning to become head of social services in Michigan.
The departure of Ms. Hammons, one of the few high-ranking black officials in the Giuliani administration, was not unexpected because she had been consistently shut out of most important decisions involving social services and her agency, the Human Resources Administration. Ms. Hammons was rarely seen at major announcements at City Hall and was not at yesterday's news conference when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced her departure and named her replacement, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli. 
 Ms. Barrios-Paoli is a trusted Giuliani aide who now heads the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Ms. Barrios-Paoli has a reputation as an able administrator who held a number of management positions in the administrations of Mr. Giuliani and Mayor Edward I. Koch, including a seven-year stint at H.R.A.
Advocates for welfare recipients have sharply criticized Ms. Hammons, saying she did little to lead an agency that has long been considered the city's most unmanageable and cumbersome bureaucracy.
But in reality, Mr. Giuliani and his top aides have directly overseen many of the agency's new initiatives themselves, including the city's workfare program, which has put more than 122,000 people to work cleaning streets and parks in return for their benefits, and the fingerprint-imaging program to weed out welfare fraud.
The Mayor congratulated Ms. Hammons on her new appointment yesterday and said, "I want to thank her for the significant contributions she made to restructuring H.R.A."
He reserved higher praise for Ms. Barrios-Paoli, saying, "Her proven capabilities as a leader, manager and an administrator and her commitment to city government will be a tremendous asset to the Human Resources Administration."
Ms. Hammons declined to comment yesterday but issued a statement saying she looked forward to her new job and adding, "I have very much enjoyed working at H.R.A. and have benefited greatly from the support I received from Mayor Giuliani and the staff of the agency."
While Ms. Hammons had receded into the shadows in the Giuliani administration, John Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan's Governor, John Engler, said, "She'll have a very high profile in Michigan because she has the full backing of the Governor."
Governor Engler has been in the forefront of welfare reform at a national level, and has cut the welfare rolls in his own state by more than 140,000, a 46 percent decrease.
In her new job, Ms. Hammons will run an agency that administers cash assistance to about 167,000 people, only a fraction of those handled by New York's Human Resources Administration. She also will be taking a pay cut, from $133,000 to $100,000 a year.
Ms. Hammons took over H.R.A. in 1994, after managing services for Denver's 15,000 welfare recipients.
During her tenure in New York, the city's social service agency lost more than 7,500 employees. Much of the staff reduction occurred when the Mayor stripped away the department's responsibility over child welfare last year and created a new agency to manage the city's foster-care and child-protection programs after the highly publicized beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo.
The caseload also declined significantly in her tenure. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that welfare rolls had been reduced by 220,000 in the last three years, leaving a caseload of about 940,000. Advocates for the poor said that while some of that decline could be attributed to an improved economy, the Mayor's harsh policies accounted for the rest of the drop.
"Really bad things happened under her watch, but it's not clear that she had much to do with any of it," said Liz Krueger, of the Community Food Resource Center, an agency that works with welfare recipients.
Nonprofit organizations that have worked with Ms. Barrios-Paoli in the 10 months she has run the housing preservation agency praised her willingness to work with them but said the department needed someone with more housing expertise. The Mayor has not yet appointed a successor at the housing agency.

HEADLINE: Enterprise's Unconventional Path;
Rental Car Giant Successfully Shuns Industry Shakeout

BYLINE: By GIANNA JACOBSON 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 22

 BODY:
For 40 years, Enterprise Rent-a-Car Inc. has gone against all the conventional industry wisdom. Not only has it ceded the bread-and-butter airport business to Hertz, Avis and other national competitors, but it has also done without celebrity-driven advertisements and catchy slogans.
Yet while the Hertz Corporation and the others got the higher profiles, the St. Louis-based Enterprise has become the industry's giant. 
 Sticking close to the niche it developed -- providing rentals for customers whose cars are being repaired or who need an extra car -- Enterprise is No. 1 in fleet size and locations. And though it trails Hertz in revenues ($3.1 billion versus $3.8 billion in 1996), its estimated $500 million in pretax earnings probably make it No. 1 in profits, too. (Hertz, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, does not disclose earnings.)
"Enterprise's track record is astonishing," said Jon LeSage, editor of Auto Rental News, a trade publication based in Redondo Beach, Calif. "They have very quietly and humbly built an empire."
Now, as the $16.5 billion industry reorganizes in the wake of a six-month spate of acquisition deals, the question is whether Enterprise and its owners, the founding Taylor family, can keep that empire, and all those profits, largely to themselves.
Auto manufacturers, stuck with hefty write-offs or paltry profits from their rental car subsidiaries, are beating a hasty retreat from the overcrowded business, which no longer is needed, as it was during the recession, as a captive market for new cars. In the last six months, four of the biggest rental car companies have changed hands, or are about to. Two others are for sale, and Hertz itself may be heading for the block as well.
The changing of the guard ushers in two wily financial chieftains -- H. Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster Video, and Henry Silverman, head of HFS Inc., the world's largest franchiser of hotels and real estate offices -- who promise to bring a new aggressiveness to the business. Mr. Huizenga's Republic Industries owns Alamo Rent-a-Car and is in the process of buying National Car Rental; HFS owns Avis Rent a Car.
Characteristically, the Taylors say they will continue to go against the grain, keeping Enterprise in the family and out of the airports. And, they say, they are more than capable of fending off the inevitable assault on their profitable terrain.
"I am watching this frenzy with fascination, but I am sitting on the sidelines," said Andrew Taylor, Enterprise's chief executive and son of the company's founder and chairman, Jack Taylor. "Everybody wants to throw us in the same pot with the other rental car companies, but our businesses are different. We have no plans to be in the airports. We're sticking to our niche."
And why not? Enterprise dominates the replacement niche, also known as the home-city rental business, with more than 70 percent of the market, according to a report prepared by Jordan Hymowitz, an industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
"Not only is Enterprise profitable, but it is in the fastest-growing and least competitive rental car niche," the report said. "An industry adage states there are two types of rental car companies: those that lose money and Enterprise."
But if Andrew Taylor is not going after the "Airport Seven," as he calls them, he concedes that they are beginning to invade his turf.
"They're coming after us," he said, "no question."
Already, Hertz is revamping its replacement division, dubbed H.I.R.E. (for Hertz Insurance Replacement Entity), and Alamo is considering a similar division.
"Whenever you have one player in a market segment, there is room for competitors," said Joseph Russo, a Hertz spokesman.
Andrew Taylor responded with typical competitive fervor: "Our delivery network is tough to compete against. Our ability to move people and resources around the organization is pretty awesome. It will be interesting to see who gets that growth in market share."
Indeed, Enterprise is a maverick in a lot of ways that have paid off and will be hard to match. Simply by locating its 3,100 branches away from airports, it reduces overhead significantly by cutting out high concession fees. It saves more by handling its own reservations, avoiding 10 percent travel agent commissions and a separate 3 percent fee that other rental car companies pay to use a shared reservation system. And it employs a highly sophisticated computer network to track the whereabouts and service history of each of its 315,100 cars, keeping inventory lean and cars on the road an average of six months longer than Hertz and Avis do. At the same time, the company is known for its extra level of service: it often delivers cars to customers' homes or takes customers to the cars.
The new market picture will become clearer in the next year, as the industry adjusts to all the ownership changes. HFS touched off the flurry of deals last July, when it bought Avis from its employees and the General Motors Corporation for $800 million. In the last few weeks alone, these deals or related events have transpired:
*Team Rental Group Inc. said it was acquiring the Budget Rent a Car Company from Ford for $350 million. Team Rental is the largest Budget franchisee.
*Republic Industries announced its intention to buy National from G.M. for $600 million, on the heels of its purchase of Alamo from Michael Egan, a rental car executive who owned 94 percent of Alamo, for $625 million.
*The Chrysler Corporation put its Dollar Rent-a-Car and Thrifty Car Rental divisions on the block.
*Ford said it was exploring possibilities for Hertz, including an initial public offering and a spinoff.
"I've never seen anything like this frenzy of activity around the rental car business," said Neil Abrams, a Purchase, N.Y., auto rental industry consultant. "What is remarkable about Enterprise is that it is the only major player in the industry that has had no changes in ownership or top management in the past four years."
The rental car companies that had been owned by the car makers relied heavily on manufacturer subsidies for what little profitability they had.
With the recent deals, financial managers have taken over the show. Mr. Huizenga will use National and Alamo as a "used car factory" of sorts, according to the Montgomery Securities report. Both will supply cars for Republic's budding Auto Nation USA chain, which sells late-model used cars.
Mr. Silverman of HFS also hopes to benefit from having complementary businesses. With such well-known chains as Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Days Inn, ERA, Howard Johnson, Ramada (U.S.), Super 8 and Travelodge, HFS operates a vast reservation system with endless opportunities to promote Avis rentals.
The increased emphasis on profitability is unlikely, however, to result in consumers paying more for rentals, experts say, because the industry is too fee-competitive. "We are not optimistic about seeing even modest price increases in the near future," Mr. Hymowitz, the analyst, wrote.
As the dust settles, Andrew Taylor remains bullish about Enterprise's prospects, estimating revenues will jump to $6 billion by 2001.
The company will grow, he said, by opening more branches across the United States and especially abroad. With 150 branches in Canada and Britain, Enterprise is preparing to venture into Western Europe next, beginning in Germany.
Enterprise also wants to amass local and regional players in the replacement rental market. Last year, it bought Standard Rent-a-Car, a Sacramento, Calif., company, and Agency Rent-a-Car, a replacement division of Avis spun off by HFS. Enterprise closed Agency's branches shortly after the purchase.
As ambitious as Enterprise's plans are, Andrew Taylor is quick to point out, "We don't have to grow." At least not in light of the estimates that place its profits at the $500 million level, according to Mr. LeSage of Auto Rental News.
Enterprise's secret profitability weapon, Mr. LeSage said, is management of fleet costs, which account for nearly half of operating expenses.
While the business and leisure rental car companies have relied on manufacturer subsidies and buybacks, "nobody is better than Enterprise at negotiating prices to buy and sell cars," Mr. LeSage said. Enterprise sells its cars at 30 retail lots it owns around the country, in a fashion nearly identical to Mr. Huizenga's much-heralded chain.
Though Enterprise has grown most quickly in the last 15 years, it has long benefited from innovative strategies. Jack Taylor, a World War II fighter pilot aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise (hence the company name), left his job as a Cadillac salesman in 1957 to effectively invent the concept of auto leasing with his first venture, Executive Leasing.
As leasing began taking off nationwide in the 1970's, the father-son team started to push their replacement-rental business -- which they had formed in 1963, with 17 cars -- as a service to leasing customers.
"We could see this niche and we figured there was something here," said Andrew Taylor, 49, who took over as chief executive in 1991. "There was an evolution of people's reliance on having transportation all of the time, and we were fortunate to ride that wave."
Executive Leasing remains a division of Enterprise, though it accounts for less than 5 percent of the company's gross revenues.
A highly decentralized network of company-owned branches -- "a confederation of small businesses," in Andrew Taylor's description -- fuels Enterprise's growth on the strength of referral relationships with auto dealers, insurance agents and adjusters and body shops. Competition among the branches is notorious, with managers encouraged by the home office to place bets with each other on staff performance. (The losers might pay for dinner or work extra hours at the winning branch.)
But as Enterprise grows, Andrew Taylor says, it is getting harder to find enough employees with the competitive mind-set he seeks and the affability necessary to work with the public for long hours.
This year alone, Enterprise is preparing to hire 10,000 college graduates for its management training program, making it one of the nation's largest hirers. Enterprise now has 31,000 employees.
About 25 percent of the new hires will leave before six months. Those who stay do everything from washing cars and picking up customers to handling paperwork. Almost everybody in the company, from Andrew Taylor down, goes through the program. As Mr. Taylor likes to say, "We've all had our ties sucked into the vacuum."
Richard Allen, the Enterprise vice president who leads the recruiting effort, recognizes the enormousness of the job. "We need more people than most companies to facilitate our ongoing growth," he said. "We need to be more aggressive than most in who we hire."
As the industry begins a new era, aggressive will be the watchword at Enterprise for more than just hiring.
"This is a business of details, not brilliance," Andrew Taylor said. "Our customers don't care if we have the best computer system. They want someone to look them in the eye and ask, 'How can I help you?' "

HEADLINE: Hometown Recalls Paul Tsongas as Hero Who Inspired Renewal and Pride

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Jan. 21

 BODY:
To most people beyond this city, Paul Tsongas was the man with the odd voice who made a quixotic run for the Presidency in 1992. No one really believed that Paul Tsongas was going to be President.
To Lowell, he was the favorite first son whose extraordinary relationship with this once dying mill town transformed it, and the people who live here. The local newspaper, The Sun, made Mr. Tsongas's legacy clear in Sunday's front-page obituary: "He leaves his family and the city he resurrected." 
 Because of Mr. Tsongas's vision, Lowell, a city of 103,000 people about 25 miles northwest of Boston, has a national historic park that draws thousands of tourists each year, a minor league baseball team, a new stadium on the way, a Sheraton hotel, 14 new schools, thousands of jobs and, as important as all the bricks and dollars, renewed civic pride.
"He made it cool to be from Lowell," said James Cook, one of the former Senator's legions of hometown friends and director of the Lowell Plan and the Lowell Development Finance Corporation, a nonprofit economic development group started by Mr. Tsongas. "Twenty-two years ago, you used to say you lived north of Boston. Now you say you're from Lowell, and proud of it."
Mr. Tsongas, a Democrat who died of pneumonia on Saturday at the age of 55 after a long battle with cancer, went to Washington as a United States representative in 1975, and was elected to the Senate in 1978. He stunned nearly everybody in 1984 when he decided to retire after one term because of his cancer. But he never left Lowell or, in a way, his first job in politics as a Lowell City Councilor.
Two weeks before his death, from his hospital bed in Boston, so weak that nurses had to dial the phone for him, he was calling around town to make sure there were enough City Council votes to keep the planned baseball stadium downtown, Mr. Cook said. (The Council voted, 9 to 0, in favor of the downtown site.)
Mr. Tsongas never passed up an opportunity to promote his hometown, not even in death. In an extraordinary public relations stroke, he arranged for a public wake to be held at his Victorian house, in the stately neighborhood where the mill owners once lived, so the mourners would have a chance to see Lowell.
Thousands of people -- including the waitresses who served him coffee, the Mayor, Edward Caulfield, and the people from all over the state who never met him but wanted to pay their respects -- have filed past his coffin and through his beloved city this week.
"He was the pillar of the Lowell community," said 71-year-old Arthur C. Anton, the owner of Anton's Cleaners and a friend of Mr. Tsongas's father, who also owned a dry cleaning business, as he left the Tsongas house this evening. "He had an ability to get people to respond to his vision, his dreams. We're so proud of him for what he has done for us, and what he left us."
With his back bent against the biting cold, Mr. Anton stood on the sidewalk, talking about the Lowell National Historical Park, which was signed into Federal law in 1978, thanks to Mr. Tsongas's efforts.
"We would never have the park if it weren't for Paul," Mr. Anton said. "You know how many tourists we get now because of it? They all come to see how the mills began, the quilt museum, the mill girls."
Mr. Tsongas's funeral, to be held on Thursday, is another opportunity to show off a revitalized Lowell. The funeral cortege is scheduled to go from the Transfiguration Church past Cawley Stadium, where the baseball team, the Spinners, will play until the promised new stadium is built; past the Paul E. Tsongas Arena now under construction, and the newly renovated Lowell High School, and onto the Lowell Cemetery, high on a ridge overlooking the Merrimack River, where Mr. Tsongas will be buried near his Greek immigrant parents, Efthemios George and Katina Tsongas.
It is also in deference to Mr. Tsongas's wishes that all week his friends and colleagues have been talking up the city even as they have been grieving for the man.
"He'd be kicking us right now if we weren't doing our jobs promoting the city," Mr. Cook said. "He had arranged that we would all talk to the media when and if it happened. It was the same thing when he was running for President. He joked that it was his marketing campaign for the city of Lowell."
Mr. Tsongas's obsession with Lowell could be exasperating to those who wanted him to be President.
"There we were on the Presidential campaign plane, and he would be talking to somebody about some zoning regulation in Lowell," said Edward F. Jesser, a Boston political consultant, who was Mr. Tsongas's media adviser during the former Senator's campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination five years ago.
From the campaign trail, from Washington, from his hospital bed, Mr. Tsongas stayed in touch with Richard Howe, the elder statesman of the Lowell City Council. "He was always a Lowellian," said Mr. Howe, who has served on the Council since 1965.
When Mr. Tsongas was elected to the Council in 1969, Lowell, an industrial city of Greek, Portugese and French Canadian immigrants, had double-digit unemployment. Nearly half a century after the mills had moved South, the city's downtown business district was blighted by abandoned and dilapidated buildings.
"Between 1950 and 1970, Lowell just hit rock bottom," Mr. Howe said. "For youngsters graduating from high school, the only goal was to get out of Lowell. Our goal was to change the mood and the atmosphere and the direction government was going."
Over time, Mr. Howe and a group of others, led by Mr. Tsongas, made Lowell a place where people wanted to stay. As a Congressman, Mr. Tsongas was able to secure millions of dollars in state and Federal funds for improvement projects for Lowell.
He did menial labor, too. One of the rituals of life in Lowell was seeing Mr. Tsongas at work in Kittredge Park, the green space that he had helped restore.
"I would drive down the street, and there would be this former Presidential candidate sweeping the leaves out of the gutter," said the Rev. David Malone, the pastor of the Eliot Church, whose hundreds of Cambodian parishioners reflect the changing demographics of Lowell. "It's one of the most powerful images in my 55 years as an American citizen. He'd be there with his broom and a dustpan."
Three weeks ago, Mr. Cook said, Mr. Tsongas called him from the hospital to ask him to bring him three photographs -- one of the arena under construction, another of the new supermarket being built in the Acre neighborhood, and one of Kittredge Park.
Mr. Cook had the pictures taken, and brought them to the hospital. "We set them up on his windowsill," he said.
"He loved this city as much as anyone I ever met," Mr. Cook added. "Every team needs a coach or a cheerleader. He was both for Lowell."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Wall Street Helps the Many Who Had a Bad Year

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Lifted by donations from the employees of seven Wall Street firms, total contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund shot upward yesterday, crossing the $4 million mark on a pace expected to result in the fund's second-best finish ever.
But at a time when social service providers say they are bracing for changes in the welfare laws that will mean less public money and services for the poor, and though the economy remains strong, the fund trails far behind the record-setting appeal at the height of a recession five years ago. 
 Yesterday, the fund's 85th annual appeal, which runs through Feb. 28, had collected $4,001,272.25, about $300,000 more than last year at the same time. But that is still about $425,000 behind the pace of the 80th annual appeal, which went on to finish with a record $5,083,520.81 in 1992.
Leaders of the social service agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund said the mixed success of this year's appeal left them with conflicting emotions, troubled by a sense of increased cynicism among Americans about charitable giving, yet grateful that many had recognized the deeper need and given more.
"The irony of the whole situation is that the level of human misery is increasing geometrically and there is a compassion fatigue out there," said Stephen D. Solender, chief executive of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven charities benefited by the fund.
Among the contributors who have helped the fund outperform last year were 346 employees from seven Wall Street firms, who contributed more than $90,000. Once the firms submit corporate matching gifts, the donations will total about $125,000, up from about $88,000 last year.
James Valentine, 31, who tracks the railroad and trucking industries as an equity researcher for Salomon Brothers, and his wife, Emma, 28, gave $20,000, the largest of the Wall Street contributions, because they were concerned about children.
"I think it was a good year for me, a good year for Salomon," he said, "and I think that the donation will make a much bigger impact on the children it's going to serve than it would have on my wife and me. I think in New York more than in many other places in the U.S. there are many children in need. Given the compensation levels on Wall Street, we figured it was the least we could do."
The Wall Street effort to support New York's neediest is spearheaded by first- and second-year analysts, typically the youngest workers in an investment bank. It is organized by Salomon Brothers, which coordinates the donations from other firms. "I think the key selling point is the money is going directly to the people who need it most," said Christian B. Hensley, 22, a coordinator.
Malcolm Kostuchenko, 24,, another coordinator, said: "We have a list of the charities. The New York Times covers the overhead and we have documented stories about how it works. People feel very comfortable going ahead and giving."
This week's contribution, the first of two, included gifts from employees at Salomon Brothers, Paine Webber; Morgan Stanley; Merrill Lynch; Goldman, Sachs; Bear, Stearns and Dillon, Read. The second Wall Street gift is expected at the end of February near the close of the appeal, and is to include contributions from additional firms.
To meet the ever-growing social service needs of New York's poor, particularly immigrants and refugees, Mr. Solender and other social service providers said, the call must go out for a wider response from a greater part of the city's citizenry.
"You could see real hell in this city," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, another agency supported by the fund. "The confluence of all these negative policies is beyond my ability to comprehend. This message hasn't permeated the public consciousness yet."
Permeating the public consciousness was precisely the goal of Adolph S. Ochs, the former publisher of The Times, when he started the Neediest Cases Fund in 1912. Moved by a chance encounter with an immigrant pauper on a winter night, Mr. Ochs reasoned that if New Yorkers only knew how some of their neighbors lived, they would be anxious to help.
He assigned a reporter to delve into the files of some of the city's largest and oldest social service organizations. The stories first appeared in the newspaper's magazine section under the headline: "Santa Claus, Please Take Notice! Here Are New York's 100 Neediest Cases."
The Wall Street workers were not the only ones to notice the greater need this year. "I too am raising my gift for this year," Glen Winters of East Setauket, L.I., wrote in a note accompanying her $125 donation. "What the new welfare laws will mean to many wounded recipients, I hate to think."
Ms. Winters, 72, a retired Federal employee who helped start Suffolk County's Head Start program 30 years ago, said she gave to the fund for the first time last year. "I always wanted to," she said, "and I decided why do I keep putting this off? I just think we are going to have a lot of problems."

NEW YORK
 
Police Union Officials Indicted
Federal authorities charged in an indictment that top officials of the union that represented the transit police took kickbacks and engaged in several other schemes before the force merged with the city Police Department. The announcement was seized on by Mayor Giuliani, who noted that among those indicted is a negotiator for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. That union rejected the city's contract offer, a development Mr. Giuliani said was linked to legal problems involving P.B.A. officials and negotiators. [Page A1.] 

In what may be the singular paradox of the Giuliani era, his administration's relationship with the P.B.A. may be more bitter than that of his predecessor. News Analysis. [B6.]
 
City Seeks Hospital Partner
Seeking to wrest more control from the private medical centers that staff its public hospitals, New York City officials said they would seek a new partner for the city's largest medical-care contract -- a $100 million deal to run the Queens and Elmhurst Hospital Centers. [B1.]
 
D'Amato Behind Bill's Passage
Of all the politicians involved in arranging the agreement to pass legislation providing women longer hospital stays after mastectomies, the lawmaker most responsible was Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. The measure's passage provided yet another example of how Mr. D'Amato uses his influence over the state's political leaders to push issues important to him through the Legislature. [B1.]
 
Girl Hurt in School Fall
Trying to hide from a dean who was looking for her and other students who had cut class, a 13-year-old girl was injured when she fell two floors down an air shaft at an intermediate school in Queens, police officers and school officials said. [B3.]
 
Mayor Wins on Airport Rent
Mayor Giuliani won a victory in his long-running battle with the Port Authority over back rent at the city's two airports when the Federal Aviation Administration partially reversed a decision it had made. [B3.]
 
$20 Million Gift to Cornell
David A. Duffield, a Cornell University alumnus who amassed a fortune in the development of computer software, is giving his alma mater $20 million toward the construction of laboratories and classrooms to train the next generation of scientists and engineers. [B4.]
 
Head of Welfare Agency Quits
Marva L. Hammons, the head of the sprawling agency that distributes welfare benefits to nearly a million people in New York City, is resigning to become head of social services in Michigan. [B5.]
 
Police Commander Suspended
The commanding officer of the Police Department's licensing division was suspended without pay after he was accused of doing favors for friends, the police said. [B6.]
 
Court-Martial Testimony
Testimony in the court-martial of a male cadet charged with raping a female classmate focused on the questions of precisely how drunk the 20-year-old woman was and, by implication, whether she had the ability to consent to a sexual act. [B9.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Plan to Solve Segregation
A panel established by Gov. John G. Rowland to address segregation in the state's schools said that the state should require school districts to accept students from anywhere in Connecticut and should pay more for school construction projects that bring black and Hispanic students into mostly white districts. [B6.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Passion for Giving Revealed
Over the last 15 years a self-made entrepreneur from New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to hospitals, universities and other beneficiaries -- but has done it in such secrecy that most recipients never learned who their benefactor was. The donor is Charles F. Feeney, who made his fortune with a string of duty-free airport shops. While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of, the scope and style of Mr. Feeney's giving, and his passion for total secrecy, are unique. [A1.]
 
Charles F. Feeney said he never forgot his humble beginnings. [B4.]
 
Mall Still a Lure for Shoppers
While others took advantage of the tax-free week in New York, there were those who still made the trip to the Newport Center Mall in Jersey City to do their shopping. Perhaps for those in the mall habit, the lack of a tax on clothing just can't compete with the comfort of a climate-controlled Main Street. Our Towns by Evelyn Nieves. [B1.]
 
METRO BUSINESS
 
Finding Niche in 99 Stores
Seizing on the "one-price" mania that burst onto the retailing scene in the early 1990's and creating a new employment niche, three extended Pakistani families have opened 34 of the so-called 99 stores, most in New York City, a few in New Jersey, in the past five years. [B1.]
 
City Outpaces Suburbs on Jobs
One of the tenets of economics in America is that suburbs create more jobs than cities. Last year, New York City broke that pattern. For the first time since 1980, the city outshone its entire suburban encirclement of office parks and edge cities in making new jobs. [B8.]
 
Success Lurks in Whitman Plan
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposal to allow motorists to buy no-frills no-fault insurance that reduces their premiums was widely seen as classic pocketbook politics. But the seal of approval for "auto choice" insurance reform from the adroit Republican could prove the breakthrough that bipartisan proponents have been waiting for. Economic Scene in Business Day.

China Now Leads In Crude Steel Production

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
China replaced Japan in 1996 as the world's leading crude steel producer, a Japanese industry group said yesterday. China's output last year rose 5.2 percent, to 110.4 million tons, ahead of Japan's output of 98.8 million tons, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. The group attributed China's increased output to that country's economic expansion. 
 Japan's 1996 production fell 2.8 percent from the record high of 101.7 million tons in 1995, which resulted in part from the rebuilding after the January 1995 earthquake in Kobe. The United States continued to occupy third place, with a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 95.9 million tons, the group said.

A Boom in Tourism

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Tourism is booming in New York City. According to the latest estimates, 30.3 million people visited the city last year, pouring $13 billion into the local economy. So why is the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau rolling out a major campaign to lure tourists with discounts at 250 hotels, restaurants, stores and cultural institutions? Two words: The cold.
"We have now entered the slowest time of the year for the 25,000 tourism-related businesses and their 130,000 employees," said Stephen J. Morello, the bureau's president. "It's not because we have less to offer but because the weather makes us less competitive. We can't sit back and let the city sell itself." 
 Indeed, after the New Year, the hotel occupancy rate dips to somewhere between 65 percent and 70 percent, compared with last year's average occupancy rate of 81 percent.
Fifteen hotels, from the Days to the Ritz-Carlton New York, are participating in the campaign called "New York for a Song," by offering discounts of up to 40 percent. Hotel guests will receive a "fun pass" -- a subway Metrocard with one free fare and a discount at participating restaurants, stores, theaters and museums. The campaign is scheduled to run through the end of March.

HEADLINE: He Gave Away $600 Million, and No One Knew

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Over the last 15 years, a businessman from New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to universities, medical centers and other beneficiaries -- but has done it in such secrecy that most recipients never learned who their benefactor was.
The donor, Charles F. Feeney, who made his fortune with a string of duty-free airport shops, covered his tracks so well that business magazines for years have estimated his net worth in the billions, not realizing that he had transferred most of his assets to his two charitable foundations and is actually worth less than $5 million. 
 After years of secrecy, Mr. Feeney, who is 65, agreed this week to discuss his gifts because the duty-free stores were sold this month to the company that makes Moet & Chandon Champagne, and a lawsuit over the sale would have revealed his anonymous donations.
Mr. Feeney -- who has both Irish and American citizenship and has also made many gifts to Irish groups, including personal donations to Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing -- was matter-of-fact in describing why he had given away his fortune. "I simply decided I had enough money," he said. "It doesn't drive my life. I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of guy."
Harvey P. Dale, a New York University tax law professor and president of Mr. Feeney's Atlantic Foundation, who has helped Mr. Feeney orchestrate his gifts since 1982, said: "He doesn't own a house. He doesn't own a car. He flies economy. And I think his watch cost about $15."
While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of, the scope and style of Mr. Feeney's giving, and his passion for secrecy, appeared to be unique, according to independent experts on philanthropy. "I've never heard of anything like this," said Thomas A. Troyer, a senior partner in the law firm of Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, who specializes in philanthropic law.
From the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to Portland State University, none of the American recipients of Mr. Feeney's largesse knew who their benefactor was. Grants were paid by cashier's check to conceal the source. In fact, the beneficiaries never realized that they owed their thanks to a single giver -- they were told that the money came from several generous "clients" who wished to remain anonymous.
Few of the recipients had ever even met Mr. Dale or Joel L. Fleishman, the president of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which gave away the money on behalf of Mr. Feeney's foundations, the Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust.
Dr. Robert Butler, chairman of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said he met Mr. Feeney in 1990 while making a proposal to an advisory board that reviewed grant proposals.
"I had no idea that he was the main supporter of what I call the Anonymous Foundation," Dr. Butler said, adding that the grant was made, starting the International Longevity Center at the New York Academy of Medicine. "Anonymous giving, giving that is not dependent on ego, is just really rare."
Mr. Feeney said that by giving anonymously, he could go about his life unhampered by pitches for donations. "There are people who want, and rightly deserve, recognition for giving, but in our case it wasn't important," he said.
It was Mr. Dale who helped Mr. Feeney set up his foundations, which like his Duty-Free Shoppes chain are based in Bermuda, avoiding the disclosure requirements of private foundations in the United States. Mr. Feeney also declined to take a deduction on his personal income taxes for the money he gave to the foundations, in order to preserve the secrecy. And Atlantic Philanthropic Services, the New York-based entity that screens applicants and writes the checks, is a for-profit company, also avoiding disclosure rules.
Mr. Feeney gave his entire 38.75 percent interest in the duty-free chain, known as DFS Group, to the two foundations in 1984 (even his partner, Robert W. Miller, was not told). Now, the foundations have received the proceeds from the sale of the controlling interest in the chain to LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton of France. The chain has sales of more than $3 billion annually, mostly in liquors and luxury goods, more than the combined sales of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus.
The sale proceeds, along with other business assets Mr. Feeney has turned over to the foundations, have left the charity with $3.5 billion, even after the $610 million that has already been distributed to charities. It would rank as the nation's fourth-largest grant-making foundation if it were based in the United States, yet the two groups operate with tiny staffs, just 20 professionals in the United States and overseas.
The foundation's largest single grant was $30 million, according to Mr. Dale, who refused to identify the recipient on grounds that the information might discourage other donors from supporting it. "One reason for keeping gifts anonymous is to avoid what we call this 'crowding out' effect," Mr. Dale said.
Recipients were effusive in their praise for their anonymous donor's style of giving and what it had enabled them to do. "This is operational support, the most valuable kind of assistance," said William Nelsen, president of the Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America, in St. Peter, Minn., which has received support since 1984.
Mr. Nelson said that the group, which mobilizes community groups to raise money for college student aid, was able to significantly expand its "Dollars for Scholars" program to reach 770 chapters throughout the country, thanks in large part to Atlantic money, which he said was more than a million dollars.
"As an organization, we've more than quadrupled in size since getting support from this anonymous donor," Mr. Nelsen said.
At the College Board, which administers scholastic assessment tests for college-bound high school seniors, the mystery donor was always referred to by the name "anonymous," said Dr. Donald Stewart, president of the College Board.
"Anonymous was most interested in results," Dr. Stewart said. The anonymous donor supported "long-term research to establish whether we are right, which is crucial for the project's credibility and in assessing whether all schools should adopt the same approach," he said.
Several recipients said that once they were invited to apply for funds their plans were closely examined. "Ed McMahon did not knock on my door," said Chuck Supple, president of Public Allies, which places young people in internships with nonprofit organizations. "These guys really kick the tires."
Judith Ramaley, president of Portland State University, in Oregon, called her first foundation grant last year her "catalyst," less than one million dollars that enabled the school to publicize its innovative new curriculum and links to the community, which have now drawn national attention and the support of other foundations. "They were the trail mix at that key moment on our very steep hiking path," she said.
One-fourth of Mr. Feeney's contributions have been made abroad, half of that in Ireland. The foundation also supports projects in South Africa, the former Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, Israel and Jordan. There was less secrecy surrounding Mr. Feeney's activities in Ireland. Several Irish university presidents and other beneficiaries said they had met Mr. Feeney several times.
Mr. Feeney also said he had given substantial personal donations -- not from the Atlantic foundations -- in the last two years to the Washington office of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which in 1994 entered into a cease-fire with the British that was broken last February. Public records show that Mr. Feeney has contributed some $280,000 -- making him the group's single largest American donor.
While Mr. Feeney acknowledged that some would criticize his support for a group linked to the I.R.A, he said his gifts to Sinn Fein had been monitored to insure that they supported only nonviolent activities. He continued supporting the Washington office despite the cease-fire's collapse, he said, "because I'm hopeful that it will be renewed."
The Atlantic Foundation's board of directors includes several prominent personalities in the philanthropic and educational establishment -- among them, Elizabeth McCormack, a senior adviser on charitable giving to members of the Rockefeller family and vice chairwoman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation; Frank H. T. Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University, Michael I. Sovern, president of the Shubert Foundation and president emeritus of Columbia University, and Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., an attorney and chairman of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
None of them had previously disclosed their connection with the Atlantic groups publicly, nor did they discuss Mr. Feeney's giving with peers or even their families, they said in interviews this week. "This organization has operated on a need-to-know basis," Mr. Fleishman said.
Most recipients said their only contact was with program officers of Atlantic Philanthropic Services.
Mr. Rhodes, the foundation board member and former president of Cornell, said that the foundation was careful not to use money to tell recipients what to do or how to do it. "The danger with foundations is that sometimes the staff and board come to feel that they own the money," Mr. Rhodes said, "and they micromanage. We have a motto: noses in, fingers out."
Mr. Dale said of the relationship to grant recipients: "We are voyeurs. We let good people do good things. We oversee, but we don't interfere."
And despite his decision finally to disclose his donations, Mr. Feeney is still trying to keep a low profile. He declined this week to be photographed.

HEADLINE: Save Social Security, Save Our Families

BYLINE: By Gary L. Bauer; Gary L. Bauer is president of the Family Research Council.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, I have worked to defend average American families, which time and again get the short end of the stick. I fear they will be the chief victims again as Washington considers three plans to "reform" Social Security, all based on putting payroll taxes or private contributions into the stock market.
Social Security, as designed in the 1930's, provides special compensations for couples who devote themselves to rearing children during their active years. A woman who never takes a job receives at least 50 percent of her retired husband's benefits. If her husband dies, she receives 100 percent of his benefits. There are also survivor benefits for children who are orphaned or who have a lost a bread-winning parent. 
 Any privatization plan that makes benefits dependent on lifetime contributions by a payroll worker would leave these women and children out in the cold. Is this the message we want to send to parents making huge sacrifices in time and money to raise our next generation of workers?
Moreover, any plan to replace the modified pay-as-you-go system we have now with a contributory system would involve a long transition during which workers would have to continue to pay taxes for their parents' retirement while contributing dollars for their own. The only way to do this, assuming that current recipients would not be cut off abruptly, would be through colossal tax increases or enormous growth in Federal deficits.
To pay for this transition, the privatization plan favored by five of the 13 members of the Social Security Advisory Council would require a 20 percent increase in the present payroll tax for workers and employers, effective for the next 70 years. The only reason that the increase is not far bigger is that this plan would also ask the Government to borrow an additional $7.2 trillion over the decades ahead, to be paid off by 2070.
Another plan offered by the advisory council would finance privatization completely through even higher payroll taxes. If so, according to Sylvester Schieber, a council member, payroll tax rates would increase to 19.3 percent (from the current 15.3 percent), a whopping 26 percent increase.
 The rush to overhaul Social Security has been fueled by questionable economic assumptions. The idea of having workers put their retirement dollars into the stock market rather than into government bonds, as is the case today, has tremendous appeal during a record bull market: The Dow Jones industrial average has multiplied eight times in 15 years.
Yet the advisory council based its plans on the assumption that the market will continue to grow in the decades ahead at a rate equal to or greater than the current pace. So for the privatization plans to work, the Dow would have to be in the neighborhood of 52,000 by 2012. Is this realistic? I haven't found very many economic historians who think so.
 Still, no matter what the market does, why do we think the nation will be better off by forcing workers to put their money into stock rather than, say, spending it on rearing children? The late Theodore Schultz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, concluded from his landmark study of postwar economic recovery that human capital is roughly twice as important as monetary capital in generating economic growth. It is people who matter, not things, in generating the wealth of a nation.
It is possible to reform Social Security and to avoid the huge deficits projected to occur when baby boomers retire without placing an undue burden on today's families. As a first step, the retirement age, which is scheduled to be raised to 67 in the next century, should instead be raised periodically to reflect changes in life expectancy. Payroll taxes, instead of being sharply increased, should be cut by 20 percent for workers and employers, with employees who benefit from the tax cut receiving a commensurate reduction in their future benefits.
Such changes would help rein in entitlement growth while giving working families flexibility to make their own decisions in raising the next generation of the world's most productive workers.

Happier Motoring: Choices in Buying Insurance

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The proposal from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey last week to allow motorists to buy no-frills, no-fault auto insurance that could pare premiums by as much as one-fourth was a strong endorsement for a fledgling idea that has been unable to take flight nationally. The idea is known as auto choice, and the seal of approval from an adroit Republican who has her sights on bigger things, may finally be the step that lifts it off the ground.
"Once people understand auto choice means lower premiums and better coverage, it's a no-brainer," argues Peter Kinzler, director of the Coalition for Auto Insurance Reform, an ad hoc group of consumer activists that operates without funds from the insurance industry. 
 From the perspective of reformers, the Whitman endorsement could not come at a more opportune time. Next week Mr. Kinzler's group, along with the University of Wisconsin's Auto Compensation Project, is sponsoring a conference in Washington to highlight the virtues of auto choice and to publicize the introduction of legislation by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, and Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky.
One reason auto insurance is so expensive is that it costs a fortune to determine liability in court. Plaintiffs' lawyers typically take one-third to one-half of any compensation. Moreover, the ability to sue for payoffs far exceeding injury victims' medical bills and lost wages encourages fraud. In 1995 Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, estimated that fraud added $200 to the average household's insurance cost.
No-fault insurance, requiring insurers to cover their own clients' economic losses regardless of fault and permitting suits only when injuries are severe, was supposed to contain this colossal waste. But trial lawyers have maintained the upper hand by keeping it relatively easy to get to court in most states.
Stricter no-fault laws that barred all suits against offending drivers whose behavior is short of criminal would do the trick. But this approach is a nonstarter, in no small part because of opposition from Ralph Nader, who sees no-fault as an unacceptable interference with every American's right to a day in court. That's where auto choice fits in.
The invention of Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia, and Michael J. Horowitz, a fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, auto choice is just what it sounds like. Those who value the right to sue for pain and suffering could still buy insurance to do that. Those who do not could save money by limiting their insurance to no-fault protection covering medical bills and lost wages.
When two drivers who chose the no-fault protection were involved in an accident, each would look to his own insurer for compensation. When two drivers who bought pain and suffering insurance collided, responsibility -- and compensation -- would be settled through the legal system.
It gets a bit more complicated if a fully covered "pain and suffering" driver collided with a no-fault driver. Here, the fully covered driver would not be able to sue the other for pain and suffering. Rather, he would look to his own insurer for compensation. This may sound odd but it is just the way coverage against "uninsured motorists" works today.
If everyone chose the no-fault route, the savings would be enormous. A study by the Rand Corporation, updated to 1996, puts the figure at $40 billion nationwide, or $220 a vehicle.
Auto choice, which was quietly endorsed by President George Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996, may be broadening its political base with the support of moderate Democrats like Senators Lieberman and Moynihan. What's more, there are signs that Nader-inspired opposition from consumer groups is crumbling: Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, has signed on.
But lawyers, who reap tens of billions of dollars annually from auto injury suits, have plenty of money to feed the campaign contribution machine. And at least for the moment, there is no compelling incentive for legislators to bite the hands that feed them. That's why the New Jersey initiative -- where 35 cents of the total premium dollar now goes into compensation for pain and suffering and lawyers' fees -- looms so large.
The New Jersey plan offers motorists four choices. At one end is a policy close to business-as-usual, with "unfettered access" to the courts. At the other is $250,000 in true no-fault protection, which would cut premiums by 20 to 25 percent.
In between are hybrids that Governor Whitman apparently figured would help deflate opponents' argument that access to court was a matter of principle. One option would allow motorists to buy limited coverage for pain and suffering from their own insurers, reducing premiums by about 8 percent. The other would establish a new, very tough injury threshold for access to court.
Auto choice remains a political long shot. Insurance companies, which might be expected to be powerful natural allies, are in fact, largely indifferent because they see little additional profit, anticipating that competition would force them to lower their premiums in proportion to their costs.
But when seasoned politicians like Governor Whitman take a shot at mobilizing the discontent of motorists who have insurance premiums that can easily exceed $2,000 a year, the assumption that trial lawyers can buy their way out of trouble may not hold forever. "Who could say no," the Governor asks, "to a bill that simply gives consumers a choice?"
 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 1997, Monday

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Jan. 23, about legislative proposals to allow motorists to buy no-frills, no-fault auto insurance, misstated the position of the Consumer Federation of America on one such auto choice proposal before Congress. The federation does not support it.

HEADLINE: New York Shoppers, Unleashed

BYLINE: By Frank DeCaro; Frank DeCaro, the author of "A Boy Named Phyllis: A Suburban Memoir," writes about style.

 BODY:
It wasn't the lime green cashmere sweater that found its way home from Brooks Brothers, or the navy blue fedora. It wasn't that new Lanvin necktie from Saks, the Calvin Klein underwear from Bloomie's or the light blue Banana Republic sport shirt.
No, what summed up this week's shopping frenzy -- the delirium of rack pawing fueled by a one-week repeal of the New York sales tax on clothing -- was watching the actor Dolph Lundgren buy footwear in the middle of the afternoon. Even Norse gods can't resist saving a little money after lunch. 
 "It's like Christmas in here," the sales clerk said. And at Barneys, where the man who survived "Rocky IV" was shoe shopping, and at stores all over Manhattan, it was. Except that people were buying presents for themselves this week.
The sales tax abatement, touted by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a miracle salve for the city's economy despite skepticism from economists, has allowed consumers to give in to their most selfish shopping instincts. It has granted New Yorkers permission to guiltlessly say gimme. After a disappointing holiday retail season, stores are thrilled. Even Gov. George Pataki saved $12.49 last Saturday.
Though the experiment is expected to cost the city $7 million in lost revenue -- and the state an estimated $10 million to $20 million -- the Governor and legislative leaders now seem to favor Mayor Giuliani's goal of abolishing the sales tax on clothes priced under $500.
The hope is a permanent tax break will stem the flow of shoppers to New Jersey, where clothing isn't taxed and there's no difficult math to do in the dressing room.
What perfect timing. From fashion magazine layouts to liquor ads, the message is to indulge. Conspicuous consumption is back, they say. Forget the Nike slogan "Just do it," with the rigor it implies. Just buy it.
Who can resist the temptation? Certainly not bargain hunters, and we are a city of those. While our savings this week is only 8.25 percent and limited to "necessity" clothing -- like lime green cashmere sweaters -- it is an inducement the best shoppers can't fight, even though January is supposed to be the slow season. After all, fall and winter merchandise is on sale, and the tax break makes these clothes even more irresistible. But what if this were a time when prices weren't so drastically reduced? Full-price clothes would still be a hard sell.
On the one hand, in this fashion retailing mecca, the best merchandise is presented in the poshest way; the snootier the sales clerk, the more desirable the goods. Stores are our country clubs, each with its own clique. But the city has also been malled, chain stores replacing special retailers. It's becoming Paramus without the free parking.
Mayor Giuliani would have us believe that with no sales tax we can indulge our basest fashion needs, revitalize the city's economy and compete with New Jersey, all at the same time. That would be swell, though it's unlikely.
Even without a tax break, New York City is still the only place where shopping remains a performance art. Malls may have food courts, but we have Dolph Lundgren.

Moment of Realization: Home Has Disappeared

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
In every life there comes a moment of realization that what we assumed would always be there is actually vanishing. Our parents die, the houses we grew up in are sold, neighborhood landmarks disappear and sooner or later what we used to call home just isn't there anymore.
Jeanne Jordan and Steven Ascher's absorbing documentary film, "Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern," presents itself as a case study of the decline of a small-farming way of life in the American heartland. But the movie, which Ms. Jordan narrates in a deceptively chipper, faintly sardonic style, is really the story of her own coming to terms with the ultimate disappearance of home. 
 The film, which won the award for best documentary at last year's Sundance Film Festival, is really an extended home movie starring Ms. Jordan's likable parents, Russel and Mary Jane Jordan, members of a hardy breed of farmers in northwestern Iowa who have worked the land for generations. Ms. Jordan is one of six children of the couple, who, like so many other agricultural families in the 1980's, found themselves getting ever more deeply in debt to increasingly hard-nosed financial institutions.
After much anguished consultation, the Jordans decided that the most economically feasible solution was to auction off their farm equipment, animals and other possessions to pay the debt, and give the land to their oldest son, Jim, to work, while they moved into town. That way, the land would remain in the family.
The film presents the bushy-browed Russel (who was once runner-up in an Abraham Lincoln look-alike contest and who suffers from Parkinson's disease) and Mary Jane as laconic salt-of-the-earth types who face up to their situation with a tight-lipped dignity, although not without tears. Mary Jane, a onetime Iowa state 4-H president, is especially bereft over the sale of her Ethan Allen furniture.
The Jordans' story, which the narrator humorously dubs "a midwestern," is interspersed with scenes from classic westerns like "Red River" and "High Noon." Straining a metaphor, the movie compares the auction of the family's belongings on a snowy winter morning to a climactic Hollywood gunfight. But for all the buildup, not much suspense is generated over the auction price of a combine and a herd of cows.
In the film's eeriest scene, Ms. Jordan and her parents revisit an earlier family home, now uninhabited, in the once-cozy Iowa community of Rolfe, which now appears to be a well-kept ghost town. There's the spic-and-span facade of Ms. Jordan's high school, which, she says, was recently closed for lack of enrollment. Everything seems to be snugly in place except for the people, who have gone somewhere else.
Without becoming analytical, the movie, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, describes the economic cycles of farm life and offers some rough statistics on the decline of American agriculture. (Since the 1960's, the number of farms has dwindled to fewer than two million, from six million).
But what gives the film its elegiac resonance has little to do with the farm crisis or with western movie myths. The images of the land, with its windmill and its cattle, and of the Jordan clan figuratively drawing their wagons into a circle in hard times exert a nostalgic tug for a Norman Rockwell dream of which this family, in better days, seemed to have found a piece.

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By William Grimes 

 BODY:

Off Broadway, Too, Goes on the Move
Two can play the real estate game. For several years now, the Broadway shuffle on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues has hogged the theater news. But Off Broadway is showing signs of real estate restlessness.
This week, Second Stage ended a six-year search for larger quarters, taking out a lease on the top two floors of the former Manufacturers Hanover Bank on the northwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 43d Street. The 1927 Art Deco building will undergo a $4 million conversion into a 299-seat theater, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 1998. 
 Second Stage will keep its 108-seat theater at Broadway and 75th Street. "Artistically we were a little stymied," said Carole Rothman, the artistic director of Second Stage. "We can't do musicals, and playwrights these days tend to write very cinematically, with plays that have 26 scenes, and we have no room for scenery."
The limited seating has also put a cap on earned revenue, as the theater's next production illustrates. It's a new play by Lanford Wilson, "Sympathetic Magic," which Ms. Rothman described as "a comedy about chaos and order." Mr. Wilson can draw audiences of 800 a night. "At Second Stage, only 800 people a week can see it," Ms. Rothman said.
Just around the corner, on the north side of 43d Street just west of Eighth Avenue, the Manhattan Theater Club, which has its office on 16th Street, plans to convert two floors of an office building into an administrative office for itself and four rehearsal studios. Some studios will be rented out, helping to relieve a shortage of rehearsal space in midtown. The complex is scheduled to open in June.
There's more. Eric Krebs, who owns the John Houseman and Douglas Fairbanks Theaters, is expanding westward on 42d Street. This week he began construction of a 280-seat theater in the Riverbank West apartment building between 10th and 11th Avenues. The theater, scheduled to be completed in late April, will have table-and-chair seating for revues and raked seating for plays.
Last but not least, J. C. Compton, formerly an actress and the wife of Harold Clurman, is creating a theater complex in the old Century Association headquarters, a 19th-century townhouse across from the Vineyard Theater on East 15th Street.
The Century Center, as the new complex is named, will have a 299-seat theater and smaller room for seminars, readings and classes. "Minor Demons," a new play by Bruce Graham whose producers include Blake Edwards and Tony Adams, begins performances on March 4.

 
 
Serious About Silliness
 If you're going to be banana No. 2, it doesn't hurt to have Bill Irwin as banana No. 1. So Christopher Evan Welch, making his New York debut at the Laura Pels Theater in "Scapin," has no complaints, unlike his character, Sylvestre, whom he describes as "the nervous friend."
Scapin is a schemer and an optimist. Sylvestre is a realist, which is to say, a pessimist, not overly bright, but smart enough to know that when servants try something clever, a beating from the master lies in store.
"He has to be dragged into things," said Mr. Welch, who specializes in economical gestures and tiny but constant changes of expression. "In the commedia dell'arte, the characters would have worn actual masks. Today we wear the masks of our neuroses. It's clear that Sylvestre has problems that go way beyond this play."
Mr. Welch grew up near Dallas and during high school began competing in local acting tournaments, winning top honors in the "humorous interpretation" category his first time out. After studying theater at the University of Dallas and the University of Washington, he walked right into the lead role in Tony Kushner's adaptation of "The Illusion" at the ACT Theater in Seattle. He has worked steadily ever since, mostly at the Seattle Repertory Theater, where Mr. Irwin directed him in an evening of sketches and in an early version of "Scapin."
When "Scapin" concludes its run, Mr. Welch will make his Broadway debut in mid-April on the Roundabout's Stage Right in "London Assurance," a 19th-century comedy.
In the meantime, Mr. Welch is devoting serious attention to absolute silliness. "Bill and I talk every day about shaping a beat," he said. "We change the laughs all the time. In fact, we dropped two lines the other day. The badda-bing stuff requires constant retuning."

 
 
Director as Character in a Play
 The Elia Kazan problem just won't go away. Mr. Kazan, one of the century's most influential film directors, was recently rebuffed by Hollywood when the American Film Institute and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association denied him lifetime achievement awards. Forty-five years after he cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee, he remains a troubling figure, the focal point of hot debate about the relationship between ethics and art.
In New York, theater audiences will have a chance to revisit the same arguments in a new play, "Names," which begins performances at the American Jewish Theater on March 1.
Written by a first-time playwright, Mark Kemble, "Names" gathers the charter members of the Group Theater in a room in the Algonquin Hotel in the early 1950's. Outside, an angry anti-Communist mob is picketing. Inside, John Garfield, Harold Clurman, Luther Adler, Stella Adler, Clifford Odets and Lee Strasberg pace, worry and argue. Enter Mr. Kazan.
Audience members may come ready to hiss, but Mr. Kemble gives Mr. Kazan a fighting chance. "I'm mixed about Kazan," he said. "The argument is about two rights, which is much more interesting than a wrong and a right, because then you're just beating someone up."
Mr. Kemble came to his subject by a peculiar route. While sitting in a Greenwich Village cafe in the early 80's, he was approached by a casting agent for the film "Frances" who thought he looked like Garfield. He flew out to Los Angeles, landed the small role and became obsessed with the actor, the blacklist and the Group Theater. "Names" is the result, a play about politics, friendship and the disintegration of an artistic collective. "In a way," Mr. Kemble said, "it's really about the breakup of a family."

 
 
Actor of the Week
 The Sam Shepard-Signature Theater machine rolls on with three one-act plays, "The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill on the Eve of Killing His Wife," "Killer's Head" and "Action." Keep a close eye on the middle one, a 20-minute monologue that will be delivered by a different actor each week of the run. Signature has signed up Jamie Sheridan, Bill Pullman, Treat Williams, Stephen Lang, Arliss Howard and John Diehl for the rotation. Performances begin on Jan. 28 at the Joseph Papp/Susan Stein Shiva Theater.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Retreats With Stocks, Ending Mixed in Profit Taking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar hit a nearly four-year high against the yen and touched another two-and-a-half-year high against the mark yesterday before retreating to end mixed on profit taking and faded hopes for lower German interest rates.
A late selloff in the American stock market also helped undermine the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average, which surpassed 6,900 during trading yesterday afternoon for the first time, tumbled nearly 100 points in the final hour of trading. 
 Despite the dollar's mixed showing, traders said the currency remained in heavy demand. They predicted that it would test the 120-yen level and keep rising against the mark.
"This new-found bullishness by the market is extremely strong and well entrenched," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign-exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "It's going to take some heavy selling to change market sentiment about the dollar."
The dollar traded as high as 119.69 yen in intraday dealings, the strongest since February 1993, before settling in New York at 119.47 yen, up from 119.03 on Wednesday.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.6455 marks, the highest since June 1994, before dropping to 1.6366 in New York, from 1.6427 Wednesday.
The pound, which tumbled Wednesday to the lowest level since October, weakened further in a broad retreat caused partly by fears that the governing Conservative Party might have to call elections in March instead of May.
In New York the pound cost $1.6292, down from $1.6300.
The yen also suffered from Japanese data that showed the country's trade surplus narrowed far more than expected in December, suggesting the currency had room to fall further. A weak currency tends to bolster exports and weaken imports.
The mark derived strength against the dollar partly from profit taking from the dollar's surge on Wednesday. In addition, the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged at its regular meeting countered some speculation that the German central bank might reduce rates to stimulate the country's economy. Lower rates diminish a currency's value.

Strong Clothing Sales Spur Rise In 4th-Quarter Earnings at Sears

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company said today that earnings surged 25 percent in the fourth quarter, led by strong sales of clothing and other goods and an increase in credit card revenue.
Sears's earnings gain came even as many other retailers reported a disappointing holiday season, which is expected to push fourth-quarter profits lower. 
 "Sears is among the leaders in sales growth," said Terry McEvoy, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
Sales rose 11 percent, to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year -- a closely watched indicator of a retailer's sales strength -- rose 5.4 percent.
Sears, the nation's second-biggest retailer after Wal-Mart Stores, earned $567 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $455 million, or $1.13 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results surpassed the average estimate of $1.37 from 23 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International Inc.
Shares of Sears fell $2 today, to $49.125, amid a broad decline in stocks.
It was the fourth consecutive quarter that the retailer exceeded expectations and that earnings rose by 25 percent or more.
Sears, which operates about 800 department stores, said it had same-store sales increases of higher than 10 percent in all clothing categories in December, as well as in computers, electronics, tools and hardware.
The company, based in Hoffman Estates, a suburb of Chicago, said same-store sales in its 2,500 specialty stores also rose more than 10 percent. Those stores sell auto parts, tires and furniture.
Sears credit card revenue rose 18 percent as a result of strong sales and higher rates. Its provision for unpaid accounts rose by $133 million, to $328 million, largely because of an increase in personal bankruptcies.
The revenue from credit cards made up about 28 percent of net income, said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. He said investors could find that worrisome if interest rates rose or personal bankruptcies increased further, which would reduce the company's benefit from credit cards.
"The question Wall Street asks is will they be able to control that and run it as profitably as they are right now," Mr. Barnard said.
The company's gross margin widened to 27.9 percent of sales from 26.9 percent, as Sears sold more higher-margin goods, such as apparel.

Bonds Fall Late in Day After Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday but stayed in a narrow trading range as the market absorbed a fresh supply of debt.
The 30-year bond fell 15/32 , to a price of 9514/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direct, rose to 6.86 percent, from 6.82 percent on Wednesday. Bonds had rallied during the day but turned lower in the last hour of trading, as did the stock market. 
 Yesterday, the Treasury sold $12.5 billion of new five-year notes at a yield of 6.325 percent, up from 6.125 percent last month and the highest yield in more than three months.
John Canavan, government debt analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said he thought yesterday's five-year note auction went fairly well, with better-than-average retail interest.
"Combined with the two-year note auction the day before, which got a decent reception," Mr. Canavan said, "today's five-year note auction did not appear to be a problem and brought the market through this week's supply without any difficulty, as far as the auctions are concerned."
He added that there was no real reason for the market to be down yesterday, though supply did appear to be a prime suspect since there were others in the market to borrow.
The Province of Quebec sold $750 million of 10-year notes to international investors at a price to yield 7.118 percent, or about 58 basis points more than a comparable United States Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In when-issued trading, the Treasury's new inflation-indexed securities being sold next Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 3.42 percent, up 11 basis points from the previous day.
According to Credit Suisse First Boston, one of the three book managers along with Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch, American investors made up about 40 percent of the buyers for the global bond issue.
The initial weekly unemployment report gave investors some respite, as the number of people filing for unemployment rose more than expected, to 355,000 for the week ended Jan. 18.
The report served to ease concern about a tight labor market, but traders said they did not believe the market would move into a new trading range before the release of the Employment Cost Index on Tuesday. The surprising September drop in the index's year-over-year growth to 2.8 percent precipitated the market's rally late last year.
The weekly jobless claims number suggested that employment reports were more likely to moderate than to strengthen, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors. He added that some investors were looking ahead to reports next week on wages and economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Higher-than-expected readings could give the Fed more reason to raise interest rates to contain inflation. Fear of higher interest rates, combined with expectations of more debt sales by other borrowers, could induce further selling.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Gingrich's Revenge

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
One thing above all led to the undoing of the Republican revolution that Newt Gingrich and his colleagues launched after their election victory in 1994. That was Mr. Gingrich's decision to shut down the Government at the end of 1995 as a way of waging the policy conflict with President Clinton.
The shutdown outraged the public. Americans, it turned out, did not agree with the radical Republican aim of disemboweling the Federal Government. 
 We are now in serious danger of repeating on a far grander scale the folly of immobilizing the Government. That would be a likely consequence of the proposal at the top of the Republican Congressional agenda: a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.
One provision of the proposed amendment, not much noticed so far, would require a three-fifths vote in both houses of Congress to raise the limit on the U.S. debt. Sponsors of the amendment say this feature would be an automatic way to block deficit financing. But just think how it would likely work in practice.
As it is, the debt ceiling has produced crisis after crisis. Getting a simple majority vote for an increase in the ceiling has often proved difficult, putting the Government at risk of being unable to pay its bills. It will be far more difficult -- often impossible -- to win three-fifths of the votes in both houses.
Moreover, debt-ceiling crises tend to occur quickly, when budget forecasts have slipped. There is an unexpected slowdown in the economy, so tax revenues are below estimates. Or a financial crisis like that over savings and loans increases expenditure.
Suppose the President has presented a balanced budget, as the amendment would demand, but then events unbalance income and spending. There is no way to raise taxes or cut spending quickly enough to avoid the need for temporary borrowing, so the President asks Congress to increase the debt limit.
Forty-one senators, one more than two-fifths, could block the increase. Different members of that bloc would have different prices for relenting: build my dam, shift money from Medicaid to Star Wars, whatever. It takes no great analytical skill to appreciate how extraordinarily hard it would be to work through such a crisis.
Failure is likely, at least temporarily. And that would mean one of two things: shutting down parts of the Government or having the United States go into default.
That scenario is not far-fetched. It is the logical outcome of the balanced-budget amendment. And it would have consequences far graver than the overreaching by Newt Gingrich that closed much of the Government in 1995.
For the United States Government to default on its obligations, or even to approach a serious possibility of default, would be devastating to financial markets in this country and everywhere. If it happened once, confidence would be weakened even if we emerged from the first crisis. Everyone would understand that the system -- the new system created by the amendment -- virtually insures more crises in future.
Foreseeable consequences of that kind have led a broad spectrum of financial and economic thinkers to oppose the amendment. Alan Greenspan stated his opposition this week. Robert Eisner, past president of the American Economic Association, spoke for 38 economists, including 9 Nobel laureates, in a critical article in The Wall Street Journal. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, has issued formidable analyses.
The possibility of a crisis over the debt ceiling is only one provision of many in the proposed amendment that alarm those and other critics. The amendment would effectively end majority rule in Congress, giving minorities new blocking powers and assuring stalemate again and again.
The Republican leaders who are pushing the amendment must be aware of those dangers. They have to be going ahead, then, either because they are in the iron grip of ideology or because they see a chance for partisan point-scoring. Neither reason justifies endangering the system that has enabled this country to survive and prosper over 200 years.

HEADLINE: Russia's Frail President

 BODY:
Boris Yeltsin's weakened health has understandably preoccupied Russian politics for months, but a new surge of calls for his resignation as President is premature. Mr. Yeltsin may eventually prove unable to give his country strong and enduring leadership. But unless he suffers a sudden decline, it will be several months before a sound judgment about his fitness can be made.
That is not to belittle the precariousness of his condition. Weakened by heart problems and slowly recovering from bypass surgery and pneumonia, President Yeltsin is a frail figure today. Despite a brief return to work and a flurry of decrees, he clearly cannot run the Russian Government in his current state. But recovery from bypass surgery ordinarily requires several months of rest, and the added complication of pneumonia has slowed his convalescence from his November operation. He has not helped himself by rushing back to the Kremlin. 
 Mr. Yeltsin's rivals and opponents are eager to push him aside, propelled in part by mounting economic problems and opinion polls showing growing impatience with the Government. The Russian economy contracted by 6 percent last year, and the gap is rapidly growing between those who have done well under capitalism and those who have struggled or fallen into poverty. Crime and corruption remain staggering problems.
Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament approved a non-binding resolution this week to sack Mr. Yeltsin. Aleksandr Lebed, the former general who finished a strong third in the first round of presidential balloting last spring, is impatient to get on with a new election he is confident he can win. In a visit to New York this week, he warned of coming chaos in Russia if problems like uncollected taxes and unpaid workers are not addressed.
Mr. Lebed's bulldozer approach to politics is both refreshing and unnerving. There may be a limit to the frustrations Russians will endure, although they have shown remarkable stoicism over the decades, but predicting instability only invites unrest. A political upheaval is not in Russia's interest.
Moscow's political leaders should not be so quick to talk of discarding a president. Mr. Yeltsin won election by a wide margin in a fair vote. The interests of democracy require that he be given a reasonable time to recover before Russia is asked to face the issue of his fitness to serve and the unpredictable consequences of a resignation.
Mr. Yeltsin has an able team of aides who can manage the Government while he tries to regain his strength. If by spring it becomes clear that his recovery is faltering, he should not dodge the difficult issue of resignation or talk himself into the mistaken belief that he is indispensable. Under the Russian Constitution, new elections would be held within three months of a resignation.
The United States, for its part, must continue to do business with the Yeltsin Government. Vice President Al Gore plans to meet next month with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and President Clinton is tentatively scheduled to play host to Mr. Yeltsin in March. But Washington should recognize that Mr. Yeltsin may not be able to handle a full agenda of issues or deliver on promises he makes.
Russia cannot wait indefinitely for its President to heal. But pushing him out the door now would do more to undermine democracy than a few more months of uncertainty about his health.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up Commerce

 BODY:
William Daley, President Clinton's nominee for Commerce Secretary, promised at his confirmation hearing to take politics out of the most politicized department in the Government. It was a necessary pledge that may not go far enough.
The Clinton Administration was not the first to escort powerful corporation executives into presidential palaces and government offices around the globe in pursuit of export sales. But his first Commerce Secretary, Ronald Brown, perfected the practice, critics charge, mostly on behalf of big contributors to the Democrats. The Commerce Department is also where John Huang worked as a political appointee on trade before leaving to raise money for the Clinton campaign -- fueling suspicions that the Administration swapped access to officials in exchange for political donations. 
 Mr. Daley's comments were designed to deflect criticism by those who accused the Administration of turning Commerce into an adjunct office of the Democratic National Committee. He promised, if confirmed, to wipe out about 40 percent of the department's politically appointed jobs. He also promised to suspend trade missions for a month while he creates guidelines for giving all corporate executives -- not just those who donate to Democrats -- an equal shot at accompanying department officials abroad. The task will not be easy. Commerce can justify promoting products that pack a large economic wallop. But how to put that abstract principle to work in a politically charged environment is far from clear.
Mr. Daley should not stop with depoliticizing trade missions. This may be the time for rethinking more broadly the historic role of Commerce in promoting American business abroad. Mr. Daley can surely defend using political muscle to sway foreign governments that are choosing between American products and imports from another country. Such political decisions abroad warrant political interference, especially since other governments are not shy about backing the commercial interests of their exporters. The sale of Boeing aircraft to Saudi Arabia fits this model. It also makes sense for Commerce to spend some money, primarily on behalf of small companies, providing generalized information to American exporters about foreign opportunities and similar information to foreign importers about American exports.
But Mr. Daley will need to look skeptically at the practice of using Government influence to help particular American companies win contracts from private companies overseas. He might also review the department's export-promotion schemes that use taxpayers' dollars to subsidize advertising and sales of American products abroad.
Mr. Daley declared that the Commerce Department ought not to favor Democrats over Republicans. He also needs to check that the department is not favoring businesses over taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Worst Freeze In Years Ruins Florida Crops

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A freeze last weekend, the worst here in seven years, caused $93 million in damage to winter vegetable and tropical fruit crops in Dade County, officials said today, and losses for all crops could total $250 million statewide. The damage could lead to sharply higher prices across the nation.
The Florida Agriculture Commissioner, Bob Crawford, said the higher estimate included losses of citrus crops, sugar cane and other agricultural products that have yet to be assessed. He has asked Gov. Lawton Chiles to declare agricultural disasters in 18 counties. 
 Among those counties, though, three in South Florida, including Dade, were the hardest hit by the freeze on Saturday night and Sunday.
Nearly 16,000 acres and 70 percent of all crops in Dade County were destroyed. Pole beans and okra suffered 100 percent losses while 85 percent of the green bean, yellow squash and zucchini crops were lost. Sixty percent of the banana and mango crops were also lost.
Half of all winter fruits and vegetables sold nationwide originate in Florida. In some areas in the state, vegetable prices have already increased 50 percent to 70 percent.
"Green beans have doubled in price since last Friday," Mr. Crawford said, "and bell peppers are also going up dramatically."
Although vegetable crops were hardest hit, citrus growers are also worried. It is not yet clear how the state's citrus crops will be affected, since roughly 40 percent of state's oranges have already been harvested, said Bob Terry, an administrator with the Florida Agriculture Statistics Service.
"We did have some ice reported in fruit," Mr. Terry said, "but that doesn't necessarily translate into lost fruit. It's very difficult to tell what has been lost."
The Florida Citrus Commission has recommended that there be heavier inspection at citrus packing houses for the next 10 days to determine the severity of the damage to the fruit.
"This way the fresh market will be assured of receiving Florida citrus that has not been damaged," said Philip Lesser, director of economic and market research at the Florida Department of Citrus.
One reason for the severity of the losses, officials said, was that farmers did not get adequate warning of the weather, which would have enabled them to take precautions. Because of budget cuts, the National Weather Service stopped forecasting temperatures for agricultural areas as of last April, forcing farmers to rely on local forecasts of populated areas, which tend to be warmer, on average, by five degrees or more. Even a difference of a few degrees can be crucial to crops.
"This was the first year we
haven't had a weather forecast coming from the Government," specifically for farming areas, Mr. Crawford said. "It really left farmers in the lurch not knowing this freeze is coming."
In addition, the weather service had predicted temperatures around 40 degrees for last weekend, well above freezing, but temperatures in fact dipped below freezing, in some areas to 19 degrees.
Precautions farmers can take if they know severe cold is coming include spraying crops with water heated to 72 degrees so a protective coating of ice forms to prevent freezing, and saturating the ground with warm water.

HEADLINE: China's Leader For Hong Kong Backs Repeal Of Rights Laws

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Friday, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In the face of international and local criticism over China's intention to roll back laws protecting a range of civil rights in Hong Kong, the man who will rule the territory under Chinese sovereignty has declared his support for repeal of the laws.
Local legislators, lawyers and the territory's rambunctious press expressed alarm over the recommendation by a Beijing-appointed body that a series of recently adopted laws, including core provisions of Hong Kong's bill of rights, should not stand when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1. 
 But it was not until Thursday that Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping tycoon chosen by Beijing to be Chief Executive of Hong Kong when Britain hands over the colony, declared his support for China's intentions, which include reinstating colonial legislation restricting protests and requiring official approval to set up political organizations.
"The key question here for the community to debate is what is more important to the community -- social order, inconvenience caused to the public at large or individual rights," Mr. Tung said at a dinner organized by two leading newspapers, Sing Tao and The Hong Kong Standard. "I believe it is important to get the right balance between individual rights and social order for the good of the entire community."
Mr. Tung has repeatedly stressed the need to subjugate individual rights, whether expressed in the form of protest or through democratic institutions, to "the good of the public at large."
China's move to return to authoritarian colonial legislation that had been repealed by Hong Kong's elected legislature in recent years has drawn vigorous protests from London and Washington. On Wednesday the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Jiang Enzhu, was summoned to the Foreign Office to be told of London's unhappiness over Beijing's intentions.
In Washington the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said that the Administration was "deeply concerned over any attempts to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in Hong Kong."
Martin C. M. Lee, the chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest party, said today that he was dismayed by Mr. Tung's capitulation to Beijing's injunctions.
"I express regret that Mr. Tung doesn't seem to understand that what he's been talking about are entirely human rights matters, and they are also legal matters," Mr. Lee said in a telephone interview. "It has everything to do with human rights."
Many of the laws China plans to revoke were passed after 1984, when Britain and China signed an agreement to return Hong Kong to China and London promised not to significantly change the colony's laws or electoral system. Since then, however, the British authorities have moved to a fully elected legislature and have adopted numerous guarantees of civil and democratic rights.
Many local newspapers attacked Beijing's intentions.
"This is an obvious attempt to emasculate Hong Kong people's freedom to demonstrate and collect petitions," Sing Tao said. "Hong Kong people should keep on protesting against the reinstatement of the ordinances concerned."The Hong Kong Economic Times, which often supports Beijing, said, "Before amending or abolishing Hong Kong law, the Preparatory Committee legal panel should first consider the desires and needs of Hong Kong people." The panel is the Beijing-appointed body that made the proposals.
But Mr. Tung is having none of it.
"The issue is not about the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly," Mr. Tung said. "The issue is not about human rights. If people want to demonstrate or lie in the middle of the road, in my view, they're welcome. They should be allowed to do so. But they must do so without causing inconvenience and harm to the community at large and they must do so within the law.
"This is not a human rights issue," he insisted. "Some people in this community like you to believe this is a step backward on democracy and a step backward on human rights. This is not true."

HEADLINE: Rug Pulled From Stocks In Last Hour

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market dropped sharply in a sudden late-afternoon selloff yesterday, ruining what looked to be another record performance. The fall came on the busiest day of trading in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 94.28 points, or 1.38 percent, all of it in the last hour of trading, to close at 6,755.75 Before the selloff, the Dow was up 56 points and fell as much as 150 points from there. It was the first time this year that the Dow declined two consecutive days. 
 "The market was just overdue," said Alfred Goldman, market analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. The Dow had risen 500 points this year, he said, "and we haven't even paused to catch our breath," adding, "Today, we took a peak at 6,900 and then the market ran out of steam."
The sudden market decline, the worst since a 101-point fall in the Dow on Dec. 31, came after two years of sparkling stock market returns and at a time when even bullish analysts forecast only moderate gains in 1997.
Analysts, who in general had trouble finding reasons for the sudden turn, said it appeared that selling on the futures market -- where big bets on the outlook for stocks are often made -- set off the plunge.
In addition, a string of large, computer-aided sell programs helped sink the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn.
Other analysts cited a slump in the bond market, which pushed interest rates higher in the afternoon just ahead of the fall in the stock market. Even as the Dow and the other major market indexes moved almost daily to highs this year, analysts have been worried about the jump in interest rates.
"Clearly we have had pressure building because we have had interest rates moving up and the stock market has been ignoring it," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company.
Analysts are worried about interest rates because when they rise they make stocks less attractive. The yield on the 30-year bond, which rose to 6.86 percent, from 6.82 percent Wednesday, has risen from 6.35 percent on Nov. 29, its recent low. Some market strategists are predicting a fall in the market this year caused by rising interest rates as the economy begins to grow faster.
But others simply said the market needed a timeout after rising nearly 7 percent this month as of yesterday's intraday high. Many said the drop was healthy and still left the Dow up 4.8 percent on the year.
"It was time for this," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. "Bonds sold off and the market was extremely overextended. You don't expect the market to keep going to new highs with lackluster interest rates."
Elaine Garzarelli, an independent market analyst who was formerly a leading strategist for Lehman Brothers, was reported during the day to have turned bullish on the market. After prices turned down in the afternoon, some analysts suggested that her reversal might have contributed to the drop, noting that she had turned bearish last July 18 -- as it happened, the day stock prices bottomed after a summer decline and then began another record run. Her office would not comment.
But while the selloff was sudden, some analysts said that yesterday's reversal was nothing to worry about.
"It's just a timeout, not a top-out," Mr. Goldman at A. G. Edwards said. "The fundamental and technical underpinnings are still positive. It's still a bull market and its going higher."
Although such technology stocks as Microsoft and Intel made strong gains early in the day as the Nasdaq continued to outpace the Dow, the fortunes of these and other computer and technology companies were reversed late in the day. Microsoft lost 2 5/8, to 94 3/4, and Intel lost 3/8, to 151 3/4.
Better-than-expected earnings reports from United Technologies and McDonald's also helped lift the Dow early. United Technologies rose 3 1/8, to 69 5/8, and McDonald's was up 1 1/4, to 46 1/2. I.B.M. also rallied early in the day after sharp losses on Wednesday that pulled the Dow down. But later it turned down, with a loss of 6 1/4, to 151 3/4. In the last two days, shares of I.B.M. have lost nearly 10 percent.
The Dow hit its high for the day of 6,906 around 2 P.M. Then as it began to decline, the fall was accelerated by the first of three computer-aided sell programs at 2:30. The last computer selling went from 3:37 to 3:57, dropping the Dow by 88 points, according to Birinyi Associates.
"The market was overbought," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "It's been on a vertical rise all year. A key reversal on the downside brought in all the nervous people."
David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said, "I am at a loss to say why the market dropped, but I have been at a loss to say why it was going up every day."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 685.1 million shares, surpassing the previous high of 680.9 million last July 16. Of the top 10 volume days on the exchange, five took place this year.

HEADLINE: Administration Won't Merge Programs Promoting Exports

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration decided today that the three Government agencies that play a major role in financing American exports abroad should not be merged, concluding that while the current system was fragmented and awkward, the political costs of reorganization were too high.
The decision came at a White House meeting of the National Economic Council, which coordinates major economic decisions for President Clinton much as the National Security Council reviews foreign policy decisions. While the decision before the council was a narrow one, it signaled that the Administration was in no hurry to heed calls from business leaders and a number of current and former Government officials that the system of programs to promote and finance exports needed a major overhaul. 
 The Office of Management and Budget has recommended merging the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which provides low-cost financing for American exporters; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides political-risk insurance to companies trading or investing overseas; and the Trade and Development Agency, which develops feasibility studies of overseas markets for exports and investment in emerging markets. All three need to be reauthorized by Congress this year.
In private, even many of the advocates of those programs concede that they are badly organized, largely because they were created one at a time by Congress, often with intersecting or conflicting charters. For example, the investment corporation is barred from operating in China, under legislation passed after the bloody suppression of protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But the other agencies are free to operate there. But supporters do not see a better way, yet.
"If we were starting from scratch, we certainly wouldn't organize it this way," one senior Administration official deeply involved in the debate said after today's meeting. "But the energy and time that would be consumed by reorganizing was judged not to be worth the benefits."
The reauthorization seems almost certain to reopen a long-simmering argument between the Administration and the Republican majority in Congress over whether these agencies sustain jobs in the United States -- as the Administration argues -- or whether they are a form of "corporate welfare." Next week a coalition of forces led by Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the Budget Committee, plans to release a list of Government programs for industry that it wants to eliminate or vastly cut back.
The list seems likely to include subsidies provided by the Agriculture Department to help food exporters, and the Rural Utility Service, which subsidizes electric power in rural areas. Mr. Kasich's group also wants to reduce the contribution from the United States to the International Monetary Fund, at a time when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is insisting that that contribution must be bolstered.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation has long been on Mr. Kasich's hit-list. Last year he nearly succeeded in eliminating its budget.
Ruth Harkin, who heads the agency and is the wife of Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, defended the Administration's position.
"This is about two different philosophies of what the Government should be doing," she said. "We believe that what is critical here is how to maintain and create American jobs through exports."
Almost every one of the nations with which the United States competes -- including members of the European Union and Japan -- also help exporters by offering financing or insurance. As a result, advocates of those programs here say that to eliminate them would be tantamount to unilateral disarmament, giving America's economic competitors a major advantage.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Agent Runs a Brooklyn Club to Snare a Mafia Outfit

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
From the outside, the Portofino Soccer Club in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn was just another nondescript social club. But inside, the authorities say, it was the rendezvous for a select gathering of men who arranged million-dollar business deals for products like dresses from Donna Karan and Liz Claiborne, exercise machines, computers, video-cassette recorders, television sets, cigarettes and featherbeds.
Sitting on the dilapidated white couches of the club, the men, many of them Mafia members or associates, sipped their coffee and quietly disposed of $6 million worth of stolen merchandise in the last two years. But unbeknown to them, the Portofino was the centerpiece of a sting operation that ended yesterday in the racketeering indictments of 47 men, including Nicholas Corozzo, the reputed new boss of the Gambino crime family. 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation officials, who said they captured all the deal-making on videotape, said the sting operation offers a window on an underground economic network that moves millions of dollars of hijacked goods into seemingly legitimate stores.
"The great majority of business people know that when they get cut-rate prices for dresses, computers and big items, that it is hot goods," said James K. Kallstrom, the F.B.I. official in charge of the New York office. "The smaller items, like perfume and watches, are part of the underground economy, people selling it on street corners."
Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York State, whose office will prosecute the defendants, said the case should serve as "a wake-up call, because it shows how pervasive organized crime remains in the theft of interstate commerce."
F.B.I. officials said that an agent posing as an accomplished fence infiltrated the Gambino organization and was authorized by mobsters to open the social club.
It was only the second time, officials said, that an F.B.I. agent had penetrated the inner sanctum of a Mafia faction. The only previously known infiltration occurred from 1976 to 1981, when Joseph Pistone, an agent pretending to be a jewel thief, wormed his way into the operations of the Bonanno crime family.
Mr. Kallstrom declined to identify the agent who ran the club, except to say that he had been with the F.B.I. for more than 20 years. "To make your bones with a mobster, an undercover agent has to be a fabulous actor and think quick," he said.
"Making your bones" is an expression for performing deeds, usually illegal, that allow a criminal to be accepted into a Mafia family or mob-sanctioned place. Mr. Kallstrom emphasized that the agent and a cooperating witness who helped him had not committed any illegal acts.
Investigators say thieves and hijackers use many systems for fencing their loot, depending on the marketability of the stolen products and the relationships they have established with fences. Some fences deal only in specific items, like jewelry, liquor or women's clothes, because they have created illicit channels for selling such merchandise to established wholesalers or merchants.
Other fences are known for accepting almost all kinds of merchandise. If these fences are unable to peddle goods illicitly, they sell them to street hawkers.
Thieves usually get 10 percent of the wholesale value of the stolen goods, with fences getting another 10 to 20 percent, investigators say.
Law enforcement officials maintain that focusing on hijackers and major fencing operations is their most effective tactic in deterring crimes and disrupting the flow of stolen goods. They say it is impractical to investigate the thousands of merchants who might be on the receiving end of stolen property.
"Eventually," Mr. Kallstrom said, "the hijacked merchandise gets into the legitimate market, even though there are illegitimate gains for some business people who are as corrupt as the guys who hijacked the load."
Stephen M. Carbone, the head of the F.B.I.'s Hijacking Squad in the New York area, said that the investigation, known by the code name Second Gear, began four years ago, in an effort to disrupt Gambino hijacking operations. In addition to the New York area, the hijackings or thefts of trucks and their cargoes occurred in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Virginia, officials said.
Investigators said that the cooperating witness, who also was not identified, had links to hijackers and Gambino associates. He introduced the undercover agent to mobsters as a figure who could fence substantial amounts of stolen goods.
After a year of ingratiating himself with the gangsters, the agent and the cooperating witness were granted permission by a Gambino faction known as the Canarsie crew, headed by Mr. Corozzo, to open the Portofino Club in a red brick building at 3516 Flatlands Avenue, near East 36th Street. The agent and the cooperating witness then leased a warehouse at 5803 Avenue J, near East 58th Street in Canarsie.
Mr. Kallstrom said that although the F.B.I. used concealed cameras to tape the discussions in the Portofino, none of the hijackings were planned there. The thieves came to the club to make deals for the disposal of the property. The thieves then delivered the property to a warehouse, where the deliveries were taped.
The stolen goods were later traced to their rightful owners, and Mr. Kallstrom said all the recovered property would be returned.
Investigators said that the clubhouse conversations implicated Mr. Corozzo; his top Mafia aide, Leonard DiMaria, and six other members and associates of his crew in a host of crimes, including loan sharking, extortion and illegal bookmaking. Yesterday's racketeering indictment was the second in a month for the 56-year-old Mr. Corozzo, who investigators say recently assumed control of the Gambino family, one of the nation's most powerful Mafia groups.
Mr. Corozzo, law enforcement officials say, replaced John Gotti, who is serving a life term in prison. Mr. Corozzo, who was arrested in December in Miami on separate Federal racketeering charges, is being held without bail in Florida.
Asked if Mr. Corozzo's indictments might cause realignments in the Gambino family and aid Mr. Gotti's son, John Jr., who investigators say has ambitions to become the Gambino boss, Mr. Kallstrom replied, "He might be happy about this."

HEADLINE: Was It His Career, or Theirs?;
A Corporate Wife Holds Out for a 50-50 Split of Assets

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
He works at full throttle. She raises the children and creates the elegant home. She plays hostess at business dinner parties, orchestrates charity events, relocates on command, accompanies him on trips and listens to his office woes. She is the corporate wife, and her career, she believes, is managing her husband's career.
But how much is her contribution worth? A divorce case in Connecticut involving a General Electric executive worth as much as $100 million puts a fresh spin on that question -- and, in the process, is rattling the corporate elite. Its resolution, many people say, will be a verdict on the institution of marriage itself and on the value of the supportive duties traditionally known as "women's work." 
 The plaintiff, Lorna J. Wendt, turned down a $10 million settlement from her husband of 31 years, Gary C. Wendt, the chief executive of GE Capital. Invoking economic theory, she is arguing that her performance as a corporate wife was an investment, entitling her to half the family fortune.
"Gary wanted to buy out my partnership, and I didn't want to be bought out," she said, using language she learned in her role. "It's like a hostile takeover -- he offered me a very small percentage, and I said that's not the price of the buyout."
The case breaks new ground because in divorce, too, the rich are different. While a 50-50 settlement is common practice for ordinary people -- indeed, the law in 11 community property states -- American courts elsewhere generally balk at awarding the wife half when an estate is worth more than $10 million or $15 million. The wife is awarded what she needs to live in the style to which the pair had become accustomed.
There is little wonder why the executive set is following the Wendt case closely: As executive pay and stock option awards have ballooned in recent years, a growing number of top managers -- particularly those in high technology, on Wall Street, and in the media/entertainment world -- have substantial assets at risk.
Most divorce cases, whether the couple are wealthy or not, are settled out of court. So Mrs. Wendt's persistence is unusual. But Mr. Wendt will not quit, either. "She was not responsible for my success," he said. "This is about who created and preserved the assets. "
Since reports of the Wendt case first arose last month, it has sparked heated conversations at dinner parties, in bars, on commuter trains and in corporate corridors all over the country. Mrs. Wendt, who is 53, said she was getting calls and letters of encouragement from many women. Mr. Wendt, who is 54, can also brandish a batch of support letters from both men and women.
"The important public policy issue here is: What is the nature of the marital partnership," said Martha A. Fineman, a Columbia University law professor who testified for Mrs. Wendt. "Is it an equal partnership or is a housewife a junior partner?"
A decision against Mrs. Wendt, Ms. Fineman said, "would say that our historically typical contributions to marriage are not valued, and that women are not full partners unless we are equal wage earners." The message, women say, would be clear: Why stay home?
Wendt v. Wendt, unfolding in State Superior Court in Stamford before Judge Kevin Tierney, is scheduled to be back in session on Tuesday, with his ruling expected by early spring.
Any judgment in the case that diminishes the wife would be coming at an odd time. For the last few years, politicians and pundits have preached family values, putting renewed emphasis on the importance of child-rearing and other traditional female roles. Last fall, the movie "First Wives Club" -- in which three women triumph over ex-husbands who trade them in for younger models -- hit a nerve among women who believe that for all their advances toward equality they remain losers in the gender wars.
Still, interviews with more than three dozen people, most of whom travel in circles like the Wendts', show that their dispute is hardly an open-and-shut case. Not all the women side with Mrs. Wendt, and not all men concur with her husband.
Many -- women and men alike -- buy Mr. Wendt's argument that his singular financial genius as head of GE Capital, which contributes more of General Electric's profits than any other division, created the wealth, not joint efforts with his wife.
But not one of the men who thought Mrs. Wendt deserved half would speak for the record. And several prominent men who have gone through or are getting a divorce -- including Henry R. Kravis, the buyout specialist, John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, and Robert Pittman, chief executive of AOL Networks -- declined through their spokesmen to comment at all.
Other people resist the notion that the wife has a lesser role, insisting that marriage is an equal partnership, for better or for worse.
"If her work is her husband's career, of course she should get half," said Toni K. Goodale, whose Manhattan-based firm counsels nonprofit organizations. "Some women have devoted their lives to furthering their husband's career -- just go up to Greenwich and you'll see them."
Ellen Schwartzman, whose ex-husband, Stephen, is a well-known investment banker, agreed. "I'm not saying that all women deserve half," she said. "There are women who don't even know what their husbands do. But where the career was a joint effort, the wife is entitled to half."
Sentiments are equally strong at the other end of the spectrum. "I know what it takes to develop a business and to run a business, and I think that has a value over and above the supportive relationship," argued Harriet Weintraub, a partner in Loving & Weintraub, a marketing and communications firm in Manhattan.
Her view was in sync with a top Chicago real estate agent who feared losing business if she allowed her name to be used. "I see an awful lot of women having a very nice time," she said. "What they do doesn't seem very extraordinary."
Many people have mixed feelings. "I think a woman who worked hard is entitled to a fair split, but I don't know if it is 50-50," said John Gutfreund, the twice-married former chairman of Salomon Inc., the Wall Street firm. "But what she needs to live on is not the way to resolve this."
And others dispute the notion that an estate's size should be a consideration. "It's like being a little bit pregnant -- if it's right at $2 million, it's right at $200 million," said one twice-divorced female financial adviser who insisted on anonymity. "How can we take half away from a guy who works on the assembly line and not from a guy who is worth so much more?"
But some courts do. Most states -- like Connecticut -- instruct judges to divide the spoils in an "equitable distribution." Many start with the presumption of an equal split, but then consider how long the two were married, what each needs to live on and who contributed what to the pot, among other things.
"I know of no cases where a wife has gotten 50 percent of the assets when they are of such substantial nature," said Robert Epstein, Mr. Wendt's lawyer. "If you believe that what she did was equal to his contribution, then you believe in the tooth fairy. We don't deny that she acted like a corporate wife, but we say that contribution was de minimus."
That such a debate is taking place reflects the surprising endurance of what seems an anachronism. After more than 35 years of the women's movement, corporate wives may be scarcer now but they are hardly an endangered species.
"There is enormous pressure in top jobs, and C.E.O.'s don't want to reveal their vulnerabilities to their boards or to their second-level managers," said Gerard R. Roche, a top executive recruiter. "They're really alone, and it's awfully good to come home to a real partner.
"The most successful executives lead totally integrated lives. They have corporate breakfasts, corporate vacations, corporate weddings. The total integration is seamless, and the wife can be very important."
Ms. Goodale bears witness to that. "The corporate wives I know can't have lives of their own," she said. "They are entertaining for him, going on trips with him, making friends with the wives of his associates. They're his sales department and his entertainment department."
The Wendts fit much of that description, according to their depositions and testimony so far. High school sweethearts in tiny Rio, Wis., they married in 1965, after college but before either had visions of striking it rich -- and long before the age of prenuptial agreements.
First stop: Harvard Business School, where Mr. Wendt earned an M.B.A., while Mrs. Wendt worked as a public school music teacher. He then worked in real estate in Texas, Georgia and Florida before moving in 1975 to GE Capital, where he became chief executive 11 years later.
All along, according to court documents, Mrs. Wendt ran the home, raised their two daughters and supported his career, mostly by entertaining.
"Here we have a case where two people have invested in a single career," said Myra Strober, an economist at Stanford University who testified on behalf of Mrs. Wendt. "The investments were different in kind, but these two people made equal sacrifices and therefore should get equal rewards."
Ms. Strober invoked the human capital theory of Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, who believes that investments in humans, like those in machines or buildings, pay a return over their lives. Mrs. Wendt, Ms. Strober argued, contributed to Mr. Wendt's career throughout their marriage and is entitled to her share of the assets -- even the stock options, deferred compensation and pension benefits -- accrued during the marriage.
Many economists, including Mr. Becker, agree that the activities of a corporate wife have a value. "The fact that the wife makes a significant contribution to his earnings is absolutely right," Mr. Becker said. "The hard part is to know what share it should be."
For a start, the Wendts do not agree on how much there is to divvy up. Mrs. Wendt's experts say the tally is about $100 million. But Mr. Wendt, in a telephone interview, said "the amount is about $25 million," an assertion that his expert witnesses will support. In that light, he contended, his settlement offer is generous.
The offer, according to Mr. Epstein, includes $4 million in real estate, $5 million in cash and $250,000 a year in alimony for life. "Such a settlement puts Mrs. Wendt in the 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' category," Mr. Epstein said.
But Mrs. Wendt countered: "This is not about need. I can get along on $10 million, but why should he get $90 million? I entered into this marriage as a partner. I don't know when he decided that it was not a partnership."
All of which puts Judge Tierney in the hot seat, with many people watching his decision -- not least Dennis D. Dammerman, G.E.'s chief financial officer, and his wife, Patricia, who are in the early stages of a split as well.
But Mr. Epstein is confident. Referring to Mrs. Wendt's expert witnesses, he said, "There is nothing in our law yet that talks about a partnership or equal distribution. Some women want that, and I won't comment on whether that's the wave of the future. But I told Ms. Fineman that she should make her case to the legislature."

HEADLINE: New Bricks, Same Old Walls For Europe's Poor Nations

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Svetlana Raykova should represent the hope for the future of this shattered country. As generations of her family have done before her, she would like to marry and settle down here.
But years of Communist misrule have left the economy in ruins. Hundreds of thousands have fled. For the past two weeks, protesters have filled the streets. And Ms. Raykova now has doubts. From time to time, she thinks of leaving. 
 "I like my country and its traditions," said Ms. Raykova, 23, a language student at Sofia University, as she sat in her parents' cramped apartment, where she helps make ends meet by giving English lessons. "But the Government and the economic situation often make it impossible to see why I should stay."
Susan Langi, on the other hand, likes what she sees of her future in Hungary. A law student with fluent English and friends in the United States whom she met during visits there, Ms. Langi, 27, has a multitude of career opportunities at home and abroad. But because Budapest has blossomed, she has decided that she will stay and go into banking.
With fading memories of the jubilation at the collapse of Communism seven years ago, there is a new divide -- some call it the latter-day iron curtain -- between have and have-not nations of Central and Eastern Europe. Only in the former does the joy remain.
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, more prosperous and stable, are cruising toward Western Europe, while much poorer Bulgaria, Romania and Albania languish in the doldrums. For the former, entrance into NATO and the European Union is a matter of when, not if. For the latter, a legacy of Communist rule and a reluctance to undertake market reforms have left faltering economies awash in corruption.
Czechs, Poles and Hungarians are sanguine about their countries' membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the prestigious club of industrialized nations.
But for citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, even those lucky enough to have reliable incomes find themselves barred from visiting Western Europe because their countries are on the European Union's "negative visa" list, along with Zambia and Afghanistan.
A New York University historian, Tony Judt, writing about this new European division in his recent book "A Grand Illusion? An Essay on Europe," predicted that the European Union, motivated in part by sentiment, would probably extend its "protective arm" around the old centers of the Hapsburg empire: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and perhaps Slovenia.
Influenced by Western ideas and religion, and by the experience of pre-World War II capitalism, these countries have been the better students of reform. They have been protected from their worst nationalist instincts, their leaders assert, by the lure of Europe and the promise made in the early 1990's that they could join NATO if they met certain economic and democratic standards.
These countries alone will scrape into the fold of Europe, Mr. Judt said. Thus, there will develop "a sort of depressed Euro-suburb beyond which 'Byzantine Europe' would be made to fend for itself, too close to Russia and Russian interests for it to be prudent for the West to make an aggressive show of absorption and engagement."
The disparity between the halves is reflected in American aid policy.
In June, the United States Agency for International Development will pull out of the Czech Republic, its mission completed and its presence in the more mature economy and democratic political scene no longer needed, said Thomas Dine, the agency's director for the region. The agency plans to leave Poland and Hungary next year but remain in the poorer parts of Eastern Europe.
"The have-nots are almost dysfunctional," said Mr. Dine, who recently returned from cutting the ribbon for an American-financed sewage plant in southern Bulgaria. "It is there in the southern tier that we can make a difference. We have a northern-tier strategy and a southern-tier strategy -- one to gradually pull out and the other to stay and help them set up the institutions they need."
The 1996 economic data show the division clearly. Foreign investment and rising buying power have transformed the larger cities of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland into places with many of the accouterments of the West: fast-food restaurants, self-service gas stations, Benetton stores and apartment complexes outfitted with satellite dishes.
More than $15 billion in foreign investment has poured into Hungary since 1990. In neighboring Romania, which has more than twice the people, only $2 billion has come in, and in Bulgaria, a paltry $700 million.
The average monthly wage in Poland is now well over $300, and people have access to adequate and cheap medical care. In chaotic Bulgaria, the average wage fell to $30 this month, and many hospitals lack even such basics as X-ray film. Inflation in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic declined last year; in Bulgaria and Romania it soared.
Many people in the West "thought all the countries in Eastern Europe started out equal in 1989," said Natalia Kaneva, 32, the director of a restaurant and property management company in Sofia. "But we didn't. We were all different. Sofia was nothing before World War II. The Czech Republic was one of the most industrialized countries in Europe. Budapest was a major capital."
Ms. Kaneva said she had stayed because she had fought bureaucracy, extortion and failing banks to help build a surviving business. She blames both the Socialist Government, made up of former Communists, and the previous Government of so-called anti-Communists for bringing Bulgaria to its knees.
"They're all the same," she said with disgust after delivering hot tea and sandwiches as an encouragement to anti-Government protesters.
Many of her friends, she said, are among the 300,000 to 500,000 people who have left Bulgaria in the last six years. The latest escape trick, she said, is to buy a ticket to a Caribbean country that does not require a visa -- like the Dominican Republic -- and then ask for asylum at a stopover in Western Europe.
But Western Europe, straining under its own unemployment, does not welcome visitors from Bulgaria, Romania or Albania, who they fear will turn into illegal immigrants. Nor does the United States.
In contrast, Czechs who apply at the American Embassy in Prague in the morning receive a visa that afternoon; later this year visa requirements for Czechs entering the United States are expected to be abolished, which will give them the same status as Western Europeans.
Albania was isolated for more than 40 years by the Stalinist Government of Enver Hoxha. Few saw it competing with the likes of Poland, where, for example, land was not collectivized, or with Hungary, where small businesses cropped up in the still-Communist 1980's. But even so, many Albanians have found it painful to learn that throwing off the yoke of Communism does not mean automatic entrance into Europe.
Donald Bala, a law student, had wanted to take his bride on a honeymoon across the Adriatic Sea to Italy last summer. Mr. Bala had more than enough money but was denied a two-week visa. "We're completely locked in," he lamented.
At times, Mr. Bala said, he looks with envy at the drug couriers who tool around Tirana, Albania's capital, in expensive cars bought in Switzerland with their illegal proceeds. With no raw materials and archaic equipment, Albania's few industries -- bicycles, steel, glass, cement -- have shut down. Many families keep going on illicit drug money, remittances from abroad and the interest from local pyramid schemes.
Several thousand protested in Tirana last Sunday after three of the smaller pyramid schemes collapsed and did not pay depositors their interest. The police beat a number of protesters, and the opposition promised to stage more rallies.
Romania's political and economic prospects have improved since November, when the former Communists were ousted. The new President, Emil Constantinescu, is campaigning to start membership negotiations with NATO this summer, at the same time as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
But although the the French Government is taking the pleas seriously, Romania is unlikely to prevail, a Washington official said. "It would be a sure way to sink the chances of the other three countries who will be invited in," he added.

Since the collapse of Communism seven years ago, a new divide has appeared between nations of Central and Eastern Europe. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have emerged as the more prosperous and stable economies. In Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, the economies have faltered.

HEADLINE: Pilar Barbosa, 99, Puerto Rican Political Mentor, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Pilar Barbosa de Rosario, a revered Puerto Rican historian and political authority who served as teacher, mentor and mother confessor to generations of Puerto Rican politicians, scholars and intellectuals, died on Wednesday at a hospital near her home in San Juan. She was 99 and widely regarded as the conscience of the ruling New Progressive Party.
In a career in which, in 1921, she became the first woman to teach at the University of Puerto Rico and later established the departments of history and social studies there, Dr. Barbosa became such an authority on Puerto Rican political history, from the movement for autonomy from Spain in the late 19th century to the drive for statehood in the 20th, that she was named the commonwealth's official historian in 1993. 
 It was a further reflection of her standing that after her death Gov. Pedro Rossello decreed a three-day period of mourning and that half a dozen members of the Legislature formed an honor guard at her coffin during a wake on Wednesday night.
The only reason a state funeral was not planned was that Dr. Barbosa had asked for private ceremonies, and as virtually any political figure in Puerto Rico would attest, Dr. Barbosa's wishes had long been treated as commands.
Indeed, long after she retired in 1967, Dr. Barbosa remained an influential figure in Puerto Rican politics -- a gregarious and vivacious woman with such a magnetic personality and wide-ranging knowledge of political history and current events that students, politicians and government officials trooped to her door for her counsel and her company.
"It was an intellectual watering hole," said Gonzalo Cordova, a friend who began teaching history at the university the year she retired. "You didn't come to drink, but for the conversation."
To Kenneth McClintock, a 40-year-old member of the Puerto Rican Senate, her wealth of political and historical knowledge was understandable. "As she was growing up," he said, "history was made at her dining room table."
Her father, Jose Celso Barbosa, was the founder of the Puerto Rican statehood movement and the precursor of the New Progressive Party, which has continued to embrace his ideals -- as modified over the years, to be sure, by his daughter, who insisted that the party of statehood also commit itself to social justice.
This, too, was a tribute to the legacy of her father. He was a black man who was so outraged at being denied higher education by the Spanish that after graduating first in his class at the University of Michigan medical school in 1882 -- and even then allowed to practice in Puerto Rico only after the intervention of the American consul in San Juan -- that he became a leader of the autonomy movement.
Having found a measure of racial and civil justice in 19th-century America after the United States displaced the Spanish in 1898, he espoused statehood as the best way to guarantee similar rights in Puerto Rico.
As one of his 12 children, Dr. Barbosa, whose mother died when she was a toddler, inherited her father's intelligence and his ideals. When she began teaching at the University of Puerto Rico in 1921 she was still an undergraduate herself, and the university was little more than a teacher's college.
After graduating in 1924, she moved on to Clark University in Worcester, Mass., receiving a master's in 1925 and a doctorate the next year.
Over the next decades Dr. Barbosa researched and wrote numerous books, pamphlets and papers on Puerto Rican political history, some based on her father's papers.
Partly, perhaps, because she and her husband, Jose Ezequiel Rosario, an economics professor who died in 1963, had no children, Dr. Barbosa began receiving her students for informal consultations on Saturday afternoons.
The sessions, which began in the days she lived in a farmhouse on the outskirts of San Juan, were continued after she retired and moved to a condominium in the city's Santurce section, but with a difference.
Because she no longer had a teaching load to keep her busy during the week, her proteges took to calling on her any day of the week.
By the time many of them had risen to high positions in the government, Dr. Barbosa, who also maintained friendly relationships with members of other parties, had acquired so much influence that she operated almost as a political boss -- a boss who seemed so blind to her own power that she may not have realized that an off-hand criticism delivered in a private conversation would soon be altering party policy.
Dr. Barbosa is survived by a brother, Rafael Barbosa, of Carolina, P.R.

Texas Instruments Stock Rises on Plan to Sell Unit
Texas Instruments shares rose 11 percent on a bad day for many stocks. The company reported a quarterly loss but announced a deal to sell its money-losing notebook computer business to Acer of Taiwan.
Having already agreed to sell its military electronics division, the company was quick to note that its core chip-making business was bouncing back after a weak period. [Page D3.]

Kohlberg Kravis Plans Acquisition
In its first takeover since amassing a new $5.8 billion fund, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said it had agreed to buy control of Amphenol, a maker of electronic cables and connectors, for roughly $1.2 billion in cash. The deal represents a bet by the investment firm that cable TV companies will resume large purchases of coaxial cable, Amphenol's most important product. [D2.] 

Xerox to Sell 2 Businesses
Xerox said it would sell two units, one to General Electric and one to Andersen Consulting. Xerox also reported better-than-expected earnings, and its stock rose. [D6.]
 
Boeing and McDonnell Fall Shy
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which Boeing plans to acquire, reported strong earnings, but they fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates, and both stocks slipped. [D2.]

Little Softness in Sears's Quarter
Strong sales of clothing and other goods and an increase in credit card revenue helped Sears's quarterly earnings rise 25 percent. The gain came even as many other retailers reported disappointing holiday sales. [D5.]
 
Delta's Profit Up; Southwest's Falls
Delta Air Lines said that its earnings increased 79 percent in the most recent quarter, but Southwest Airlines said its profits fell because of a rise in jet fuel prices. [D13.]
 
Second Base for Sony, in New York
Sony, already one of the most American of Japanese companies, said it planned to make New York City into a second headquarters to better supervise its sometimes troubled operations in the United States and to track American media and technology trends. [D5.]
 
Bond Yields Rise, but Only a Bit
Despite the big drop in stocks, bonds traded within a narrow range as the market absorbed a fresh debt supply. The yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 6.86 percent from 6.82. [D13.]
 
Tokyo Stock Troubles Stir Doubt
Japan remains one of the richest countries, but the recent stock-market convulsions have fed the growing sentiment that the country has lost some of its economic dynamism. [A1.]
 
Swiss to Set Up Holocaust Fund
The Swiss Government, leading banks and businesses agreed to establish a memorial fund for Holocaust victims, after months of pressure from American Jewish groups. [A3.]
 
Florida Crops Damaged by Cold
A freeze last weekend caused heavy damage to winter vegetable and tropical fruit crops in Dade County, Fla., officials said. The damage could lead to steep price increases across the nation. [A20.]
 
Christie's in Talks on New Space
Christie's, the expanding auction house, is negotiating a consolidation of its warehouses, offices and auction houses in a new home at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. [A1.]
 
Hut 1, Hut 2, Sell!
The New England Patriots are underdogs in the Super Bowl, according to the bookmakers and commentators. But they are favored by the stock market, based on observed -- and irrelevant -- historical correlations between market performance and Super Bowl results. If that forecast comes true, the market could be in for trouble. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]

With the Super Bowl matching two teams that have a relative paucity of star power, viewers will have to wait for the ads to see celebrities. And there will be plenty -- ads and celebrities, that is. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]

HEADLINE: Court Says 2 Pataki Aides Can Be Forced to Testify

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A New York State appellate court ruled today that the Democratic-controlled Assembly can compel two advisers to Gov. George E. Pataki to testify about the activities of two private corporations that raised more than $2.6 million for the Governor's inauguration and transition in 1995.
The ruling appears to clear the way for the Assembly to hold public hearings into the inaugural and transition funds with the two advisers, Charles A. Gargano and Lawrence Kalkstein, as major witnesses. The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, was not available today to say whether he planned to go forward with such hearings. 
 The Assembly had tried last year to force Mr. Gargano and Mr. Kalkstein to testify before three Assembly committees investigating whether the Governor had improperly used the two funds for political purposes. But lawyers for the two men succeeded in persuading Justice Joseph Harris of State Supreme Court to block those subpoenas. Today's decision partly overturns that lower court ruling.
But even as the Assembly Democrats were lauding the decision, lawyers for Mr. Gargano and Mr. Kalkstein were also proclaiming victory. They said that the Appellate Division had upheld their contention that the two men need not answer questions that might infringe on their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.
The lawyers have contended throughout this case that the Assembly Democrats were trying to use their investigation to embarrass the Republican Governor and to intimidate his supporters. They said today that if hearings are held, they will order Mr. Gargano and Mr. Kalkstein not to answer any questions that seem political in nature -- which, they strongly suggested, would probably be all of them.
"What is the real purpose of this hearing?" said H. Neal Conolly, one of the lawyers. "It's to have a show so people can be paraded in front of reporters and they can ask questions that are to their advantage. It's a political show."
Mr. Gargano, who is now Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development, was Mr. Pataki's chief campaign fund-raiser in 1994 and helped raise money for the inaugural and transition funds.
Mr. Kalkstein, an accountant, has been a consultant to Mr. Pataki's campaign committees for several years and was an officer of both corporations, N.Y. Inaugural '95, and N.Y. Transition '95.
The two corporations were formed in late 1994 to finance the Governor's lavish inauguration and transition. But after promising to abide by strict limits on contributions and to publicize the names of contributors, Mr. Pataki's aides failed to do either.
Only after the Assembly subpoenaed their records did the two corporations release information showing who contributed and how the money was spent.

HEADLINE: New York Police, Seeking Raises, Assail Mayor They Once Backed

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
In a choreographed expression of scorn for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, police officers by the scores marched outside every station house in the city yesterday afternoon in orderly though occasionally raucous protests against the Mayor's final proposal to improve their pay.
Clasping placards suggesting that the lives they risk for the city were undervalued, and at times chanting derisive slogans against the Mayor, whom they had once championed, the officers vowed to continue periodic picketing until they gained an acceptable resolution of their contract impasse. 
 Puffing steadily on a cigarette outside the Fifth Precinct station house in Chinatown, Officer Shawn Russell summed up the emotions of many of his fellow officers when he spoke in bitter language of the betrayal and humiliation he feels at the hands of the man he had venerated.
"I cannot understand why, after the job that we have done, he would insult us like this," he said of the Mayor's final contract offer to the police union. Once an unalloyed supporter of the Mayor and his law enforcement agenda, Officer Russell said, "I think Giuliani has a better chance of winning Lotto than of police officers backing him again."
Mayor Giuliani continued to defend his economic posture yesterday. "This is a very, very generous offer," he said. "You could question whether the city really has the room for this, but we did it because we wanted to show police officers that we do appreciate the tremendous work that they have done."
He accused the union leadership of nourishing false expectations for its membership. "What they've done is try to make it appear as if we could do things that are impossible to do," he said.
The officers' anger came to a crescendo over the last few days. On Tuesday, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents the city's 38,000 police officers, rejected the city's last contract offer, which calls for no pay raises in the first two years, then increases totaling 16 percent over the next three years. On Wednesday, Federal authorities charged top officials of the Transit Police Benevolent Association with taking bribes from lawyers it shared with the larger police union before the two unions merged in 1995.
James L. Lysaght, one of the lawyers charged in the indictment, is described as the principal shaper of the P.B.A.'s strategy in the current contract talks. Mayor Giuliani at once declared that the alleged crimes were a primary reason for the stalled negotiations.
Mr. Lysaght and the three other people charged in the indictment pleaded not guilty yesterday at their arraignment in United States District Court.
In the taut showdown between the police force and City Hall, underscored by the late-afternoon demonstrations, Officer Russell and many of his colleagues made it evident that they saw a multifaceted issue in simple terms.
He brushed aside the fact that the Mayor's offer was more generous than those accepted by other city unions. Police officers, he said, deserve better still. Don't talk to him about what teachers make: teachers dodge chalk and he dodges bullets.
He readily dismissed the fact that corruption charges had been filed against some of those bargaining for him as beside the point. To him, the point was a mathematical one: he was not paid enough.
He spoke of a fellow officer, one of the most admired in the precinct, who reluctantly left last month to join a force in Nassau County for a raise of $18,000 a year.
Throughout the city, officers on the beat yesterday spoke of a blanketing mood of gloom and bitter anger, one profound enough that some even suggested it was affecting the vigor with which they pursued criminals. Officer after officer said they felt that they had done what the Mayor asked of them in reducing crime, and then some, and now the Mayor had failed to reward officers adequately where they wanted it most -- in their paychecks.
In a demonstration of their discontent, half-hourlong protests were staged around 4 P.M. outside all 75 station houses to denounce the Mayor's actions. Clad in street clothes, officers marched while displaying signs proclaiming, "We are the lowest paid Cops in the state" and "How much is a Cop's life worth?"
For the most part, the protests were fairly restrained, yet they attracted thousands of officers.
Chanting "Zero percent can't pay the rent," "Rudy must go" and "Rudy's a liar, set him on fire," about 75 officers marched before the 71st Precinct in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in one of the more boisterous protests. Passing motorists honked in support, and even prisoners in a Correction Department bus offered upraised thumbs and banged on the barred windows to support those who had arrested them.
Some 75 officers protested outside the 103d Precinct in Jamaica, Queens, where Officer Vinny Esposito introduced himself as, "Police Officer Underpaid."
Another 70 officers joined the protest outside the 30th Precinct in upper Manhattan, accompanied by 30 transit officers. Officer Joe Strong, a union delegate, teetered astride the legs of two police barricades and declared, "We will show the Mayor. We will not be defeated." Later, he said, "Mayor Giuliani, we give you heroes, you give us zeroes."
Officers yesterday were hesitant to point any fingers at the union. Most scoffed that the irregularities transpired at the transit union, not theirs. Others preferred to await more conclusive developments. "They can indict a salami," one officer in downtown Brooklyn said. "Let them prove the charges."
Raymond Byrne, a detective at the 48th Precinct in the Bronx, shrugged off the news: "Like any other union, it's human nature. You're always going to have people who are corrupt, who take advantage and steal."
A number of officers seized on the indictments as another reason to heap scorn on the Mayor. "The day before we're going to picket, he grabs the headlines with the indictments," said Officer J. P. Perez of the 84th Precinct in downtown Brooklyn. "I think the timing was deliberate."
It was the sullen mood in the station houses and patrol cars that dominated the talk of the officers. "It's gotten to where we say, 'Why risk your life if you're not getting anything out of it,' " said Aaron Jackson, a 30-year-old officer in the Seventh Precinct on the Lower East Side. "It's definitely affecting people in their jobs. Why go out and make arrests and be a cop if you can't make a living? Cops are only making arrests if they have to."
While other officers echoed Officer Jackson's appraisal, many others insisted that their job performance had not yet been dulled in any way by their sour mood.
Like many police officers, Officer Perez linked his anger to his economic anxiety. He is a single parent of three children who earns about $46,000 a year, appreciably below the pay of suburban officers. "I can tell you my kids have not eaten steak in three years," he said. "If this contract is passed, I'd have to sell my house." He said he lived in Nassau County but would not be specific.
Officers at the 71st Precinct in Crown Heights were circulating a flier that said, "N.Y.C. Needs Competitive Pay Raises." Beneath the lettering was a picture of an officer shaking hands with a man on the street and inquiring about his profession. The man replies, "I redeem old soda bottles. I was going to become a cop, but I couldn't afford the pay cut."
Officers were especially bitter over the fact that the drop in crime they have produced will serve as the centerpiece of the Mayor's re-election bid. "He sits at a desk over in City Hall taking full credit for what the police officers have done," said Officer Perez. "I've been 17 years on the force and never once did I see Mayor Giuliani in the back of my patrol car making an arrest."
Officer Ronald Fagan of the 84th Precinct said he and his wife had been reluctant to start a family because of his pay. "I can't imagine what would happen if my wife had to stop working," he said.
The simmering anger against a Mayor who was championed by the police rank and file when he was elected has left relations between the police and the Mayor as acrimonious, if not more so, than they were between the officers and the Mayor's predecessor, David N. Dinkins.
A few officers went so far as to declare that their anger against Mayor Giuliani was worse than it had been for Mr. Dinkins. In one police union office, a sign on the wall read, "Re-elect David Dinkins."
The police had any number of spats with Mr. Dinkins. They reached their boiling point in July 1992, when Mr. Dinkins rushed to console the family of Jose (Kiko) Garcia, a drug suspect shot to death by a police officer during a scuffle in Washington Heights. Even as Mr. Dinkins repeatedly insisted that his motive was to quiet the outbreak of violence triggered by the shooting, not to take sides, the police never forgave him.
Many police officers yesterday brought up the Garcia episode as the moment when their self-esteem hit bottom. They spoke of how they had steadily regained pride in what they do, as they have been embraced by Mayor Giuliani and have seen crime sink sharply. But at a time when they have begun to feel so good, they said that they were again dispirited by the contract impasse.
"We're feeling like we've won the world championship at the same time that we've gotten knocked out," Officer Russell said.

HEADLINE: Switzerland and Banks Agree to a Fund for Holocaust Victims

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERN, Jan. 23

 BODY:
After months of pressure from American Jewish groups, the Swiss Government, leading banks and businesses agreed today to establish a memorial fund for Holocaust victims in what a senior official called "the humanitarian traditions of Switzerland."
The Government left open the question of whether it would contribute to the fund and officials said many key issues remain open to negotiation. It remained unclear who would contribute, who would be eligible for payments and on what legal basis the fund would operate. 
 Switzerland, which was neutral during World War II, has until now resisted the idea of helping in the creation of a compensation fund, saying such a step could be taken as an admission of guilt for wartime misdeeds. They have insisted that a historical inquiry precede any talk of payments.
Swiss officials portrayed the decision, announced in a statement after tonight's meeting of the cabinet, as a breakthrough.
"This is a major step," said Thomas Borer, a Swiss diplomat who leads a Government task force created to deal with the controversy over wartime gold transactions between Swiss banks and Nazi Germany and its handling of dormant bank accounts set up by Jews who subsequently perished in the Holocaust.
American Jewish groups who have been pressing Switzerland to set up a fund to help families of Holocaust victims said the Swiss Government's policy shift "appears to suggest that they are moving rapidly towards the establishment of a Holocaust fund."
Elan Steinberg, a spokesman for the World Jewish Congress in New York, which has taken the lead in pressing Switzerland to create such a fund, said, however, that the organization remained cautious. Mr. Steinberg said that after a year of negotiation and confrontation with Swiss officials "not one franc of restitution has been paid."
The change in Swiss policy seemed to indicate that the authorities here had come round to sharing the view of some of the country's main banks that a political gesture was required to defuse a stubborn crisis that could damage the Swiss banking industry and the economy as a whole.
Yesterday, however, Rainer Gut, head of Credit Suisse, the country's second largest bank, urged the rapid creation of what he termed a "well-endowed" fund in excess of $70 million, to be financed in equal parts by commerical banks, the Swiss National Bank and the Government.
Today's Government statement said the authorities "welcomed the readiness of some banking circles to take a rapid step in this direction."
The Swiss Government made a previous offer to negotiate a fund on Jan. 7, but, at that time, said it was prepared only for the fund to be drawn from dormant accounts discovered in Swiss banks after World War II, an idea that was rejected immediately by many Jewish organizations. Switzerland says some $29 million has been found in dormant acocunts, but maintains that only a small proportion of the money was deposited by Holocaust victims.
At issue are three aspects of Switzerland's relationship with Nazi Germany for which Jewish groups are seeking restitution. One is a well-documented trade in gold that enabled Nazi Germany to finance part of its war effort with gold it looted from conquered lands. Last December, the Swiss National Bank acknowledged making a profit of around 20 million Swiss francs, or about $5 million at wartime exchange rates, on those deals. Some accounts put the profit levels higher.
A second issue that has arisen recently is Switzerland's treatment of Jewish refugees, some 30,000 of whom were turned back at the Swiss frontier as they sought to flee Nazi Germany. Swiss historians say the wartime Swiss government refused to pay for the upkeep of the Jewish refugees, obliging American and Swiss Jews to spend some 55 million francs, or nearly $14 million, to support them.
The third issue is the fate of the bank accounts, insurance policies and other wealth deposited in Switzerland by German Jews who subsequently perished in the Holocaust.
In response to pressure from American Jewish groups and politicians, the Swiss authorities have agreed to two inquiries. One, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, former head of the United States Federal Reserve, is a joint Swiss-Jewish inquiry into the dormant accounts. The other is a panel of Swiss and non-Swiss historians charged with investigating the whole gamut of Switzerland's dealings with Nazi Germany.
Mr. Borer, the leader of the Swiss inquiry, met in Zurich today with representatives of commercial banks, the National Bank, insurance companies and other business interests shortly after the Government issued its statement in Bern.
At a news conference, Mr. Borer said the the significance of today's developments lay in the fact that, while the Government had previously "never expressed itself on a fund," it was now ready to "take the lead" in setting one up.
Mr. Borer said a "broad outline" of the fund would be ready "in a few weeks," but he declined to speculate about its likely size..
A key issue remains who will contribute. In its statement in Bern today, the Swiss coalition Government said that "a decision on the appropriate participation of the Government in the financing of a fund will be made when the hard, historical facts are presented."

HEADLINE: Spring, That Tease, Drops By, but Only for a Day

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Winter still has eight weeks to go, but spring slipped in early yesterday to remind people of its virtues, and for a few hours, its rites were evident everywhere in the region.
With the temperature hitting 54 degrees at Kennedy International Airport, William Smythe, a carpenter, eased his 24-foot cabin cruiser into the choppy but ice-free waters of Oyster Bay to test the depth finder his wife had bought him for Christmas. And Martin Schwartz, a retired druggist, tried nudging a golf ball across a thawing patch of brown grass. 
 "I just wanted to work on my putting," he said. "The ground is a little soggy, but who cares? It's sunny. It's warm. It's a perfect day for golf."
The roller-coaster ride is far from over. Temperatures dropped into the night, reaching 28 degrees at midnight, and chilly weather is expected today. Warmer weather will return on Saturday, with some rain.
But with yesterday's balmy weather, people took advantage of the mercurial character of this winter season, walking more slowly, jogging and cycling, pausing for sunshine, wearing windbreakers and denim jackets or no jackets at all. When they stopped to talk, New Yorkers asked each other if they could remember a season when temperatures fluctuated so wildly between the polar chill of the weekend and yesterday's almost sultry warmth. Many also wondered how we went from 75.6 inches of snow in Central Park last season to 5 inches so far in this one.
During lunch hour in Manhattan's Bryant Park, hundreds of office workers occupied the benches and many shed their winter coats and woolen caps. One of them, Rosemarie Censullo, said: "I love it because I'm not a cold-weather person to begin with. This is the first time I've been in the park since it went below 30 degrees. I guess that's been at least weeks."
Still, with the memory of last weekend's subzero temperatures, Ms. Censullo clung to her winter dining regimen, enjoying a bowl of steaming chicken chili.
One dissident from the general air of approval was a man walking his dog near the beach in Westport, Conn. "I hate going from it being like the Antarctic to being like Miami Beach so quickly," he said. "It's a good way to get good and sick."
To those curious about weather fluctuations that took the New York area from 0 to 54 degrees in the Porsche-like acceleration of five days, Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Penn State University, blamed it on a shift in the storm track.
"Weather behaves differently from year to year," he said.
Last year, the predominant storm track passed to the south and east of New York, leaving New York at the mercy of the colder northern winds circulating within the track, Mr. Gadomski said. This year, the dominant track has been to the north, bringing warmer southern winds to New York. But since winds circulate in a counterclockwise direction, New York has occasionally been getting a whiff of the chilly air of Canada, and that accounts for last weekend's shivery temperatures.
In terms of snowfall, this season is less an aberration than last. New York, Mr. Gadomski said, has often had virtually snowless winters, the last one in 1992, when only nine-tenths of an inch had fallen by Jan. 23.
The warm winter has been salutary for many sectors of the region's economy, particularly construction. Although construction activity can fall 20 to 25 percent in punishing winters, this season there has been no decrease, said Edward J. Malloy, president of the Building Construction Trades Council, the umbrella group for the city's 100,000 unionized construction workers.
Some farmers said they were largely unconcerned about the fluctuations in temperature.
"The weather at this time of year really doesn't affect us too much," said Robert H. Gammon of Woodside Farm, a fruit farm in Jamesport, L.I. "It takes an awfully long time for the sap to flow. If this warm weather persisted for a month, it might be something to worry about."
The lack of snow this year has not hurt the winter's pre-eminent sport, skiing, all that much. In the era of man-made snow, the important factor is temperature, not snowfall, and early January provided enough freezing days at resorts like Bellayre Mountain Ski Center in Highmount, N.Y., to spread nearly all trails with man-made snow.
Dick Clark, superintendent of Belleayre Mountain, said that business was off about 10 percent from last year's level, but that figure pleased him, given the steep decline in skiers during the Christmas season when above-freezing temperatures rendered snowmakers useless.
"A warm day like today doesn't set us back," he said. "Man-made snow is a lot more durable than natural snow."
What was best about yesterday's unseasonable warm spell was simply the promise it brought that spring may be around the corner. Outside Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School in Oyster Bay, L.I., Margaret Ryder and her shaggy dog watched children racing around the playground, laughing and shrieking.
"I walk my dog here every day and it's great to see the kids back out on the playground," said Ms. Ryder, who is a computer analyst. "It's been too cold and too quiet, and I've missed all that wonderful noise only kids can make."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Passes 120-Yen Mark, Then Drops in Broad Pullback

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar vaulted over the 120-yen barrier for the first time in nearly four years yesterday but then dropped, hurt by fear that Japan's central bank was selling dollars to defend the yen.
The dollar retreated against other major currencies on profit taking from the dollar's sharp rise over the last week and on news of higher inflation in Germany, which further dimmed hopes of lower German interest rates. 
 It was the first broad pullback in the dollar in more than a week. But traders said the currency was still likely to go higher on the basis of a stronger United States economy compared with weakness in Japan and much of Europe, the same forces driving the dollar up for the last several months.
"There are still plenty of buyers for the dollar," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "I don't think anything's changed."
The dollar traded as high as 120.13 yen in intraday dealings, the strongest since mid-February 1993 and the sixth consecutive day that the dollar has hit a nearly four-year high. But its subsequent drop left the dollar at 119 yen in New York, down from 119.47 yen on Thursday.
The dollar also fell to 1.6284 marks, from 1.6366. The pound cost $1.6308, up from $1.6292.
Even with the pullback, the dollar still ended the week 2.7 percent higher against the yen and 5.6 percent higher against the mark.
Traders initially bid up the dollar against the yen in Asian trading after a senior Japanese economic official said the yen's weakness was not aggravating Japan's inflation rate. Shinpei Nukaya, a Vice Minister of the Economic Planning Agency, told reporters there was "no big demerit seen" from the yen's drop.
But when the dollar hit 120 yen, speculation swept the market that the Bank of Japan was selling dollars. Still, there was no firm indication that the Bank of Japan was in the market, and its officials declined to comment.
The dollar's retreat against the mark partly reflected news that inflation in three of western Germany's four biggest states accelerated unexpectedly last month, further dimming hopes for an interest-rate reduction in Germany.

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities Prices Are Sharply Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday, as investors sold on concern that coming reports on the economy and wages would show faster growth and greater inflationary pressures.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32 , to 955/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.88 percent, from 6.86 percent on Thursday. A week ago, the yield was 6.83 percent. Fears that new signs of strength in the economy would lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, combined with concerns about the market's ability to absorb a flood of new debt issues, have kept investors uneasy. 
 "The past week in the market has been like trying to jog uphill with 200-pound weights tied to your waist," said Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of the government bond trading at Cowen & Company. With no new data yesterday, many buyers moved to the sidelines.
Mr. Gamba said that market participants were particularly concerned about the Labor Department's employment cost index report for the fourth quarter, which is due on Tuesday. The estimates are for a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent to 1 percent, which would rekindle investor fears of a rate increase, Mr. Gamba said, "probably sooner than later, since everyone already knows it's coming."
If the barrage of new government, corporate and municipal issues "does not continue to plague the market, than the barrage of economic data next week surely will," he said.
In corporate trading, Citicorp sold $450 million of 30-year capital securities yesterday through Citicorp Capital II at a price to yield 8.015 percent, or about 107 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than a Treasury bond due in 2026. They are rated A-1 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
Capital securities are debtlike trust preferred stock that do not add to the company's debt load and that issuers can also defer the cash distribution for up to five years.
In when-issued trading, the Treasury's new inflation-indexed notes being sold on Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 3.49 percent.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
There are two widespread impressions about the growth and decline of religious groups in this country, and both of them -- at least in their unqualified form -- are wrong.
One is the notion that groups adjusting quickly to contemporary ideas, groups that "modernize" or "update," are likely to thrive. 
 The other view is just the opposite: Groups that resist the spirit of the day, remaining faithful to the strict demands of that old-time religion, increase and prosper.
What both theories ignore is that flourishing religious groups are always marked by some mixture of cultural adaptation and cultural resistance.
The first theory is often taken for granted among people who know almost nothing about the current religious landscape. The second is popular among those who know something but perhaps not enough.
That something is the steady, in some cases spectacular, expansion of conservative church groups like the Southern Baptists, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the pentecostal Assemblies of God -- paralleled by the decline of more or less liberal denominations like the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), the United Methodists and the United Church of Christ.
It may seem counterintuitive that churches demanding more should grow more, but analysts have come up with plausible explanations of why, psychologically, this should be so. Liberal religious scholars have attributed such growth to a human urge to flee from the chaos and ambiguity of recent social change. More popular recently have been explanations modeled on economics that see conservative religion as a paradoxical but rational preference despite its apparent "high cost."
According to those explanations, religious groups that insist on strict adherence in belief and conduct drive away the lukewarm -- in economic terms, the "free riders" who use the church mainly for weddings, funerals and seasonal uplift. Consequently, those willing to sacrifice get in return the positive experiences of filled pews, enthusiastic worship and the collective affirmation of otherworldly rewards as well as dependable this-worldly support.
As happens so often, such theories have been exaggerated and simplified. The religious equivalent of "no pain, no gain" gets translated into "the more pain, the more gain" -- an elementary error, as any coach or doctor could attest. When it comes to conservatism, in religion as in economics, there is apparently a point of diminishing returns -- the point where religious demands become so costly that people are driven away.
Last November, Benton Johnson, a sociologist of religion at the University of Oregon, recalled some of these complexities in an address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion and the Religious Research Association.
He based his remarks on studies he had made of theological and political polarization among the Oregon Protestant clergy from the early 1960's to the late 1980's, as well as on research done by others.
Professor Johnson noted the extent to which conservatives, just like liberals, have modified their public stances to accommodate changing culture, although without budging an inch on their basic theological views.
Whatever became of conservative strictures against card-playing, dancing, gambling, drinking and shopping on Sunday, for example?
In 1962, 92 percent of Oregon's Southern Baptist ministers reported preaching against dancing; by 1987, the figure was 13 percent. In 1962, over 80 percent of the state's Baptist pastors had preached against drinking; in 1987, the number had decreased to 24 percent among Conservative Baptists and 8 percent among American Baptists.
And though there are rudimentary conservative efforts to stiffen laws against gambling and divorce, these ministers prefer to occasionally preach against these evils without mobilizing against them politically.
"Despite the posture of militancy and holding the line on doctrinal issues, a process of quiet accommodation has been going on within many old evangelical denominations," Professor Johnson said. "As the culture changes, the conditions for church stability and church growth change."
Those conditions appear to include "a medium degree of tension with the surrounding culture," he said, but only a medium degree. When a changing culture poses new threats to established positions, "it would be demoralizing to oppose none of these threats; it would be too costly to oppose all of them." What gets overlooked, he said, are changes that have already embedded themselves within the membership of these conservative religious groups.
Divorce, for instance. Although in 1987 none of the Baptist pastors had been divorced since entering the ministry, a high percentage -- three-fourths of the Southern Baptist pastors, for example -- reported divorces in their immediate families. A development like that, Professor Johnson believes, has tempered conservatives' views on divorce.
When a church historian, Martin E. Marty, reported Professor Johnson's conclusions in the Jan. 15 issue of The Christian Century, he called such modification of religious principles "negotiating with modernity."
You can view this "negotiating with modernity" as hypocrisy or evidence of creeping compromise. Or you can take it as the moderation that comes with experience. You can argue that growing conservative religious groups have negotiated with modernity better than shrinking liberal ones. But, one way or another, everyone does it.

HEADLINE: Fedex Reinstates Pickups On Dark Streets of Gary

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Federal Express executives have decided that the darkened streets of Gary may not be so menacing, after all.
Severely stung by criticism after it decided on Jan. 16 to eliminate after-dark pickups in the city, Fedex, the largest overnight delivery company, has reversed course. After a boisterous meeting on Wednesday with Mayor Scott King, in which Mr. King threatened to organize a nationwide boycott of the company, the company agreed to return full service. 
 "I can't tell you what they did in the first place, how they came to this boneheaded idea to cut service," Mr. King said. "They embarrassed our city for no good reason, and we were not going to sit back and take it. There was never one bit of supporting evidence that they offered to substantiate their claims that it is not safe for their drivers to work in Gary."
A spokesman for Fedex, Greg Rossiter, said a regional manager made a temporary decision to limit collections from the 10 curbside pickup boxes in the city after the manager had received reports from drivers concerned for their safety.
One driver reportedly said he had seen a handgun being fired into the air. Another driver reported that he feared he was about to be robbed when another vehicle cut off his truck. Other drivers said they had been sent to deliver or pick up packages from abandoned buildings.
None of the incidents were reported to the police. Mr. Rossiter said the company left it to the drivers to notify the police.
Chief John Roby of the Police Department said the police had no reports involving mail or delivery workers filed since 1994.
"That in itself says a lot," Chief Roby said. "These people don't carry cash. They are not easy targets. We have never been contacted by them for any reason."
Mr. Rossiter said Fedex stood by the decision to schedule the final pickups at 4 P.M. instead of 6 P.M., adding that the drivers, most of whom live in or near Gary, had voiced legitimate concerns about their safety and that Fedex policy let managers change service schedules.
Mr. Rossiter said the company had assurances from Chief Roby "that we would be able to call upon the police if there are any future concerns about driver safety."
Chief Roby scoffed at that and said Fedex, like other businesses here, had always had the support of the police and would continue to receive "the same help we have always been ready to provide."
Mr. Rossiter would not say in what other regions Fedex had cut service.
Officials from two other companies, Airborne Express and United Parcel, said their companies never curtailed service for safety reasons, except in cases of mass civil unrest.
U.P.S. drivers who feel unsafe are reassigned to other routes, and a new driver and escort, often an off-duty or a retired police officer, take over that route, said a spokesman, Mark Dickens.
A spokesman for Airborne, Tom Branigan, would not discuss security details, but said Airborne immediately adopted preventive measures in areas that the company viewed as unsafe.
After reviewing the cutback, Fedex offered pickup service until 5 P.M. Mr. King quickly stopped the city from using Fedex and garnered support for a proposed boycott from the Greater Gary Chamber of Commerce and industrial leaders in northwestern Indiana.
"This was not an idle threat," said Thomas McDermott, president of the Northwest Indiana Forum, which includes United States Steel, Inland Steel, LTV and Amoco. "With a few phone calls and faxes we were prepared to put them in a very awkward position."
Discussions with members of the United States Conference of Mayors increased the leverage. The executive director of the conference, J. Thomas Cochran, said members were outraged over the cuts here, coming on the heels of news that Pizza Hut had refused delivery to a high school in Kansas City, Mo., because of safety concerns.
"We are of the opinion that was very unfair, for someone to wake up one morning and redline one particular area where people are paying for services," Mr. Cochran said. "The one thing mayors won't stand for is someone dictating where and when they will and won't service an area. It may start in Gary, and then spread like a cancer to places like New Orleans, Newark, anywhere there is a perception of things not being as they are in the suburbs."
For two years, this steel-mill city 30 minutes from downtown Chicago has had the dubious distinction of having the highest per capita murder rate, 107 murders last year, or 92 per 100,000 of the population, down from a total of 132 in 1995. It is home to 119,125 people, 80 percent of whom are black.
Despite the opening of two riverboat casinos last year, which added more than 2,000 jobs, Gary still has the highest unemployment rate in the state. Its boarded-up downtown is testament to the jobs and businesses that disappeared in the 80's with the collapse of the steel industry.
Mr. King is the first white mayor since 1968, and he has staked his political future on turning around Gary.
"The last thing we needed at this time was a black eye coming out of nowhere," the Mayor said in an interview today. "Hopefully we have all learned a bit from this experience."

HEADLINE: Albright Vows to Seek Support In U.S. for Clinton Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
At her first news conference on her first full day as Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright promised today to stay the course of President Clinton's foreign policy but to sell it better to Congress and the American people.
Speaking of her first trip as Secretary of State, Ms. Albright said she had "already taken it." It was to Capitol Hill, she said, and it will be followed by many more. 
 "The President is serious and I am serious about working with Congress on a bipartisan basis," she said.
She also said she would schedule more events around the country to explain the goals and budgetary needs of American foreign policy.
"We have a strong case to make," she said. "But we cannot expect that case to make itself."
She said her first trip abroad would be to allies in Europe and Asia, a deliberate effort to accent what she called "our most important task -- sustaining momentum toward the creation of a Europe that is united, stable and democratic, and an Asian-Pacific community that cooperates increasingly, based on shared economic interests and a common commitment to peace."
Ms. Albright made no clear departures from the goals of Mr. Clinton's first term.
She said again that "the overall relationship with China" was "multifaceted," with areas of cooperation as well as of sharp difference, like human rights, and "it cannot be held hostage to any one issue." But she added that "we have made it clear" to the Chinese "that what happens in Hong Kong is very important to the overall relationship."
A comprehensive peace in the Middle East is among her highest priorities, but she suggested that she would reserve her own travel and intervention there for later. Her staff is mindful that her predecessor, Warren Christopher, was criticized for spending too much time there.
Ms. Albright said flatly that political contributions had not affected the Administration's foreign policy.
Asked about the Canadian Foreign Minister's trip this week to Cuba, Ms. Albright said relations with Canada were "the best possible," but she excoriated President Fidel Castro.

HEADLINE: The Cuban Tango

 BODY:
The trip to Cuba this week by Canada's Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, was meant to send a strong message of protest to Washington about the overreaching Helms-Burton law. That misguided effort to punish foreign companies that invest in Cuba has already led to Canadian executives' being barred from United States soil, and, if fully enforced, could inundate Canadian businesses with scores of costly lawsuits. Unfortunately, Mr. Axworthy failed to deliver an equally strong protest against the human rights abuses of his Cuban hosts.
Canada is now Cuba's largest foreign investor, and Mr. Axworthy is Ottawa's highest-level visitor to Havana in more than 20 years. Americans cannot reasonably object to his making such a visit. Diplomats from democracies, including American Secretaries of State, visit dictatorships all the time. But such an important visitor should have insisted on the need to release political prisoners and expand individual liberties in this hemisphere's most repressive dictatorship. 
 Mr. Axworthy reports that he did raise human rights issues in his private meetings with Cuban leaders. Canada also provides funds to independent Cuban groups that campaign for environmentally sensitive development and gay rights. But on the most pressing issue, encouraging democratic change, Canada is doing less than it should. Ottawa ought to follow the example of the European Union, which recently decided to link any strengthening of its economic ties with Cuba to an expansion of the human and political rights of the Cuban people.
Fidel Castro's dictatorial rule and market-stifling economic policies have stunted Cuba for so long that it has become hard to imagine significant change. But Mr. Castro's advancing years and the economic crisis provoked by the end of Soviet subsidies make transition inevitable. It is in the interest of the United States, Canada and Cuba that change, when it comes, be peaceful and democratic.
By locking itself into a failed policy of rigid economic isolation, Washington deprives itself of the influence it should have as Cuba's most important neighbor and the home to the world's largest overseas Cuban community. Canada makes the opposite mistake. By not using its economic influence to press for political change, it forfeits its opportunity to exert a positive influence.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Treasurer Plans To Sell State Disability Fund

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Whitman administration announced plans today to sell the State Disability Benefit Fund, which distributes about $325 million annually to New Jersey workers who are temporarily disabled as a result of sickness or injury unrelated to their jobs.
The State Treasurer, Brian W. Clymer, said the sale would not have a noticeable impact, at least right away, on the more than 2.4 million employees and employers who contribute about $370 million through payroll deductions each year to the fund. Benefits are provided for up to 26 weeks to help make up for wages lost by the temporarily disabled, such as working women who have just given birth. The maximum weekly benefit is $339. 
 Mr. Clymer estimated that the fund could be sold for $200 million, allowing the Whitman administration to use the proceeds as a one-shot revenue source to help balance the $16 billion state budget that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is scheduled to propose next week.
This is the second time Mr. Clymer has turned to the State Disability Benefit Fund for budget savings. Last year, Mr. Clymer took $250 million from the fund's surplus to help balance the state budget. He said he did not know whether a surplus now exists in the fund and whether that would be part of the sale.
Democratic lawmakers attacked the proposal, accusing the Whitman administration of balancing the budget on the backs of working people. "Four out of five workers are covered by the temporary disability benefits that Governor Whitman intends to sell," State Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden County said. "Since the state's temporary disability insurance has been an efficient program with low overhead, its sale clearly has more to do with the Governor's need to find revenue than common sense."
Mr. Clymer announced the proposed sale during a news conference about the state's revenue projections for the new budget. He projected moderate economic growth, and a $264 million increase in state tax revenue in the coming year. New Jersey, like New York, is benefiting from the boom on Wall Street, with personal income tax receipts estimated at $200 million more than anticipated for this fiscal year.
New Jersey and New York are among five states that administer temporary disability benefit plans. The fund was created in 1948, at a time when private insurance companies did not offer such benefits. But now, Mr. Clymer said, there are more than 4,000 approved insurance plans offering similar benefits, enabling the state to turn the fund over to a private insurer.
"It is not something that we need to be in the business of," Mr. Clymer said. "It is not something that we do efficiently. This is a competitive market. We should not be competing with the private market."
Private employers, who are required by state law to provide temporary disability insurance benefits to their employees, already have the option to purchase benefits from private insurers. But almost 80 percent of the companies that do business in New Jersey choose to participate in the state plan, state officials said.
While Mr. Clymer said increased competition in the insurance industry would benefit both employers and workers, it was unclear whether participants in the disability fund would be able to take advantage of such competition immediately.
Mr. Clymer declined to provide details about the proposed sale, but he did acknowledge that the state would sell the fund's customer base. Taxes that are now paid by employers and employees would be converted into premiums. It is unclear whether current participants in the plan would have the option to leave the plan after the sale, which Mr. Clymer said he hoped would be completed by June. But benefit levels andcurrent tax rates would remain unchanged, he said.
Taxes on employers range from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-quarters of 1 percent, and the employee tax is a flat one-half of 1 percent; each tax is applied against the first $17,600 of wages earned. That means the lowest-income and highest-income wage earners in New Jersey pay about the same $100 in annual payroll taxes for temporary disability benefits.
New Jersey is one of three states that imposes payroll taxes on employees in addition to employers.

HEADLINE: Javits Center President Reportedly Tops Pataki's List to Take Over the Port Authority

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
The president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, Robert E. Boyle, is Gov. George E. Pataki's top choice to become executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, officials said yesterday.
The new executive director will run an agency that both Governors want to continue shifting away from development deals to focus on transportation. The agency's chairman said the changes mean the elimination of 500 jobs this year. 
 Combined with the dismissals, early retirements and job attrition that began in August 1995, that will reduce the number of employees to 7,300, from 9,100. Former executives and senior employees say the downsizing is wrecking one of the nation's blue-chip public service agencies, but Port Authority officials say the changes are long overdue.
"The determination has been made that we are really not a real estate development agency and that our core mission is transportation infrastructure," said Lewis M. Eisenberg, the chairman, who announced the new job cuts in an interview. "I would say it is an agency which is more focused, its purpose and design are more clear, than in the past."
Governor Pataki is expected to announce the new director next week. Mr. Boyle, a friend of the Governor's from his hometown of Peekskill, won the administration's approval for confronting the unions at the Javits Center that the Governor felt were driving up costs.
Mr. Boyle did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Aides to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she would have no reaction until an announcement was made.
Mrs. Whitman was angry two years ago when Governor Pataki announced his decision to appoint George J. Marlin to the post without consulting her. In replacing Mr. Marlin, who will leave April 3, the new executive director will oversee an agency shrinking for the first time in its 75-year history.
Critics of the retrenchment say the once proud guardian of the region's gateways and the developer of the World Trade Center has been brought low by a series of blind swings of the downsizing ax.
They describe an agency so bent on change that it plans to unload valuable real estate without regard to the long-term revenue consequences, so fixed on reducing staff that the employee exodus has left La Guardia Airport bereft of one third of its electricians, and so riven by jealousy between New York and New Jersey that a project to extend the runway at Newark International Airport has yet to be approved two years after its introduction.
Supporters of the new direction counter that the authority was a dinosaur gamboling in the fields of big government, unaware of the realities of the leaner 1990's. The two state administrations have yet to produce a full blueprint of how far the cutbacks should go, but there is no doubt further shrinkage lies ahead.
"The question is what are we going to do to improve the transportation system in the region, the waterway and the harbors, not if we can build an industrial park somewhere," said Charles Gargano, the vice chairman. "It had a reputation for a lot of waste, for not watching out for the interests of New York. They did not have a focus on the core mission of the Port Authority, which was the transportation systems of the region and how they can focus on improving the economy of the region."
The authority still runs major enterprises, including the region's three major airports, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the PATH commuter rail line. But entire departments within the agency have disappeared, including its export marketing section, its trade library and independent groups that analyzed the environment and economic policy. It sold off the Vista Hotel for $141.5 million and parts of industrial parks in Elizabeth, N.J., andYonkers.
Various privatization options are being considered for the World Trade Center, and the organization wants to sell Piers 1 to 5 in Brooklyn as well as the grain terminal there. A $1 billion international arrival building at Kennedy International Airport will be built and run by a private company, and its 105 employees will not work for the Port Authority. It handed the Passenger Ship Terminal to the city on Dec. 31.
December also witnessed one of the largest departures of senior management and technical staff. The Port Authority said it had yet to compile complete figures, but those leaving said it amounted to roughly 300 of the most experienced employees, including 8 of the 24 electricians at La Guardia Airport and the building crews that helped restore the World Trade Center after it was bombed in 1993. Also, in the last two years, at least 17 of 28 senior department heads have quit or retired.
In interviews, a dozen of the people who have left cited three main reasons. First, they feared the authority would either be eliminated or shrunk to a point where all it did was manage a few bridges and railroads, without generating revenue to finance new prestige projects. Second, they felt the new management no longer welcomed proposals for new ventures. Third, they wanted to get good salaries with private companies before the changes tarnished the authority's reputation.
"There is a high level of angst and uncertainty," said John Collura, who worked for the authority for 26 years and was chief operating officer when he left in March 1996. Much of the uncertainty stemmed from the way the downsizing was handled, the employees said, with little internal discussion or warning.
In seeking to unload important real estate like the World Trade Center or letting a private company build and run Kennedy Airport, the authority risked cutting itself off from the sources of revenue that allowed it to be an independent agency not beholden to local government.
"The Port Authority will wind up more like the Metropolitan Transit Authority or New Jersey Transit by living day to day, putting off maintenance," said Richard C. Leone, a former chairman. By tradition, the governor of New Jersey appoints the chairman and the governor of New York names the executive director, although they are supposed to consult on their choices.
Employees who had departed said the changes had not affected safety and the public would probably not notice, although it often meant postponing preventive maintenance.
"Any time you lose experienced people, some things could possibly take longer to rectify," said Joseph DiPrisco, 52, who took the December buyout after 34 years employment.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market fell yesterday for the third consecutive session as investors appeared to be growing more concerned about rising interest rates and this year's fast climb to repeated record highs.
The decline ended the busiest week of trading ever on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of 2.8 billion shares. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 59.27 points to close at 6,696.48, capping a late week plunge that left the index up just 3.9 percent for the year.
"You had a 6 1/2 to 7 percent month until the last three days, and that's way too strong," said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan. "It was just running too fast; it was running way ahead of the fundamentals."
Although few analysts had an easy explanation for the market's slide, many tied it to rising interest rates in the bond market -- which could lure some cash out of the stock market -- and worries about next week's Employment Cost Index report, a key measure of inflation.
The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.88 percent yesterday, from 6.86 percent on Thursday, and has jumped half a percentage point in less than two months.
The Employment Cost Index, which measures growth in wages, has been singled out by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as a key barometer of inflationary pressures.
While most analysts are predicting that the Fed will not raise its short-term interest rate target at its policy meeting next month, a rise in the Employment Cost Index could set the stage for an interest rate rise later this year.
"I think the market's starting to come to grips with the reality that the increase in the Employment Cost Index means the Fed may raise rates," said John H. Shaughnessy, an analyst at the Advest Group.
Several analysts argued, though, that the economic outlook remained strong and that all the fundamentals for a strong stock market were still in place, including strong cash flows into mutual funds.
And while some expressed concern about the market's volatility and the defensive posture of many investors who have been buying safer, large capitalization stocks, most analysts said the drop this week was healthy.
"What we are going through is a two- or three-day jolt in the market," said Edward Collins, head of stock trading at Daiwa Securities. "I've been in this business a long time and you don't go straight up. But I still think we have a little more run to go in this one."
While the Dow was down throughout the day, falling as much as 93 points, it recovered some of the loss, ending down 0.88 percent in a volatile session of trading. Du Pont and Eastman Kodak led the Dow's decline. Du Pont dropped 4 7/8, to 102 5/8, and Kodak fell 2 7/8, to 85 5/8.
After an impressive run this year in which the Dow gained more than 435 points, or 6.8 percent, as of Tuesday, the blue-chip index has lost 187.42 points. Early in the week, many analysts said, investors began anticipating a blockbuster month that seemed likely to take the Dow to 7,000. But the retreat has forced them to scale back their ambitions.
"The market has positioned itself in a very defensive way," said Richard Eakle, a market analyst at Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. "People are moving away from small cap stocks. They don't want to worry about the problem of liquidity. It's a lot easier to sell Eastman Kodak than a small cap."
Broader market indexes were also down. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 7.04 points to close at 770.52. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.54 points, to 1,363.83.
One of the few stocks to escape unscathed was Microsoft, which gained 13/16 , to 9515/16 . However, shares of Cascade Communications, which makes telecommunications equipment, plunged 23 1/8, or 36 percent, to close at 41. Analysts ignored an earnings report that beat their expectations and concentrated on what they saw as future weaknesses.
Yet even though many analysts were concerned about the market's jittery mood, some said that the market had proved its resilience time and again. In July, the Dow lost 254 points over three days, before recovering. And in December it lost 205 points over four days, only to bounce back.
"The fundamental picture can hardly be better," said Robert Stovall of Stovall 21st Advisers. "I don't see any conspiracy out there. All you're seeing is a market that's twitchy and sensitive."
One recent convert to bullishness is Elaine Garzarelli, the former Lehman Brothers market strategist who now runs her own firm, Garzarelli Capital. Ms. Garzarelli, who had been bearish on the stock market since July, switched her stance this week, a fact that was widely reported on Thursday as the Dow dropped 94 points. In an interview yesterday, she conceded she had failed to predict a continued bull market, but that a revised "model" that eliminated "cash flows" from her studies now pointed to a bull market.
"I was trying to find out what happened and it took so long," she said, explaining why it took her half a year to revise her outlook.
Now, she says she is "normally bullish" and is forecasting that the Dow could rise 10 to 15 percent. And she said she was happy she switched just as the market started a correction, which means her clients can get in at a lower price. "We're getting in on a nice correction," she said.

Supermarket Chain to Pay $81.5 Million in Bias Suit
Florida's largest supermarket chain agreed to pay $81.5 million to settle accusations that it systematically denied promotions, raises and preferred assignments to its women employees. The settlement, by Publix Supermarkets, may be the largest workplace discrimination case in terms of the number of people it covers.
The class-action lawsuit covers more than 100,000 women who have worked since 1991 at Publix stores in Florida and other Southern states. [Page 1.]

White House Coffee for Bankers
The Democratic National Committee organized a meeting at the White House last May in which some of the nation's most prominent bankers met to discuss banking regulation with President Clinton, a senior bank regulator, the Treasury Secretary and the top fund-raiser for the party, Administration officials said. The meeting was one of 103 at the White House arranged by the Democratic Party that were attended by the President and other top officials. [1.]
 
Abortion Pill Is Closer to Market
Three years ago, it seemed inevitable that the French abortion pill would soon be sold on the American market. But a dispute between the American group that was given the patent rights to the pill, RU-486, and the businessman the group had chosen to raise money and arrange for the pill's manufacture and distribution kept the pill off the market. Now there is hope that the stalemate is ending. [7.]
 
Bond Prices Fall Sharply
Prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply, as investors sold on concern that coming reports on the economy and wages would show faster growth and greater inflationary pressures. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 955/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.88 percent from 6.86 percent on Thursday. [38.]
 
Dollar Rises, Then Slips
The dollar vaulted over the 120-yen barrier for the first time in nearly four years then dropped, hurt by fear that Japan's central bank was selling dollars to defend the yen. The dollar fell against other major currencies on profit taking from the dollar's sharp rise over the last week and on news of higher inflation in Germany. [36.]

Big Bankruptcy in South Korea
The Hanbo Steel Corporation, South Korea's second-largest steel producer and the flagship of one of the country's big industrial conglomerates, is seeking court protection from its creditors, dealing a new blow to an economy already reeling from labor strife and prompting an injection of money into the financial system by the central bank. Hanbo's collapse, one of the biggest in Korean corporate history, was caused largely by a plant expansion that the company could not afford. [38.]
 
More Funds for Food Inspections
President Clinton's 1998 budget will propose spending $43 million for a program to detect outbreaks of food-borne illnesses and to improve food safety. [1.]

Fresh Moves for British Telecom
Fresh from striking Britain's largest corporate acquisition, in which British Telecommunications will buy MCI Communications of the United States for $20 billion, the chief executive of British Telecom is charting additional steps toward turning this once-mundane utility into the world's fourth-largest telecommunications enterprise. Sir Peter Bonfield said his personal experience working in the United States would help BT shift from being just a telephone company into a multiservice, multimedia telecommunications phenomenon. [38.]

Coffee Prices Fall As Strike Ends
Coffee prices tumbled after dock workers in Colombia ended a 10-day strike, allowing thousands of bags of coffee to flow into the world market. The strike at the key Colombian port of Buenaventura ended after union leaders and management reached a wage agreement, port officials said. [36.]

HEADLINE: 10 Abandoned Children Found in Ramshackle Atlantic City House

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
With two kerosene heaters for warmth and nothing to eat but canned vegetables, 10 children lived alone for three weeks in an abandoned, crumbling row house in the shadow of the city's shimmering casinos, the authorities here said today.
They survived without electricity, running water or a back door, using buckets as a toilet and scurrying to school each morning for a free breakfast, the officials said. 
 Building inspectors knocked on the door of the house at 633 Baltic Avenue on Thursday after receiving a call from a neighbor who smelled kerosene, said Steven M. Greenwood, a code enforcement officer. When they peered inside, he said, they saw the children and two adults sitting in the dark. Drug paraphernalia was strewn around the squalid apartment, he said, and the acrid-sweet smell of crack cocaine hung in the air.
The children, who range in age from 1 to 16, told officials that they were from Camden and Trenton, but that they had been alone in the house since early January, during some of the winter's most bitter cold. Wendy Patella, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services, would not say how many of the children were boys and how many were girls, nor would she say how many of them were related. As of tonight, the children's parents and relatives had been identified but had not been located.
The two adults, a man and a woman, told the officials that they were not related to the children, Mr. Greenwood said. He said the police questioned them and allowed them to leave.
The children, who were evaluated for health problems at the Atlantic City Medical Center, have been placed with foster families, Ms. Patella said.
Mr. Greenwood, who made the chilling discovery with other building inspectors, police officers and social workers, said the children had at first refused to reveal even their names. One of the boys, an 11-year-old, tried to keep the others from talking, he said. But eventually, he said, they told the inspectors that their parents had dropped them off at the house three weeks ago and never returned.
The building had been without any plumbing since 1994, Mr. Greenwood said, and without electricity or gas since early last year when the building's owner, Alex Michel, vanished.
The children had apparently been surviving by stealing water and sometimes running an electrical cord from another unoccupied house next door. But when inspectors arrived at noon, they said that the house was dark and without any utilities.
Two dogs were roaming the apartment, and the floors were covered with feces and the tools of drug users -- wax paper that had held crack rocks and heating spoons still covered with their residue.
Upstairs, a baby girl lay in a crib sleeping in the cold and appeared unconscious, though 10 minutes of gentle prodding by inspectors finally revived her. The other children appeared healthy, with only slight sniffles and colds, Mr. Greenwood said.
"This place was a shambles," Mr. Greenwood said, adding that dilapidated buildings are far too common in this city of about 38,000 people, just blocks from the hulking rows of casinos that thrive even in the dead of winter. "Sheets were being used as doors, there was garbage everywhere and when my inspector walked into the kitchen, his foot went through the floor."
"While we've got a lot of abandoned buildings here," he added, "we've never had a situation like this where kids were just left to fend for themselves."
Today, the block was quiet except for reporters milling about and children hurrying home from school, many in baggy jeans and carrying boom boxes. The doors and windows of the building were boarded up. A warning sign read, "This structure is unfit for human occupancy."
Neighbors said they had not seen the children until this week, when a few ventured out to sit on the building's stoop or walk to a nearby school. Many spoke bitterly about the deterioration of their city, where the casinos lure many to seek their fortune, but the wealth has never spread past Caesar's Palace, the Trump Taj Mahal or other gambling venues.
A resident, Tony Brown, said he thought the mothers of the abandoned children were two sisters in their late 20's who had moved here from the South, hoping to find good jobs at the casinos. They found work, he said, but quickly squandered their earnings on drugs.
"They had no family to depend on," he said. "They were very good people. They just got a bad deal."
Mr. Brown and others said it was not uncommon here these days to find children fending for themselves in decrepit housing, with only occasional visits from relatives. Affordable housing is harder than ever to find, he added, and drugs can be bought on many street corners.
Child services officials said that 337 children had been abandoned in New Jersey in 1995, the last year for which they have records.
"People are living in these abandoned buildings all over the city, kids and all," Mr. Brown said. "All over the streets you can get the drugs. I've got to blame this on the drugs."
Omar Africa, an unemployed father of five who was walking his son home from school, said it was obvious for a long time that the building had been taken over by drug users. He questioned why city officials and neighbors had not investigated sooner.
"It's been that way for a long time but nobody said a thing," he said, gesturing toward the boarded-up structure. "Whoever finally called should be commended, but I don't think they were the first to notice there was a problem here."
While many neighbors surmised that drugs were at the root of the problem, few were willing to let the children's missing parents off the hook. Many parents in this blighted section of the city were struggling, but would not think of leaving their children, they said.
"They should burn these parents, not lock them up," said Steve Serale, who was visiting a friend on the block. "You don't jeopardize your kids like that for anything or anyone."
Despite the squalid conditions they had endured for the past three weeks, the children remained reluctant to leave and took pains to protect their parents, inspectors said, noting that it took several minutes of cajoling to get them even to tell their names. Mr. Greenwood said that small talk about their dogs -- one whose name was Cheese -- and his offer to tie one child's shoelaces helped win them over.
"They were really shy, bummed out, and we had to push them along," he said. "But they had an idea of what was about to happen. By the end, they seemed pretty enthused about getting out."
The younger children waved goodbye, he said, and smiled from the back of the police cars that rushed them away from their home.

HEADLINE: An AIDS Nursing Home Finds It Is No Longer the Last Stop

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
Deric Dixon had a bout of double pneumonia in December that could have killed him. But it didn't.
Mr. Dixon, a clerical worker who has AIDS, had been taking a new class of drugs, protease inhibitors, that are extending lives. He swallows 30 pills a day, at 9 A.M., 4 P.M. and 9 P.M., since he became a patient at the Rivington House, a nursing home for people with AIDS on the Lower East Side. 
 When Mr. Dixon arrived at the center last summer, his legs looked like tree trunks because they were so bloated from fluids caused by an AIDS-related cancer, Kaposi's Sarcoma. The new drugs kept his immune system from deteriorating further and allowed his body to stabilize in the months before the pneumonia.
"If it wasn't for the drugs, he would be dead," said Steven A. DeMartino, a staff supervisor at Rivington House. "All indications are that he's more resilient. When is the last time you heard somebody say that about the H.I.V. disease? We're not used to talking that way."
When the Rivington House opened two years ago, the 219-bed center was the last stop for many AIDS patients. The length of stay was 12 to 15 days, and the death rate was nearly 50 percent. In recent months, the length of stay has risen to 120 days. More people are feeling healthier and are going home. And the death rate at Rivington House, the nation's largest residential health-care facility for AIDS patients, has fallen 20 percent, which has left the center with about 20 empty beds.
Mr. Dixon's experience and the empty beds at Rivington are part of a new chapter in the AIDS epidemic: Like many people with AIDS who are taking advantage of the new drug therapies, Mr. Dixon is feeling better and thinking that he might be around longer than he expected.
In Washington yesterday, New York City health officials reported that for the first time since 1981, deaths from AIDS declined sharply, falling by 30 percent from 1995 for all racial and ethnic groups. The decline actually began before protease inhibitors were widely available, but experts say that as protease inhibitors become more widely used there should be an even sharper decline in deaths.
Like many residential treatment centers and hospitals in New York, the Rivington House has seen the ripple effects of the advent of a powerful new class of drugs that is bringing many people back from the brink of death.
At the center, new questions are being asked. The big one is: What now? What do the AIDS patients do, now that they have gotten better instead of worse?
For some patients, the new drugs have kindled a fragile kind of hope, adding to the terror, the confusion and the complexities already in their lives.
Mr. Dixon, a slight, bespectacled man in a plaid sweater, said the new drugs have given him a sense that he can look forward to living perhaps 5 or 10 years more rather than 2. Mr. Dixon, who has worked as an administrative assistant at Community Access, an agency that provides housing and other services for people with mental illness, moved to New York from Detroit, where he said his family had rejected him because he is gay. Now, Mr. Dixon, who takes psychotropic drugs for manic depression, is weighing questions he had never dreamed he would have a chance to consider. He talks about his hope to reconcile with his family and other matters of the heart.
"Will I allow myself to love someone again? How will I tell someone I have AIDS?," he said yesterday.
Still, many patients are dying, with or without the new drugs, including a young mother in the room next to Mr. Dixon's, a patient Rivington officials said was within hours of death.
While the new drugs have made many patients stronger, officials at Rivington House and elsewhere see danger in the growing sense of optimism among those who have concluded that the disease is soon to be beaten.
"I don't think we've turned the corner," said Linda A. Domizio, director of professional services at Rivington House. "I think it's too premature to make any projections about what's going to happen in the future. It's a very difficult regimen to adhere to. And we don't know what the long-term effects are going to be."
But the new drugs have given many people with AIDS a glimmer of hope. At the Rivington House, a six-story, red-brick structure that used to be a public school, patients are talking about getting their G.E.D.s, getting jobs, even getting their teeth fixed. The corridor walls are decorated with brightly colored artwork, painted by patients. A golden retriever, named Dinah, nuzzles patients and prowls halls.
But despite the center's welcoming atmosphere, Joseph Breen is eager to leave at the end of the month. Mr. Breen, who has been on protease inhibitors for nearly a year, looks forward to going back to his acting career.
Breen, who is 38, has had side effects including a painful kidney stone attack that sent him weeping to a hospital emergency room. He switched medications.
Mr. Breen, who has three children and a ex-wife in Connecticut, said he used to be a leading man in television soap operas including "Guiding Light," "As the World Turns" and "Loving." At one point, he said, he was making more than $300,000 annually, but three years of unemployment have left him with only Social Security disability benefits.
Mr. Breen will move to a house run by the Actor's Fund of America, for entertainers who have AIDS. Some days he believes he will have a normal life expectancy. But on a recent day, after he experienced a night of discomfort from kidney problems, he asked a staff worker if he would live to see a cure.
"I will never stop taking these AIDS medications until there is a proven cure," he said yesterday. "You can't play around with this disease."

HEADLINE: Stand Firm on Police Pay

 BODY:
For the last two years, the union representing New York City's nearly 38,000 police officers has tried every conceivable tactic to avoid the realities accepted by other municipal employees. The union tried to run around Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and get the Legislature in Albany to arrange for higher wages than the city can afford. Now that the courts have effectively blocked that approach, the union has rejected the Mayor's latest sensible offer and thrown up picket lines at precincts around the city. Mr. Giuliani, whose political reputation rests heavily on his crime-fighting zeal, must stand firm and not be bullied by these police protests.
Though the city's economy has improved recently, the fiscal situation remains imperiled by projections of deficits in the years ahead. Accordingly, in 1995 Mr. Giuliani negotiated five-year contracts with most city unions, calling for a wage freeze in the first two years and an increase of 13.3 percent in the last three years. Now the city has offered the police a two-year freeze followed by an increase of about 15.5 percent over three years, a considerably more generous package, provided the police make concessions on work rules and pension payments to cover the extra cost. City Hall is right to demand that wage increases be funded by improved productivity. 
 Part of the problem is that the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has been ill served by its leadership for years. This week, a Federal grand jury indicted top officials of a sister union representing the transit police on racketeering charges. Among those charged was James J. Lysaght, a lawyer who designed the P.B.A.'s strategy of trying to use political muscle in Albany to circumvent the city. Mr. Lysaght is entitled to the presumption of innocence, of course, but his strategy of trying to muscle the city by going to Albany has been a diversion. Police officers should demand that he step aside in favor of leadership willing to negotiate in good faith with City Hall.
The P.B.A. makes several arguments to support its claim for preferential treatment, all of them fallacious. The union says the police should get credit for the city's decline in crime. But police officers are already reaping a bonanza in overtime from the recent crackdown on drug trafficking in Brooklyn and upper Manhattan, and other actions.
The police also think they should be paid what their fellow officers are paid in Nassau and Suffolk counties. But their wages are comparable to what the police are paid in other big cities, the most meaningful comparison. New York City police get benefits, vacations, sick leave and pensions that are much more generous than those in many suburban communities. If New York City officers want to be compared to their brothers and sisters in the suburbs, they could agree to one-person patrol cars in low-crime areas and other work-rule changes that help cut costs in those places. The union should also work to expedite arrest and arraignment procedures to cut overtime costs.
If the police union insists on rejecting the city offer and going to an arbitration proceeding, Mr. Giuliani should widen his scope and demand the changes in work rules and benefits that the police have resisted for so long. A much better alternative would be for the police to recognize that they are not going to get a better deal from the city or arbitration, no matter how much noise they make.

HEADLINE: Let the Users Pay for New York's Rail Tunnel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to build a railroad tunnel beneath New York Harbor (news article, Jan. 15): I applaud any effort to return more of the region's freight to the rails. But how will this affect the overall transportation system? Yes, the highways are a mess and the railroads underused, but the massive public expenditures on highways in the 1940's through the 1960's shifted the system to the current status quo.
Major and shortline railroads, steamships and national and local trucking companies are all working in the marketplace delivering goods. A harbor tunnel would shift the system out of balance. For example, Conrail has an exclusive ability to move freight destined for Long Island via the old New York Central Railroad line from Albany. Would the tunnel authorities allow other railways to access Long Island? What if a steamship company decided to start a subsidiary railroad to utilize the tunnel? How would the tunnel affect the contracts between steamships, railroads and trucking companies now moving freight to and from the region? 
 Rather than use public funds to influence the system, City Hall should tell the transportation companies that there is a problem and that they need to fix it. New York City demanded that the New York Central Railroad eliminate steam engines within city limits in 1905 and gave them five years to solve the problem. The railroads have built bridges, tunnels and new track when the economics were favorable, and they would do it again. Offering public funds when private capital exists is poor public policy.

HEADLINE: Jewels of the Desert

BYLINE: By KIM WESTERMAN; KIM WESTERMAN, a poet and food writer, lives in northern Tucson.

 BODY:
STANDING in line at Le Cave's Bakery in South Tucson, I found myself in conversation with a Yaqui teen-ager who wore shiny cowboy boots, some of the reddest I'd ever seen. "Stewart Boots -- Just fitted for my 16th birthday," he said self-consciously as he sidled up to the counter and ordered a pumpkin empanada.
The Stewart Boot Manufacturing Company is easy to miss. The ramshackle building looks like all the other small white houses on 28th Street, just off South Sixth Avenue, the commercial hub of South Tucson's Mexican-American community. The front door sticks and the dark, low-ceilinged room is wall-to-wall boots. One of the craftsmen left his sewing machine and greeted my companion, Jane, and me in the small area set aside for sizing. In less than 20 minutes I had ordered a pair of mustard-yellow, square-toed custom boots in kid skin. 
 Ten blocks north of Stewart Boots is el barrio, the neighborhood that, for me, is both the genesis and sustenance of border culture in Arizona. I've gotten to know the barrio well over the last seven years, making frequent visits from my home in the foothills of northern Tucson. The trip is usually an end in itself, but this time we used it as a starting point for a weekend trip across the border.
There is a palpable friction here -- among cultures, languages and values -- but it is a creative friction. The barrio is a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood where Anglos and Mexican Americans live in relative harmony as middle income families buy up old homes in need of repair.
A walk along Convent Avenue and Cushing Street uncovered some beautifully preserved 19th-century adobe homes. Some have corrugated steel roofs, an apparent concession to those who complained that Tucson didn't seem like an "American" town. Fortunately, many settlers were interested in preserving their Hispanic past, including meticulous details like saguaro-rib ceilings, now outlawed since the saguaro cactus is threatened by overdevelopment.
It was October, and the long summer, with its relentless sun and dry, staccato winds, had finally lifted. In fall the young desert light is diffuse and less threatening.
This border zone is in the Sonoran Basin, which extends 60 miles north to the Gila River in Arizona and 200 miles south to Hermosillo, Mexico, the capital of Sonora. Since ours was a brief trip, we traversed only the interior of the basin, from South Tucson down to Magdalena, Sonora, about a hundred miles one way.
Heading south, away from the urban hum, we were in the desert proper within 10 minutes. As deserts go, it is lush, but the eye must be trained to see into the vast expanse partially rimmed by the Santa Rita Mountains.
Flat terrain of wiry ocotillo plants and creosote bushes (sweet-smelling after a rain) is punctuated sparely with saguaro cactuses, whose stature belies their fragility. It's hard not to anthropomorphize these giants in an otherwise lunar landscape.
Like many plants in the basin, saguaros grow nowhere else on earth. Even though they've undergone adaptations that allow them to survive in an extreme climate, their survival counts on a tenuous ecosystem of interdependence. As seedlings, they must be sheltered from the blistering sun in order to develop their complex insulation and water storage systems. Growth is slow: arm buds appear only after 75 years. During monsoon season, when the ground often becomes saturated and winds kick up, these ancients, with their shallow root systems, are in danger of being simply knocked over.
We decided to go for a walk in Madera Canyon, a bird sanctuary and wildlife refuge halfway between South Tucson and the Mexican border. The 19-mile drive out of the desert and up into Coronado National Forest is an almost imperceptible climb, but, indeed, we'd entered another microclimate. At 5,400 feet, the air was crystalline, the landscape populated with evergreen oaks, mesquite, white-limbed sycamores, and my favorite: alligator junipers, named for their scaly bark, which camouflages a variety of lizards.
A half-hour walk on the well-maintained Super Trail deposited us at the base of a waterfall, the mouth of a substantial creek, probably fed by Mount Wrightson (9,453 feet), behind which the sun had just set. Walking back to the car, I spotted a raccoonlike coatimundi scurrying in the last light of the day.
Our destination for the evening was Sonoita, the beginning of Arizona wine country, with some 10 wineries. Sonoita's downtown, an area that has outgrown its truck-stop roots and is emerging as a wild West strip mall, is the unlikely location of Er Pastaro, an Italian restaurant where we had a delightful dinner. The Roman chef, Giovanni Schifano, and his Austrian wife, Karin, close up every summer and return to their home in the Maltese Islands, bringing back enough hand-picked capers to last all year. I had the perfectly al dente spaghetti alla carbonara (with bacon, eggs and cream), and Jane had penne alla Norcia, an Umbrian dish with sausage and mushrooms. We shared a bottle of rough Sicilian red wine, appropriately tannic for the rich food.
We stayed at the Vineyard Bed-and-Breakfast, a 1916 restored hacienda on 20 acres of oaks, grasslands, and vineyards. Our freestanding casita, decorated in southwestern motif, provided views of the grounds in every direction.
Morning brought clouds, but Sonoitans are quick to say they don't indicate rain. Or more precisely, when it does rain, it usually evaporates before it can land, leaving long, dark traces in the sky. The Spanish name for this phenomenon is "nublina," but Jane calls them witches' hairs, lovely all along deserted scenic Highway 82, which we took because we were eager to reach Nogales, the U.S.-Mexico border, by lunch.
We parked on the Arizona side in order to buy the inexpensive car insurance that a sojourn into Mexico necessitates. Then we crossed the border on foot to search for a particular kind of hand-blown water glass I had found years ago at the Lazy Frog, a craft store just off tourist row, and one of the few retail outlets in Nogales in which bargaining is frowned upon.
I didn't find them, but I did pick up some vanilla without coumarin, a common chemical additive. Nearby, I bought Portofidio Single Barrel Anejo (aged) tequila -- smooth, creamy and slightly sweet.
NOGALES is Spanish for walnuts. It is said that when the city was named in 1854, two identical walnut trees mirrored each other on opposite sides of the border. There is no sign of those trees in this burgeoning, but still mostly poor, metropolis.
Ambos Nogales -- "both Nogaleses" -- is economically and spiritually one city, separated, but not divided, by a wire fence. It was here, in 1882, that Mexico was first connected to the United States by rail. Now, because of hotly contested immigration laws, the heavily policed border is ominous, but the folklorist James Griffith documented a practice common in the 1980's: international volleyball games, with the wire fence serving as net.
We picked up the car and crossed into Mexico, where teen-age boys with automatic weapons were guarding the towns of San Ignacio and Imuris. Seventeen roadside shrines and an hour later, we were in the old mission community of Magdalena, looking at the bones of Eusebio Francisco Kino, the Jesuit missionary who died on the church grounds in 1711. Discovered under the chapel by archeologists in 1966, the bones now rest in full view in the center of the plaza under a glass dome.
The Spanish Colonial town is striking in its architectural simplicity. White, hacienda-style structures with tile roofs form a square around the 15-acre plaza. Wide streets that once saw horses and buggies now give passage to pedestrians.
The church of Santa Maria Magdalena de Buquivaba is the locus of a multicultural convergence each October for the feast day of the Roman Catholic St. Francis of Assisi. The pilgrims are Mexican, Mexican-American, Anglo, Yaqui and O'odham. They come to touch and kiss the statue of yet another saint, Francis Xavier, patron of missionaries, whose life-size image lies horizontally, as in death, in the chapel adjoining the main sanctuary. A few try, out of what seems a violent desperation, to lift the statue's head, an ability believed to be granted to those who are right with God.
They also come to purchase beautiful painted glass frames, cuadritos, intended for sacred pictures. I chose a frame bearing the image of a translucent green lizard on a slate background, planning to use the frame itself as the picture. Shopkeepers complained that they wouldn't get much business for the rest of the year; they bring in 80 percent of their yearly income on the feast day.
We wandered through the Plaza Monumental, satisfying in its symmetry, then turned back north toward Nogales, where we stopped for a dinner of Guaymas shrimp at La Roca, an ornate, second-floor restaurant built into the side of an enormous rock. Inside the cavelike space, the rock provides a partial ceiling and the entire east wall. Camarones mojo de ajo (shrimp with butter and garlic) is a house specialty that I can never resist, but the menu listed 10 other shrimp preparations, including batter-fried and grilled.
There is never much traffic crossing the border back into the States after 10 P.M. It is harder, though, to enter the United States than it is to enter Mexico; American border patrol agents take their time questioning each driver and passenger, choosing some, in an elusive logic, to submit to searches. We were waved through.
We had booked a room at Rio Rico Resort, 11 miles north of the border, a sprawling complex high on a mesa with quiet rooms and stunning mountain views. Our third-floor room was large and rather drably appointed in dark blues and browns, with stock landscape prints above the bed. Its nicest feature was a balcony with table and chairs, a perfect spot for room service breakfast.
Seven miles north of Rio Rico, in the Santa Cruz River Valley, is Tumacacori, home of the O'odham. Originally hunter-gatherers, the O'odham were expert in weaving and storytelling. A self-sufficient community when Padre Kino arrived in 1691, they were nonetheless enticed by the gifts he bore: livestock, horses, and seeds for food crops, like wheat, which could be grown throughout winter. He traded them, of course, for souls.
The O'odham invited Padre Kino into their homes, engendering the strange proximity of Catholicism to Native American life, images of which fill so many history books. The mission at Tumacacori was taken up by Franciscans and the church rebuilt after the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain in 1767.
On a rare day when there were no other tourists at the site, now the Tumacacori National Historical Park, we started for the sanctuary as horses whinnied in the near distance and a road runner tried clumsily to hide behind a chaste tree.
Little has been done to renovate the church, but faint friezes of stenciled flowers are still visible near the ceiling. The cemetery out back is surrounded by a whitewashed wall with deep indentations indicating places for the 14 stations of the cross. We stood for a moment inside the round mortuary chapel, whose planned dome roof was never completed. The view is all sky.
Time, like space, is elongated in the desert. Surrounded by 20 or so dead, their graves marked with stones and crosses made of rotting sticks tied together with wire, I was reminded of a Mexican folk saying: Hay mas tiempo que vida. There is more time than life.
 
Finding food and shelter in the desert
 
The Basics
Madera Canyon, accessible off I-19 at Green Valley, is a protected wilderness refuge. Trails are provided for every level of hiker. Picnic facilities and cabin rentals are also available. Information, call (520) 625-8746.
Tumacacori National Historical Park is just off I-19, 18 miles north of the Arizona-Mexico border. Admission is $2. For more information, call the park (520) 398-2341.
Proof of citizenship is required to enter Mexico. Alien residents of the United States must have proof of residency to return to the United States. Mexican car insurance can be purchased at any number of agencies near the border in Nogales, Ariz. Our 1994 Mazda cost $13 a day, plus tax. The country code for Mexico is 52.

Where to Stay
The Vineyard Bed-and-Breakfast, 92 Los Encinos Road, Sonoita, telephone (520) 455-4749. A quaint hacienda with three well-appointed bedrooms, each with private bath, in the main house, and a free-standing casita. Double rates are $75 to $85, including a full breakfast.
Rio Rico Resort and Country Club, 1069 Camino Caralampi, Rio Rico, (800) 288-4746. The location of this rather gaudy Avatar Resort is ideal: just 11 miles north of the Arizona-Mexico border. The rooms are large and quiet, and the mountain views are unparalleled. Rates are $85 to $155. Golf and tennis packages are available.
The Arizona Inn, 2200 East Elm Street, Tucson, (800) 556-8480, fax (520) 881-5830. An historic inn a half-hour drive from Tucson International Airport, it is built in an adobe style. Sitting around the elegant piano bar is a relaxing way to spend the evening. Double rates are $180 to $215.

Restaurants
Among the many traditional restaurants in South Tucson, Taqueria Pico de Gallo, 2618 South 6th Avenue, (520) 623-8775, is fast food heaven. Try the fish tacos on homemade corn tortillas with fresh salsa. They also serve shrimp ceviche and carne asada (grilled flank steak). Horchata, a rice drink flavored with cinnamon, helps put out the fire. $15 for two.
Alfonso's Carnitas Jalisco, 2801 South 6th Avenue, South Tucson, (520) 882-7985, has a large menu, but I've never made it past their house specialty, carnitas: stewed pork, which you can dress up with salsa. $15 for two.
Le Cave's Bakery, 1219 South 6th Avenue, South Tucson, (520) 624-2561, has traditional Mexican sweets, as well as homemade breads and both sweet and savory empanadas.
Er Pastaro, 3084 Highway 82, Sonoita, (520) 455-5821, is a desert anomaly. The specialties are hearty, central Italian pasta dishes, like penne alla Norcia (with sausage) and spaghetti alla carbonara. The chocolate truffle desserts alone are worth the trip. Dinner: $40 for two, not including wine.
La Roca, 91 Calle Elias, Nogales, (631) 2-07-60. An elegant Sonoran restaurant with a traditional menu. Chile rellenos are expertly made and the seafood dishes are fresh and simple. Try camarones mojo de ajo, large Guaymas shrimp in garlic and butter. Be sure to ask for tortillas instead of dinner rolls. Dinner: $40 for two, not including drinks.

Shopping
Stewart Boot Manufacturing Company, 30 West 28th Street, South Tucson, (520) 791-9973, custom designs Western boots for adults. Factory seconds are $150; custom boots start at $375. Closed Sunday.
The Lazy Frog, 57 Campillo Street, Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, (631) 2-23-11, sells handcrafts, pottery and Mexican vanilla. Prices range from $6-$300. Closed Sunday.

Old Town Artisans, 186 North Meyer Avenue, Tucson, (520) 623-6024, is a cooperative where you can find Kachina dolls, jewelry, pottery and woodcarvings. Prices range from several dollars for children's toys to several hundred dollars for silver jewelry. Open daily.
Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company, Tumacacori (just south of Tumacacori National Monument), (520) 398-2591, has dried chiles of all kinds, as well as original blends of spices. One room is a museum devoted to western memorabilia. Closed Sunday. K.M.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Edward G. Caputo;
Computer Crunch at the Millennium

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
EDWARD G. CAPUTO is the president of Command Systems Inc. in Farmington, a computer consulting company that has formed a partnership with the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company in Hartford to develop a system that will solve the "Year 2000" problem, also known as Y2K, faced by computer users everywhere.
Mr. Caputo jokes that he is going to be home on New Year's Eve 1999 because he would not want to be on an airplane, or even in a hotel, when the computers start to crash. 
 The basic problem is that computers are programmed to recognize only the last two digits in a year -- 1996 is read as just 96. So at the turn of the century the computers will read 00, meaning malfunctions in the making.
Mr. Caputo graduated summa cum laude with a degree in business administration from the New York Institute of Technology, and has more than 25 years' experience in the insurance, financial and manufacturing industries. Before forming his present company in 1985 he was the founder and president of the Computech Corporation in Glastonbury, which grew to 70 employees and $4 million a year in seven years.
Mr. Caputo discussed Y2K, or the Millenium Bug, during an interview at his office overlooking Batterson Park Pond in Farmington. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
 Q. What caused the Year 2000 problem?
A. It dates back to the beginning of automation, when the first computers were rolled off the factory floor. The cost of the hardware was the most expensive part of the system. This little computer on my desk has more power than a computer the size of the whole building had back in the 1960's. So the major drive was to save on the use of the hardware -- the memory, the disk drives, all of that equipment.
The people in the industry were also trying to save on space. And the most convenient place to save on space is the date area. Everybody uses dates, over and over again. If you can just cut out that "19" you save a lot of space. But it caused a major problem.
Q. So what happens after midnight on Dec. 31, 1999?
A. At all companies that have processing routines -- and today, every company is very dependent on computers and automation -- all calculations that utilize dates will be erroneous unless they go through and fix the date logic and the databases. Insurance companies, banks, Wall Street brokerage firms, utility companies, manufacturing companies, they all will have this problem.
All computer systems are suspect. They'll be paying the wrong interest rates on mortgages or passbook accounts. Insurance companies will calculate the wrong benefits, and so forth.
Q. Why?
A. The way a program works now, if the computer is trying to calculate the difference between today and 1983, the computer takes the 96 from 1996, and subtracts, say, the 83 from 1983, and gets 13. In the year 2000, it's going to take just the 00, and subtract the 83, and come up with minus 83, because it's treating 2000 as if it was 1900. Everything is going to be based on 1900 instead of 2000, and it's going to cause tremendous problem.
What happens when someone applies for Social Security, for instance, on Jan. 15, 2000, it will do the subtraction, and the applicant will have a negative age.
Q. Isn't it too early to get excited about this?
A. No. In fact in many cases, it's too late. Some companies are going to be in big trouble because they didn't start five years ago. You have companies that have 100 million, 150 million lines of code, and it will take many, many years to process all that, and test it, to make sure the changes in the date routines will not cause regression in other areas, and to make sure it all fits together properly.
Q. There isn't going to be some diskette you can pick up at Wal-Mart and fix this problem?
 A. I don't believe there is any silver bullet, either for home PC's, or business, or government. It's a very, very labor-intensive process. There will be tools that will make the process a little bit easier, provide a methodology and a structure.
But it's a very convoluted process because everyone developed programs in their own way, according to their own logic and their own personality, and it's very difficult to correct that with one program or algorithm. It's got to be done one system at a time.
We've converted 5 million lines of code for Phoenix, and put it back into production -- but that's only one-third of what we have to do.
Q. Why hasn't this problem been fixed before now?
 A. Time and expense. Everybody's trying to get the latest and the greatest, and get done the things they need to get done immediately, and this was a postponeable project for a long, long time. Companies have budgets, they have regulations to follow, new products to put out, and this was something they could push off. Unfortunately, they can no longer push it off. We're right up against the wall now.
Q. How much is it going to cost to fix all the computers?
 A. Well, the Gartner Group in Stamford is estimating that it's going to cost $1 trillion worldwide. And, it's going up every month, because of supply and demand. As demand increases and the supply of programmers decreases, the cost is skyrocketing. The price of programming has doubled over the last two years.
A company that has 25 million lines of code, it's costing over $1 a line just to address this problem. And it all likelihood it's going to go up to $2 and $3 a line by the time 1998 and 1999 roll around.
Q. Haven't most businesses starting to address it?
 A. As of right now, probably only 25 percent of companies have an active project.
Q. Are there enough programmers to deal with the issue?
A. I don't think there are enough in the United States, no. We have about 100 openings right now, and we have eight recruiters working. We just invested $100,000 in a system to help us locate people. We have tremendous shortages.
That's one of the reasons we set up a programming operation in India, an area that has a lot of people, people who are mathematically inclined, who are taught from kindergarten computer literacy. And even though we're paying them well by their standards, it's less expensive than doing it over here.
Q. How long have you been working on the problem with Phoenix?
 A. More than two years. In addition to more than 15 million lines of code in their mainframe system, their personal computer systems and support systems number in the thousands. That is going to be a whole other level.
As we started to see how big the problem was for Phoenix, we also realized everyone in financial services was going to face something similar. We decided, why don't we take this out to the rest of the market? That's why we created Command 2000.
Q. If only 25 percent of companies are fixing the problem now, what was the percentage two years ago when Phoenix started?
A. This is a guess, but I would say less than 5 percent. It was very unusual for a company to have that much foresight.
Q. What range of costs going to be, from small to large businesses?
 A. It can go anywhere from a couple of million dollars, to $150 million. It's going to depend on what solution they use.
Q. Are companies ignoring the problem or are they not aware?
 A. There is a lack of awareness out there. One of the steps in our Command 2000 program is management awareness, where we go in and help senior management understand how big a problem this is, and how expensive it is, and how disastrous it's going to be if they don't tackle it.
You take companies that are busy with acquisitions or mergers, that are busy with Federal regulations or growth plans, chances are the board of directors are not going to be worried about the year 2000. It's the squeaky wheel syndrome.
Again using Gartner's statistics, 20 to 25 percent of companies are not going to be ready by the year 2000, and are going to face a serious risk of major lawsuits, bankruptcies, erroneous data coming out of their systems.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Miami's Shaken Image Shakes Its County Too

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
AT a time when Miami's tourism industry has rebounded from the tourist murders of the early 1990's and visitors have been flocking to the area in record numbers, officials here are having a case of the jitters. Miami's image has suffered another black eye, this time from the one-two punch of a $68 million deficit and the threat of a vote to abolish the city itself.
Miami's troubles have made national headlines since last summer, when three top city officials resigned to face Federal corruption charges and it was disclosed that the city was near bankruptcy. Since then, the city's bond rating has dropped to single-b from triple-b and Florida's Governor has appointed an oversight board to help the city tighten its belt and carry out a recovery. 
 "I can see tourists saying, 'They can't even pay the police. Should we even be there?' " said Mayco Villafana, spokesman for the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The irony, of course, is that the city of Miami's troubles have little to do with the 28 other municipalities of Dade County, the "greater Miami" metropolitan area that uses Miami as a brand name. Most of the attractions that draw tourists are scattered around these other cities, including the Art Deco district and the South Beach section in Miami Beach, Miracle Mile in Coral Gables and the beaches of Key Biscayne.
Miami, the city, does not even have a beach, the main lure for domestic and international travelers along with the weather, shopping malls and restaurants.
So in a pre-emptive strike, representatives from other cities and tourism organizations have been dispatched to major tourism markets -- the Northeast and Canada, Europe and South America -- to spread the message that Miami is not Miami. The officials stress that all the main infrastructure a tourist may worry about -- airport and seaport, the bus and rail system, water and sewers and major highways, the tourist-oriented police programs -- are controlled by Dade County, which is financially stable, not any one city. They have also tried to put the recent negative publicity about Miami in perspective.
"The city of Miami represents only 17 percent of the residents of Greater Miami and the Beaches," or 365,000 of more than 2 million, the Visitors Bureau president, Merrett R. Stierheim, wrote in a memo fired off last month to his membership. "The city of Miami accounts for only 35 square miles out of the 2,000 square miles that comprise Greater Miami and the Beaches."
Neighbors like Miami Beach, while optimistic that their sister city will survive, have also tried to distance themselves from the mess. Mayor Seymour Gelber of Miami Beach said he was not as concerned about tourists as he was about investors who may have second thoughts about opening businesses in the area. "Tourists worry about the weather and about safety," he said. "When they go to the beach they don't ask, 'What's your bond rating?' "
Still, when Mr. Gelber was asked recently what the financial relationship was between Miami and his city, Miami Beach, he said: "I quickly explained that we're not related at all."
Miami, the city, does include the popular Cocowalk shopping and entertainment center in Coconut Grove, Bayside Marketplace near the Port of Miami and a downtown shopping district popular with tourists from Brazil and other countries. Some business owners have joined the movement that is calling for a referendum on whether Miami should dissolve itself and merge with Dade County's government, although opposition to such a move is also widespread.
Patty Allen, director of the Downtown Development Authority, the quasi-government agency that represents Miami's downtown business district, said that commercial property owners were split on the abolition issue but that what "people want to see is a restructure of some kind." She said there was a consensus that the city needed a more aggressive economic development plan and should use tax abatements, low interest loans and other incentives. But Ms. Allen said it was business as usual despite the financial crisis. "Investors understand the market is the market and Miami is a great market," she said. "They're looking at the rate of return."
Although tourism has actually risen recently, some tourism officials are still concerned. After the tourist murders of 1993, the impact was not felt until months later when tourism was off by nearly 100,000 visitors in 1994, reversing a trend of growth. The latest tourism figures, for the first nine months of 1996, show that 7.1 million tourists visited Dade County, a 2 percent increase over the same period in 1995.
"I don't think we're going to have any ill effect from this," Rob Snowden, Cocowalk's general manager, said of the fiscal problems.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/The Nyacks;
Unusual Diversity in A Bedroom Suburb

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
THE Rockland County community known as the Nyacks -- the hilly riverfront villages of South Nyack, Nyack and Upper Nyack; the rural hamlet of West Nyack and an area west of Nyack known as Central Nyack -- is not a typical New York bedroom suburb.
For the tourists, the draw is Nyack itself, with a melange of about 50 antiques and crafts shops, one-of-a-kind clothing and gourmet shops, galleries and restaurants. 
 For residents, it is an interlocking jigsaw puzzle of races, cultures, religions, socio-economic groups and living styles with 20 houses of worship and 30 different languages or dialects spoken by schoolchildren.
"A lot of people that gravitate to the Nyacks come from Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, the Upper West Side and the West Village because it has the diversity they're accustomed to and they like the urban flavor of a place where the schools are complicated," said Jo Baer, broker/owner of Baer and McIntosh Real Estate.
The Rev. Richard Gressle of Grace Episcopal Church in Nyack said he had been attracted to the village because the people there "think in ways that have been lost in the places I have lived."
"Like it or not, there are enough liberals left out there whose experience from the 60's and 70's is still their road map," he said. "They're out there in the community and they're determined not to fall into that quiescent numbness that seems to have gripped everyone else."
Eugene Gurlitz, a set designer, said he had moved to West Nyack because "it's a distinctive rural area even though it's close to the city."
"There's no blacktop on my driveway or sidewalks on my street," he said. "This is where I wanted to live, but I relate socially to Nyack more than I do anywhere else."
Residents live in housing as diverse as they are. Nyack and South Nyack have a mixture of less expensive, modest homes on quarter-acre lots interspersed with larger, more expensive Tudors and Victorians.
HOMES in Upper, Central and West Nyack can be good buys because they are in the Town of Clarkstown, which has lower taxes than the other Nyacks, which are in the Town of Orangetown. Upper Nyack has a larger selection than elsewhere in the Nyacks of grander homes on lots of one acre or more, Ms. Baer said. The median price of a house in West Nyack, which has many 1950's development homes on one-acre lots, was $225,000 in 1996, mirroring the median price of a home in South Nyack.
In Central Nyack, the median price of a home last year was $128,000, about 30 percent lower than Nyack's. Two-bedroom apartments in the three co-ops in the Nyacks, with a total of 258 units, go for $119,900 to $175,000. Prices of two- and three-bedroom condominiums at the 101-unit Clermont overlooking the river in Nyack range from $225,000 to $700,000 for the triplex penthouse.
Two-bedroom prices at three other condominiums, with a total of 85 units, range from $89,000 to $220,000.
"There is a bigger demand for rentals here than the supply," Ms. Baer said. The largest rental building is the 162-unit West Shore Towers on the Nyack riverfront, where one-bedroom apartments average $1,120.
The housing market in the Nyacks has been strong over the last five years and with few exceptions, housing prices have appreciated, according to the Rockland County Multiple Listing Service.
The median price of a home in South Nyack appreciated more than the other villages and hamlets in the Nyacks from 1990 to 1996, going to $256,000 from $154,000, to $256,000, according to the M.L.S. During the same period, the median price of a home in West Nyack rose to $220,000 from $205,000 to $220,000.
A MAJOR magnet for home buyers in the Nyacks is its schools. Sally Witte, a psychologist who lives in Nyack with her husband, Michael, a cartoonist, and their three children, said her experience in a private girls' school in the Midwest never caused her to question her values.
"But in this school system, because there are so many kinds of people," she said, "you're sort of always having to question what your values are.
"You're put in a situation where you have to struggle a bit more, but I think you can learn from this heterogeneity." She added: "In many ways, my children's education has been more complete than mine."
Said Roberta Zampolin, superintendent of the 3,000-student Nyack School District, which serves Nyack, Central, South and Upper Nyack, Grandview and Valley Cottage: "It's a constant struggle of how to meet all the needs of the different students, but we do a great job if you look at our statistics."
The district's Math League ranked No. 1 in the state, said Ms. Zampolin, adding that 93 percent of the high school graduates last June went on to higher education.
The district has three elementary schools for kindergarten through fifth grade, a middle school for sixth through eighth grade and Nyack High School. At a time when schools are cutting back classes in the arts, the high school offers electives in photography, media communications, including television and video production.
Students in West Nyack are served by the Clarkstown Central School District, where, said William Heebink, its superintendent, 93 percent of last June's graduates of South High School and North High School went on to college. He added that the schools had begun a $13 million program to update its computer capabilities.
The 8,600-student district, which has 10 elementary schools and a middle school, offers an innovative language program that sends sixth graders through 10 weeks each of Japanese, French, Italian and Spanish to help them choose the language they want to specialize in when they reach seventh or eighth grade.
Among the recent arrivals in the Nyacks is Mary Fisher, a mother, artist and AIDS activist who spoke at the last two Republican National Conventions. She is renovating her house after having moved from Maryland with her two children. "It's a difficult time for me," said Ms. Fisher, who herself has AIDS. "As my children grow, their questions get different and they get harder. I came here because I wanted to be in a strong community, one with the kind of people who would want to know and watch out for my children."
Touch, an acronym for Together Our Unity Can Heal, a nonprofit AIDS support group, has just opened its new quarters at 150 Broadway in South Nyack, where it serves 130 people with AIDS in Rockland County.
THE restaurants that line Broadway and Main Street in Nyack reflect the overall community's diversity. Among them are pubs, like O'Donoghue's Tavern; Italian restaurants, like Heather's Open Cucina; The King and I for Thai food; Ichi Riki for Japanese food; Southern Comfort for Southern home-cooking; Three Broadway and the River Club on the Hudson for fine dining and Strawberry Place for breakfasts with the children.
Children are offered food for thought at the hands-on Hudson Valley Children's Museum, at 21 Burd Street, a short walk from the river. They can play in an orchestra of spoons and coffee cans, fix a car, create crafts from recycled materials and explore a bubble factory. The museum, which is open Tuesdays through Sundays at varying times, charges $4 for admission for all.
For both the young and their elders, there is the Palisades Interstate Park system just north of the Nyacks, where they can hike on Hook Mountain, bike, picnic and swim, and the riverside Memorial Park at the end of Burd Street in Nyack, where there are two basketball and two tennis courts, a playground, boat launch and baseball field. And for $5, residents can work a small plot of land in the Nyack Community Garden.
Julius Petersen's Boatyard, founded in 1898, provides repair services, winter storage and 60 boat slips. The private Nyack Boat Club offers more than 150 moorings to its members.
Named by Dutch settlers for the Indians that first settled there, Nyack grew as a river port through the 19th century. The village prospered from a growth in factories, quarries and shipbuilding.
But by the end of the century, prosperity slowed and the village began to decline. With the opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955, the Nyacks became more accessible and downtown Nyack showed some signs of revival. But strip malls outside Nyack and, finally, the opening of the 800,000-square-foot Nanuet Mall in 1969, decimated the shopping district. Later, an influx of Federal subsidies and innovative business people began to turn the Nyacks around.
Antiques dealers bought up vacant storefronts and Nyack gained a reputation as an antiques mecca, although one afflicted by what merchants call a severe parking shortage.
"It's difficult to face a situation where people come in mad at you before you've done anything for them because they've been hunting for a parking space for so long," said Hank Hovorka, owner of Heather's Open Cucina. Many in the Nyack business community have voiced apprehension over the impending opening of the first three anchors in the 1.8-million-square-foot Pyramid Mall this spring in West Nyack. But Terry Hekker, Mayor of Nyack, said it could be a boon to the local economy. She said she hoped to open a kiosk at the mall that could promote the Nyacks and carry shoppers back to the villages by jitney.
One attraction that is expected to draw traffic is the 600-seat Helen Hayes Performing Arts Center, which opened last fall with a budget projected at $1 million for its first year. The theater is a renovation and expansion of the former Cinema East.
One of its prime movers is its president, Walter LeCroy who with 12 others contributed $25,000 or more to get the center under way. He moved to Nyack in 1981 because he liked to walk within a little village. "In another village, there wouldn't be a wider group of artists, or a theater to revive," he said.

LOOK WHO MOVED INTO TOWN: The Nyacks have always been known for their interesting and often famous blend of residents. For one, there's the ghost who is believed to haunt 1 Leveta Place and was the focus of a state appellate court ruling in Manhattan in 1991 that realtors are required to disclose to prospective buyers accounts of the presence of ghosts in a house. Nyack has been home to actors and actresses, such as Ellen Burstyn and the late Helen Hayes; Jonathan Demme, who directed "Silence of the Lambs," and Edward Hopper, the artist, who grew up there. Last year Rosie O'Donnell, the actress and television personality, bought the Nyack home of Ms. Hayes for $770,500.. Ms. Hayes had done extensive renovations, so she called it Pretty Penny. Ms. O'Donnell is expected to do still more.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Rethinking The Meaning Of the Modern

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
AND THE WINNER IS -- MODERN architecture! That's the announcement the Museum of Modern Art would like to make when it finally selects an architect to design its expanded Manhattan campus. No big names. No razzle-dazzle designs in instantly recognizable signature style. No prizes for best song, most congenial contestant, wizard special effects. Rather, museum officials hope that the process of redesigning one of the world's most vital cultural institutions will itself be the lead performer.
Last week, the museum announced an international list of 10 architects invited to compete for the commission, a project that is not simply an addition or expansion but of another order of magnitude. The architects have been encouraged to rethink the configuration of the entire campus, which now includes the Dorset Hotel on West 54th Street, bordering the rear of the sculpture garden, which was acquired last February. 
 The architects are Wiel Arets and Rem Koolhaas of the Netherlands; Toyo Ito and Yoshio Taniguchi of Japan; the French architect Dominique Perrault; the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and four New York firms: Steven Holl, Bernard Tschumi, Rafael Vinoly and the office of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. By May, three finalists will be chosen. The commission will be awarded by the end of the year.
Speaking on behalf of the Museum of Modern Art's trustees, Glenn D. Lowry, the director, said the selection process itself would help to "conceptualize a modern museum in the context of the future."
The museum convened a three-day conference last October at the Rockefeller estate in Westchester County, to discuss the expansion on a conceptual level. Discussions were held between curators, critics and architects, including several, like Peter Eisenman and Arata Isozaki, who were not included on the final list. Last fall, the museum also sponsored a series of public lectures and symposiums on the expansion project. Another series will take place when the 10 designs are put on view.
The architects on the list are relatively youthful. Most are in their 50's. Some architects who were not invited to compete have expressed surprise, bafflement, even anger, at this emphasis on younger architects -- as if the museum had deliberately chosen to take a slap at more established architects like Norman Foster, Richard Meier and Charles Gwathmey. These architects, a generation older than those on the Modern's list, are the names one expects to find on short lists for prestigious projects.
Actually, the Modern's tilt toward youth makes perfect sense. The architects on the list represent a generation that has felt compelled to reinvent the idea of modernism for itself. The generation preceding theirs includes a number of distinguished architects, like Foster, Meier and Gwathmey, whose work is strongly rooted in the values of the modern movement. Still, at a pivotal moment, the work of these designers was less influential than that of Robert Venturi, Charles Moore, Michael Graves and others of their contemporaries who chose to promote the the post-modern cause.
Younger architects, especially in the United States, grew up having to reckon with the repudiation by their elders of 20th-century history. They were educated in a climate that subjected modernism to constant criticism and ridicule. The sterility of modern architecture. The anti-urbanism of modern architecture. The indifference of modern architects to popular needs and tastes.
The Museum of Modern Art, meanwhile, was undergoing its own crisis of identity. In the 1970's and 80's, the museum stood at a crossroad. How could a modern museum survive in what was widely labeled a post-modern world? Had modernism become a closed historical chapter? Should the museum simply devote itself to filling out the record in a story that had reached the end? Or did modernism represent a set of values that could feed into the future?
The Modern itself had helped to precipitate this crisis. In 1966, the museum published Robert Venturi's "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture," a book that instantly became the bible of post-modernism, the text that encouraged architects to repudiate the esthetic values on which the museum had been founded. Later, Philip Johnson, who was a founding director of the museum's architecture and design department as well as a prominent museum trustee, further complicated matters when he began crusading against the modern movement he had once championed.
Arthur Drexler, the museum's longtime architecture curator, didn't help matters much by basically sitting on his hands throughout this period, committing his department to what seemed like an endless recycling of shows on the great modern masters. In 1984, Drexler commented to me that the only contemporary designed objects he judged adequate to the museum's esthetic standards were pieces of military hardware, like the Stealth bomber. As one contemplated the Bell helicopter that still hovers at the entrance to the design galleries, one imagined Drexler as an embattled figure sitting atop a stockpile of weapons, manning the barricades against post-modern incursions.
The 1985 expansion by Cesar Pelli, is an enduring symbol of that crisis. Here the museum entrusted its redesign to an architect whose adherence to modern principle, never particularly firm, soon lapsed into a purely commercial practice dedicated to producing decorative building skins. Pelli was the perfect architect for a moment when the museum hoped to insure its future not by esthetic but economic means, erecting a profit-making condominium tower on its property and refashioning the museum itself in the image of a suburban mall.
SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN a changing of the guard: a new president, a new director, new curators, a rejuvenated department of architecture and design. This new group, mostly under age 50, is of a generation that regards the modern, and the Modern, from quite a different perspective. Born well after the pioneering days of the modern movement, this generation accepts as a matter of course that the "modern movement" and the polemical struggles of that movement are a matter of history. But they also perceive modernism as an ongoing way of relating to the present.
John Summerson, the British critic and historian, was referring to the modern movement when he wrote in 1947 of the need to "sort out those aging ideas that get encrusted round past creative achievement and clog the proper working of the imagination in changing times." For Summerson, in other words, modernism had already grown stale 50 years ago, a decade before the Seagram Building went up. But for many architects today, especially the generation represented by the list, the sorting out of aging ideas could serve as an excellent definition of modernism itself. The definition evokes no particular style or philosophy. It merely proposes that time moves on, that the imagination can be stifled, that creativity is, in part, an act of mental hygiene.
The museum's trustees are wise to view the process of selecting an architect as a creative venture in its own right. It's an opportunity for the museum to sort out some aging ideas that got encrusted round the institution itself. Like the idea that there is some inherent conflict between the traditional and the modern: the second grew organically out of the first. Or that historically there was only one correct, canonical "modernism" rather than Futurism, Constructivism, Bauhaus, de Stijl, Expressionism and many other modernisms.
We value the Modern as a place where this sorting-out goes on, where modernism is presented within a framework of changing awareness. Many of the architects on the museum's list have embraced that framework as the essence of contemporary architecture. Pioneer modernists spoke of transforming entire cities, of remaking the world. Modern architects today are more likely to speak of heightening our consciousness of the modern world. The function they see for architecture is much like the museum's own historical goal.
I hope they won't forget that it's also one of the world's great spots for dating.

 BODY:
Paul R. Krugman did a good job of describing income inequality in his article "New Math, Same Story" (Jan. 5).
I offer a view from the production floor that may explain one cause of the problem. 
 1. Management encourages workers to improve productivity. Workers are promised that any improvements they make will not result in loss of jobs.
2. Workers organize in "quality circles," make productivity improvements, are commended at company meetings and have their pictures displayed on posters in the hallway.
3. Demand for the product slumps. Management shuts down several production lines. Some workers are "temporarily" laid off.
4. Demand increases. More efficient production rates allow production lines to remain shut down. Workers who were laid off are forced to take lower-paying jobs in the service sector.
So much for promises.

Krugman correctly points out that statistical changes in the Consumer Price Index will not change the fact that inequality has widened in recent decades. But the story is even sadder than he suggests. 
 The consumer goods that have held steady or dropped in cost have been, disproportionately, luxury items (computers, audio equipment, cars and long-distance phone calls). The things that have increased in cost have been those essential to low-income and young families (new homes, college tuition, medical care, public transportation and basic telephone service).

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Sales and Service Operations;
As Industry Changes, Networks Feel a Ripple Effect

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AS corporate America downsizes and looks for outside suppliers for non-core operations like property management, the real estate industry is reorganizing itself as well, consolidating into fewer, but bigger, companies that can take over the jettisoned corporate departments.
This is having an impact on real estate networks, those far-flung associations of usually independent companies that seek to have a means of referring to affiliates in other regions on a fee-splitting basis. 
 It is also leading to the development of new types of organizations, including at least one group that emphasizes offering a broad variety of services, rather than the traditional referrals.
Local real estate sales and service operations have long sought to broaden their ability to hold on to clients and increase revenues by affiliating in some fashion with companies in other cities.
Some, such as Cushman & Wakefield, Grubb & Ellis and CB Commercial, have done so by acquiring or establishing corporately owned offices in major cities. Cushman & Wakefield, for instance, employs over 1,500 people in 40 offices nationally.
But others say this is an overly expensive approach that does not guarantee a uniform level of quality, despite having the same brand name over the door. These companies have joined with others in a variety of networks, which range from licensing operations with a central corporate staff to voluntary associations governed by membership boards.
With these national -- and increasingly international -- affiliations, a company that handles a corporation's business in New York can maintain the relationship, even if the corporation wants to expand to California, Georgia or Hong Kong.
"It is important to provide one-stop shopping," said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark & Company Real Estate. "If I have a client in New York who wants space in Hong Kong, I'd go there with him, meet with an affiliate and do the transaction."
Without this ability to provide service in remote markets, real estate executives say, they may put their New York business at risk if a client decides to shifts all its activities to another agency.
Recently, networking was in the news as Newmark cut its 10-year relationship with the New America Network and announced it would be joining The Commercial Network. And executives of the old Edward S. Gordon Company, now Insignia/ESG, said they planned to acquire real estate companies in other cities, despite being a founder of Oncor International, a membership oprganization.
Mr. Kuhn said Newmark made the shift from New America, which is a privately owned company that supplies services to brokers, to T.C.N. for two major reasons: to gain access to more international markets and to gain a greater measure of control of its own operations.
"It is extremely important to be represented internationally today and T.C.N. is in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing and all over Europe," Mr. Kuhn said. "The other thing is that New America is owned by Gerry and Jeff Finn and we think it is important that we control our own destiny. We don't want outside individuals making decisions that affect our business."
T.C.N., he noted, is owned by its member firms.
Jeffrey M. Finn, the president and chief operating officer of New America, said the purpose of his company was to provide research, communications and other services to brokers, many of them in smaller markets. "We have a staff of over 50 people to provide services, including sophisticated technology to link over 200 offices in North America," he said.
John Powers, an executive managing director at Insignia/ESG, acknowledged that a company on the prowl for acquisitions may not fit comfortably with the collegial style of Oncor. The network was founded in 1977 at least partially to offset the growing influence of corporate real estate service providers.
"There was a feeling among members that there was still a place for strong regional firms," Mr. Powers said. He said the members referred business to each other and discussed mutual problems. "We could discuss things in a nonthreatening way," he said. "You were dealing with a colleague, not a competitor."
BUT now, he said, many companies are reducing the size of their internal real estate operations and looking to outside contractors to provide these services. Many corporate real estate managers prefer dealing with a structure that looks like their own, he said, with a strong central command and widespread subsidiaries under apparently tight control.
"The problem is that networks have not been as successful as national firms in forging strategic alliances with corporations," he said. "There really is not much difference, because all companies have brokers who are independent contractors. But reality is perception."
He said Insignia/ESG's relations with the other companies in Oncor would depend in large part on where Insignia makes acquisitions, turning colleagues into competitors. Nevertheless, he said "we have a high regard for the firms in Oncor and we will find a way of continuing to work with them."
Networks can continue to be viable in the current economic environment, but they have to adopt a more corporate appearance, said Patrick Moultrip, the president of T.C.N. "For the last three years I have been recruiting people who know how to talk to corporate America, because that's their background," he said. "For example, I'm out of Sun Microsystems."
He said the network has about 15 people on staff now, in addition to the staffs of the network's members. "We can put together a SWAT team overnight to help a company that is downsizing and outsourcing and we will do it for as fixed fee," he said. "And if tomorrow they don't need us, we're not there."
Ownership, rather than alliances, produces a more consistent, higher quality service, argues David Gialanella, a senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield. "When you are representing a client nationally, they are looking for quality, consistency and control," he said.
"There is a fundamental restructuring of the real estate business and industry is looking a real estate companies as service providers, not just deal doers. That is hard to do in a nonstructured environment."
He said that Cushman & Wakefield, in addition to its domestic array of offices, has formed partnerships with companies overseas so it can work with corporations operating global businesses. "Companies are recognizing that international real estate is as important as domestic," Mr. Gialanella said. Cushman & Wakefield covers Europe through Healey & Baker in London, Asia through Marlin Land in Hong Kong, South America through two affiliates in Sao Paulo and Canada through Royal LePage in Toronto.
"A network is a body without a head," said David Binswanger, president of Binswanger Inc., a Philadelphia-based firm, that owns all 18 of its domestic offices and has alliances with a British and a German company to handle international assignments.
"A client like Kodak would deal with the same person regardless of whether the job was in Italy, Mexico or Brazil," he said. "We would take advantage of local expertise, but the deal would be handled centrally to maintain quality."
THE real estate industry will evolve into different forms as it consolidates , said Stewart Forbes, president of Colliers International Property Consultants in Boston. "It similar to what happened in the securities industry after fixed commissions were abolished," he said. "You ended up with fewer but larger firms. That's what's going on in real estate now. You are going to end up with a few firms dominating the industry nationally and some niche players locally. It is going to be very difficult to be in between."
Robert L. Billingsley, executive vice president of Colliers ABR, Inc., the New York affiliate of the Colliers system, describes it as a "federation of stockholders." He said participation in the Colliers system gives the firm access to services, such as the work of a 12-person research department, that a purely local firm could not support, and influential contacts in far away places.
"Colliers Jardine handles East Asia," he said, referring to an alliance with the noted trading company. "It's interesting to watch the eyes of corporate officials bulge out when they realize that your local partner is Jardines."
While most networks and national real estate companies emphasize their geographic reach, one New York-based grouping of companies focuses on the breadth of services offered. The Arete Group (pronounced are-TAY after a Greek word for excellence) has brought together real estate brokers and planners, a law firm specializing in tax incentives, construction and project managers and financiers in one loosely affiliated organization.
"Arete is a federation, not a network, and it is transaction driven, not referral driven," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a member of the group specializing in office space. "We are not all sales people. We have attorneys, architects and developers. The business is moving away from the old-line brokerages."

What's Next for Riverfront Bayonne Military Base?

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE land juts out like a shelf from the edge of Bayonne two miles into the Hudson River, where it spills into Upper New York Bay. And from one spot at the eastern tip of the 437-acre site, the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge come into view.
It is here where the 62,000 residents of this old industrial city are preparing to confront their future. Sixteen months ago the Pentagon ordered the shutdown of the Military Ocean Terminal by 2001, ending this man-made peninsula's more than 50 years as a military base and leaving it one of the last prime parcels of real estate available along the Hudson River shoreline. 
 Some 110 bases nationwide have been closed or reconfigured since 1988, according to the Washington-based National Association of Installation Developers, a nonprofit group that works with communities to re-use bases. Bayonne's base, from which cargo was sent to battlefields around the world, is the largest in New Jersey set to close.
Since the announcement, the city has shaken off the shock of the closing of the base, its largest employer, which will mean the loss of 1,924 civilian jobs, half of them held by local and county residents. But the challenge for this Hudson County community is how to shape what will be the most significant redevelopment in 40 years in Bayonne.
To counter the economic blow of the closing, the city is negotiating with the Federal Government, the landowner, to acquire the site, a maze of warehouses, barracks and docks. It would then be subdivided, with some parcels sold or leased to developers and others kept for public uses like schools.
The city is reviewing its options for the site, which must undergo an environmental cleanup, to be paid for by the Government. At this early stage -- a master plan is to be completed in October -- the direction is toward a mixed-use development focused on industrial uses, from light manufacturing to warehousing.
Other possible uses include television and film production, a community college and a cruise-line terminal.
"No option has been foreclosed," Mayor Leonard P. Kiczek said. He is also chairman of the 11-member Base Re-use Commission set up to look into uses for the old site.
Meanwhile, the city is working with developers to turn 120 adjacent waterfront acres, once partly a landfill, into a golf course. And retail projects, including two shopping centers, are to rise along nearby Route 169 by this spring.
"The site may have potential, but over 25 years," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "Bayonne has to be sure not to compete with the unused waterfront in other cities, which have the advantage because they have a base on which to build."
Mayor Kiczek is upbeat. "The emphasis will be on producing jobs and tax revenue, creating a new generation of prosperity for the city," he said of the site, which makes up a fifth of Bayonne's land. While he did not preclude the possibility that a "fragment of the former base could be used for residential development," he said he wanted to make sure that his city's residents would not be overburdened with taxes.
The city watched its tax base slip when industries left. It was bypassed by the mid-80's boom because of a lack of transportation links, together with sewage and environmental problems.
Frank P. Perrucci, 56, like many other residents is hoping that the base's re-use will bring property tax relief to the area, where homeowners bear a heavy tax burden. "It is what's needed to help keep oldsters -- and youngsters -- in Bayonne," he said.
Edward J. Kaczka, a 48-year-old resident who owns a local insurance brokerage concern, added: "As long as what goes on there brings in services, it sounds good to me. What I don't want is something that will become a separate part of Bayonne."
FOR others, the concern is that nothing will get built.
Mayor Kiczek, who as a teen-ager delivered fast-food chicken to soldiers at the base, said the city for decades had most of its commerce along its eastern shoreline and most of its residential areas further west. "We have learned the lesson that this layout of our community works best," he said.
He says a redeveloped base area could replace twice the number of jobs lost, increase the city's revenue from property taxes and open the waterfront to the public. The Government pays no real estate taxes on the site, which except for special times, like Armed Forces Day, has essentially been cordoned off from the community's tight neighborhoods of neat houses.
"We want to see new jobs growing before the base closes," said Brig. Gen. Gilbert Harper, the installation commander.
The decision on how best to use the site is largely up to the community and the re-use commission. Final approval, however, rests with the Government.
Suitors have been drawn to the base like miners in search of gold. Some of the plans are grand, including one to build a $1.5 billion world trade center. The project, called Gateway USA, was conceived by Gordon Bishop, a former columnist for The Newark Star-Ledger, and Marwan M. Sadat, president of Sadat Associates, an environmental engineering and science firm in Princeton. Designed by Michael Graves of Princeton, it would have six trade pavilions on 150 acres. Plans for the rest of the site include hotels, cruise ships and education-entertainment centers.
Another, by World City Corporation of Manhattan, would make Bayonne the summer home of the world's largest ocean liner, which the company wants to build.
The 6,200-passenger floating hotel, a quarter mile long and 21 stories high, would also be the catalyst around which the base would be developed with, among other uses, offices, movie theaters, a community college and parkland, its sponsor says.
Knut Ulstein Kloster, the founder of Norwegian Cruise Lines, conceived the concept of the floating hotel, which would be called America World City, and put up $34 million for its design. World City still needs a Federal loan guarantee for most of the ship's $1.2 billion cost.
Other plans include building a recycling plant and blowing up some warehouses for a movie. The longshoremen's union wants to lease part of it for a bulk freight port and the U.S.S. Battleship New Jersey Commission wants to tow the ship from the West Coast to her namesake state and berth it in Bayonne, where it would be maintained as a museum. And some groups, including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are hoping to put in a container port similar to those in Elizabeth and Newark.
But Bayonne has committed itself to only two uses so far. About 100 Coast Guard personnel will move into 25 acres of the former base next June as part of its deployment off of Governors Island.
And 18 more acres will be for park-and-ride lots to serve the state's 20.5-mile light rail system along the Hudson River, the southern half of which, to be completed by 1999, starts in Bayonne. There are also discussions to extend the line into the site and eventually to a hoped-for fleet of ferries to Manhattan.
OF the other proposals, Mayor Kiczek said, "As the plans evolve and commitments become more serious, they can be incorporated into the re-use plan." He said the trade center concept could work at the site and bring something new to the riverfront.
There are challenges ahead, including the cost and time to improve and clean up the site. "There are areas of concern on the site, but they are not widespread or insurmountable," said James Monkowski, chairman of the environmental subcommittee on the base re-use commission.
It can take years to redevelop some bases. So towns must "manage their expectations and be flexible" to meet the market, said Ellen Baer, a principal at Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, a Manhattan-based consulting firm that has worked on base re-use plans.
Plus, the redevelopment must navigate through a layer of military bureaucracy. "What makes the process succeed are community consensus and political leadership," Ms. Baer said. "Otherwise, you have a ship with no captain that floats out to sea."

Grant Advances Bay Shore's Downtown Revival

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: BAY SHORE

 BODY:
THE announcement last month that the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York had allocated $520,000 in grant money toward the construction of 78 units of below-market-rate housing has given this South Shore community another leg up on its efforts to revitalize its downtown.
"A lot of work has been done by the town to put together an economic development plan for Bay Shore," said Thomas A. Isles, Planning Commissioner for the Town of Islip, of which Bay Shore is an unincorporated area. 
 "Housing is another method of encouraging redevelopment, and the project announced three weeks ago is going into that direction," he said.
The housing, which still needs more than $2 million in state funds before work can proceed, is only one component of what is planned downtown. Two major projects, an aquarium and a new home for Touro College's School of Health Sciences, offering bachelor's degrees in such things as physical and occupational therapy and a master's in biomedical sciences, have also been proposed, along with other redevelopment.
Many of the Main Street storefronts carry "For Rent" or "For Sale" signs because of limited demand for the hamlet's 350,000 square feet of retail space. Most of the Main Street buildings were constructed 40 years ago when Bay Shore became Suffolk County's regional retail center.
An overall economic development plan completed by Town of Islip last year, which focused largely on Bay Shore, called for the hamlet's business district to "reinvent" itself.
One proposed direction was to find new uses for some of the surplus retail space, by converting it to offices, for example. Live/-work space for artists and housing above stores were other proposals.
Medical office space is in demand because of the 451-bed Southside Hospital at the east end of Main Street. But retail can remain the major activity because distinctive "niche" stores like Bay Shore Lighting and Home at 143 West Main Street and Bay Shore Furs at 12 East Main Street still attract "destination" shoppers to the downtown and do well, Mr. Isles said.
The development plan also proposes that Bay Shore capitalize on its location as a gateway to Fire Island by promoting tourism. About 400,000 ferry riders pass through the community each year.
State and Federal grants will be used to pay for street improvements that will include new lighting and paving and landscaped walkways linking municipal parking lots to Main Street. A building on the south side of Main Street just north of Watchogue Creek will be demolished to open up the view to the waterfront.
"With our long-range plan we hope to make Bay Shore the thriving community it once was," said Pete McGowan, the Islip Town Supervisor.
AMONG potential tourist attractions is the proposed $60 million Long Island Aquarium. The project, which would be privately financed, has received a $750,000 grant from the New York State Urban Development Corporation for a feasibility study and for preliminary designs.
The 2.5-acre aquarium site, on Park Avenue north of Main Street, is owned by Islip's Community Development Agency and leased to the aquarium's promoters for a nominal fee. When construction starts, it is to be sold to the group, called The Long Island Aquarium, for its appraised value.
A campaign to raise $12 million from private contributors is about to start and a $48 million public tax-exempt bond offering is expected to be issued in September, said Artie Dromerhauser, the Long Island Aquarium's executive director.
The preliminary design is for a 97,000-square-foot educational and entertainment complex with a three-level, 1-million-gallon aquarium and a 400-seat theater. Cambridge Seven of Cambridge, Mass., designers of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, among others, are the architects.
The proposed school is the Touro School of Health Sciences, a division of Touro College, which is negotiating to purchase a county-owned 83,000-square-foot office building on Union Boulevard. The school, which has 600 students and a faculty of 150, is currently located in Dix Hills.
The town was able to obtain $3 million in Federal grants and loans for the school to enable it to purchase and renovate the building. Some county functions, such as a health clinic, would stay.
"If you are looking for a way to have a dramatic impact on a community that's seen better times, this is certainly one way to do it," said Edwin W. Finder, the former executive director of the Bay Shore Business Improvement District, a business group, and now its consultant.
The 78-unit housing project proposed for the downtown would replace dilapidated residential structures on Smith Avenue north of Main Street. The town already owns some of the properties. The rest will be acquired through negotiation or condemnation.
The land would be turned over to the Long Island Housing Development Fund Company, the development arm of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit housing group based in Hauppauge. The entity will construct the new units which will include a mix of for-sale housing and rental apartments.
Under the plan, there will be 52 three-bedroom attached and semi-attached houses, expected to sell for $74,000 to $85,000. Of the 26 rental apartments, which will be owned and managed by the Town of Islip Housing Authority, 10 will be for families and 16 for the elderly. To qualify for the houses, purchasers can make no more than 80 percent of the area's median income of $66,000, and the income of renters cannot exceed 50 percent of the area's median.
Owners of the existing houses will receive relocation assistance from the town, or they will be able to purchase one of the new houses. Tenants will receive similar assistance, or they will be able to elect to move into one of the new rental units.
EAB, a Uniondale bank, would provide a $4.335 million construction loan for the 52 for-sale units, as well as end loans for purchasers.
That commitment and the $520,000 Federal Home Loan Bank grant that Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of Babylon and Senator Alphonse M. D'Amato helped secure, are "critical" in helping the $12.3 million project get the $2.2 million in state funds that it still needs, said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership.
"It indicates that the private sector looks at the project as a good business deal," he said, "and one of the state's requirements is that there be a leveraging with private sector money."
The project's impact would be far greater than 78 new housing units, said Robert J. Klein, a vice president of the EAB Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of EAB. "Once private developers see this happen, they will put up market-rate housing," he said.
Private investment is, in fact, already flowing into the downtown. Louis J. Modica, a local developer, recently acquired a 14,000-square-foot vacant office structure at 85 West Main Street. He is fixing it up to rent to a medical group.
THE building, known as the Omni, was started in the 1980's but was never completed and had become a symbol of the community's failure, said Mr. Isles, the town planner.
Steven H. Bankin of Bay Shore is renovating an 18,000-square- foot building at Main Street and Fourth Avenue as new retail space on the ground level with nine apartments ranging in size from a 750-square-foot studio to a 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom unit to occupy the upper two floors. Rents will range from $750 to $1,400 a month, he said.
"There are a lot of things that are about to happen," said Susan Barbash, a local resident and developer, and also the co- chair of the Bay Shore-Brightwaters Summit Council.
The organization was started in 1994 by the Bay Shore Board of Education and its school superintendant, Evelyn Holman. As an umbrella group for local organizations it has become an influential voice on behalf of residents, holding an annual open meeting for the discussion of problems and ideas.
"Touro to a great extent was attracted to Bay Shore because we have been able to demonstrate that this is a community that is coming back," Ms. Barbash said.

Justifying Government Jobs

 BODY:
James Treffinger, the Essex County executive, recently asked all county employees to write letters justifying their jobs. What would you say?

The Wrong Targets 
 The idea of the exercise -- self-justification -- is obnoxious. It is bullying by the boss. Let the boss justify himself or herself and manage the work force intelligently and properly.
 
DONALD SINGLETON
Jersey City
 
The Wrong Emphasis
I work for the state (not New Jersey) in social services. The politically correct response would be pushing how much money I save the taxpayers. But the real focus should be how much good I can do for the taxpayers, and non-taxpayers, in my state. I realize in days of privatization this may not be the proper response. Doing the minimum for the minimum seems to be the current goal. While it is not the response that budget crunchers are looking for, service is why we are there.

Justifying Justification
Corporations justify their existence in a free market every day with every exchange of goods or services. If people don't like a corporation or its product, they can boycott it with little repercussion; try boycotting the payment of your taxes.
 
CHRIS TOTO

A Necessary Job
As a government worker in New Jersey, my job is necessary, as I work for the Division of Unemployment. When other people are out of work, it is the responsibility of my agency to make sure the eligible people get their money and the ineligible people don't.
 
ROBIN BUTEN

Another Necessary Job
I don't need to justify my job in the Government: I'm in the Navy. I've gone to sea to keep this country free.
 
TERRY BRYANT
Groton, Conn.
 
Employees Are Maligned
I work in the private industrial sector, and my feeling is that government employees are unnecessarily maligned. They don't have the cushy gigs that the public would like to believe. The pay isn't all that great; the security is not what it once was, and longevity toward a retirement is getting tougher to achieve with each passing year. Still, I have to justify both my job and (hopefully) a small increase each year to my employer at review time. I also have to tell them what I plan to accomplish for them so that I can keep receiving my employment.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
The American Dream, In One Form or Another

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Karen Tarver, a native of this hardscrabble city and a single mother, moved away to Plainfield more than 15 years ago, and as she said the other day, she "never planned to come back."
But a couple of months ago, while searching the newspaper for a new apartment for herself and her 12-year-old daughter, Joice, Ms. Tarver came across an advertisement seeking first-time home buyers. As a modestly compensated employee of a public utility company, Ms. Tarver had assumed that she could not afford to purchase a home. But that was before the advertisement led her to Orange Hecker Gardens, a development of affordable town homes in the Central Ward neighborhood of Newark. On Feb. 14, she is scheduled to become the owner of her very own, newly constructed, three-bedroom town house -- a $94,500 revival of the American dream, built on urban land once left for dead. 
 For Governor Whitman, Ms. Tarver is a shining example of how government should help build and rehabilitate affordable housing as a means of restoring decaying cities. By working with private banks, the state has provided low-rate construction loans and subsidies for projects like Orange Hecker, helping developers to build quality homes that can be sold to people like Ms. Tarver at a price they can afford.
Governor Whitman, in her recent annual address to the State Legislature, boasted of the success of her urban housing initiatives and pledged to pull together $100 million more from various entities (none of them being her own budget) to expand the program. "We are expanding people's opportunity to claim a part of the American dream," the Governor said in her speech. A few days later, the Governor joined Ms. Tarver for a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of Ms. Tarver's new home.
But housing advocates and community development leaders contend that Mrs. Whitman's focus on ownership does not address the need for rental housing in the state's cities. The 2,250 new homes that Governor Whitman plans to build through her Urban Home Ownership Recovery Program will create more owners like Ms. Tarver, but many people simply cannot purchase their own homes, they have insisted.
"Ownership is good for people who are able to buy their own homes," said Diane Sterner, the executive director of Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey, an association of housing and community development groups. "But there's a terrible lack of resources for affordable rental housing."
Last year, Ms. Sterner's organization drafted legislation calling for a $290 million housing bond that would have attacked the problem at its foundation by providing money for affordable housing, job creation and rental assistance. The legislation, however, has languished in committee since Mrs. Whitman tucked it away there last June. "We're not overly optimistic at this point," Ms. Sterner admitted.
Instead of a huge general obligation bond like the one housing advocates have called for, much of the money going toward Governor Whitman's effort is coming from banks that already offer products like low-interest construction loans and mortgages. What the state has essentially done is helped to pull private lenders and their services together and sweetened the pot with a small amount in subsidies.
"With the pipeline that we're creating, we're demonstrating a need and a market to purchase houses in New Jersey," said Timothy J. Touhey, the executive director of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, the quasi-independent agency that has created partnerships with 11 private banks and is also providing the subsidies.
Even if it cannot fully address the needs of those who cannot afford to purchase a home, the Governor's plan must at least reach the people like Ms. Tarver who can qualify to become homeowners but don't know it. Hubert Graham, the real estate broker responsible for selling the Orange Hecker project, said that although there is an obvious need for housing in the area, many people simply don't know that they can afford to buy a home for a monthly cost that is sometimes less than they are paying in rent.
"Many people can do what Ms. Tarver is doing, but they don't know that they can," he said. "What's required is an all-out effort to educate them."
Her chance to become a homeowner "just kind of came along," Ms. Tarver said. She is excited and optimistic, she added, about moving back to her native city to invest and share in its revitalization efforts. "This is just a great opportunity for me to become an owner," she said. Looking down the street at the older homes on the block, she said, "I can already see other people doing things to fix up their homes too."

HEADLINE: Instead of a New Bridge, Why Not Mass Transit?

 BODY:
"Still Needed: A Cross-Island Bridge" is akin to Lazarus rising from the dead. Unfortunately what is "scarce and in imbalance" is an understanding of the longtime resolved issues of his suggestion, even after 35 years of its repeated defeats.
Since 1965, when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller killed an Oyster Bay location for a bridge, through 1973, when the Legislature repealed bridge legislation, since no Suffolk County crossing to the northeast would be able "to pay for itself," and in 1980, when Gov. Hugh L. Carey rejected a bridge crossing, since it would cost close to $2 billion, a Long Island Sound bridge crossing has been shown to be ill conceived. 
 Governor Carey did, however, establish an Action Committee for Long Island, which looked at all the transportation and economic factors associated with the construction of a new Long Island Sound bridge and after one year of intensive study rejected it overwhelmingly due to the main fact that commercial and industrial productivity on Long Island would not be changed with a new crossing
In my five years as a bridge administrator with the Coast Guard reviewing bridge-construction permits and environmental-impact assessments for bridges in six New England states, having reviewed some of the original planned Long Island Sound bridge-crossing proposals and over my last 20 years as an ecologist with the National Park Service, I have heard made every possible argument for the construction of a "new L.I. Sound bridge crossing."
Nothing has changed the fact that any new bridge crossing the Long Island Sound would have significant negative impacts on all Long Islanders. To name just a few:
(1) A new bridge crossing would cost an estimated $1.9 billion, with a $3 million to $4 million annual maintenance cost -- and that is in 1988 dollars.
(2) Bridges draw more traffic! They accommodate existing traffic levels, since they are planned for a "projected use," which ultimately becomes obsolete once a bridge is placed, due to increased use from the development, which is spurred on after the bridge is completed. Just look at Staten Island and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
(3) Bridge tolls in the past have slowed vehicles down, contributing to increased concentrations of air pollutants. Even with the E-Z Pass implementation, the volume of air-polluting vehicles, especially trucks, does not get less. Regional air-and noise-pollution impacts dramatically increase after a bridge is constructed. No bridge ever built reduced air-pollution or noise-pollution levels in its corridor.
(4) Bridge right-of-ways divide communities, due to property acquisition for bridge approaches, ramps and maintenance facilities. The new bridge will attract more trucks, especially since it would be an interstate connection, thus more pollution concerns.
(5) Bridges have significant impacts on waterways from hydrocarbon runoff, to paint and solvent discharges during maintenance to loss of wetlands from construction to potential dredging to maintain water navigation. The Long Island Sound Study does not include a bridge in its considerations for the restoration of the Sound.
(6) Bridge construction produces "short-term" jobs, which would need to be shared between two states. Stable long-term jobs are derived from mass transit and its ridership.
Mr. Waldman identifies a host of factors contributing to the Long Island transportation peritonitis, and that this blockage can only be cured by his radical cure, a new bridge across Long Island Sound.
Many sites have been suggested for this crossing. Yet all have been defeated, not as Mr. Waldman would have you believe "by a few bistate groups in local opposition," but rather by a diligent cadre of professional environmentalists who through experience know that any Long Island Sound bridge would be a pariah, not a panacea.
These solutions are suggested to Mr. Waldman to place his future efforts:
(1) Establish additional ferry services across Long Island Sound. They are less expensive and generate more revenues.
(2) Put the same heart-felt enthusiastic fervor into petitioning greater expenditures and subsidization of the Long Island Rail Road. Improving mass transit has repeatedly increased ridership. Look at the progress made in the City of New York over the last 10 years.
(3) With the merger of Brooklyn Union Gas with Lilco, there should be a movement to provide the incentives for greater reliance on gas-powered buses and minivan transportation links to help reduce our future demand on fossil fuels.
Mr. Waldman's "radical change" is not so radical at all. It is moribund and uninformed and would lead Long Islanders to another dead end.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Joe Sharkey's Jersey column "Speak Up If H.O.V. Lanes Were Your Idea" (Jan. 19) reads like the provocation of a talk-show host. 
 He misses the most important reason for H.O.V. lanes: since driving is contributing to the ruining of the environment, it needs to be reduced.
Mr. Sharkey mentions several possible reasons for the decrease in car pooling from 1980 to 1990 (shifting work patterns and inadequate public transportation). He omits the most likely reasons: the number of freeway lane-miles is increasing, and the inflation-adjusted price of gas (per mile driven) is about the lowest it has been since 1950.
I can't take credit for the idea of H.O.V. lanes, but I think we need them to save the planet. Instead of one-lane H.O.V.'s, we should limit the number of non-H.O.V.'s to one lane.

HEADLINE: Five Acres, a Tax Break and a Bushel of Opinions About Farmland Law;
He Has 13 Acres And an Explanation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article "Five Acres, and a Tax Break?" creates a misleading and destructive impression. Most readers would reach the conclusion that homeowners with farmland assessment do not pay their fair share of taxes. This is not the case. 
 Our 13-acre farm is a typical case. We pay full residential property tax on our house and on our first two acres. (We live in a two-acre zoned area.) The farmland assessment applies only on the other 11 acres. Therefore, we pay at least as much tax as any other property owner with a similarly valued home. We pay our full share of our town's tax bill.
Since farmed (or undeveloped) land places no demand on the community for such services as school, police and fire protection, there is no logical reason why it should be taxed to pay for these services. The question is not why farms should get a "tax break." The question is why, in an allegedly fair and rational system, land without homes on it should be taxed, farmed or unfarmed.
An accompanying article, "How Tax Bills Stack Up Against a Flock of Sheep," further reinforces the misimpression by quoting statistics that 23 percent of the land in Mendham classified as farm produces one-fifth of 1 percent of tax revenue.
While a reader might conclude that homeowners in Mendham who also have property assessed as farmland pay only one fifth of 1 percent of Mendham's taxes, this is not the case. Such a homeowner with a $300,000 home pays as much property tax as any other resident of Mendham with a $300,000 home.
However, the taxes on the house fall under the category of "residential property," which the article says produces "83 percent of this years tax revenue." Therefore, the perceived tax shifting is an illusion.
The same situation exists for the corporations as well. While your article leads off with the eyebrow-raising fact that the peach orchard BMW maintains by its headquarters rates just $373.52 tax for its 20 acres, the reader must search through the body of the article to find that BMW pays $215,000 in taxes on its adjacent 21-acre headquarters. BMW receives no "tax break" on the commercially valuable office building. But would it be fair to tax BMW $215,000 a year for owning a peach orchard? And is it really likely that BMW or other corporations would continue to maintain a peach orchard if they had to pay $215,000 a year in taxes for the privilege? Would the critics prefer the likely outcome of eliminating the farm assessment: sale of the orchard, and the construction of homes or offices?
The article repeatedly refers to the owners of property assessed as farmland as wealthy and reinforces this impression by citing a few wealthy individuals who farm in New Jersey. But it should be obvious that thousands of small parcels in hundreds of communities in the state cannot possibly be all, or even mostly, owned by wealthy people. One of the law's great strengths is the low-acreage requirement that makes it possible for the middle class to own undeveloped land and to farm. The higher acreage requirements and greater sales requirements imposed by some states would exclude a majority of landowners who now get the farmland assessment, while the wealthy would still qualify.
When I speak to other New Jerseyans, regardless of their age or occupation, I find that there is one subject on which there is virtually unanimous consensus. People feel that the state is losing its natural beauty and that the day is not far off when this will no longer be a nice place to live. They mourn the loss of woods and fields; they object to noise and crowding, and they find the roads increasingly impassable. But most people see no way out: they feel the economic forces pushing us to overdevelopment are too strong to resist.
The Farmland Assessment Act has proved it is possible to resist the trend, at least to a degree. Before readers jump to conclusions about who benefits from the Farmland Assessment Act, they should consider the implications for all of us of increasing pressure for development.
Far from restricting the Farmland Assessment Act, a wise policy would expand it to an Open Space Act, rolling back taxes on woodlands, meadows and other natural space without requiring the owner to farm. The purpose of the act was not to help "farmers who make a living in farming"; it was to preserve what little is left of New Jersey's desperately needed open space.

Pizza Job Sustained a Dream

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Eleven A.M. on a Monday, at Ray's Pizza on Third Avenue and St. Marks Place, seemed like an odd place and an odd time for a celebration.
But that's what it was. Zoran Bandovic, a dark-eyed 40-year-old with an unruly graying brush cut, was sipping a Sam Adams. Danilo, 7 1/2, and Ivan, 4, were happily eating chocolate cake. Their mother, Jela, was drinking juice. 
 They had just come from the downtown offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, where they had been given approval for green cards. Mr. Bandovic pulled out his passport to show it, proudly.
There was even a good reason to celebrate at that very spot -- a generally unremarkable coffee, pizza and bagel place awash in East Village anonymity.
"I came to this country like a parachute," he said, dropping his right hand through the air onto the table. His wife and sons came later. "When I came, three years ago, my first job was at this pizzeria. I wanted to show them where I started." A flash of humor crossed his face. "I was a doctor from Yugoslavia."
He made a few friends. One, he said, told him not to stay in the East Village. Too strange. "But I find it very interesting," he said. "The people are friendly, open. The people are nice."
Jela interrupted with a wifely jab: "Nice girls!" He grinned.
After two weeks at Ray's, he said, he heard about Veselka, the Ukrainian diner on Second Avenue. "I went to work there, making sandwiches behind the counter. We were four doctors working over there, three from Poland!"
And he began volunteering at St. Luke's Hospital, to get closer to the world he left. In four months, he was offered a job in the pathology department. Now, he commutes from Astoria and studies for the grueling exam he will take in June to earn the right to be a doctor in America.
He left Belgrade, the Serbian capital, he said, mainly for economic reasons. He and his wife were both doctors, at a top university hospital, but at the time, 1994, inflation was so high that his salary effectively shrank to less than $10 a month.
But he did not leave until after he got word that he was being drafted. "I'm a Serb," he said. "She's Croatian, from Herzegovina," pointing to Jela. "Because of the war in Bosnia, I had been mobilized. Or, there was an attempt to moblize me. I was being sent to kill her parents, or have them kill me!"
He forgot his beer as he reminisced. Danilo and Ivan continued eating cake. Jela was quiet.
"The last day I was in Belgrade, they came to pick me up," he said. "But I was out taking the kids for a walk. So I was absent. God helped." ANDREA KANNAPELL

The Battle of the Braid Brigade

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
AT Walton High School in the Bronx, Andrean Russell was the student her peers went to when they wanted their hair braided.
Over the years, her clientele grew, along with her reputation as a skilled braider. Relatives and friends have sat patiently at Ms. Russell's knee for hours while she weaved African-inspired braids into hair once styled with straightening chemicals. 
 Last year, Ms. Russell began seriously thinking about turning her weekend passion into a career. "I began doing research to see what I needed to obtain a license to braid hair professionally," said Ms. Russell, 23, who is a legal secretary and part-time student at Bronx Community College.
The answer was not what she expected: a course of study at a cost of thousands of dollars and 900 hours.
"Nine hundred hours!" Ms. Russell said with a trace of indignation in her voice. "I don't see the need for all those hours of training when all I want to do is braid hair. Something I've done since I was a teen-ager."
Under a 1992 state law, natural hair stylists must complete a 900-hour cosmetology curriculum covering everything from chemical hair treatments and pedicures to shaving to receive a state license. The law has been sharply criticized by prospective hair braiders like Ms. Russell, who wonder why they should be subject to hundreds of classroom hours devoted to hot pressing and curling, or haircutting and shaping, disciplines that do not apply to braiding.
Ms. Russell says the requirements are excessive to the point that the state is depriving her of a civil right -- to pursue the occupation of her choice. She and Bonnie Best, a 30-year-old part-time braider in Cambria Heights, Queens, have filed a lawsuit that seeks to revise the licensing rules.
"Of the 900 hours required by the state, only 250 are devoted to braiding techniques," said Mark W. Smith, the lawyer who took on the case after conversations with Carla Brown, a professional braider who teaches a braiding course at York College in Jamaica, Queens. "But here's the catch. The cosmetology schools aren't offering the courses, and those who are qualified to teach it, like Ms. Brown, haven't been certified by the state to do so."
The lawsuit is likely to draw considerable interest in a bustling cottage industry of stylists catering to the growing popularity of African-inspired braids among black women. Braiding shops seem to have cropped up overnight along 125th Street in Harlem and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. They are supplemented by the braiders, from high-school students to unemployed women to working professionals, who run informal styling operations in their homes, bartering their services for everything from cash to clothing.
In many cases, the stylists are African or Caribbean immigrants who use skills learned in their homelands to eke out a living in America. In other cases, they are young women who, like Ms. Russell, styled hair for friends and expanded to take on other clients. Many may be unaware of the licensing requirements. But Mr. Smith noted that even for those who want to satisfy the state requirements, it is impossible, because no privately run cosmetology school in New York offers a program or course of study that includes the required 900-hour curriculum.
"In fact, no person has ever completed the 900-hour curriculum," Mr. Smith said. "The only individuals who possess natural hair styling licenses are those who were grandfathered into the law when it was first created four years ago."
Gwen Lee, a spokeswoman for the New York Secretary of State, Alexander F. Treadwell, who is named as a defendant in the case, said she could not comment on matters under litigation. The Secretary of State's office oversees and controls the New York Division of Licensing, which issues natural hair styling licenses and created the requirements and curriculum for licensing. State officials had 30 days to respond to the complaint, which was filed on Jan. 6.
The case is but one of several involving hair braiders in more than half a dozen states. They are using legal weapons and political pressure to challenge laws that require anyone offering natural hair-care services to the public to complete lengthy and expensive programs at certified cosmetology schools.
In the last two years, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and the District of Columbia have created separate braiders' licenses, according to Taalib-Din Uqdah, the executive director of the American Hairbraiders and Natural Hair Care Association. Several other states, including Louisiana, Michigan and Illinois, are said to be considering similar laws. Although licensing laws for braiders vary from state to state, all require some basic hair-care training, from 16 hours in Florida to 1,500 hours in California.
Most braiders agree that training is necessary, especially courses devoted to recognizing scalp disorders and other health-related issues. But many question the government's right to sanction their craft, which has traditionally been learned from friends or relatives.
Government officials argue that the proliferation of braiding salons raises questions about sanitary practices and professional accountability; oversight is necessary, they argue, to protect dissatisfied customers. Partly with those concerns in mind, the State Legislature wrote language into the cosmetology law in 1992 that specifically requires braiders to be licensed, as are barbers and other hair stylists.
A "grandfather clause" in the law exempted licensed cosmetologists and hair salons that existed before 1992.
Members of the cosmetology industry, which had lobbied for tighter controls on braiders, applauded the new measures.
"If we have to take a minimum of 1,200 curriculum hours and pay up to $10,000 to learn our trade, why shouldn't braiders?" said Barbara G., a black cosmetologist who asked that her full name not be used, expressing concern that her comments might create tension in the mid-town Manhattan salon where she works alongside braiders.
The number of individuals practicing African-style braiding in New York is unknown. But Mr. Smith and others say the current law has had the perverse effect of driving more braiding services into the "underground" economy, where government lacks the opportunity or ability to reasonably regulate the industry.
"Ms. Russell and Ms. Best are taking this action because they don't want to hide or braid hair undercover," Mr. Smith said. "They also don't want to break the law.
"By bringing suit we hope to force the state to create reasonable regulations that take into account the safety of the community without taking away economic opportunity for braiders."
Ms. Best, who has a bachelor of arts degree in engineering, didn't know how to braid until she enrolled in Ms. Brown's braiding class last year. Now, she would like to supplement her income as a braider, but says she cannot afford to spend the $6,000 to $10,000 it costs to enroll in cosmetology school.
"And I wouldn't dream of operating without a license," Ms. Best said. "I don't want to have to hide from the authorities or do it undercover."

Secretaries Go From 'Take a Letter' to Taking Charge

BYLINE: By MARTHA NOLAN McKENZIE 

 BODY:
MOVE over, Miss Moneypenny. Clear out your desk, Jane Hathaway. Your days as the quintessential secretaries have passed.
No longer just helpers who keep the boss's calendar straight and take dictation, career secretaries and administrative assistants have, in the last decade, increasingly taken on the duties of middle managers. 
 The reasons are varied. Because of downsizing, there are fewer middle managers around, and companies have given many of the unfilled responsibilities to secretaries. And with executives typing memos on their laptops and checking their own voice mail, secretaries have been relieved of some of their time-consuming clerical duties and are available to tackle other tasks.
"The de-layering of organizations largely meant the layoff of middle managers," said Elizabeth Fried, president of N. E. Fried & Associates, a human resources consulting firm in Dublin, Ohio. "But their work remained, and it had to go somewhere."
In most cases, however, the authority given to secretaries has lagged behind that of the former managers whose duties they are assuming. So have their salary levels: the average pay of secretaries is about $8,000 a year less than the average pay for white-collar workers in private industry. But over the last five years, the gap has closed slightly. From 1992 to 1996, the national average for secretarial salaries rose 14 percent, to $24,200, according to Watson Wyatt & Company, a human resources consulting firm based in New York, while white-collar wages as a whole climbed 11 percent, to $32,100, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Often what happens is the boss calls the secretary in and says, 'Handle this for me,' " said Florence Stone, editor of The Take-Charge Assistant, a publication of the American Management Association in New York. "It's not added to her job description and she's still listed as a secretary in the personnel files, so her salary is not adjusted. All these new responsibilities are being given very cavalierly.
"In the marketing department, the secretary may be doing the market research. In purchasing, she may be responsible for all the purchasing orders. She may be supervising staff, doing performance appraisals and running team meetings."
Ellen Napier, administrative assistant to the president at Ocean Spray Cranberries in Lakeville, Mass., has taken on some budgeting responsibilities and organizes special meetings of Ocean Spray's board. At the Paul Revere Insurance Group in Worcester, Mass., Chris Jackel, assistant to the president, compiles data from members of her department, organizes meetings and committees and handles customer service calls. Lisa McClain, a secretary with an investment banking firm in Manhattan, coordinates group events at conferences and is the liaison between management and other secretaries.
Such responsibilities would have been unthinkable for a secretary 18 years ago, when Marion Gehl joined the Milwaukee office of the firm now known as Deloitte & Touche as an administrative assistant. "Like the other assistants and secretaries, I spent my time typing, filing and taking messages," Ms. Gehl said.
Now, as administrative assistant to the partner in charge of audit operations, Ms. Gehl, 45, pours through stacks of reports, gathering figures to compile monthly summaries of billings and collections of each partner in her office. She then writes a synopsis, highlighted with charts, to give her boss a concise picture of monthly operations. She has also taken on the role of marketing director, handling media relations, planning meetings and researching prospective clients.
A 1995 survey by Professional Secretaries International, a trade association in Kansas City, Mo., found Ms. Gehl in the majority. More than 70 percent of the respondents said they were handling management tasks. Nearly half were responsible for training other workers, one-third supervised others and four out of five were involved in purchasing.
The survey also showed that most of these secretaries were not trained before taking on their new duties. "There was a real lag between the time secretaries had to demonstrate skills they didn't necessarily have and the time managers realized they needed to provide some training," said Susan Fenner, the manager of education and professional development for Professional Secretaries International. "I think that is starting to change, but slowly."
LAST spring, Sprint brought consultants to its Mansfield, Ohio, headquarters for north-central operations to work with secretaries and their managers on adapting to the changing relationships and roles. The consultants helped the company define the new duties for the secretaries and asked the secretaries what support and equipment they needed.
But the most important thing the consultants did, said Carolyn Turner, 49, the executive administrative assistant to the president of the north-central operations, was to "help the managers get out of their old habits of thinking of a secretary as a secretary," she said. "They helped show the managers we can help them more and they can trust us to make decisions."
Many secretaries are turning to night classes and seminars for training. Sandy Chismark, an administrative secretary with Southwest Gas in Phoenix, is two-thirds of the way through the credits she needs for her bachelor's degree in business management at the University of Phoenix. Attending classes in the evening, she has already taken courses in financial management, statistics, labor law and ethics.
"I'm taking these classes for my own benefit, to help me handle my current responsibilities and hopefully to advance in the future," said Ms. Chismark, 45.
The traditional secretarial schools are also responding to the changes in the secretarial field. The Katharine Gibbs Schools in New York, for example, began changing its curriculum in 1994 to offer more business courses, like economics and statistics.
"We recognized the school was behind what the industry's needs were," said William Kalaboke, the president of the Katharine Gibbs Schools. "Employers are looking for more than someone who can merely translate words onto paper. So we revamped our curriculum accordingly."
Secretaries say they need one thing even more than training: authority. Too often managers give their secretaries the responsibility for a job or project without giving them the authority they need to accomplish it. Ms. Gehl has faced that frustration. "If someone doesn't get their numbers to me on time, I can't go rattle any cages," she said.
It is a mistake made by too many companies, said Steven Frohman, the president of Applied Synergistics, a consulting firm in Milwaukee. "Businesses are focusing 100 percent on developing the technical skills in their secretarial staff, but the issue of authority is much more critical."

The change is hard to notice, but the average national salary for secretaries in private industry has been edging closer to that for white-collar workers. (Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Watson Wyatt & Co.)

HEADLINE: On the Mexico Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your Jan. 18 editorial "Vindication of the Mexican Bailout," you trumpet the accomplishments of President Clinton for saving Mexico, and arguably the United States, from an economic crisis. You write that "Mexico's early repayment of loans made by the United States in 1994 puts the finishing touch on a public-policy success." 
 But you did not note that the International Monetary Fund has been pressured into lending the Mexican Government yet more money so that we could get back ours.
Under those circumstances, Mr. Clinton's "public-policy success" is neither public policy nor success. When the International Monetary Fund has been repaid, you can give the Clinton Administration a pat on the back for a job well done. Until then, the jury is out.
We should be thankful that we did not have a currency crisis when the Treasury's currency intervention fund was tapped to lend Mexico more than $13 billion and the yen and the dollar almost spun out of control.

A Setback for Mortgage Brokers' Bonuses

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
A FEDERAL court has called illegal a practice in the mortgage industry that costs consumers millions of dollars in extra payments.
A judge for the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in rejecting a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against two lenders, said this month that Federal law prohibited lenders from paying independent mortgage brokers a premium for writing loans with interest rates higher than normal. 
 The payments, called yield spread premiums, have not been forbidden by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Justice Department, but consumer groups say they are kickbacks.
 Consumers have been suing over the practice, arguing that brokers, who offer loans from a variety of sources, have a fiduciary duty to find the best deal for borrowers. Not telling customers about extra percentage points tacked onto a home loan amounts to fraud, the plaintiffs say. Their cases have generally been settled out of court.
The Ford Consumer Finance Company, a mortgage subsidiary of Ford Motor, settled such a suit last August, agreeing to pay 70,000 to 80,000 borrowers a total that could reach $20 million.
A yield spread premium often works like this: If a lender is offering a 30-year mortgage for 8 percent, but a mortgage broker gets a consumer to accept a 9 percent rate, the broker gets an additional fee from the lender for writing the loan at the higher rate.
Lawyers said the Federal judge's action, while not a final decision in the case, was the first time a Federal court had said that paying yield spread premiums to brokers was illegal.
Daniel A. Ragland, an Atlanta lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, said the ruling would undoubtedly be used by other lawyers in fighting the fees. "I think this is the best order out there," he said. The case is expected to go to trial this summer.
Separately, H.U.D. said last week that it was looking at the issue and might issue a regulation about the practice in the spring.
The judge's ruling advances a lawsuit filed last year by two Maryland couples against Saxon Mortgage and Crestar Mortgage, both of Richmond. The couples contend that the companies charged them higher-than-normal interest rates on mortgages. Crestar had asked that the suit be dismissed, arguing that the practice was not illegal under the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and was recognized by H.U.D. as a legitimate form of broker compensation.
Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. disagreed. First, he said, "H.U.D. has never expressly permitted or prohibited such payments." But he continued that the payments were prohibited under the settlement procedures act. "Quite simply," he said, "the premium rewards the broker for referring the above-par loan." He added that the court "is unable to see what service is provided" to consumers, "unless it is the provision of a bad deal."
Lawyers for Saxon and Crestar refused to comment on the judge's ruling.
William Cumberland, general counsel for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said he believed that it was not illegal for banks to pay yield spread premiums to independent brokers, but that the judge's interpretation could be picked up by others.
"We all know if one district judge has spoken on an issue the others will follow," he said. "It's going to have a significant psychological impact on people involved in these issues."

Doing Homework on Taxes Before Lending to a Child

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
YOUR son wants to buy a house, but doesn't have enough money for the down payment. So, loving parents that you are, you lend him $30,000 and tell him to pay you back when he can. You don't even charge him interest.
Lending money to your children seems simple. They need the money and you happen to have it. As Richard J. Daley, the late Chicago mayor, once said when criticized for using his influence to help his sons, "If a man can't put his arms around his sons, then what kind of a world are we living in?" But the I.R.S. rules governing all no-interest loans are anything but simple, and if the loans are set up incorrectly, you may be creating a tax burden for yourself. Set up properly, however, they can be used to lend your child, or anyone else, up to $100,000 free of Federal taxes. 
 "It could be a good way of allowing a younger generation to use $100,000 worth of assets that otherwise they would have to borrow at market rates," said James DeJesus, a partner in the Manhattan office of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche.
 But as Lawrence F. Montague, a partner with Deloitte & Touche in Stamford, Conn., said, "This is one of the more convoluted parts of the tax code."
No kidding. The first rule to remember is that the amount of any no-interest loan should be no more than $100,000. Lend more and the Internal Revenue Service will compute what it believes to be market-rate interest on the loan. So even though you are receiving no interest payments from your child, the I.R.S. will tax you as if you did. This is called imputed interest. (Gift taxes may also apply if the imputed interest plus any gifts made by the lender to the borrower surpasses $10,000 in a calendar year.)
Second, the I.R.S. will also impute interest -- using the A.F.R., or applicable Federal rate -- if the loan is more than $10,000 when the recipient has more than $1,000 in net investment income, which is defined as interest, dividends and, in some cases, capital gains. For income tax purposes, the I.R.S. sets an interest rate every July. Last year, it was set at 5.77 percent.
Confused? Well, say you made a three-year, $100,000 no-interest loan to your son and an identical loan to your daughter. Your son has $900 in net investment income; your daughter has $5,000. The loan to your son generates no imputed interest because the loan is not above $100,000 and your son has less than $1,000 of investment income. Your daughter is over that limit, and thus you must pay taxes on imputed interest.
The imputed annual interest on her loan is $5,770 (5.77 percent of $100,000), but there is another twist. The I.R.S. limits the interest to the amount of the borrower's investment income. So you would pay taxes on $5,000.
In theory, you can make as many of these loans as you want, as long as none are for more than $100,000 and the I.R.S. does not think you are trying to avoid taxes. If the imputed interest is above $10,000, you would have to file a gift tax return.
Married couples cannot, however, double the amount they lend to an individual free of Federal and gift taxes. Parents can make tax-free gifts, though, while these loans are outstanding; the gifts are limited to $20,000 a couple each year, minus imputed interest reported on loans made to the recipient.
Although the loans can last decades, they cannot be used to transfer wealth permanently. The debts remain assets in the lender's estate, and after the lender dies the unpaid balances are subject to estate taxes.
Of course, many loans that parents make to children are never repaid. The parents either forgive the loan or the child does not make paying it back a high priority. Financial planners urge parents who expect the money back to make the loan terms clear at the outset so the child understands that the money is not just a gift.
Paul Richards, president for education with the National Center for Financial Education in San Diego, urges parents to charge interest or take an equity position in any business or home for which the loan is used. "If statistics were kept, you would probably find that there were more defaults on these type of loans than any other," he said. "My own personal view is that you should never loan money you can't afford to give away."
If the loan is never repaid, and a good-faith effort has been made to seek repayment, the parents can at least get a bit of a tax break.
The I.R.S. allows parents to take a deduction for the bad debt. The write-off would be treated as a short-term capital loss that could be used to offset capital gains. The losses could also be deducted from other income in $3,000 increments in future years.
ROBERT GOULD of San Diego borrowed about $100,000 from his mother, Margaret, to open an advertising agency and makes payments several times a year. "It's the Bank of Mom," he said.
Mrs. Gould charged her son interest, as much as 10 percent, required collateral and fully documented the loans. They are not subject to imputed interest and she pays taxes on her son's interest payments. "This is a much better way to go," Mr. Gould said. "When it is done informally, there is too much of an opportunity to let human nature come into play and go, 'Well, it's Mom.' "
Proper paperwork is also proof to the I.R.S. that the transfer was a loan, not a gift. It can help, too, when a borrower is using the loan as a down payment on a house. (The Federal Housing Administration recently did away with a rule stating that money from family members for a down payment had to be a gift, not a loan. That means parents can hold second mortgages on the homes they help their children buy.)
Making a loan to your children may provide them with more than just your money: they could get a tax deduction. If they use the loan to make a taxable investment, like buying stocks, they can deduct the interest, whether actual or imputed, as an investment expense up to the amount of their investment income. They also can take a deduction if the loan helps them buy a home.
If, for example, the loan is subject to imputed interest of $5,000, your child can take the home mortgage deduction on his Federal tax return, if the home secures the debt. This creates a curious set of phantom transactions: You would be paying income taxes on $5,000 that you never received, but which the I.R.S. says you should have charged, while your son is taking a tax deduction on $5,000 that he never had to pay in interest, but the I.R.S. figures he would have paid if you had asked. Sounds like an Abbott and Costello routine.
"The rules can be pretty daunting," Mr. DeJesus said, "even for a sophisticated taxpayer."

DATELINE: ST. PAUL

 BODY:
AH, the Super Bowl. The camaraderie of family and friends gathered around the TV set, the roar of the crowds, the cold beer, the call from the bill collector.
Sound farfetched? It's not. Debt collection has become a science of catching debtors off guard, and its practitioners have discovered that even the most evasive deadbeats will answer the phone on Super Bowl Sunday, thinking that their buddies are calling to gab about the game. 
 "The Super Bowl is definitely a good day, so we target people with higher balances and people we haven't been able to reach at other times," said Dan Peters, the manager of the vast computerized dialing system at I.C. System, a large collection agency here.
Unlike some other agencies, I.C. System sends its employees home right before kickoff so they can watch the game. Even so, Mr. Peters said, the company planned to be near its peak capacity, with 200 collectors calling debtors across the country until then.
The football gambit is just one manifestation of a quiet revolution that has transformed the debt-collection industry over the last few years. Collectors are using new technology to home in earlier on potential deadbeats and are getting better at tracking them down where they live, work and play. To many, it feels like there is no escape.
Yet, with more people falling behind on their payments and a record one million households filing for personal bankruptcy last year, collectors have found that tough-guy threats and endless dunning notices have lost their punch. They have discovered that it is more effective to assume the role of a friendly financial adviser.
"Ten years ago we simply called up and asked for the money; now we say, 'How can we help you?' " said Lee J. Robinson, the senior vice president for collections at the Crestar Bank in Richmond. Often, he said, sweet talk is the best way to a debtor's limited dollars. "Collecting is basically selling, and what we are selling is a payment plan," he said. "Most people are past due on four or five debts and the debts are much bigger than before, so now we need to sell them on the idea of paying us first."
To Robin Taylor, who fell behind on her credit card bills last year, the deluge of calls from collectors was a mix of sweet and sour.
"J. C. Penney was wonderful; they treated you like you were a human being trying to do your best," said Ms. Taylor, a newspaper circulation manager in Manchester, Conn. "To Bank of Boston, you are nothing but a liar or a deadbeat. All the guy said was if you just made your payments like you said you would we wouldn't be calling you." She said the bank had also called her at work and harassed her 14-year-old son.
But Ms. Taylor got a bit of revenge: The money she had to pay off her bills went to Penney, not Bank of Boston, she said.
A spokeswoman for Bank of Boston said the bank's policy is to treat customers "with dignity and respect."
Because more debtors have to choose which lenders to pay, collectors are moving away from the traditional technique they call "grinding," in which they ignore debtors' excuses and simply repeat that they have to pay up now -- or else.
"When most debtors were blue-collar workers, you would demean and embarrass them," said Roger Willis, a leading collection consultant in San Francisco. "That worked, because that is the way most of those folks were treated anyway."
But times have changed, Mr. Willis said, and friendly persuasion has replaced bombast. "Generation X is focused on escaping any kind of pain or responsibility," he said. "You have to sell them on the benefit of taking responsibility and the explicit consequences if they don't."
And, however cloaked in nurturing language, the collectors also make threats: People who don't pay will get a black mark on their credit bureau file, hurting their ability not only to borrow money but also to get a job or rent an apartment. And lawsuits to garnish the debtors' wages might be filed in states that allow the practice.
But debt collectors have to be careful about what they say. Many debtors may not know it, but they have legal protection against once-rampant abuses. The 1977 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act forbids collection agencies from threatening to file suit if they have no intention of doing so.
In addition, the law bans certain harassing practices, like calling after 9 P.M. Debtors, in fact, have the right to demand that a collection agency not call them at work or, for that matter, at home. Such ostrich-like behavior, however, won't keep the unpaid bills from showing up on credit reports.
Debtors also have what amounts to the ultimate weapon -- they can wipe away most of their debts by filing for bankruptcy. (The lenders' revenge, of course, is to deny home and car loans to those who have filed for bankruptcy or to charge them near-usurious interest rates.)
Before the 1960's, the collection industry mainly used the mail to pry dollars out of debtors, sending them increasingly stern letters. Like many other agencies, I.C. System, founded in the 1930's, initially served retailers and professionals like doctors and dentists. In the last 30 years, the focus of collections has shifted to the telephone, with increasingly assertive tactics.
Recently, I.C. System, now the 30th-largest collection agency in the country, has been hired by lenders to call some customers after they miss just one payment. This nip-it-in-the-bud practice is known as an early-out program.
ON a recent rainy afternoon, Jennifer Toepper worked the phone in her beige cubicle at the three-story brick headquarters of I.C. System off a rural highway here. Unlike the back-alley hangouts of popular lore, the building is a cheerful place, with three stories of cubicles surrounding a sculpture-filled atrium.
But Ms. Toepper, who is 20, has no time to admire the view. She is making early-out calls to people who are one month behind on payments to a big appliance company.
In the hectic pace set by the computerized dialer, she has just seconds from the first ring of her phone to glance at the computer screen and figure out who is on the line and what she wants from the conversation.
Ms. Toepper determines that she is speaking to a woman who has missed a $105 payment on a $2,631 projection television. The customer, it turns out, misunderstood the terms of a sales promotion, and quickly agrees to give Ms. Toepper her checking account number so I.C. System can electronically transfer the money.
A note pad on Ms. Toepper's desk bears the inscription, "Get those WUPP's." The acronym stands for Western Union Phone Pay, a service that electronically deducts funds from a debtor's checking account. Such transfers are the quickest and surest way for the agency to get paid.
Not every newly minted debtor is as innocent as the TV buyer. "There are a lot of 'I forgot's,' " said Nicole Neis, who sits next to Ms. Toepper. Late in the year, she said, people plead that "Christmas is coming up and I need the money." But she doesn't buy that excuse. After all, she said, "These are appliances and computers that are a 'want' debt, not a 'need' debt."
Lenders organize collections into "buckets" of accounts, based on how late the payments are. One bucket is for people who are one month late, another for those two months late, and so on. Each bucket calls for progressively tougher tactics, typically with a different group of collectors. "Back end" collectors, who handle the most delinquent accounts, are often the industry's highest-paid stars.
One reason is that they don't get ruffled. Across the atrium from Ms. Toepper's cubicle, Cindy Olson's computer flashes details of a doctor's bill, unpaid since October 1992.
"Is Christine there, please?" Ms. Olson asks. No, but Christine's husband is.
"Do you want to settle this right away before it goes further into collection?" Ms. Olson asks him. "We have the option of recommending the account be placed with an attorney."
The debtor argues the bill is inaccurate.
"We already sent you an itemized bill in October," Ms. Olson responds coolly after looking at the computer screen. Then, barely flinching under a barrage of obscenities, she asks politely, "Do you want to discuss payment today or do I have to disconnect?"
With just too firm a click, Ms. Olson turns off her phone headset and types "vulgar, rude" in the computer log. Without missing a beat, she moves to the next call.
The wall of her cubicle displays a chart of her current bonus plan. If she can get $42,000 in payments in this month, she will receive an extra $1,625 in her paycheck. The average collector at I.C. System earns between $9 and $11 an hour, plus bonuses.
Ms. Olson likes collecting because she can work part time and fit her schedule around taking care of her children. On this day, for example, she is working from 1 to 8 P.M.
Prime times for collections are 7 to 9 A.M. and 4 to 9 P.M. weekdays, when people are most likely to be home. Even better are Saturday mornings and Sunday evenings.
And collectors are always looking for the extra opportunity. "When there was the big snowstorm in Ohio, we targeted Cleveland during the day," said Dan Peters, manager of the I.C. System dialing machines.
IN 1995, lenders placed $100 billion of consumer debt with the nation's 6,300 collection agencies, up 37 percent from 1990, according to the Nilson Report, a newsletter in Oxnard, Calif.. The agencies recouped roughly $16 billion, though their success rates varied wildly, depending on the type of bill, the age of the account and the credit standards of the lender. They kept just under $1 for every $3 they retrieved, making debt collection a $5 billion industry in annual revenue.
But the revenue figure understates the true size of debt-collection activity in the United States because it includes only debt that is placed with agencies after it has been charged off. It does not include the rising "early out" programs, both by the lenders themselves and by collection agencies under contract, that call debtors who are just a month or two late. And it doesn't include collection of business debt, or the collections by the rising number of law firms that work for lenders.
Although the business is still dominated by small outfits, some bigger companies have been buying up the little guys. The largest credit agency is Nationwide Credit, a subsidiary of the First Data Corporation, the credit card processing conglomerate. Currently, no large independent collection agencies are publicly traded.
Of all the economic sectors dominated by small businesses, the category of debt collection and credit reporting is the fastest growing, by the reckoning of the Small Business Administration. The agency estimates that employment in the industry will surge 68 percent by 2004, to nearly 3 million, from 1.7 million in 1994. One reason for that growth: governments at all levels are using the private sector to help in tax collection.
Moreover, the industry seems immune to the automation that has shrunk the work forces of other industries. "Unfortunately, we haven't come up with a substitute for a live person," said Jeffrey L. Dodge, senior vice president of the Equifax Financial Services, the large credit reporting bureau. "Robots don't work. Tape recordings don't work. If you get a phone call and it's a computerized voice, you have more important things to do."
One technology that does seem to work is the videocassette. Norwest Card Services, the credit card unit of the big Minneapolis bank, sends a five-minute tape filled with soothing reassurances to people it can't track down by phone. "We work to make your calls to us a positive experience," a smiling Norwest representative intones. "You'll see that we're ready to listen and offer solutions to your specific situation." Almost one-third of those receiving the video make at least one payment.
Another effective weapon is the computerized dialing machines, which place hundreds of calls simultaneously to offices and homes. With this tool, collection agencies are able to calculate, through trial and error, the daily schedules of the people they are trying to reach, and are programming their computers to factor in special events, like snowstorms and sports extravaganzas, that keep people at home and close to their phones.
For example, the automated dialers at I.C. System have nearly 500 phone lines, which typically make more than 100,000 calls a day, one-third of which actually reach human beings.
A dialer monitors the human collectors, placing new calls when it calculates that they should be finishing up on their old calls. Sometimes the dialer is early, and the recipient hears a recording that instructs him to "hold for an important call."
THE machine can tell live voices from answering machines. In busy times, the dialer will hang up on answering machines or play a taped message asking the debtor to call back. In slow times -- or with more recalcitrant debtors -- it will switch to an operator to leave a personalized message.
Some lenders are moving into a new technological frontier, developing computer models that decide which late payers to pounce on first.
After one missed payment, the Crestar Bank places phone calls right away if customers are near their credit limits or if they routinely pay the minimum each month. People who have bounced checks or have missed payments in the past get immediate calls, too. But someone who doesn't flash such warning signs of financial stress may get no more than a late fee on his next bill.
If people fall further behind, other computer models are used to determine how tough a stance to take. Norwest, for example, has developed a system that looks at late-paying customers' other debts from credit bureau files.
"If the person has opened up 13 other cards in two weeks, I figure no good can come of this," said Brian J. O'Hare, president of Norwest's credit card unit. "I want to close the account and get him to pay me from the other cards. If there is someone who has diminished capacity to pay but no diminished willingness, I want to work with that person."
What sort of personality is attracted to making the phone calls that most people rate up there with dog bites and parking tickets as guaranteed ways to ruin a day?
"Kids don't grow up saying, 'I want to be a bill collector,' " said Marci Martin, the training superviser at I.C. System. "But for some people, it's their niche."
In her case, it was an escape from a job at a hotel front desk that required her to put on a cheerful face at all times, no matter how grumpy she felt. "Here, I don't have to be nice," she said. "I'm my own boss. If I want to be tough, I can tell you you have to pay all the money today. If I want to be lenient, I can be lenient."
Others like the human contact, no matter how hostile it can become. Daniel Alejandro spent 12 years as a Baptist minister, but when his wife was transferred to Minnesota for a computer job, he gave up the collection plate for the collection call. "I felt it was time to change," said Mr. Alejandro, who now works for I.C. System. "I have the people skills, and it is good money." He acknowledged, though, that the job "gets a bit tedious" at times.
"The ministry is perceived very differently from collections," he said. "But the similarity is that you call people to responsibility," in one case spiritual, in the other, financial.
"I'm still helping people solve their problems," he added. "But, this time, it's for a profit."
Managers who hire collectors say they look for people with sales backgrounds, assertive personalities and a dash of cynicism. "Collecting is an exquisite art form," said Mr. O'Hare of Norwest. "You have to be empathetic but be absolutely firm. You have to be an attentive listener but willing to challenge the individual. You have to be a good salesman and be able to deal with a lot of rejection. All the good collectors I've ever seen enjoy a good head game."
One of the more challenging specialties in collecting is called skip tracing, or finding the master deadbeats who slip off their creditors' radar screens by changing their phone numbers, their addresses and, in rare cases, their names.
Skip tracers use computer phone directories, including reverse directories that link phone numbers to street addresses, allowing collectors to call neighbors and ask for a debtor's new phone number, or to leave a message to pass along. Finally, there are credit bureau files where fugitive debtors, unable to shake their borrowing habits, often make a reappearance.
FOR all the efforts of the collection agencies, most of the debtors they dun just don't pay. And, as a rule of thumb, any debt under $2,000 is generally deemed too piddling to justify sending to a lawyer. But with the silence of computers, I.C. System is getting its revenge: Every month the company sends negative reports on 480,000 people to credit bureaus, reflecting $167 million in bad debt.
Sometimes -- on average, two and a half years later -- the debtors call I.C. System in a panic. They have tried to get a job or obtain a mortgage, but have been blocked because of a stained credit file.
"I just got called all kinds of names," said Beth Zeug, an I.C. System manager who helps answer 1,200 calls a day from disgruntled debtors. The caller was apparently furious when she rejected his offer of payola. "He said he will pay us money to take the debt off his credit file but he won't pay the $500 vet bill," she said.
"I had one guy who didn't pay because his cat jumped out of the car window on the way home from the vet and got run over by a car," she said.
Ms. Martin, who trains new collectors, advises them to numb themselves to sob stories like those, just as emergency-room nurses must steel themselves to blood and broken bones.
"The collectors who feel sorry for people don't work out," she said. "Someone tells me a sad story -- the kid went to drug rehab, the dog ran out, Dad lost his job -- any sad story you've ever heard. I say, 'The bottom line is, you still owe the money.' "

Debtors who refuse to answer their telephones are especially vexing for a bill collector. Norwest Card Services, the credit card unit of the big Minneapolis bank, gets its foot in the door by mailing them an innocous-looking video that runs nearly five minutes. The friendly pitch, excerpted below, assures viewers that by responding, "you'll feel so much better becasue you've taken control." Nearly one-third of those who receive the video make at least one payment. (pg. 13)

HEADLINE: The World;
Oil Imports Are Up. Fretting About It Is Down.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN his second inaugural address last week, Bill Clinton made promises on the usual problems, like race relations, education and health. But another hardy perennial, the nation's dependence on imported oil, went unmentioned. Not gone but forgotten, this problem is larger than ever.
Imports have risen to record levels -- above 50 percent of consumption, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Needing cash last year, the Government sold off about 25 million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the equivalent of almost three weeks of imports from Saudi Arabia. That hoard might have been precious in a crisis. 
 But there will not be another crisis quite like the oil shortages of 1973 to 1974 and 1979 to 1980, experts say, and there are reasons that might justify America's profligate course. Last year, domestic production decreased, but the oil companies delivered 2.8 percent more fuel to their customers. As a result, imports, which are relatively cheap, increased 6 percent, the institute said.
The contrast between the bad old days and today is stunning. When imports were 40 percent of consumption, Jimmy Carter, donning a cardigan, said that America should cut imports by nearly a third by 1985 and declared "the moral equivalent of war." As President Carter's energy czar, James R. Schlesinger, put it last week, Americans now have evolved to "indifference without moralizing."
Efforts to find substitute fuels for vehicles continue, along with programs to pump more domestic oil and conserve use. But dependence on foreign sources will grow anyway, the General Accounting Office said last month, because rising demand will outstrip all these efforts as the economy grows. Even without a population increase or new factories to consume more energy, new Chevy Astros, Mercury Villagers and other vans are roaring out of showrooms as old fuel-efficient Chevy Chevettes and Honda Civics head for the scrap heap. That means more fuel per mile.
Combined with declining domestic production, imports could rise to 60 percent of consumption by 2015, the G.A.O. said.
Hazel R. O'Leary, whose job as Energy Secretary ended with Mr. Clinton's swearing-in, said in an interview just before her departure that the American people needed to get the message, but delivering it was beyond the ability of an Energy Secretary. She said it would take another oil shock.
And that appears about as certain as another hurricane in Florida or earthquake in California. The only question is when. Many of the elements are already in place; Larry Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said that idle production capacity is only about three million barrels a day, all of it in the Persian Gulf. "If you were to have a disruption in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, " he said, "the ability of the world to make it up is zero. And nobody would honestly say the Middle East is more secure today than it was a decade ago."
But Mr. Goldstein and other experts say oil is no longer at the top of America's problem list for a number of reasons.
For one, interruptions in supply from the Persian Gulf are possible, but there is no enemy superpower poised to march in. "When the Soviet Union was still around, it had six airborne divisions seemingly ready to fly into the gulf," said Mr. Schlesinger, who also did a turn as Secretary of Defense. OPEC has lost power too, he said.
In fact, the so-called North-South confrontation of the 1970's, with rich oil-consuming nations facing off against poor energy-producing ones, is mostly gone. Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, pointed out that in the 1970's and 1980's, oil-producing countries nationalized their industries, but now they are privatizing them and asking for Western investment. "It's back to a high degree of interdependence," he said. "Everybody wants to be on the same team now."
And America itself has changed. The amount of goods and services that 20 years ago required five barrels of oil to make now takes only three. Not only have utilities switched to coal and natural gas, but the output of the American economy has also shifted away from products using vast amounts of energy, like heavy manufactured goods, to those that use hardly any, like movies and computer software.
The price of oil is down, too. In 1980, oil sales were about 8.5 to 9 percent of gross domestic product. "Today, it's a little over 3 percent," Mr. Goldstein said.
Mr. Goldstein also distinguishes between dependency and vulnerability. If this country cut its dependency by several million barrels a day, it would still be just as vulnerable to price shock, he said, because in a free international market, "a disruption anywhere is a price shock everywhere." Making a similar point last month, the G.A.O. gave the example of Britain after the fall of the Shah of Iran and the subsequent price shock. That country was nearly self-sufficient in oil at the time, but when the price rose, the economic dislocation was severe. The G.A.O. report found that "vulnerability is linked to dependence on oil, not merely to dependence on imported oil."
Cheap oil is still a boon to the American economy. The G.A.O. put the benefits of cheap oil at hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Its analysis explicitly excluded the cost of human life in sending American soldiers back into Mideastern oil fields -- or the limits that import dependency may impose on American foreign policy. In the current political climate, though, those costs do not seem to be high on anybody's list.

I.B.M. STOCK
Good News, Go Away
I.B.M. stock, it may seem, is the stock market in miniature -- both just kept heading gleefully higher, taunting the naysayers. And last week, both fell in tandem. Here's a huge difference, though: the haughty Dow would laugh if anyone compared it to the 2,700-point weakling it was before the '87 crash, but I.B.M., even after quadrupling since '93, has yet to see its precrash high. It edged close last week -- $168, versus $175 in August 1987 -- but then came the bad news. What? You say an 18 percent rise in quarterly earnings, even better than analysts had expected, doesn't sound like bad news? Shows how much you know. I.B.M. shares plunged 10 points in a day, 6 the next and TK the next, leading the whole market in what is politely known as a "correction."
 
JOURNALISM
The 'Gotcha!' That Backfired
It's become a staple of TV news: the Gotcha! stories, in which reporters insinuate themselves into the belly of some beast and discover something, well, simply shocking. But do the news hounds go too far? Have they crossed the line from protecting the public interest to getting flashy scoops for the sake of the flash? That was the issue when reporters for ABC's "Primetime Live" finagled their way into Food Lion stores for a report that accused Food Lion of selling spoiled meat. And last week a North Carolina jury said resoundingly that ABC had gone too far, awarding Food Lion more than $5.5 million in punitive damages. Food Lion never disputed the show's findings, just the methods -- like having producers submit fake resumes to get jobs. "I don't have anything against undercover investigations," one juror said. "Just do them legal." But "trivial" complaints, one media expert said, should not obscure a "noble journalistic goal."
 
SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES
ove Over, Explorer
You can almost hear the conversations in Detroit a decade or so ago: "So, everyone's buying imports. What'll we do?" "Let 'em drive trucks," a passing messenger boy pipes in. "Nah," a guy in a suit says. "It'll never work." "Hmmm," said another. "Let's give it a try. Can't hurt -- nothing else is working." And so was born the unlikely American craze for big, gas-guzzling "sport utility vehicles" (even the name is clunky). Foreign car makers mainly sat it out, seeing it as a crazy idea. So Detroit practically had the field to itself and racked up huge profits. Well, the party may be over: the Japanese and Europeans are getting in on the madness, with at least 17 new foreign sport models due in the next four years. And guess what: they don't cost a fortune. Watch your back, Detroit.
 
INDEXED BONDS
Inflation? Then You Win
You thought you were insured against every calamity? Not a chance. Starting on Wednesday, you can also insure yourself against inflation -- by buying inflation-indexed Treasury bonds. Say you buy a $1,000 bond and it pays 3 percent. You'll get $30 the first year, and the $1,000 will grow by the inflation rate -- if it's 4 percent, add $40 (which you don't see yet). Trouble is, you'll pay tax on the whole $70, so unless the bonds are in a tax-deferred account, you'll get little cash in your pocket. In fact, if demon inflation does return, your tax could more than wipe out your income. Then again, these bonds are a gamble -- and if inflation does rise, you win the bigger gamble. It's just that it won't look that way till the game's over -- when the bonds mature in 10 years.
 
PHILANTHROPY
Enough Money? What an Idea
It was a shocking statement. Downright un-American, really. "I simply decided I had enough money," Charles Feeney said. What? Enough money? Doesn't he know, as a New Yorker cartoon once made clear, that "money is life's report card"? Clearly not, because for 15 years Mr. Feeney has given most of his money away. And since he'd made a fortune in airport duty-free shops, the sums were staggering -- a total of $600 million. But the truly amazing thing was that it was all anonymous -- he didn't even get any gold stars on his report card. Mr. Feeney, who's 65, came clean last week, though. He had to: his company had just been sold, and his secret would come out. His share of the proceeds, some $3.5 billion, went straight to his charitable foundations, leaving him perhaps $5 million. As he said, though, "nobody can wear two pairs of shoes at one time."
 
AND MORE PHILANTHROPY
Billable Heiress
Doris Duke also wanted her fortune -- $1.2 billion -- to go to charity, and if she'd just written a check before she died, it would have. Instead, she kept rewriting her will in her final years, with control of the vast estate flitting from daughter to diet doctor to accountant to butler. She was, in other words, writing an engraved invitation to the legal profession saying: Come and get it. And, of course, the lawyers have come. They fly across country to meetings, billing perhaps $450 an hour en route; they pore over the same papers, billing as they read; they descend, en redundant masse, into courtrooms, billing as they jostle. The total: $10 million and counting (counting fast). One person described it as a "feeding frenzy" -- and that was a lawyer! Decency forbids printing nonlawyers' opinions.
 
EXECUTIVE DIVORCE
What's Yours Is Ours
"First Wives Club" has come to the courtroom -- with a vengeance. In a Connecticut divorce case, Lorna Wendt is asking what is normally considered reasonable: half. The case stands out, though, because of the sums involved: she says Gary Wendt, a top General Electric executive, is worth $100 million, and 50-50 splits are rare at these levels. He offered $10 million; she declined. If the 31-year marriage was a partnership -- if it was their career, not his -- why, she asked, should he get the bulk of it? And multimillionaires throughout the midlife-crisis set await the outcome nervously. One wrinkle: Mr. Wendt says he's worth just $25 million, and his experts back him up. How could there be such a disparity? Simple. It's all those newfangled ways companies have of paying people -- stock options, deferred compensation, pension goodies, you name it. It adds up to a lot more than it seems, Mrs. Wendts' experts say. (Don't feel bad: with that kind of money, you, too, could have experts.)
 
NUTRITION
Oatmeal, Miracle Cure?
Americans, bless their sound-bite-clogged hearts, love a quick fix -- whether it's a diet pill or a miracle pain-killer -- and they're suckers for official-sounding health claims. Makers of oat cereals know this, and have long lobbied to be able to say, on their labels, that whole-oat fiber is good for the heart. Last week, they got their wish from the F.D.A., with one condition: that labels say the oats must be part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. The industry practically danced a jig at the news, with full-page ads appearing within a day trumpeting the wonders of Quaker Oats and Cheerios. But wait a second, said Bonnie Liebman of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, "you have to eat up to four servings a day, every day," to get enough of that magic fiber. The real answer, she said, is a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Otherwise, you'd better really love oatmeal.
 
TELEVISION
What Price 'Seinfeld'?
Would there be intelligent life in a world without "Seinfeld"? No, much too cosmic a question. How about this one: Would there be profitable life on a network without "Seinfeld"? NBC is scared to death that the answer might be no -- in fact, there are fears that if this show ever vanishes, it will be network TV's last gasp, letting cable's marauders take over. Just look at the show's power: with stupefied viewers unable to push the "off" button, a hit show, of course, makes whatever follows it a hit, too. But "Seinfeld" creates such a force field that it even helps the show that comes before -- "Seinfeld" fever, apparently, takes hold before the dishes are even cleared. Do the show's stars know their power? Of course, and they reportedly want $1 million each to come back next season. That's per episode, by the way, or $22 million a year, putting Elaine, George and Kramer -- the man who's turned entering a room into an art form -- up there with Jim Carrey and the mega-stars. Pricy, but consider the alternative.

HEADLINE: Deaths in the Workplace: Looking Beyond the Numbers

 BODY:
"One Day's Death Toll on the Job" (Dec. 22), by Jon Nordheimer, examined the deaths of 13 American workers on a single day last fall. The toll was smaller than usual -- on a typical day, 17 people die in the United States because of the work they do. These were among the responses to the article from readers:

To the Editor: 
 Undeniably, as measured by fatalities, the workplace is becoming safer. Fatality rates have declined by about 2.7 percent a year since the end of World War II. But the work of the Labor Department and OSHA doesn't seem be a leading driver of the trend.
Our research suggests that there are three main reasons for the decline in fatalities: the changing nature of employment, with a movement away from heavy manufacturing to a service economy; the fluctuations of the business cycle, and, most interesting, the changes in the country's workers' compensation insurance systems.
Workers' compensation affects safety and fatality rates in three ways. Like unemployment insurance, workers' compensation is "experience rated," in that larger employers pay insurance premiums, based in part on their safety experience. Over the last 10 to 15 years, many states have changed the rating formula so that more employers qualify for the program and that even more of their premiums are determined by their own safety. A result is a much stronger economic incentive to provide a safer workplace and control workers' compensation insurance premiums, which have generally risen dramatically since the 1970's.
Second, workers' compensation premiums are determined for more than 600 classes of employment. To the extent that insurance costs are higher for one class of employment than another (say, for construction work versus office work), employers will have incentives to substitute capital for the relatively higher labor costs and thus move employment away from the riskier occupations.
Finally, in the last several years, there has been tremendous growth in programs that allow employers to self-insure a portion of their insurance liabilities, providing a much stronger economic incentive to have a safer workplace. In some industries, with workers' compensation premiums approaching 50 percent of payroll costs, employers have embraced workplace safety as a means of economic survival.

HEADLINE: Kiss Kiss;
Bipartisanship And Other White Lies

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was one of those rare times in American politics last week when, however briefly, hostile partisanship gave way to Emily Post. With a soothing assurance of bipartisan bonhomie, President Clinton set the tone in his inauguration speech: "The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another. Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore."
Speaker Newt Gingrich sounded downright giddy after the ceremony, proclaiming that there was "a sense of bipartisanship" in the air. Madeleine K. Albright, unanimously confirmed as Secretary of State, welcomed "a new era of bipartisan foreign policy." On Friday, Mr. Clinton announced that he and George Bush and other former Presidents would hold a summit meeting on community service. 
 But as much as voters may complain about legislative gridlock, the fashionable notion among politicians that Americans are demanding comity and compromise above all else may be more an illusion of statistics than a political reality. In fact, in the last two elections, voters did not reward split-the-difference coalition builders but chose more hard-edged ideologues in both parties, leaving a gaping hole in the center of Congress.
"When it comes to actually casting a vote, people are not necessarily looking for the peacemaker or diplomat," said Leonard Williams, a professor of political science at Manchester College in Indiana. "They're looking for someone who is clear about what they stand for. Someone who wants commitment. The remarkable thing is that we found an electoral advantage to being an extremist."
Mr. Williams and a colleague, Neil Wollman, analyzed the re-election races of House incumbents in the last two elections and concluded that the Republican sweep of 1994 did not wipe out the ranks of the liberals in Congress, and that the voters last year did not reject the sharp conservatism associated with Mr. Gingrich and his fellow Republicans. Their study shows, for example, that conservatives won 95 percent of their races in 1996.
Nor is there much to the notion that people intentionally opted for divided Government last November in the hope that the executive and legislative branches could function in moderate bliss. To the contrary, 84 percent of those who backed Mr. Clinton, advertising himself as a centrist, also voted for a Democrat for the House.
This may underscore another example of voters (the same people who want their taxes cut and the Federal budget balanced) trying to have it both ways. In November, voters rewarded a Congress that ended on a note of bipartisan accomplishment by sending back most incumbents. Yet while people tell pollsters they are disgusted with partisan bickering, they also contend that they want their leaders to act out of principle, to stand for something.
 
 
 
Healing, No
 If the voters are confused, so are the politicians. They know that if they produce they will be more popular come election time. Yet, there is great risk, too, in cozying up to the other party.
"For politicians, not only does their gut tell them not to trust the other side, but the people they represent don't really trust the other side either," said Eric M. Uslaner, a professor of government at the University of Maryland and author of "The Decline of Comity in Congress" (University of Michigan Press, 1993). "Everyone wants to see what they can do. But looming beneath everything is the fact that both parties represent very different groups of people -- and for almost the last 20 years have been at each other's throats."
Steve Bell, a Republican political consultant and a former Congressional aide, said there is no way even the appearance of cooperation will last -- certainly not through the elections of 1998. "It will not be, 'Let's come together and heal' -- that's not how you get elected in this country," Mr. Bell said. "You'll see people running on the death penalty, abortion, school prayer. You get elected by exciting your folks. You show them where you stand on certain code issues. And you turn them out."
Indeed, behind the facade of conciliation, there is a growing insistence in both parties that unless they more aggressively stake their claims on issues, they will lose their identities even further.
 
 
 
Egged On
 The Wall Street Journal's editorial page recently called on its constituency of Republicans to celebrate their party's ideological fervor. "Rank partisanship can indeed corrode the system," the editorial said, "but the Beltway now seems instinctively to dump on acts of partisanship that flow from ideology." And consider, in another conservative journal, The Weekly Standard, this hardly delicate headline on a recent essay: "Stick It to the Democrats."
The Democrats, thus far, are not so blatant; if the Republicans see bipartisanship as the strategy of losers, the Democrats, having indeed lost their majority, have to appeal to bipartisanship if they are to accomplish much of anything.
But they, too, seem to be spoiling for confrontation. There is, for example, this collision course on Capitol Hill: Republicans in Congress are pressing for a balanced budget amendment as their top priority, while the Democrats' No. 1 goal -- reforming the campaign finance system -- is not even on the Republicans' agenda.
"I don't think the foundation for bipartisanship was set in the 1996 elections," said Bob Carolla, communications director for the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action. "The general election was the usual vituperative attack on way-out liberals or unpatriotic liberals. How is Newt Gingrich supposed to sit down with David Bonior or, better yet, Barney Frank, and talk about common ground?" Primed for the next battle, he added, "We're getting ready to fight like hell on the balanced budget amendment."
 
 
 
Sign My Bill
 The parties also show evidence of using the shroud of bipartisanship to obscure very partisan intentions. For example, in the name of bipartisanship Mr. Clinton last week called on Republicans to sign off on his party's plan to rewrite the campaign finance laws. But the appeal for harmony was as much a strategy by Democrats to turn attention away from their party's crisis over more than $1 million in questionable contributions, many from foreign sources. In fact, some party officials gloated that the President's announcement was cleverly timed to coincide with -- and draw a contrast to -- the House vote to reprimand Mr. Gingrich for ethics violations.
Just the same, many Senate Republicans, who want to keep the campaign finance system that helped them win control of Congress, insist that the remedy is not to overhaul it but to punish the Democrats who took advantage of it.
Efforts to bring civility and accommodation into politics are not new, and have never been particularly successful. In 1939, for example, Franklin D. Roosevelt called for "cooperation -- without trace of partisanship."
Harry Truman took a harder look. "There was never a nonpartisan in politics," he declared. "A man cannot be a nonpartisan and be effective in a political party."
One politician inclined to Roosevelt's point of view is Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican who calls himself a social liberal and economic conservative. "People do want bipartisanship," he said. "People are sick to death of finger pointing."
Then why, if people were so eager for comity, did Massachusetts voters defeat Mr. Weld in his race for Senate last year? Rather than go with a moderate who had pledged to work both sides of the aisle, they settled on a liberal Democrat, Senator John F. Kerry.
 
 
 
Still Drinking
 All the same, when Mr. Weld called Mr. Kerry to congratulate him after the election, he also invited the Senator to join him for a beer at the saloon favored by Boston politicians.
And even in Congress, lip service to the notion of working together is still being paid. In what may be a delicious coincidence, Republicans and Democrats plan to gather in early March in Hershey, Pa., the city known for producing chocolate kisses. It is billed as the "Congressional Bipartisan Retreat."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Pilots Just Want a Little R-E-S-P-E-C-T

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
CONSIDERING the record profits that airlines are generating these days, pilots should be happy. After all, the industry is more stable now than it has been since its deregulation in 1978. That means greater security for pilots, whose jobs are still among the best-paying in the nation.
But pilots are complaining. Union leaders say it is their members' hard work that has bolstered earnings, and they are demanding raises to make up for wage cuts during years of steep losses. At American, pilots are warning they may strike. At United, the employee-owner pilots are publicly criticizing the tight-fistedness of the managers they hired. At Continental and Northwest, the tune is the same: it's pay-back time. 
 Not everyone is sympathetic, though. Piloting has been called the best part-time job in America, allowing many pilots to have second careers. And although they start off with low salaries (around $30,000), a pilot currently at American, United or Delta will earn an average of $125,000 a year (in 1996 dollars) over a 30-year career. Many other employees at American, worried about the effects of a possible strike, started wearing buttons last week bearing the acronym SPOILED, for Spoiled Pilots' Objective Is Leaving Employees Destitute.

More Than Money
But the pilots' restiveness is about more than wages. Broad changes have occurred in the nature of the profession and the makeup of the pilot ranks, and those shifts help explain some of the current saber-rattling.
Pilots, for example, do not command the respect they once did when air travel was glamorous and only for the well heeled. Back then, airplanes were less refined, and jut-jawed captains stared down the dangers and calmed nervous passengers with Chuck Yeager drawls.
Today, pilots have in many ways become systems managers, monitoring computers that can largely fly planes on their own. There is a joke that the cockpit of the future will have one seat for a pilot and one for a dog -- the dog is there to bite the pilot's hand if he touches anything; the pilot's job is to feed the dog.
And as more people board increasingly crowded flights that serve fewer meals and offer no legroom, comparisons to flying buses -- and their drivers -- are inevitable, particularly after Greyhound Air started flying in Canada last year.
While society's opinion of pilots may have slipped half a notch over the years, pilot self-image appears to be as healthy as ever. One reason is that the military is training fewer pilots, so more civilians, who were not steeped in a culture where chain of command is everything, are flying for major carriers. They do not automatically respect their airline's chief executive, particularly since fewer chief executives are pilots themselves or founding fathers of the company.
Pilots are the C.E.O.'s of their planes, with the lives of passengers entrusted to them and up to $1 billion in insurance riding on their flight. Pilots like to say that they can earn their yearly salary 10 times over in just two critical seconds, and that if something goes wrong beyond their control, well, they are always first to the accident scene.
Because no C.E.O. carries such responsibility on a daily basis or faces such risks, pilots naturally chafe when airline managers see them simply as a stubbornly high cost of doing business. The employee buyout of United Airlines in 1994 was motivated in part by pilots seeking more respect from management.
Individual pilots may want more respect, but union leaders say their current demands are based on simple economics. Many airline managers, after exhausting cash and credit in the 1980's through a host of strategic errors, turned to employees for wage cuts and work-rule changes.
J. Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said his members had little choice but to become, in effect, investors of last resort in these troubled carriers -- pilot skills are not transferable to other industries, and if pilots leave one airline for another, they start at the bottom of the wage and seniority ladder.
Pilots are not asking so much for a raise but to get back to where they used to be, Mr. Babbitt said. "They made an investment of their wages, and they are simply looking to get a return."
According to one former Eastern Airlines captain, though, most pilots at major airlines were paid too much before, and most of them are paid too much now.
"What pilots get and what they do does not correspond," said Robert W. Iverson, who was a pilot with Eastern for 18 years. Along with other pilots, he founded Kiwi Airlines in 1992 but left in 1995 amid disputes over how to run the airline. Pilots' pay, Mr. Iverson said, is actually more a reflection of their power to cripple the company if they go on strike.
 
Easy Living
Mr. Iverson, who was a Kiwi pilot in addition to chief executive of the airline, also ran two construction companies while flying for Eastern. Pilots are actually flying only 60 to 80 hours a month, although they are working away from home, on average, 160 nights a year.
But Mr. Iverson scoffed at suggestions that pilots' schedules can be exhausting. "It's not intellectually difficult, it's not physically difficult," he said. "It's probably the easiest way to make a living ever invented."
Pilots can laugh at this (although they tend to laugh harder when there are only pilots in the room).
Here is one joke making the rounds: After the pilots at United led their employee buyout in 1994, they all gathered to discuss how their jobs would change now that they had more say in running the airline. The airline's chairman, Gerald Greenwald, announces their new schedule -- each United pilot would now have six days off each week, and would fly only on Wednesdays.
A minute later, one pilot raises his hand and asks, "Every Wednesday?"

HEADLINE: Small Loans May Be Key To Helping Third World

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 24

 BODY:
A global campaign to help poor people by encouraging them to start small businesses is expected to be endorsed by the Clinton Administration, several foreign leaders and leading development agencies at a meeting in Washington early next month.
Private anti-poverty groups have drawn up a plan that calls for $21.6 billion to be advanced to nearly 100 million poor people over the next eight years. The money would be in the form of small loans to finance entrepreneurial activities like small-scale farming or trade. 
 Among the plan's backers are major international aid agencies, banks, corporations and foundations. They believe such small loans -- often no more than a few hundred dollars -- offer the best way to help the roughly 2.5 billion people now living in abject poverty. Nearly two-thirds of those people are women and children.
Hillary Rodham Clinton will be co-chairwoman of the meeting, scheduled for Feb. 2 to 4, with Queen Sofia of Spain and Tsutomu Hata, a former Prime Minister of Japan. Speakers are to include the heads of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program.
"We want to reallocate existing aid to microcredit schemes," said Nancy Barry of Women's World Banking, an organization promoting credit for poor women and one of the meeting's backers. "They are more efficient than public-sector spending because once the poor have incomes they can look after themselves."
No one doubts that giving the poor small credits, normally secured by no more than a collective pledge from neighbors that they will be repaid, can be an important tool to reduce poverty. Such credit plans, which had about a million clients in 1985, now have about 10 million.
The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the best-known institution offering such plans, has lent $1 billion to two million poor women and seen 97 percent of its loans repaid, which suggests that its clients are growing more prosperous.
But critics contend that the meeting's backers are making exaggerated claims that raise unrealistic expectations.
They say "microcredit," as such small loans are known, appeals to politicians by promising to reduce poverty without the pain of big aid budgets. Most microcredit organizations are financially nonviable and require subsidies, they say. And they fear that the ground swell of interest in microcredit will divert scarce aid funds from more mundane development goals like health and education improvement.
"They are evangelists who think they have discovered the Holy Grail of poverty reduction," says Ben Rogaly, a development expert at the University of East Anglia in Britain. "All the evidence suggests credit for self-employment benefits the better-off poor over the destitute," he said. "There is no stand-alone answer to poverty."
The decision to call the meeting next month reflects the support given to this approach by the United Nations. The meeting was organized by the Results Educational Fund, a Washington group that tries to mobilize support to fight hunger and poverty.
But only some 2 percent of the roughly $60 billion that donors spend on development assistance annually goes to microcredit plans, which reach only a tiny fraction of the world's poor. The United States provides about $130 million for such plans.
The meeting organizers hope to change this. Their goal is to raise the number of poor people with access to credit to 100 million by the year 2005 at an estimated cost of $21.6 billion.
About $7 billion would come from aid-giving countries and international organizations. Countries in the developing world would be asked for $1.6 billion and private corporations and anti-poverty groups for another $2.5 billion.
Microcredit organizations hope to raise an additional $2 billion in new deposits from their clients and to borrow another $8 billion commercially as they become viable.

HEADLINE: In the Two Koreas' Icy Rivalry, Signs of a Thaw

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Just last month, diplomacy on the Korean peninsula seemed a permafrost of enmity and distrust, with relations between North and South Korea as chilly and bleak as a rice paddy in winter.
Now there are signs of a thaw. No one knows whether it will get very far and nobody has ever made money betting on conciliation in Korea, but diplomats and scholars say that forces are at work to create far-reaching opportunities to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula over the next few years. 
 One opportunity will come this Wednesday, when officials from the United States and South Korea sit down in New York with senior diplomats from North Korea to discuss a proposal for talks that could lead to a formal end to the Korean War. The fighting was suspended in 1953 with a simple armistice, rather than a real peace treaty, and the border that gashes across the middle of Korea remains the site of the greatest massing of enemy troops on the globe.
"This is just one small step, but it's still a significant one," a senior South Korean official said of the coming week's talks. "It's like a baby taking its first step."
The meeting on Wednesday will be simply talks about talks, for North Korea has agreed only to accept a briefing about what the four-party talks -- involving the United States, China and the two Koreas -- would be about. But officials note that a handful of other efforts are also under way to ease tensions.
"I don't see peace breaking out this year, but I do see some significant progress in that direction," said Michael Breen, the head of a consulting firm here for businesses involved in North Korea.
Many people expect the United States and North Korea to open liaison offices in each other's capitals later this year, a step toward the eventual establishment of diplomatic relations. The United States may also ease its sanctions against North Korea and, together with Japan, send some food assistance.
North Korea is expected to approve further visits by American experts who would search for the remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War, and American and North Korean officials will also discuss the spread of missiles. Some diplomats think that North Korea could be induced to give up its entire ballistic missile program if the price were right.
And then, the ground-breaking is expected this spring on a project to build two new light-water nuclear reactors for North Korea, in exchange for its giving up its suspected nuclear weapons program. South Koreans would then be based at the construction site in North Korea.
More broadly, some see the virtual economic collapse in North Korea as creating new hopes for change. The notion is that the North may be so desperate that it will accept distasteful steps -- such as discussions with the South -- in exchange for vast amounts of assistance that the Government in Seoul is holding out as a lure.
"Further and expanded aid to the North depends on its attitude," said Kim Suk Woo, the Deputy Minister of National Unification.
"If North Korea is prepared to admit its economic difficulties and reach out and cooperate with South Korea," he added, "then a breakthrough could happen."
Mr. Kim said that among the steps that the South could take would be allowing tourists to go to the North, assisting the North's agricultural base, repairing flood damage, and authorizing South Korean companies to invest in the North. Collectively, such moves would amount to a revolution in relations between the two Koreas.
In a more modest step, the South Korean Government today authorized seven domestic companies to do business in the North, in such sectors as manufacturing textiles and bottling mineral water. South Korea has also agreed to send the North 300 tons of flour, a small amount but a hint of what the South could provide.
Some analysts say that one excellent omen was North Korea's willingness to express regret last month for having sent a submarine full of commandos into South Korean waters. That incursion last September had poisoned relations between the two Koreas and halted all plans for cooperation.
The statement of regret put America's policy of engaging North Korea back on track, but for now North Korea is still rejecting any discussions with the South.
"Frankly, it is highly unlikely that four-party talks will take place," said Kim Myong Chol, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea in Tokyo.
Mr. Kim said that North Korea was attending the briefing next Wednesday out of courtesy to President Clinton, rather than because of any real interest.
"North Korea has every reason to be polite to President Clinton, but we have no reason to listen to South Korea," Mr. Kim said. "So we don't foresee any improvement in relations between North and South Korea."
One reason for skepticism about the prospects for major improvement is simply the force of personalities, especially that of the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam. President Kim says that his mother was killed by North Korean commandos in 1960, and he clearly harbors a visceral hostility for North Korea -- which it reciprocates.
To be sure, Some officials say that President Kim is hoping to arrange a summit meeting in the latter half of this year with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il. But North Koreans may prefer to wait until Kim Young Sam leaves office early next year and hold a summit meeting with his successor.
Still, whether discussions come this year or next, most believe it is on the horizon. One reason is that North Korea is expected to name Kim Jong Il President and Communist Party leader this summer, after a three-year period of mourning to honor his father, the former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
Diplomats say that the prospect of North Korea again having a formal leader creates new possibilities, especially because Kim Jong Il is expected to try to raise funds so that he can celebrate his inauguration by bestowing gifts on the population.
North Korea has just reached a tentative deal with Taiwan to accept and store up to 200,000 barrels of low-level Taiwanese nuclear waste, in exchange for an initial payment of $75 million and more later on. That may pay for some of the festivities, but the most obvious way for North Korea to raise large sums in a hurry would be to talk peace with the South.

HEADLINE: Despite Agreements, Cleanups Are Slow to Come to the Border

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CALEXICO, Calif.

 BODY:
Taking no chances, a team of state water quality engineers suited up like astronauts on a poisonous planet to take samples from the stinking, foaming stream that ripples through this dusty border town.
Wearing plastic face masks, coveralls and a double layer of gloves, they dipped bottles into the murky New River to measure the prodigious amounts of bacteria and other contaminants carried from Mexicali, Mexico, across a tattered fence. 
 Modest improvements over the last year to the Mexicali sewage system have given residents here hope that the river will eventually flow cleanly past the housing tracts and farmland in this town, 100 miles east of San Diego. But like much of the pollution cleanup along the border promised before the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect three years ago, major progress has yet to come.
After removing his gear and rinsing his hands, one water engineer, Charles Springer, sat near the riverbank and described the brackish water as somewhat cleaner than it was a few years ago, but still 2,000 times more polluted than the level considered safe for swimming.
"I've heard stories of people who've splashed themselves and had to go to the hospital," Mr. Springer said. "The water is definitely something you don't want to touch."
A report last year by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, showed that a witch's brew of contaminants from Mexico -- including sewage, chemicals from factories and pesticides from agricultural runoff -- feed into the river.
The sewage treatment plants in Mexicali, which cannot cope with the expanding population of one million, pour millions of gallons of raw and partly treated effluent into the stream each day.
Small enough to be called a creek almost anywhere but in the Mojave Desert, the New River runs through urban slums and past a slaughterhouse and a gantlet of oozing pipes before flowing into Calexico.
It then meanders north for 50 miles through Imperial Valley farmland until it empties into the Salton Sea, a landlocked lake that is polluted in its own right, primarily from agricultural sources in California.
Though the New River is lush with reeds, turtles and occasional wintering egrets, its problems are unmistakable. In some spots, the river is covered with soap foam and lacks the oxygen to support fish. When pollution is at its worst, the usually green algae-filled water runs black.
The Imperial County Health Department says the river carries micro-organisms capable of transmitting cholera, polio, tuberculosis and typhus. Signs in English and Spanish warn people to avoid contact with the water.
For Suod Rashid, who owns Jerusalem Sportswear in a shopping center, the nearby river is more an esthetic problem. Standing behind his cash register, he told of hours without customers on hot days, when the stench from the water is especially strong. The smell, he said, has led a nearby chiropractor to move.
"Sometimes when I open the store in the morning, I have to spray air freshener and get the air-conditioning going because it smells so bad," Mr. Rashid said.
After nearly 50 years of promising improvements, the United States and Mexican Governments are spending $5 million on "quick fixes" to improve the sewage system in Mexicali. Construction on a $70 million treatment plant, with possible financing from both countries, could begin in a few years.
The environmental side accords to Nafta were signed to insure that increased industrialization and population growth would be regulated and that existing pollution problems would be cleaned up. But since the accord went into effect in January 1994, it has become apparent to experts that the cleanups will take longer than expected.
"The problems are quite severe on the border," said Alan Hecht, principal international administrator at the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which released a five-year border-cleanup plan last month. "It's not something you'll fix quickly."
Hampered by its economic crisis, Mexico has allocated $100 million to $200 million in the last two years to clean up pollution in border towns. The amount is far short of predictions issued in the Nafta debate.
"Both Governments rushed to address the symbolism of border pollution," said Daniel Seligman, the director of international trade for the Sierra Club. "But once the free-trade deal was signed and delivered, they failed to carry through."
Officials of both countries hope to obtain a loan from the North American Development Bank, created by the Nafta side accords, to finance the treatment plant in Mexicali. The bank has approved four small projects, totaling $5 million to $8 million, that are unrelated to the Mexicali-Calexico problems. But it has not distributed the money.
In the meantime, irate residents in this bustling community of 19,000 have proposed damming the river at the border or piping it to the outskirts of town. But not much has come of that except frustration.
An Imperial County supervisor, Wayne Van De Graaff, is optimistic that the river's transformation is near. Though five American and Mexican presidents have visited the region over the years with promises to clean up the river, he said, official resolve these days is more serious. "Everybody wants to see this cleaned up," Mr. Van De Graaff said. "It's a stigma to the county."

HEADLINE: OPTIMISM GROWING THAT BUDGET DEAL CAN BE NEGOTIATED

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Two years ago, the Republicans proposed cutting $270 billion from the growth of Medicare spending over seven years, setting off a bitter political battle that has poisoned efforts to balance the Federal budget ever since.
But as the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress prepare for yet another effort to eliminate the deficit by 2002, their differences on Medicare -- and on a number of other contentious issues -- have narrowed sufficiently so that both sides for the first time are expressing cautious optimism that they can reach a deal on a balanced budget this year. 
 "The groundwork has been laid pretty well," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said in a television interview on Thursday.
President Clinton said on Wednesday that the odds of getting an agreement were "quite high." On Friday, the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said Congress and the White House "can agree by spring on a plan to end nearly three decades of red ink."
The remaining differences, over ideological approaches to the role of Government, as well as over spending levels, are big enough that neither side is taking a deal for granted, and neither is likely to eschew partisan rhetoric as it maneuvers for a negotiating advantage. Mr. Clinton is to send his budget proposals to Congress on Feb. 6, and the Republicans will flesh out their own proposals over the next month.
"I don't think the differences have narrowed as much as it might appear on the surface," said a Democratic Congressional aide involved in the budget process. "We're still in a honeymoon phase, and no one wants to appear not to be cooperative. But as we move forward, positions will harden."
On all the major issues, though, Democrats and Republicans have ground each others' positions down enough over the past two years that they start off within shouting distance of one another.
On Medicare, the Administration said last week that its budget proposal would call for $138 billion in spending reductions over six years, just $20 billion less than a comparable Republican proposal last year.
The gap could widen when the Republicans complete their new plan. But already, the focus of the debate over Medicare has shifted from the scale of the spending cuts to narrower issues, such as whether the Administration's plan fairly compensates health maintenance organizations and whether it relies too much on accounting gimmicks.
Mr. Clinton has said he would keep an open mind about a proposal from some Republicans to increase Medicare premiums for wealthy retirees. But after the political battering they took over Medicare last year, some Republicans said they were reluctant to push for such an increase.
The Republicans have consistently insisted on far larger tax cuts than the Democrats have been willing to accept. But the Administration's own tax-cutting proposals expanded during the Presidential campaign, and Mr. Clinton said this week that he could "envision being more flexible" on Republican demands for a reduction in the tax on capital gains, the issue that has most clearly divided the two sides. Republicans, in turn, have promised to consider Mr. Clinton's proposals for tax deductions and credits for college tuition.
Senate Republicans last week proposed a tax-cut package of $193 billion over five years. The Administration's tax-cutting proposal in its coming budget is expected to be valued at $100 billion to $130 billion.
Mr. Clinton has already said he would call for increases in spending on education, welfare and other domestic programs, and this weekend he proposed an expansion of the Federal food safety program. Republicans are certain to fight all or most of his proposals.
But the Republicans are no longer putting much firepower behind their calls to eliminate or scale back the Education, Commerce and Energy Departments, and after cutting overall discretionary spending on domestic programs in 1995 by more than $20 billion, to $490 billion, the Republicans voted to increase it last year to $503 billion.
After squabbling over the accuracy of the economic and technical assumptions underlying their competing budget plans, the White House and the Republicans in Congress have edged closer together, particularly in their estimates of the size of the deficit they must eliminate to balance the budget by 2002.
The Administration foresees needing to close a deficit of about $100 billion in 2002. The Congressional Budget Office's estimate is about $150 billion.
"If you simply look at the numbers, at the size of the problem and at the progress they made in 1995 and 1996, you'd have to say the stars are in alignment," said Van Doorn Ooms, a former policy director at the House Budget Committee.
"The objective conditions for a deal are very good," said Mr. Ooms, now a research director at the Committee for Economic Development, a business-financed research organization. "Having said that, one must always be aware of how many little things can go wrong in the process."
Indeed, for all the praise that Mr. Clinton's new Medicare proposals won from Republicans early last week, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, later excoriated one component of the plan that would shift spending on home health care from one Medicare account to another as part of a short-term fix for Medicare's financial problems.
"The President ought to be ashamed," Mr. Gramm said. "This is a proposal that says, 'I am content to deceive the American people.' "
But whether it is Medicare or some other budget category, neither side has been willing to embrace the deep, sustained cuts that would yield long-term fiscal stability, or to cancel or delay tax cuts to make eliminating the deficit easier.
So to some degree, the success of the budget negotiations will hinge on the White House and the Republican leadership finding mutually acceptable ways of avoiding or postponing difficult spending cuts.
For example, the Republicans have called for an increase in military spending in the next few years, and then a decline as 2002 draws nearer.
Similarly, the White House budget last year called for increases in domestic spending in the early years, and deep cuts in the years after President Clinton has left office. The plan also included a series of sketchy proposals that the Administration contended would bring in $30 billion in 2002, said Robert D. Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Martha Phillips, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group, said: "Any agreement they reach will not, at the end of the day, be a beautiful creature to behold. Both sides will claim to have solved the problem, but we will find out in a year or two that there's more work to be done."

HEADLINE: AS DOLLAR RISES, TREASURY POLICY RAISES QUESTIONS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Almost every day for the last two years Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has repeated the same line whenever asked about the American currency. "A strong dollar," Mr. Rubin has said, almost mantralike, "is in the interest of the United States."
Now, some people are wondering whether Mr. Rubin's unrelenting support for the dollar has been a bit too unrelenting. 
 The dollar has soared in recent weeks, touching 120 yen late Thursday before falling back a bit on Friday. That puts the currency up 50 percent from the low of 80 yen to the dollar nearly two years ago, and many analysts, after repeatedly predicting that the dollar would soon start to weaken, now expect the rise to continue for at least a while longer. The dollar has not been this strong against the Japanese yen for nearly four years.
The dollar has also risen steadily against the German mark, the most important European currency, reaching a 31-month high of about 1.63 marks, up about 14 percent from the beginning of 1996.
A rise in the dollar tends to make American goods more expensive abroad and foreign goods a better bargain in the United States. It also makes it less expensive for American travelers in other countries.
The low for the dollar two years ago created the first test of wills between Mr. Rubin and the currency markets. Mr. Rubin won. But in world finance, there is no such thing as pure victory. So even while the Clinton Administration declares that the rise of the dollar is a long-delayed vote of confidence in America's renewed economic strength, Mr. Rubin finds himself under attack by two groups who usually agree on almost nothing: Japanese officials and United States auto makers.
Japanese officials say they are appalled by the pace at which the dollar has soared, even though it makes their goods far more competitive around the world. They see the flight to the dollar as worrisome evidence that investors around the world are giving up on Japan, concluding that the country may be hopelessly mired in its economic troubles for some time. In search of higher returns, investors are heading to the United States, figuring that its markets, even at these lofty heights, are a better bet than Japan or Europe.
So while Mr. Rubin has repeated his standard fare this week, his counterpart in Japan, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, has sounded a different theme. "The yen's excessive fall against the dollar is undesirable," he said on Friday in Tokyo.
For once, Mr. Mitsuzuka has many allies in Detroit. And the American auto makers have been pounding on the Treasury's door, warning the Administration of a host of disasters in the offing: a revival of the trade deficit with Japan, a loss of all the ground that American car makers have made up against Japanese competitors, and perhaps a round of "cost-cutting measures" -- a veiled warning of layoffs.
Without question, the weak yen has enabled Japanese car makers to keep their prices stable or even to lower them a bit, while General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have raised their prices for the new model year. The lowering of Japanese prices is good news for consumers. But Richard Wagoner, the president of the General Motors Corporation's North American automotive operations, said early this month that he would like to see the yen strengthen to about 90 yen to the dollar. His hopes appear likely to be dashed. "We're concerned by the yen," Mr. Wagoner said in a recent interview. "There's no justification for the valuation."
In Washington and on Wall Street, though, plenty of justifications are being voiced every day. The rapid reduction of the Federal deficit, American officials say, has made the dollar more attractive than ever. Higher interest rates in the United States make investing in Treasury bonds and other financial instruments look more promising, and if anything, analysts say, rates are likely to rise further in the United States while they are expected to remain low in Japan and could fall even further in Europe.
"The dollar's performance reflects basic economic fundamentals," Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said on Friday. "The U.S. economy remains vibrant after six years of expansion, the Japanese economy remains gripped by deflation and financial-sector problems, and European economies are struggling to grow."
Blunting the complaints from Detroit and elsewhere, Administration officials say the rise of the dollar benefits the American economy in several ways. Imports help keep prices down and thus contribute to keeping inflation under control. And by keeping inflation down, they add, imports help reduce the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. (They will say none of this on the record, of course, because that is solely Mr. Rubin's purview -- and in public or private, he says very little.)
And then there is the most intangible benefit of all: how the dollar's strength translates into diplomatic strength. Foreign policy practitioners differ greatly on this subject. But it never hurts to go into negotiations with another country when armed with a currency that is viewed as on the rise. And that is how the markets view it. "The speed of the recent U.S. dollar surge may be promoting some official worries in Frankfurt and Tokyo," Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment firm, told its clients this week, "but no credible plans to halt the rise appear in store."
Still, it can be dangerous to measure national economic strength solely by the relative values of currencies. When the dollar was exceptionally strong in the mid-1980's, it masked tremendous inefficiencies in American factories and only added to the problems of industry by pricing many American goods out of world markets. And when the dollar hit bottom two years ago, the American economy was creating jobs, a stock market boom was gathering steam, and Japan was still mired in recession and bankruptcies.
But as a measure of perceptions about the future of economic stability, the foreign exchange markets are often a telling indicator. And what they are indicating these days is that investors around the world find the United States the best haven. They are nervous about investing in Europe, which plans to move to a new currency, the Euro, in just two years -- eliminating the traditionally rock-solid Deutsche mark as an investment instrument. And whatever luster Japan had left was wiped out, deservedly or not, by the 11 percent drop in the Tokyo stock market since the beginning of the year.
"In today's world, it is no longer Japan Inc., it is U.S.A. Inc.," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics, an economic advisory firm.
That is part of the problem for Washington, however. Japan's traditional way of reviving its economy is to increase exports, raising its trade surplus with the United States. That, in turn, can intensify the political heat on Capitol Hill, especially if the American economy cools off.
"The Japanese are a bit confused these days," one American who deals often with Japanese officials said this week. Japanese companies will reap large profits if the yen stays weak. But the Japanese fear any sign that their investors are losing confidence in the yen and fleeing to the United States, where even Treasury securities are more rewarding than the interest rates of one-half of 1 percent in Japan.
Europeans share this fear. A severe slowdown in Europe could raise doubts about the viability of a single European currency. Another reason for the rise is the constancy of Mr. Rubin's comments. He has said that repetition creates a sense of stability, making speculators hesitant to bet against the dollar.
Despite the complaints from Detroit, there has been relatively little political pressure so far on the Administration from manufacturers who fear that the high dollar will hurt their exports. For one thing, a lot of American businesses benefit from the rise. Companies with little fear of foreign competitors, like Microsoft and Intel, make greater profits on their overseas sales. Wall Street benefits, too, because it lures a torrent of foreign investment.
But Detroit is a different story. And from the executive suites of the Big Three auto makers to the offices of the city's cultural leaders, there has been growing concern as the dollar has crept higher.
Robert Eaton, the chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, said that all he wanted was for the Administration to pressure Japan to stop big purchases of Treasury securities, purchases that tend to drive up the dollar. "We've been doing nothing more than asking our Government to get them to stop intervening," he said on Wednesday.
It could be a long wait.

HEADLINE: Help for Families on the Edge

 BODY:
New York City has been splintering ever further into separate worlds of rich and poor as economic trends deepen the divisions and government social programs are cut back. Last week, The New York Times Neediest Cases appeal found heartening evidence that some well-off citizens are trying to bridge the gap. At a time when Wall Street is enjoying its biggest boom in years, employees from seven leading Wall Street firms came forward with substantial contributions that put the fund over the $4 million mark. That is the highest figure, at this point in the appeal, since 1992, but it is still well below that year's total of more than $5 million.
Cynicism grips many New Yorkers, who have come to feel that private giving cannot make much of a difference. The people who run the seven charities that receive contributions from the Neediest Cases Fund speak of "compassion fatigue." But the money raised by the fund is desperately needed. More families are showing up at food pantries and emergency shelters. Rising unemployment and layoffs of unskilled workers are throwing more families into crisis, raising doubts about their ability to stay together. 
 With New York City hard pressed to operate its own system of foster care for more than 40,000 children, private charity is essential for the tens of thousands of children who have not yet fallen into the system but are holding on by the barest of threads. Among these families, illness or loss of a job or an eviction can create a crisis. Money contributed to the Neediest Cases Fund can make the difference by providing a poor family with a crib, warm winter blankets, transportation to a health clinic or shoes so that children can go to school.
The charities supported by the Times drive need more than just money. Volunteer help can provide a crucial boost to counseling and mentoring programs for young people and others. Monetary contributions, still critically needed, are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: FIGURE SKATING;
Russia's Tradition Grows Stronger With Sweep in Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 25

 BODY:
When the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991, many close observers of figure skating saw the Cyrillic writing on the wall.
With major economic difficulties, the end of blanket state sponsorship and the exodus of many top coaches and skaters, the tradition of Russian excellence appeared poised to join a lot of monumental Communist statuary on history's ash heap. 
 It has not worked out that way, at least not yet. And as Irina Slutskaya's victory today in the women's competition at the European championships made clear, the Russians are, if anything, more dominant on the European continent in the free-market era. Her lopsided triumph gave the Russians a sweep of all four events in Paris, which is something no other nation -- not even the Soviet Union -- has accomplished since ice dancing was introduced to these championships in 1954.
The Soviet system never produced champion female skaters, but last year, at age 16, Slutskaya became the first Russian to win the title in Sofia, Bulgaria. This year, she still has her flushed cheeks, heart-shaped face and giggly demeanor but looks slightly less confident and powerful. Nonetheless, she was more than solid enough with her seven triple jumps and fine line to win today's free program and defend her title with ease.
Defeating Michelle Kwan of the United States at the world championships in March in Lausanne, Switzerland, could prove considerably more problematic.
"Kwan is above everyone I saw here," said Didier Gailhaguet, director of French skating. "And the level of everyone here except Slutskaya was the weakest I have ever seen at a European championships. It was pitiful."
That is partly because the five-time European champion, Surya Bonaly of France, is struggling after surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles' tendon sustained last May. She finished ninth here after falling on her opening double-lutz-triple-toe-loop combination and making numerous technical errors.
"I'm only about 60 or 70 percent, but I would not have been happy staying at home and watching the others," Bonaly said.
Oksana Gritschuk and Yevgeny Platov had markedly less difficulty making their return to competition. The Russian pair are the defending Olympic and world dance champions and, after missing the early season to allow Platov to heal from knee surgery, they received a total of 12 perfect 6.0's en route to victory. The other Russian winners were Marina Yeltsova and Andrei Bushkov in pairs and Aleksei Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, who rallied from sixth after the short program to win the men's competition.
Of the four champions, only Gritschuk and Platov live and train in the United States.
"Our biggest problem is finding money to pay expenses," said Tamara Moskvina, one of the high-profile coaches who remains in Russia. Over the last five years, she has had to cope with reduced training time for her skaters and poor-quality ice.
"We still have our coaches and capacity and ability," she said. "We simply have had to use more inventiveness now to find solutions."

HEADLINE: Senior Doctors And Nurses See Threats to Jobs

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
As hospitals merge and shrink under pressure from managed care, a large and growing number of senior doctors and nurses have found themselves suddenly dismissed or demoted at the height of their careers.
With their high salaries and roots in old-style medicine, older doctors and nurses are natural targets for hospitals trying desperately to economize, health experts say. And when two hospitals merge, even world-renowned doctors can become redundant. No institution needs two chiefs of cardiac surgery, for example. 
 Health industry experts estimate that thousands of senior staff members -- workers with decades of service -- have lost jobs or their supervisory positions, often forcing them to scramble for health insurance and to search for new jobs.
Some quietly move on. Some swallow demotions and accept lower salaries. And some sue, citing slander or age discrimination. Indeed, complaints of age discrimination from health care workers to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have nearly doubled since 1989, from about 500 to nearly 1,000 in each of the last three years.
The phenomenon is nationwide and cuts across professional lines in the health field. Dozens of senior nurses at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan were forced out of administrative jobs and had to return to bedside nursing -- a task many had left decades before -- after the hospital eliminated the title of senior clinical nurse in 1994. A world-famous transplant surgeon was dismissed as a department head when two Harvard hospitals merged. And a public outcry stopped the dismissals of all six senior child psychologists at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn last fall. They got new jobs instead -- with entry-level benefits and, in some cases, pay cuts of 20 percent.
"We're certainly hearing about this all over, but it's hard to know just how extensive it is," said Janet Coffman, a researcher at the Center for the Health Professions at the University of California at San Francisco. "But it parallels what's happened in other industries. In the 80's, lower-level folks got squeezed; in the 90's, it's upper-level folks and management."
The transplant surgeon, Dr. Anthony P. Monaco, is a case in point. A Harvard Medical School professor, he was dismissed last year as director of the organ transplantation division at the New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, just before the hospital merged with another Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital, Beth Israel Medical Center.
Dr. Monaco, who is 64 and who lost his vocal cords to cancer in 1994, quickly sued for age and disability discrimination.
"I think they felt because I was 64 going on 65, I would swallow this without any questions," said Dr. Monaco. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center called the lawsuit "totally without merit."
Hospitals deny any systematic efforts to weed out senior staff members. But labor lawyers say they see evidence of age discrimination, and union leaders protest that to cut costs, hospitals are dismissing highly paid employees for minor errors.
That has generated a spate of lawsuits and arbitrations, but at the same time, health economists note that hospitals face a genuine quandary.
"Age discrimination should not be tolerated, of course, but I am ambivalent about hospitals' cutting back on high-paid personnel," said Karen Davis, executive director of the Commonwealth Fund, a group that studies both health care and aging. "If you are running an institution and you need to save money, it's sometimes just a matter of, here's the salary we can pay, and you are way above that."
Fay Reynolds, a nurse at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, was dismissed in 1995 after she wrote down the wrong dosing schedule for an antibiotic, ending an otherwise unblemished 25-year career at the hospital. Although the minor mistake was soon caught, the patient was unhurt and his doctor supported Ms. Reynolds, hospital officials dismissed her because, they said, she tried to hide her error. A union arbitration upheld their decision, the officials noted. But Michael Sharp, her lawyer in a slander suit against the hospital, said it had used the incident to jettison an employee making more than $70,000 a year.
"I did my job and loved my job, but in the blink of an eye everything changed," said Ms. Reynolds, 46, who had two sons in college when she lost her job. "They took everything away: my job, my self-respect, my income."
Hospitals defend their disciplinary actions as fair and say cutbacks are necessary to streamline top-heavy managements. They add that some older professionals may find it hard adjusting to new demands that medicine be practiced more efficiently.

Years of Expertise Are Lost in Cutbacks
Whatever the reasons, a number of health experts say the exodus of experienced workers deprives sick people of the expertise that comes from years of practice, and robs young doctors and nurses of mentors.
"This is a quick-fix, shortsighted solution to a budget problem," said Anna Gilmore, director of labor relations for the American Nurses Association. "We're losing the history and knowledge that the older nurses and doctors have."
The numbers work against older professionals. Senior nurses can make more than $75,000 a year, while new nursing school graduates make half that. Nursing technicians, whose duties include checking blood pressures, make $20,000 annually.
"Hospitals are facing a big crunch and one of the only places they can get big savings is by eliminating the high-end nurses," said Howard Berliner, a professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research.
And when major hospitals join forces, it is often simple arithmetic that some department heads must fall. Pam Lawrence, a spokeswoman for Beth Israel Deaconess, said she could not comment on Dr. Monaco's case because of his legal action, but added, "It's a very, very difficult process to go through these consolidations and a challenge to find the right match between people and jobs in the new organization."
Janice Goodman, a labor lawyer, is representing 10 older doctors in the New York City region who have been either dismissed or demoted, including a department chairman and one who ran a huge AIDS program. And she contends that the hospitals' actions represent age discrimination. "I've seen a big rise in these cases in the last six months," she said. "Sure, what's driving this is a cutback of funds, but older workers are very vulnerable."
Most registered nurses and a few doctors are unionized and can be laid off only by seniority. Labor lawyers say hospitals, prevented by union contracts or the fear of bad publicity from dismissing senior employees, often demote them and cut their pay.
Supervising nurses may be transferred to floor duty. Senior doctors may have their salaries cut in half or their labs and titles taken away, or suddenly find themselves required to be on call every third night.
Fay Spragley, a nurse at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, had a senior position training new nurses until July, when cutbacks in the public hospital system "bumped" 500 senior nurses out of their jobs. She now runs a patient ward, a job she dislikes and which involved a $4,000 pay cut, to $57,000.
"I'm so frustrated they have me halfway out the door," said Ms. Spragley, who got advanced degrees and special certifications to become a nursing instructor. "It's all a game to get rid of higher-paid people."

Doctors Losing Titles and Prestige
Senior physicians cannot lose their professorships because they have tenure, but they can lose other titles, as well as the salaries and prestige that go with those jobs.
Dr. Monaco, for example, is still the Peter Medawar Professor of Transplantation at Harvard Medical School and retains the right to operate at the Deaconess. But he has been stripped of the administrative role of division chairman, which he says was the anchor of his career and let him define standards for transplant surgery at the hospital. Although he will lose only about 10 percent of his $220,000 annual income, which depends mostly on seeing patients, he said the dismissal had far-ranging repercussions.
"This certainly harms my ability to get referrals or to raise money," Dr. Monaco said, "and, of course, if I want a young associate, I can't offer him a job."
Dr. Monaco, whose division at the Deaconess does kidney and pancreas transplants, was first asked to step aside so the hospital could "consolidate" all transplant surgery under another doctor, whose division did liver transplants.
When the Deaconess and Beth Israel Medical Center merged last spring, the joint hospital developed an even more ambitious plan: to expand their transplant business by recruiting three liver surgeons from the New England Medical Center.
Officially, Dr. Monaco was dismissed for "disloyalty," after he advised one of those liver surgeons, a former student, that his career would be better served at a different hospital, like Massachusetts General, the Deaconess's archrival.
Dr. Monaco said his dismissal felt like a slap in the face, since he had recently orchestrated a huge research grant for the hospital and two endowed chairs. "I feel that if they can knock out a guy of my accomplishments, everyone in academic medicine has got to feel vulnerable," he said.
Many of those who have been dismissed despite union seniority said that hospitals had used trumped-up charges. "We've had a rash of senior nurses fired for minor incidents that would have gotten a slap on the wrist a few years ago," said Barry Waldman of the New York State Nurses Association.
Barbara Tomasino, a nurse at Mount Sinai Medical Center, was dismissed on July 12, two years short of retirement. The charge: she had given a tiny injection of morphine without a doctor's written order to a patient who had just had a baby, and then failed to discard the remaining morphine promptly, a violation of hospital policy.
Ms. Tomasino declined to comment on the case, as did the New York State Nurses Association, because it is in arbitration.

50 Obstetricians Protest a Dismissal
Fifty obstetricians signed a petition last summer protesting Ms. Tomasino's dismissal. Several current and former doctors at the hospital said in interviews that the nurse had acted appropriately, and added that the hospital's stated desire to trim its nursing budget was partly to blame.
A spokesman for Mount Sinai, Mel Granick, said he could not discuss details of the case because of the arbitration, but he added that the dismissal "involved serious violations of hospital policy. It had nothing to do with her age, seniority or longevity at the hospital."
Ms. Reynolds, the nurse suing St. Luke's for slander, acknowledges an error in recording the antibiotic schedule. And the two nurses who relieved her after her shift acknowledge changing the paperwork to reflect the proper dosing and avoid future confusion. They were also dismissed and have joined her in suing the hospital. In a letter to the hospital, Dr. Jeffrey Arliss, the patient's doctor, called the dismissals a "gross injustice."
Maureen Connelly, a spokeswoman for St. Luke's, acknowledged that "the medication error did not result in an untoward outcome" for the patient. "But the three individuals tried to hide the error and so were terminated for disciplinary reasons," she said.
Abrupt dismissals sometimes leave doctors and nurses without paychecks and insurance. Ms. Reynolds lost her $70,000 job the day her second son entered college. She had to dip into savings and borrow from relatives to pay tuition and rent.
Ms. Goodman, the lawyer, said that some of her clients were so embarrassed by their dismissals that they had not even told their friends. "It's often not so much an issue of pension or benefits but personal pride," she said.

HEADLINE: L. Metcalf Walling, 88, Who Helped Set Labor Policy in New Deal

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
L. Metcalf Walling, a New Deal administrator to whom fell the thorny task of carrying out and enforcing novel concepts like the minimum wage in wartime, which critics predicted would lead to America's economic ruin, died on Tuesday at the Gifford Elder Care center in Randolph, Vt. He was 88 and had lived in Randolph Center, Vt., after a second career overseas.
Mr. Walling was a close aide to Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, whose opponents despised her liberal inclinations as much as they resented her presence as the first woman in the Cabinet. He joined her at Labor in 1938 as administrator of the Division of Public Contracts. 
 His section merged with the Wage and Hour Division and he remained in charge until 1947 as his office gathered powers -- and lawsuits, most of them derailed by the Federal judiciary.
The principal Roosevelt-era laws he worked under were the Walsh-Healey Act, which established labor standards for Government contracts, and the Fair Labor Standards Act and Wage-and-Hour Law, which applied those standards in an often balky private sector.
Mr. Walling dealt with such matters as a national minimum wage (then 40 cents an hour and by no means universal), the work week, overtime payments and health and safety in the workplace. The laws and his rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and with protests that extra pay for overtime was the bane of war production.
But when he left office, Mr. Walling noted that the wage-hour provisions, born amid controversy, had won general acceptance. They had become, he declared, part of a "broad humanitarian program" and a long-term fact of the country's economic life.
Lewis Metcalf Walling was born in Union Village, R.I. He was educated at Phillips Andover Academy and Brown University and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1933. He was the Commissioner of Labor in Rhode Island when Secretary Perkins recruited him.
In the 1950's, the United Nations sent Mr. Walling to Guatemala to rewrite its labor laws, and he headed American aid missions in Cambodia and Colombia. He then worked for the bauxite industry and finally undertook missions for the International Executive Service Corps in West Africa and Tunisia.
He had a lifelong interest in the Waldorf School and anthroposophy movements founded by Rudolf Steiner, the German occultist and social philosopher. His readings with the anthroposophy community in Vermont as a young man led to his devotion to the welfare of working people.
He was chairman of the first American Waldorf School in New York City and remained a member of the board of the Waldorf School Educational Foundation of North America until 1994.
Mr. Walling's first wife, the former Frances Slosson Holliday, drowned in a flash flood in Tunisia in 1972. His second wife, Sydney Parker, died in 1996. An elder son, Lewis Jr., died in Vietnam in 1962.
He is survived by a son, Alexander R. H., of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Judith Parker of Philadelphia; a stepson, Jameson Parker, a film and television actor in California, and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Rodney O. Felder Dies at 69; Finch College's Last President

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Rodney O. Felder, who was the last president of Finch College in New York City and later led Upsala College in East Orange, N.J., died Jan. 19 in Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 69 and lived in Montauk, L.I, until 1994.
The cause was Alzheimer's disease complicated by emphysema, said his brother, Harry L. Felder of Hyde Park. 
 An economist, Dr. Felder headed two private colleges at a time when both were struggling financially. Despite efforts to save Finch, he presided over its closing in the mid-1970's, a decade in which about 150 private colleges shut down. He also faced declining enrollments and economic problems at Upsala, although it remained open until 1995, nine years after he retired.
Dr. Felder was born in the small village of Redwood in the Thousand Islands region of upstate New York, where his father ran a general store. He attended the State University of New York at Albany, and graduated cum laude after a stint in the Army helping to process returning officers. He earned his doctorate at Teachers College at Columbia University.
While at Columbia, he started teaching at Finch, the exclusive women's college on the Upper East Side. After serving as faculty chairman in 1958, he was named dean in 1960, vice president in 1969 and president in 1970.
Finch was founded in 1900 as a two-year finishing school for women. Dr. Felder and others at the school maintained, however, that it had become as academically demanding as Barnard, Bryn Mawr and other colleges.
It was probably best known as the college attended by President Richard M. Nixon's daughter Tricia. Other alumnae include the actresses Arlene Francis and Suzanne Pleshette. Grace Slick of the rock group Jefferson Airplane attended Finch briefly.
When Dr. Felder became the school's president, Finch had fewer than 400 students and a debt that was half a million dollars and growing. Its tuition, room and board came to $4,100, making it one of the most expensive private colleges in the United States at the time. It had a wealthy student body -- some with fashionable addresses in the Caribbean or the south of France -- but little endowment.
Dr. Felder, then a young-looking bachelor who often wore wide multicolored ties and double-breasted jackets, was known to the students and faculty as "Mod Rod."
But if the president was mod, the college was not. Its status as a women's college, its Social Register cachet, its New York City location -- all assets in the past -- increasingly became liabilities in the post-Vietnam era. Despite efforts to raise private contributions, sell its art collection and seek Federal aid, the college remained in financial trouble, and Dr. Felder announced in 1975 that he was suspending operations.
"He did not see Finch's closing as inevitable, and he struggled to save it," said Sara Arthur, a friend, who was director of admissions at Finch. "He looked for a merger partner and worked with the New York State Department of Education. He kept it chugging for longer than he probably should have."
It took him two years to sort through Finch's properties, including its noted art collection and the East Side town houses on East 78th Street where it had operated. Then, in 1977, he moved to Upsala College.
Upsala was very different. It was established in 1893, a Lutheran college of Swedish origin. With 1,600 students, it was four times the size of Finch.
But when Dr. Felder arrived, it was faced with the same soaring costs and shrinking pool of applicants that bedeviled many other private colleges in the 1970's.
Dr. Felder was aware of these problems, but he hoped to devise a strategy to put Upsala on sounder footing. "We are all attempting to work out new marketing methods in order to recruit more students," he said at the time.
But when he retired in 1986, it was still struggling. And though it stayed open for nine more years, it, too, ultimately closed down.
In addition to his brother, Dr. Felder, who never married, is survived by a niece and three nephews.

HEADLINE: How Swiss Strategy on Holocaust Fund Unraveled

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERN, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Early last month, a senior Swiss diplomat sent a confidential cable addressed to only his closest aides. Instead, it was circulated to the country's top politicians and set alarm bells ringing.
According to people who have seen it, the cable led the politicians to believe that American Jewish groups were threatening to orchestrate an array of sanctions if Switzerland did not issue a "declaration of intent" to set up a $250 million fund to compensate the families of Holocaust victims and survivors. 
 Jewish groups, the Swiss politicians concluded from the cable, were poised to organize a boycott of Swiss banks, set up picket lines outside Swiss institutions in the United States, arrange unflattering press coverage and file class action suits if Switzerland did not capitulate by February 1997. It said the Swiss could respond in two ways: be conciliatory or put up hard-nosed resistance.
The Jewish groups mentioned in the cable adamantly deny making such threats and say the proposal for a fund of several hundred million dollars came from the Swiss. But the cable was quickly seized upon by many Swiss politicians and officials, who saw it as evidence of a vast anti-Swiss conspiracy involving Jewish groups, public manipulation, and American financial institutions that stood to benefit.
The President of Switzerland, who received the cable, gave an interview just a few weeks after it arrived in which he accused Jewish groups of engaging in blackmail.
This week, after taking a beating in world public opinion for months, the Swiss Government agreed in principle to establish the fund. But the repercussions will not be easily erased. This country, which is only now coming to grips with its World War II history, has seen a surge of anti-Semitic sentiment in recent weeks that one Jewish leader characterized as an "avalanche."
The dispute over the Holocaust has shaken a Swiss self-image founded on what one official termed this week the "humanitarian traditions of Switzerland."
Switzerland was neutral in World War II. At the center of the dispute between it and the Jewish groups are accusations about this country's wartime conduct.
There have been charges that Switzerland effectively acted as Hitler's banker, laundering gold looted from countries conquered by the Nazis. Questions have been raised about money deposited by Jews later killed in the Holocaust, with suggestions from critics that Swiss banks pocketed the accounts after the war. Finally, there have been documented reports by historians that the Swiss police turned back up to 30,000 Jewish refugees at the country's border, leaving them to face the threat of deportation to the death camps.
The confrontation between the Jewish groups and Switzerland has been building for years. But it turned significantly more rancorous after a luncheon meeting last month in the private dining room of Edgar Bronfman on the fifth floor of the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue in Manhattan.
The main participants -- Mr. Bronfman, President of the the World Jewish Congress as well as of Seagram, Israel Singer, the organization's secretary general, and Thomas Borer, Switzerland's point-man in the conflict with American Jews -- agreed to keep the details of their conversation secret.
At the time, the Swiss authorities were still publicly resisting demands by American Jewish groups for a fund to compensate Holocaust survivors. Pressure was building for punitive measures against Swiss economic interests.
After the Dec. 9 meeting, Mr. Borer cabled to Bern a three-page report. In it, the Swiss diplomat gave a clear impression that the luncheon had become an arena for threats from the World Jewish Congress. The report said that if Switzerland made a "declaration of intent" to create a fund, American Jewish groups would turn down the heat.
Elan Steinberg, a spokesman for the World Jewish Congress in New York, said in a telephone interview that the accusations of threats were untrue. Indeed, he said, the proposal for a specific figure for a Holocaust fund -- put by other American Jewish officials at between $230 million and $300 million -- had come from the Swiss themselves. Moreover, he said, in the view of Mr. Bronfman and Mr. Singer, the meeting ended as it began, on a friendly note. Even Mr. Borer's cable characterized the beginning of the encounter as amicable.
But that is not how it played in Switzerland. According to senior officials here, Mr. Borer addressed his message only to four members of the task force set up by the Swiss Government last year with Mr. Borer at its head to deal with the crisis.
In his view, the document was intended only to set out the options Switzerland faced and was not intended for circulation outside Mr. Borer's immediate entourage, according to officials familiar with his account of events.
Other Swiss officials circulated the report -- and further diplomatic assessments drawing similar conclusions -- among the seven members of Switzerland's Cabinet. Initially, Government ministers kept their knowledge of the document a secret.
In late December, though, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the outgoing President, gave what is usually a routine end-of-term interview by officials as they hand over the rotating presidency to their successor. The text of his remarks was vetted in advance by his press spokesman, officials said. When the French-language Tribune de Geneve newspaper published the interview on Dec. 31, 1996, a storm erupted.
Accusing the World Jewish Congress of "extortion and blackmail" -- words not used in Mr. Borer's report -- Mr. Delamuraz cited the report as evidence of "a formidable political will to destabilize and compromise Switzerland" and a desire in Washington and London to "demolish the Swiss financial center."
He warned, moreover, that his compatriots might display "negative reactions, anti-Semitic reactions." Referring to the onslaught of criticism, he said that "sometimes, listening to some people, I wonder whether or not Auschwitz is in Switzerland." And he added that a Holocaust fund would only make it more difficult to resolve the crisis.
His remarks caused an outcry among American Jewish leaders, who began to talk openly of a boycott of Swiss banks.
Mr. Delamuraz's misjudgment of the likely reaction, according to officials and commentators in Switzerland, was partly a reflection of a deep sentiment among some Swiss that they have been treated unjustly throughout the crisis.
According to Swiss Jewish leaders, the remarks also provided political cover for Swiss anti-Semites to bombard newspapers and Jewish organizations with hostile mail.
"I used to get three or four letters -- anonymous letters - a week from anti-Semites," said Sigi Feigel, a lawyer in Zurich who is honorary President of Zurich's Jewish community. "In the last two weeks I had 350 letters. About 200 of them were supportive, but 50 of them gave the sender's name and address along with remarks about 'typical Jews, greedy Jews.' "
Newspapers, too, received what Jurg Schoch, a journalist at Tages Anzeiger, a Zurich daily, called "ugly letters that revived all the old stereotypes."
Indeed, said Martin Rosenfeld, a lawyer here who is secretary general of the organization representing Switzerland's 18,000 Jews, "We knew there was latent anti-Semitism in Switzerland, but in the last few years we felt accepted and understood as a minority."
Since the remarks by Mr. Delamuraz, however, "a new avalanche is falling on us," he said.
The furor that followed the remarks seems now to have been part of the catalyst that persuaded Swiss leaders to make a critical policy shift and acknowledge that a bold political move was needed to defuse the crisis.
Swiss diplomats, led by the country's Consul General in New York, opened secret negotiations with Mr. Singer, the World Jewish Congress secretary-general, to agree on the text of both an apology by Mr. Delamuraz and a response to it by the World Jewish Congress.
The apology -- effectively blaming Mr. Borer's report for providing "imprecise" information -- was published on Jan. 14 and within hours, as previously agreed, Mr. Bronfman responded, saying he looked forward to restarting a "constructive dialogue" with Switzerland.
But precisely at the time the exchange was being negotiated, another apparently unconnected event overwhelmed Swiss authorities just as they thought they had lowered the temperature.
A security guard, Christoph Meili, came upon a huge shredding operation of files and books under way in the Union Bank of Switzerland -- one of the big three commercial banks whose archives could play a vital role in inquiries supposed to clarify Switzerland's dealings with Nazi Germany and its handling of dormant accounts.
The bank said that the shredding operation had been ordered by an archivist and that it did not involve material related to the Holocaust and had been a huge mistake.
But the incident contributed significantly to a sense among some Swiss diplomats and bankers that the crisis was spinning out of control and that, as Rainer Gut, head of Credit Suisse, put it in a published interview, Switzerland's international credibility faced its sharpest challenge since World War II.
Swiss bank stocks had already dipped and there was a broader fear that the economy -- in trouble after six years of slowdown -- would suffer permanent damage if Switzerland came to be regarded as untrustworthy and even sneaky.
Mr. Gut timed his remarks so that they would appear last Wednesday to coincide with the regular weekly meeting of the Swiss Government. And, in what seemed another choreographed part of the scenario, Mr. Borer met in Zurich the following day with representatives of the country's banks and insurance companies and announced later that a "major step" had been taken: even though it did not commit itself to a financial contribution, he said, the Government would now take the lead in establishing a Holocaust fund to be supported by the banks and insurance groups.
In turn, Mr. Steinberg, the spokesman for the World Jewish Congress, said the latest Swiss actions seemed an indication that moves toward establishing a Holocaust fund were under way.
"This shows my report was right," Mr. Borer said in an aside to a reporter in Zurich on Thursday night.

HEADLINE: John M. Eklund Dies at 87; Led Federation of Teachers

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
John Manly Eklund, who led the American Federation of Teachers in years of political and social upheaval, died on Jan. 11 at the Canterbury Gardens retirement community in Denver. He was 87 and most recently lived in Naples, Fla.
Dr. Eklund was the national president of the teachers union from 1948 to 1952, when the organization confronted divisive problems like the perception that Communists were infiltrating unions and the resistance to racial integration of unions. 
 He then worked as an agricultural administrator and promoted farming cooperatives worldwide. He retired in 1975 as the president of Agricultural Cooperative Development International, which worked with the Agency for International Development to spread such cooperative ventures in Africa and Asia.
Dr. Eklund, who was born in Burlington, Iowa, graduated as an English major in 1931 from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kan., where he was a top athlete. He studied at the Iliff School of Theology and the University of Denver for his master's degrees in theology and education and, years later, received a doctorate in education at Teachers College at Columbia University.
Like his father, he was a Methodist pastor before he entered the Denver school system in 1938 as an English teacher and guidance counselor. His concern about the poor economic standing of teachers in public schools after World War II prompted him to organize for the American Federation of Teachers.
As national president of the union, a member of the American Federation of Labor, he worked to bring balky locals, particularly in the South, in line with A.F.L. rules against racial discrimination in union ranks.
Another issue the union faced then was the battle over state laws demanding loyalty oaths from teachers and barring Communists from school jobs.
Dr. Eklund and the union denounced such requirements.
In 1961 he became the director of education for the National Farmers Union and five years later the executive vice president of its International Assistance Corporation. As president of Agricultural Cooperative Development International, he directed diverse projects to transfer American farming skills to developing countries.
He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Zara Zerbst Eklund; two sons, Gary P., of Goleta, Calif., and Carl A., of Denver, and six grandchildren.

FAY, VALLE WEBER

 BODY:
FAY-Valle Weber. Of Rowayton, CT, who led the efforts to revitalize South Norwalk in the late 1970's and 80's, died Wednesday night in Norwalk Hospital of complications following an emergency operation. Beloved wife of Francis X. Fay, Jr. and loving mother of Valle Gaynor Blake of Brighton, MA, was 77. As Founder and President of the Norwalk Preservation Trust in 1977, Mrs. Fay arranged the educational programs and forums that redirected the focus of Norwalk's urban redevelopment from demolition to rehabilitation. Concurrently, as one of five Norwalk Redevelopment Agency Commissioners, she influenced the agency between 1978 and 1981 to adopt the rehabilitation of the Washington Street Historic District, a project that won two national awards in 1988. Mrs. Fay was one of five cited in the US Department of Interior Historic Preservation Award for the "creative use of contemporary historic preservation techniques." The project was also selected and she was cited for the Downtown Development Award of the Downtown Research & Development Center of NYC, "as a demonstration of public/private partnerships creating a vibrant downtown." "Valle was the inspiration behind the city's approach to restoring the wonderful assets of South Norwalk," said former Mayor William A. Collins, who had appointed her to the Redevelopment Agency. "I don't belive we could have gathered enough strength in the community to support the program without her effort." "Valle was the pivotal person, and her voice was the stongest in saving the South Norwalk heritage despite the tremendous opposition at the time," said Rod Johnson, former Redevelopment Agency Excecutive Director. Mrs. Fay's interest in architectural antiquity had been inspired as a youngster by visits to St. Genevieve, Missouri, 60 miles south of St. Louis. Her paternal ancestors, the LaVallee family, had been among the early settlers in that first white development of Missouri (1735), and had produced three governors general of what was then known as the Louisana Territory. Mrs. Fay was Chairman of the Norwalk Green Historic Commission, Trustee and Secretary of the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum and served twelve years as a member and Vice Chairman of the Norwalk Historical Commission. Mrs. Fay had been Post Master of the Rowayton Post Office from 1961 to 1963. She had been a trainee with the Women's Air Service Pilots (WASP) during WW II. She was cited for her accomplishments in 1995 by Celebrate Women!, a Norwalk organization honoring women's achievements. Mrs. Fay was born in St. Louis on March 5, 1919, and raised in nearby Webster Groves, MO, the only child of the late John A. and Ethel Bass Weber. She was a gradaute of Mary Institute (1936) in the St. Louis area. She also attended Mills and Barnard colleges. She was predeceased in 1969 by a son, Robert E. Blake III. A memorial program will be held at 7 PM, February 2, at the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Norwalk Museum, 141 East Ave., Norwalk, CT 06851, or the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium, 10 Water St, South Norwalk, CT 06854.

THE DIVORCE CULTURE
 By Barbara Dafoe Whitehead.
 224 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
 
 THE FEMININE ECONOMY
 AND ECONOMIC MAN
 Reviving the Role of Family
 in the Post-Industrial Age.
 By Shirley P. Burggraf.
 285 pp. Reading, Mass.:
 Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $24. 
 Both these very different books address the weakening of family bonds and the rising rate of divorce that have marked American life since the 1960's. Both authors can take "family values" seriously by removing them from the tired agendas of right- and left-wing politics and considering them in the light of the social need for parents to cooperate and raise their children. Both face squarely the fact that divorce hurts, and hurts children especially.
The differences between the books, in approach and quality, may be traced to how the authors understand "culture." For Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, culture is like ideology: it advances relentlessly, then entrenches itself and seeps into our consciousness as a system of social and philosophical "ideas." That is what the "divorce culture" has done, and what we need to do is dismantle and "repeal" its "philosophy and language." Ms. Whitehead nods to relevant cultural forces like the emancipation of women, Social Security and technological advances, but the forces don't take hold in the discussion, so her "ideas" exist in a kind of historical, social and economic vacuum. Near the end she suggests that the "pervasive decline" in the marriage ideal has taken place within a larger cultural context, when she writes: "In every other domain of life, Americans are moving away from lasting relationships and toward limited and contingent commitments." But she doesn't analyze the conditions of this context, and because she says she does not want her book to be taken "as an appeal for a return to an earlier era of American family life," she shies away from articulating a counter-culture. This leaves her with the odd, and not rhetorically effective, voice of an ideologue without an ideology.
"The Divorce Culture" might have been a work of moral philosophy that argues for the affective dimension of the structural and instrumental: for instance, the ways in which love is expressed through "reciprocal and binding duties," parents being there for their children, day after day. She argues pointedly that parents' expressive need for liberation and self-fulfillment has been realized at the expense of the well-being of children. But what has created this need? Ms. Whitehead doesn't demonstrate the range or the scholarship for moral philosophy or social history. With her shallow or hidden sources, her tendency to phrasemaking and her pedestrian prose, she has produced a book on roughly the same level as the popular "expert opinion" and self-help books she rightly criticizes. "The Divorce Culture" is a sort of self-blame book.
While Shirley P. Burggraf's focus is primarily "on the economic factors involved in commitment to family," she acknowledges from the outset that the family is shaped by a matrix of forces, including psychological, sociological and historical ones. She agrees, with Ms. Whitehead, that the unraveling of family ties is a central moral issue, but rather than lament the bankruptcy of current ideas about marriage and divorce, she as much as says, briskly and bracingly, that this is where we've come, it's undesirable to go back ("the lost social order . . . was essentially a gender caste system"), so let's figure out a way to literally "reinvest" in the family.
The central problem "The Feminine Economy and Economic Man" addresses is that everyone agrees how important it is to nurture children, but few are willing to put their money where their mouths are. The "feminine economy" -- "the caring economy, the support economy or the family economy" -- is only dimly reflected in economic theories and indicators because relatively low wages, or none, are paid. Yet it is essential work, with enormous "opportunity cost." How then, when women are increasingly entering the marketplace, where their work is valued in pay; when commercial products displace housework; when Social Security displaces the caretaking of grandparents; when computer jobs can be done by women as well as men, "can a market be created . . . that will send the right signals to parents about the social value of investing in children?"
Ms. Burggraf makes a series of practical suggestions, chief among them the creation of a "parental dividend," mostly converted from what we pay now to Social Security, based on a joint marital tax return and distributed among the husband's and wife's parents. Doing this would re-endow "the marriage contract with a portion of the wealth that reproduction generates," "reward those who honor the obligations of marriage and family," encourage parental cooperation and discourage divorce, and retie the generations by privatizing Social Security. This would, in effect, rewrite a social contract, updating classic economics to include and honor the feminine economy. Ms. Burggraf also makes a clear case for raising the pay of teachers, and an interesting defense of school vouchers.
Although I cannot do justice to Ms. Burggraf's argument in this space, she has written an important work on moral economy. While her methods are practical, she aims for a "great moral awakening" to the importance of the family as an economic institution. "In a world in which people are free to choose between caring and competitive roles," she writes, "an economic system that disproportionately rewards the competitors and beggars the caretakers will eventually lose its ability to compete because resources are increasingly diverted away from society's basic function of providing a civilized context for human life."
What is especially effective about her argument is that, unlike Ms. Whitehead, Ms. Burggraf is able to suggest cultural change without recourse to nostalgia. She understands that a culture is not a system of ideas but a convergence of forces that shape ideas. We have not decided to weaken our family bonds because we have lost something, but because the conditions that those bonds require have changed. Quoting Katha Pollitt, Ms. Burggraph urges that we "adapt our institutions to the lives people actually live" rather than the lives they should live. In so doing, she has written an exemplary work of cultural study.

EVERYTHING FOR SALE
 The Virtues and Limits of Markets.
 By Robert Kuttner.
 410 pp. New York:
 A Twentieth Century Fund Book/
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 Every once in a while someone publishes a book that puts forth a sweeping position on the American economy, and it coincides in some magical way with the arrival of a new political moment; thus the book later appears (if you believe that ideas matter in politics) to have set the tone in economic policy for an entire historical period. Examples would be "The Modern Corporation and Private Property" (1932), by Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner Means, published just before the beginning of the New Deal; "The Affluent Society" (1958), by John Kenneth Galbraith, a very early harbinger of the Kennedy-Johnson era of government activism; "The Way the World Works" (1978), by Jude Wanniski, and "Wealth and Poverty" (1980), by George Gilder, two books that presaged and justified Reaganomics; and "The Work of Nations" (1991), by Robert Reich, which called for a good deal of what President Clinton proposed in his first year in office.
None of these books were written by an occupant of the highest rung of prestige within the economics profession. The authors were all best known as public intellectuals, they were writing for a general rather than an academic audience, and they were active participants in the politics of their time. Berle and Means served under Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Galbraith under John F. Kennedy and Mr. Reich under Bill Clinton; Mr. Wanniski and Mr. Gilder have both been players in national Republican politics for years.
Robert Kuttner's "Everything for Sale" is meant to be the same kind of book. Mr. Kuttner is an economics journalist who is conversant with the academic literature on his subject but regards mainstream professional economists warily -- and, in the case of neoclassical economists, with something close to contempt. He is also one of the three founders of The American Prospect, the ambitious new liberal magazine; the two others are Mr. Reich, just retired as Secretary of Labor, and Paul Starr, a sociologist who advised the Clinton health-care reform effort. Mr. Kuttner's milieu, in other words, is one of people who write to affect policy. And "Everything for Sale" is certainly sweeping: it's an attempt to engender a wholesale change in the way the public thinks about government's role in the economy.
Narrowly, Mr. Kuttner's target is the total, and to his mind tautological, intellectual faith in the market-pricing system held by economists of the Chicago school (and by members of two allied scholarly movements in the fields of political science and law -- public choice and law and economics): their idea that whatever is must be optimal if it is the result of the operation of a market. More broadly, Mr. Kuttner wants to dismantle the view that markets essentially work and government interventions essentially don't. It is here that he makes his greatest contribution. By relentlessly piling on example after detailed example of market failure and government success, he gradually makes the idea that all efforts to modulate the market are doomed seem like a blind prejudice that has been holding the nation inexplicably in its grip.
"Everything for Sale" is not a book that provides an intellectual breakthrough by suggesting a new way of resolving the tension between government and the market. What it represents, instead, is Mr. Kuttner pushing indefatigably leftward on the needle between the two, by presenting a massive compilation of evidence in favor of the government side. If you're ever challenged to name "just one thing" the United States Government has ever done right, you'll be fully prepared to answer after reading "Everything for Sale."
There are all sorts of necessary social and economic goods, Mr. Kuttner says, that markets can't be relied upon to provide. Free markets underinvest in pure research, so government needs to finance it, or to structure the economy so that private companies can afford to conduct it. Government made us prosperous by creating the higher education system, railroads, canals, commercial aviation and the Internet. Moreover, markets generate problems -- pollution, dangerous products, economic disasters like bank failures -- so they need to be regulated. Regulation does not retard growth: "The zenith of the era of regulation -- the postwar boom -- was the most successful period of American capitalism." Finally, markets fail to provide all citizens with such essentials as health care, physical safety and basic economic security, so these have to come from government.
Demonstrating an impressive mastery of a vast range of material, Mr. Kuttner lays out the case for the market's insufficiency in field after field: employment, medicine, banking, securities, telecommunications, electric power. This material isn't exactly riveting, but it is presented clearly and convincingly enough to qualify as self-improving reading matter. Then he shows, over and over, how his primary villains, academic free-market ideologues, have pushed society in the direction of abandoning carefully constructed solutions to market failures -- solutions that were working quite well.
What most bothers Mr. Kuttner about the free-marketeers is their tendency to view the world in abstract, quantitative terms. They are "simply virtuosos at the math" who are willfully ignorant of "the rich institutional detail of what has actually occurred." Because, in theory, markets must always work, each specific failure is explained away -- "Anything to save the model!" One of Mr. Kuttner's favorite examples is W. Kip Viscusi's 1984 article arguing that child-safety caps on medicine bottles would inevitably increase child poisonings because parents would leave the caps off, and that the actual decrease in poisonings could be attributed to economic growth, not safety caps.
A secondary set of villains consists of liberals who, especially during the Carter Administration, embraced the cause of deregulation: people like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Ralph Nader, Alain Enthoven, Alfred Kahn, Charles Schultze and Arthur Okun. Because of these people's success in promoting the deregulation of airlines, banking and other fields, Mr. Kuttner says, "by the time Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981, much of the Reagan crusade was pushing on an open door."
Mr. Kuttner, by contrast, is an unapologetic social democrat, a believer in America's moving in the direction of a Western European or Scandinavian-style mixed economy, with a bigger Government, higher taxes and stronger unions. One of the strengths of "Everything for Sale" is Mr. Kuttner's complete lack of the usual tendency in journalists and policy intellectuals to keep the discussion within the frame of the political possibilities of the moment. He wants to change the debate entirely. He insistently attributes our economic problems to political, not market, failure. For example, American blue-collar workers are underpaid, he says, because it isn't skills they lack but political power. Conversely, the solution to most of the market's deficiencies is not fine-tuning but "a redistribution of economic and political power." As Mr. Kuttner explains (in italics), "There is no escape from politics."
The book's subtitle, "The Virtues and Limits of Markets," is misleading: the virtues of markets take up about a hundredth of the discussion. In a few cases, Mr. Kuttner embraces a policy idea that seeks to solve problems through economic incentives rather than direct government control -- for example, public (but not private) school choice, the auctioning of a portion of the broadcast spectrum and the creation of a market in tradable emission rights. On the whole, though, he tends to doubt that any market can really work properly on its own, and to miss what markets are doing right. "The purely financial part of the economy keeps moving further and further away from its ostensible role -- the channeling of capital to the 'real' part of the economy," he writes, at a time when initial public offerings (I.P.O.'s), which channel capital to fast-growing new companies, are one of the hottest areas of the financial markets.
Mr. Kuttner would be quick to point out that the I.P.O. market has the aspect of a casino meant to enrich investment bankers and company founders, not to finance growth -- but markets do have the power to self-correct, in this case by decapitalizing companies that don't deliver on their promise to expand. Complex regulatory regimes, on the other hand, are vulnerable to massive, expensive collapse if one element of the elaborate balance changes. Savings and loans, as Mr. Kuttner explains clearly, were stable institutions inexorably destroyed by the high inflation of the 1970's. The conclusion he draws from this is that we should have got the situation under more complete regulatory control, rather than that such control can be a chimera.
In a cultural or even esthetic way, the tone of a market society bothers Mr. Kuttner; by his lights, for example, there are too many brands of breakfast cereal for sale in supermarkets, and broadcasting would be better if it aspired "to civic and artistic education, or uplift." He is not much alarmed by the characteristic deficiencies of a more regulated society, namely inflexibility and concentration of power. He uses words like "oligopoly" and "cartels" mostly approvingly, and there is a distinct tone of nostalgia in his discussion of the days when AT&T was a monopoly. The citizens who would be most horrified by Mr. Kuttner's views are the Sunbelt small businessmen who give money to Newt Gingrich's political action committee and thrill to his speeches about the coming end of all big structures and centralized authority.
It doesn't look as if "Everything for Sale" is going to fit perfectly with the historical moment of its publication. President Clinton frequently proclaims his centrism; one of the few areas where he has been willing to govern against the tide of public opinion is in appeasing the market gods with policies Mr. Kuttner disapproves of, like free trade.
The mood can change quickly, though, and books like Mr. Kuttner's are one of the things that can change it. It's hard to imagine that markets can become even more intellectually in vogue than they have been over the past two decades, which means that they will probably become less so. As that happens, Mr. Kuttner and his political compatriots ought to attend closely. One part of the social democratic program, the part calling upon government to be a better friend to big business and organized labor, is a far, far easier sell politically than is the part calling for higher taxes and income redistribution. In theory, economic centralization is undertaken only to improve the health, welfare and well-being of ordinary people. In practice, considerable vigilance is required to prevent it from becoming an end in itself, with the main beneficiaries being the big boys.

HEADLINE: Providence Jewelry District Gets a New Luster

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
THE Children's Museum of Rhode Island had a problem: Where in Providence could it find a building large enough to permit expansion, cheap enough so that it could afford it, close to a highway for the convenience of patrons and with ample space for parking?
The solution was the 25-block jewelry district, within walking distance of the heart of downtown and filled with factory buildings that formerly housed the state's jewelry industry. 
 Once brimming with so many jewelry companies that Rhode Island was called the Jewelry Capital of the World, the district went into a tailspin 20 years ago. Higher taxes in Providence prompted some jewelry companies to move to the suburbs. But many more either left the state or closed.
From 1978, when the industry peaked in Rhode Island, to 1996, the number of jewelry workers shrank to 13,500 from 32,500. Once the state's primary industry, jewelry is now No. 3, after health care and tourism.
Left behind in the jewelry district were blocks of huge red-brick factory buildings. The vacant and deteriorating structures, which could be seen from Interstate 95, were a depressing reminder of the industry's woes. They also posed a challenge to city planners, who wondered what they could do with them. "The whole district was desolate," recalled James R. Winoker, a former jewelry manufacturer now in the real estate business in Providence.
The desolation in the district echoed the malaise downtown Providence suffered in the 1970's, when suburban shopping malls and cheaper office space sucked the life out of the city.
Fast forward to 1997. The huge Coro building on Point Street, once home to one of the nation's largest jewelry makers, is now home to Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, a health maintenance organization. The Imperial Knife building, also a former jewelry factory, has been converted to a mix of residential and office space.
The jewelry district is being revitalized. Drawn by abundant parking, interesting space and relatively cheaper rents, an eclectic mix of businesses, arts groups and residents have renovated the former factory buildings. They have given the jewelry district not only a new life but also a new artsy identity.
"We call it Proho," short for Providence's version of SoHo, said David A. Duffy, president of Duffy & Shanley, an advertising and public relations firm that moved into the jewelry district eight years ago. "There's a lot happening here."
Indeed, there are now more than 15 restaurants, bars and nightclubs in the jewelry district when a decade ago there were 2 or 3. More than 20 former factories have been converted into commercial and residential space. And a new, larger Children's Museum of Rhode Island is expected to open in the district this fall. "We had been looking for the right place for two years before we found this," said Janice O'Donnell, the museum's executive director.
The museum's new home is a two-story, 15,000 square-feet brick building with 27,000 square feet of outdoor space, where the museum plans exhibits and parking for up to 80 cars. The museum is paying $650,000 for the property.
In addition to being near Interstate 95, it is close to South Providence, one of the city's poorer neighborhoods, which the museum wants to serve. "It really worked for us," Ms. O'Donnell said.
The jewelry district "has become very popular," said Charles T. Francis, a commercial broker with the Providence real estate firm of Ryan Elliott.
In the last two years, the jewelry district's vacancy rate has dropped from 7.9 percent to 2.6 percent, the lowest rate of eight districts in downtown Providence, according to a survey by Ryan Elliott. Availability of parking, a four-minute walk to the city's core, and rents that are still less expensive than in other parts of the city account for the demand, Mr. Francis said.
Office space in the jewelry district costs $16 to $17 a square foot, compared with $18 to $28 in the city's financial district. The district's revival has also been helped by its proximity to the city's hospitals and the inclusion of the Jewelry District on the National Register of Historic Places on 1985. This designation entitled developers to tax credits for renovating the old factory buildings.
The district has come to life in the last eight years, Mr. Francis said, following a decade when the neighborhood was moribund. At that time, the few people who moved to the jewelry district were considered urban pioneers.
Mr. Winoker, a 65-year-old Providence native, was by all accounts the first person to invest in revitalizing the jewelry district. Mr. Winoker and a partner bought a vacant 100,000-square-foot jewelry factory on Richmond Street in 1977 and converted it into office space. "I knew the location and the value of the location and had faith in the city," Mr. Winoker said.
IN addition to its proximity to downtown, the district is within walking distance of Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, both on the city's affluent East Side.
The jewelry district is three quarters of the way to complete revitalization, according to Thomas E. Deller, the city's deputy director of planning and development.
Mr. Deller and others attributed the district's revival to a committed group of individuals and companies who had faith in the neighborhood's future when faith was scarce. This group, now organized as the Jewelry District Task Force, includes a handful of jewelry companies that have stayed in the district, among them the watchband manufacturer Speidel, a division of Textron Inc. "It is a group of concerned citizens who basically have taken a very personal interest in this neighborhood," said Barbara A. Rossi, Speidel's director of human resources, who has been involved in the task force since its inception.
Ms. Rossi said the dedication of the task force made her feel fond of the community.
"It's a lovely environment," she said.
The state's jewelry industry, meanwhile, has not fared nearly so well as the Providence neighborhood it used to occupy.
Battered by imports and the relatively high cost of doing business in Rhode Island -- the state is known for its high electricity fees and workers' compensation costs -- the industry continues to bleed jobs; jewelry employment fell by 1,500 in the last year alone, according to the state's Department of Employment and Training.
Imports are part of the problem, said James Marquant, president of the Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths of America, a trade group in Providence. Manufacturers complain that designs made in Rhode Island are copied in Asia, where labor is much cheaper, and then sold in the United States for a fraction of the Rhode Island price. But Mr. Marquant also cited fashion trends emphasizing a barer look and the industry's failure to keep up with new technologies and to effectively market itself. "We're not capitalizing on our strengths," he said. These include, he said, a much quicker turnaround time for orders and products of higher quality than the imports coming in from overseas.
Rhode Island still has a higher concentration of jewelry workers than most other states. With at least 400 companies, the state's jewelry industry employs a quarter of the nation's jewelry workers. But its future, all agree, remains unclear. A lot depends on the economy, Mr. Marquant said, adding that when people have more purchasing power, they will buy jewelry.

America's Latest Export: A Stressed-Out World

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. SHWEDER; Richard A. Shweder, a cultural anthropologist, is Chairman of the Committee on Human Development at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
ALONG with Coke, CNN and Visa, stress is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Or at least the word for it is.
In Tokyo, "stress" is enunciated in the midst of a stream of Japanese: "Shujin wa stress ga tamaru to okorippoku naru," a Japanese housewife complains to a friend. ("My husband becomes irritable when stress builds up.") On the streets of Moscow, the term suddenly pops up in the middle of this sentence: "V sostoyanii stress u menya vsyo valitsya iz ruk." ("In this state of stress I can't do anything right.") The English syllable is articulated by Hindi speakers in New Delhi, by Chinese speakers in Taiwan, by Spanish speakers in Seville. "Stress" seems to be on loan to most of the major languages of the world. 
 The history or epidemiology of the spread of the English word "stress" has yet to be documented, although it is a foreign entry -- a borrowed term -- in etymological lexicons for Russian, Polish and Bulgarian and in Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary. The word has even propagated among Anglophobic French speakers in Paris, where it can be found in common usage (etat de stress, syndrome de stress) as well as in the "Dictionnaire des Anglicismes: Les Mots Anglais et Americains en Francais."
From tongue to tongue there are, of course, variations in the voicing and stressing of "stress." In Spanish it is pronounced "ess-TRESS." In Russian "STRESS-a." In Japanese "su-tor-es-u." Nevertheless, "stress," the Anglophonic sounding sound, is quickly becoming an Esperanto answer to all questions about spiritual, mental and physical well-being. How are you? Etat de stress. Esstress. Stressed out.
No one knows exactly how to explain the global success of the word, although it is safe to assume that the contemporary idea of stress was manufactured, patented and labeled in the English-speaking world in the latter half of the 20th century. And it is just as useful as a Visa card and as satisfying as a Coke. But what makes it so useful and satisfying? Why has it been so easy to export in the expanding free market for ideas?
One theory is that although stress may have been discovered here, it is a universal fact, a medically proven hazard in Manhattan, Tierra del Fuego or Katmandu. Thanks to American scientists, the rest of the world is finally catching on to the evils of stress and to the health benefits of a leisure society.
The word "stress" has old roots in a Low Latin word, "strictus," and ancient meanings like "afflict," "punish" and "pull asunder." Soon after World War II, though, the medical establishment began packaging a new concept of stress, the notion that the trials and tribulations of life trigger a physiological "stress response," resulting in measurable physical and mental illness. In 1950, Dr. Hans Selye, an outspoken physician also trained as an organic chemist, proposed that stress consists of physical changes in the endocrine system, including gastric ulceration and an overdevelopment of the adrenal cortex.
In later years, scientists championed other secretions and juices of the body (an increase in catecholamine, a fall in testosterone) as potential signs of a "stress syndrome." (In a similar enterprise, numerous English speaking pop psychologists have tried to translate the existentially laden words we once borrowed from Europe, "Angst," "ennui" and "Weltschmerz," into medical discourse.)
Unfortunately, there may be somewhat less to the medical image of a universal malignant "stress syndrome" than initially meets the eye. Some of the hormonal changes attributed to the "stress response" turn out to be associated with pleasant and health-promoting experiences as well, like sex and sports. And no one has yet traced or verified a true causal connection between secretions of catecholamine (or whatever) and actual human diseases of any kind.
The real rub, however, for the theory that "stress" is popular because it is a prevalent malady is that human beings are amazingly resilient. Only a small minority of those exposed to the fiery ordeals of life, like divorce or unemployment, develop a psychiatric disorder or become sick as a consequence. The most recent comprehensive review of stress, "The Effects of Stressful Life Events on Depression," published in the 1997 Annual Review of Psychology by Ronald Kessler of the Harvard Medical School, begins this way: "Despite ample theories of psychopathology and many associated empirical studies, it is uncertain whether stressful life events promote psychiatric disorders."
Fortunately, there is an alternative theory to explain the international embrace of "stress." The idea, popular among linguists and ironists, is that the word is exquisitely vague and elusive, unlike, say, "Angst," which points to the psyche or "Weltschmerz," which points to the world. When someone says, "I am stressed out," it isn't clear whether the source of suffering is inside or outside, subjective or objective, mental or physical. The cause of stress may be a harrowing event, a tormented mental state, a physiological impairment or just some chronic sense of cosmic uneasiness. No one knows.
 
 
 
Keep the Peace
 Imprecise and evasive language may be a disaster for science but it is a boon in everyday life. "I am stressed out" is non-accusatory, apolitical and detached. It is a good way to keep the peace and, at the same time, a low-cost way to complain.
It was not so long ago in the history of the world that pronouncements of suffering were occasions for making accusations and assigning responsibility. Personal misery was explained by pointing a finger at others or at oneself. This created conflict, guilt and ill will, and it often took time, effort and other scarce resources to make amends.
To say, "I am stressed out," though, is a no-fault verbal gambit. It is far less costly than claiming a nervous breakdown (which places the blame quite literally on one's mental processing system), less costly than Weltschmerz, or disenchantment with the world (which might require political action or even revolution), less costly than making accusations about being ripped off or put down (which might require legal action), less costly than confessing one's sins (which may require religious faith).
That is what makes the expression a ready-made and noncommittal (and indeed noncommittable) response to a variety of unavoidable questions, including "How are you?" "How are things going?" and, by the way, "Why are you behaving that way?"
"Stress" keeps a reputation intact. With a declaration of stress, no one is blamed and the sufferer is viewed as someone who actively copes with the strains and pressures of modern cosmopolitan living -- the kind of person who drinks Coke, watches CNN and carries a Visa card.

Transplant Surgery As a Kind of Contest

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"The Man With the Golden Hands" touches on the touchy matter of how the public, the press and the profession put pressure on doctors to try, or to hold back from trying, new and risky operations. But the program, the first of four about transplant surgery under the title "Knife to the Heart," doesn't cut very deep.
The focus tonight is on Dr. Christiaan Barnard, the South African surgeon who was turned into a celebrity in 1967 when he did the first human heart transplant. As this beat-by-beat account reminds us, the procedure was successful, but the patient died soon afterward. And that remained pretty much the situation in the next two years as surgeons around the world hastened to try their hands, not all golden, at it. One doctor attributes their race to egoism and nationalism. 
 In tonight's episode, the British producers, who go in for some dramatizing and other news-magazine techniques, give particular attention to Dr. Barnard's romantic exertions. (That's Gina Lollobrigida, fans.) His wife recalls deciding, "I must get rid of this guy." Dr. Barnard, interviewed at length, is frank about his medical and domestic missteps. More significantly, the program reports on progress in finding organs and preventing their rejection by the body. You can also hear cliche-clogged interviews with the widows and nurses of heart recipients. And that person dressed up like a surgeon who appears at the start and end of the hour is the narrator, Connie Chung. Next week, kidneys.

'The American Experience'
'Hawaii's Last Queen'
 PBS, tonight at 9
 (Channel 13 in New York)
Lydia Kamakaeha Liliuokalani may not be a household name in American history, but as tonight's offering from "The American Experience" tells the story, she played a prominent if passing role in the United States annexation of the Hawaiian Islands at the turn of the century.
Liliuokalani was Queen for something more than a day (about two years), but by the time she inherited the throne from her brother, King Kalakaua, in 1891, it had become clear that in Hawaii sugar ruled. With the arrival of cane-field workers from Japan and China (some carrying smallpox), the Hawaiians had become a minority in their own land. Economic and political power was closely held by white plantation owners, many of them the children of missionaries who had converted much of the country to Christianity and outlawed the hula. God and mammon seemed to be in cahoots.
Vintage pictures evoke the years of America's exercise in colonialism. Liliuokalani, who abdicated when faced with a company of marines, wrote in her diary, "May heaven look down on these missionaries and punish them for their deeds." Kalakaua, who reigned much longer, was a far more colorful figure, given to high living even as he tried to defend Hawaiian independence and traditions against overwhelming pressures. He is remembered for bringing back the hula.
As for "Hawaii's Last Queen," no one tonight has an unkind word to say about her, except perhaps that she wrote "Aloha Oe," the song we've had to listen to in every movie ever made about Hawaii.

HEADLINE: In America;
A Loss of Nerve

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"What a century it has been!" said President Clinton at his inauguration last week. "America became the world's mightiest industrial power, saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war, and time and again reached across the globe to millions who longed for the blessings of liberty.
"Along the way, Americans produced the great middle class and security in old age, built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all, split the atom and explored the heavens, invented the computer and the microchip, and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African-Americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women." 
 It was the greatest, cockiest run in the history of the world. But why are we at such loose ends now? For most of the century the United States had the energy and exuberance and impertinence of youth. We didn't just fight and win wars, we invented Hollywood and rock 'n' roll, and made jazz one of the great art forms of the world. We hit home runs and stole bases and hollered at the umpires. We drove fast, played hard and laughed long into the night. We had nerve.
What happened?
You got no sense from Mr. Clinton's speech that we are in for a similar run across the 21st century. For the moment, at least, we seem exhausted, rudderless, disoriented. Our great dreams have given way to a corrosive apprehension. The descendants of the soldiers who got in Hitler's face are afraid to ask their bosses for a raise.
Mr. Clinton did not address this in his speech, but Robert Reich, in his last major address as Labor Secretary, hit the matter head on. As America continues to prosper, there is less and less of a sense that everybody has a stake in what is going on. More and more Americans are being left out. The folks at the top are doing breathtakingly well. But the large mass in the middle has been forced to work harder and harder (two jobs, three jobs, four) just to stay in place. Those at the bottom are falling out of sight.
(Recent very modest wage increases are filling the elites with fears of inflation. But at the same time, the inequality in earnings continues to widen.)
"The remarkable thing about the first three decades after World War II," said Mr. Reich, "is that prosperity was widely shared. Most people in the top fifth of the income ladder saw their real incomes double and so did most people in the bottom fifth. Broadly shared prosperity -- the assumption that we were all in this together -- highlighted and fortified something about the character of America that was the envy of the rest of the world."
That is now the stuff of nostalgia. Broadly shared prosperity is gone. What is left is great uncertainty and a sense of faintheartedness.
In an appendix to his speech, Mr. Reich wrote: "From the 1950's through most of the 1970's the income of the poorest fifth of Americans grew faster than the income of the top fifth. Between 1950 and 1978 the inflation-adjusted family income of the bottom quintile grew by 138 percent, while the real income of the richest 20 percent of families grew by 99 percent."
But between 1980 and 1995, he noted, the inflation-adjusted earnings of adults in the highest brackets rose by 10.7 percent while the median worker's wages fell 3.6 percent and those in the lowest brackets saw their wages decline by 9.6 percent.
Mr. Reich wrote: "Wealth is even more unevenly distributed than income. Not only does the richest 20 percent of the United States hold the bulk of the total wealth, but over the period from 1983 to 1992, this group received some 99 percent of the total gain in wealth."
You cannot sustain the American dream with those kinds of numbers. And the greatness of America is inextricably linked to the maintenance of the dream. The House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt, in a speech Friday before the Economic Policy Institute, referred to the widening gap between working families and the well off as the nation's "one unacceptable problem."
America's great challenge as we move into the endgame of the Clinton-Gingrich era is to find new leadership that will point the way to honest solutions.

Democrats Search for Life Of Their Party

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
NIBBLING on chunks of cheese, waiting for the speeches to begin, the lobbyists traded stories. One told of how he had received a personal phone call from the party chairwoman, imploring him to attend. Another reported that he had bargained the ticket price down from $500 to $250.
"I probably could have gotten in for $50," he said, laughing ruefully at the thought. 
 On a recent chill evening, the New York State Democratic Committee held a fund-raiser in the Grand Salon of Manhattan's Essex House hotel. Even the dim lighting and the faux drawing-room elegance of the "salon" could not conceal the fact that this was a decidedly modest affair. About 75 people were in attendance, and of those, several were elected officials attending for free.
When the state's highest-ranking Democrat, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, addressed the group in his funereal baritone, the best he could muster on the state of affairs was: "This party is afloat."
Others use terms more like "adrift." New York's Democratic Party may finally be free from debt, but it is still very much a party on the outs -- outspent, out of power, and by the account of some of its own members, out of ideas. And even though registered Democrats in the state continue to outnumber Republicans by a margin of 3 to 2 -- in New York City, it's a margin of 5 to 1 -- Democrats speak openly about how difficult it will be to win back Gracie Mansion this fall, or the Governor's Mansion next year.
Fred Siegel, a professor of history at Cooper Union who describes himself as a "Democrat with frayed allegiances," put the party's problems this way: "It's not so much the Republicans have risen, as the Democrats have collapsed."
THINGS have looked pretty bleak for the Democratic Party for more than two years now, ever since then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was defeated byGeorge E. Pataki.
For 12 years, Mr. Cuomo had run the state's Democratic Party as a personal fief, installing his own operatives in its offices and doing little, many in the party muttered, to help candidates other than himself. When he went down, he left the party without much in the way of infrastructure as well as more than half a million dollars in debt.
"Those years," the party's current chairwoman, Judith Hope, said delicately, "were not used well in terms of strengthening the party at the local level."
Over the last two trying years, the party has managed to pay off its creditors and gradually to build up a war chest. It has also staved off further declines, a good sign, according to its leaders: since the Democrats didn't lose ground in races last fall, they are really making progress.
And if the party still lacks executive power, they say, it is busy laying the groundwork for future glory, doing the kind of local organizing that was too long neglected.
"This is the new Democratic Party," Mr. Silver declared at the recent fund-raiser. "It comes from the grass roots."
In light of the glaring problems facing New York Democrats these days, it is, however, easy to be skeptical of these arguments, which sound suspiciously like a new version of an old routine:
The party isn't dead. It's just resting.
THE most obvious problem for Democrats in New York right now is, awkwardly enough, the state's relative sense of well-being. The crime rate is down; key economic indicators are up. And as former Senator Bob Dole can attest, it's tough to make a case against an incumbent, even a not terribly popular one, when voters feel they are better off than they were four years ago.
But that's not the only problem. To the extent that Democrats have come up with a critique of Republican rule in New York, the critique often has a defensive, even ad hoc quality to it, sounding as if it were opposition for opposition's sake. Cut government services less, Democrats say. Or cut different services. Or don't lower taxes so much. Or lower different taxes.
Nor does one get the sense, listening to many of the state's most prominent Democrats, that they have really grappled with the underlying causes of their losses.
"The problem for the Democratic Party is people have turned away from government," Mr. Siegel observed. "And New York's Democratic Party, particularly in the city, remains first and foremost a party of government."
At the Essex House fund-raiser, Assembly Speaker Silver described the Democratic agenda for the coming months as fighting budget cuts proposed by Governor Pataki.
"The Governor has brought a lot of us together again," he said, looking out over the lobbyists around the cheese table.
After he spoke, one longtime Democratic operative predicted that by the end of the legislative session, the Governor's popularity probably would have declined. But so, too, he added, would the Democrats'.

HEADLINE: Fueled by Anger, Headed for the Border

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Dean Noble may live in Connecticut, but he no longer buys gasoline there. On a recent trip into Manhattan, Mr. Noble waited until White Plains to fill his tank.
"I feel so strongly about this, I'll risk running out of gas just to come to New York to buy it," Mr. Noble, a 37-year-old film director, said, estimating that he saved $3 with each out-of-state fill-up. 
 Mr. Noble is part of a growing exodus of drivers who cross state lines to buy their gas and avoid paying Connecticut's gasoline taxes, at 43 cents per gallon the nation's highest and 13 cents a gallon higher than New York's.
As recently as 1990 the gas taxes here were lower than in New York, but sharp, regular increases pushed the Connecticut taxes ahead of New York's in 1992, and a 1993 law set more increases, including four penny-a-gallon increases last year and another one this Jan. 1.
This rat-a-tat-tat of increases, the informal boycott and a campaign by service station owners have led officials here to talk of a gas tax revolt and to make reducing the taxes the top priority of the new legislative session.
Taxes aside, the price of gas has been higher than at any time in years, adding more pressure to reduce the state's gas taxes, which include a 39-cent excise tax and a 4-cent gross receipts tax.
Connecticut's gas prices are surpassed in this country only by Hawaii's, according to a survey releases this month by the American Automobile Association.
"People are outraged by this tax," said State Representative Carl J. Schiessl, a Windsor Locks Democrat who is co-chairman of the Legislature's tax policy committee. "The question is no longer whether we cut the gas tax, but how we're going to do it."
Connecticut is not alone in its concern that taxes may send residents flocking to neighboring states. Last week, New York had a temporary moratorium on its sales tax in a bid to stop people from crossing the Hudson River to shop in New Jersey, where there is no sales tax on clothing.
The growth of Connecticut's gas taxes can be traced to 1983, when the Mianus River Bridge in Greenwich collapsed, killing three people. The following year, the state established a special transportation fund to address problems with bridges and roads, and the gas tax was designated its primary revenue source.
Since then, the state has spent more than $13 billion on roads and bridges, and as the program has grown, the gas tax has grown with it.
A report last month by a nonpartisan think tank, the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, chronicled the path of the excise tax on gas: it was 14 cents in 1984, 22 cents in 1990, and is now 39 cents.
The New York gasoline taxes of about 30 cents have increased by a nickel since 1990. New Jersey's taxes of 14.5 cents have remained virtually unchanged for seven years.
Michael Meotti, the Connecticut council's president, listed two reasons for Connecticut's increase. One was the cumulative growth of the debt from the 20-year bonds used to finance the state's road repair program. The other was the state's budget problems in the late 1980's and early 1990's. At that time, the Legislature increased the gas tax to pay for things like fringe benefits for Transportation Department employees and the operating budget for the state police, Mr. Meotti said.
Given the increases, the movement to reduce gasoline taxes was "probably inevitable," the council's report concluded.
The aversion to Connecticut gas prices can be seen starkly at service stations near the borders.
One recent morning, Robert Springer, a retired teacher, picked up his car from Arcouette Auto Center in Enfield, where it had been repaired, but he declined an offer to fill the tank. "I try to plan my trips so that I buy my gas over there," he said, gesturing to the Massachusetts state line less than a mile away.
Tim Arcouette, whose family owns the station, was sympathetic. "I don't blame you," he said, admitting that his brother had recently bought fuel for their tow truck in Massachusetts.
Over the next hour, only one car pulled in for gas. Mr. Arcouette's father, Ed, 70, the business's founder, said that five years ago there would have been a steady stream of cars at the pumps.
"Even our most devoted customers are starting to go by the wayside," he said. "They've all gone down the road."
Seven-tenths of a mile down Maple Road, 20 feet over the border in Longmeadow, Mass., eight cars with Connecticut plates were lined up for gas at Mimi's Mobil. A gallon of regular unleaded cost $1.35, a dime less than at Arcouette's.
The taxes, which are estimated to cost the average driver about $200 a year, are much heavier than in other Northeastern states.
Connecticut's gas taxes of 43 cents per gallon compares with 29 cents in Rhode Island; 21 cents in Massachusetts, and 30 cents in New York, the economic policy council said.
The automobile association's January report showed that the average price for a gallon of unleaded was $1.50 in Connecticut, $1.40 in New York, $1.37 in Rhode Island, $1.34 in Massachusetts and $1.23 in New Jersey.
A lawyer in one Hartford suburb, who had just returned from a visit to New York City, said she was shocked to discover that her neighborhood gas station charged more for gas than a full-service station in midtown Manhattan.
While proposals to cut the tax foundered last year, five bills to reduce it have already been offered this year, two weeks after the session opened. The Senate Democrats, who a few years ago approved the tax increases that recently took effect, now favor cutting it.
And Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, who was largely silent on the gas tax in his first two legislative sessions, began this one by decrying it as "highway robbery."
This turnabout in the political climate is partly a result of the lobbying campaign orchestrated by service station owners. They have organized town meetings with elected officials, called radio shows and posted fliers on gas pumps across the state.
The taxes are not a large part of the state budget. Last year, they raised $460 million, a little less than 5 percent of state revenue. With the state projected to have its sixth straight surplus this year, lawmakers said there should be adequate resources to cover a reduction.
Still, some lawmakers think that cutting the gas taxes does not make sense. State Representative David H. Pudlin, a Democrat of New Britain, said the proposed reductions would probably be so small as to have no real impact on people's pocketbooks and offer little benefit to the economy.
"Gas prices go up and down a few cents every day," he said. "A cut in the gas tax is not necessarily something that people will notice."
Mr. Meotti noted that money from the gas taxes had had a clear impact. The Federal Government in 1994 studies ranked Connecticut's roads and bridges as being in better condition than elsewhere in the Northeast, he said. Thirty-one percent of Connecticut's bridges were found to be deficient, compared with 46 percent in New Jersey and 63 percent in New York.
Many Connecticut drivers have restructured their lives to avoid buying gas in the state. While buying fuel at a Mobil Station on the Hutchinson River Parkway in White Plains, Felix Benitez, who lives in Bethel, Conn., and works as a doorman in Larchmont, N.Y., explained, "When I leave for work in the morning, I only put the littlest amount in -- only what I need to get to the New York border. Then I come here to fill up the rest of the tank."

HEADLINE: Voice of Britain, First Thing Each Day

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine a more convincing example of one broadcast's impact on its own culture than the one that recently emerged about Britain's leading news program.
In a new book on postwar politics, the historian Peter Hennessy reported that he had discovered the procedure that the commander of a Royal Navy submarine somewhere in the depths of the North Atlantic was officially counseled to follow to find out whether Britain would have survived a nuclear strike. 
 As the final step before opening sealed orders on retaliation, the skipper was to tune in to the BBC and listen for the network's "Today" program. "If the Trident commander could not pick up 'Today,' that would be that," Professor Hennessy wrote.
"He would then have to decide whether to launch the missiles or go off to New Zealand. He would know that there was no point in going back to base."
Many Britons -- at least those four million who tune in to the program each morning -- would not quarrel with that definition of the show's indispensability to British life.
More than any other news program, it sets the agenda for public discussion in a country with a particular appetite and talent for debate. The Evening Standard recently called the program "the unacknowledged legislator of 1990's Britain," while its most famous host over 40 years, Brian Redhead, called it the best way of "dropping a word in the ear of the nation."
The current hosts of "Today," the nimble John Humphrys, Sue MacGregor and James Naughtie, are as well known here as the anchors of network newscasts are in the United States, and they labor under at least two disadvantages in that comparison: They are on radio, not television, and their program is broadcast at 6:30 A.M.
The major figures in public life clamor for the chance to appear on the program, even though it means a bracing encounter with aggressive interrogators and a ride across London to the Broadcast House studios in the predawn hours or a remote feed truck parked in their driveways in the middle of the night.
Contrary to prevailing trends on radio and television, "Today" has made its content increasingly serious in recent years, and manages to be contentious without descending to "Crossfire"-type slugging matches.
Politicians from Britain's two biggest parties have smarted from the sharper-edged questions, and, in a series of attention-getting episodes, set out to discredit their tormenters, though always unsuccessfully.
"They've learned that when you lose your temper that early in the morning, you lose," said Justin Everard, a spokesman for "Today."
"Grown-up politicians like a tough interview," said Mr. Humphrys, who is the most prosecutorial in style of the three hosts -- known in this country as presenters. Last month, when Prime Minister John Major wanted to address his falling fortunes in a BBC interview from his home, he requested that Mr. Humphrys be the questioner. Margaret Thatcher, Mr. Major's predecessor, used to call in to the show, and she judged the mettle of her ministers by how well they held their own against the combative "Today" presenters.
"Of course we get letters saying you were hard on so-and-so," Mr. Humphrys noted. "You got it wrong and all that kind of thing. But when it comes to our attitude to the politicians -- especially the politicians -- the message overwhelmingly is, 'Don't let the bastards get you down; stick it to them.' In fact, we want you to be tougher."
Seated around the kidney-shaped table in Studio 4B, their early-morning cockpit, his two colleagues nodded in agreement. "The audience expects it of us, much more than Americans do," Ms. MacGregor said.
Americans might see their methods as verging on hectoring, but "the British would feel betrayed if we didn't ask tough questions," Mr. Naughtie said.
And while an abortive attempt was made some years ago to transform "Today" into a television program, the hosts have resisted the idea.
"There's a kind of radio culture of discussion and journalistic sharpness with words that we've kept going," Mr. Naughtie said. "There's a huge tradition in this country of listening to speech radio."
"It has a directness," he added, "that makes bluffing quite difficult."
The three hosts rotate through the six-day-a-week schedule so that two of them are on every morning. They have a jocular camaraderie on the air, but also consider themselves surrogates for their no-nonsense-please listeners, the people who fill letters-to-the editor columns with laments signed "Disgusted of Cheltenham" and the like.
On a recent morning, the program had a typical mixture of subjects: business and sports reports, the reviews of the morning papers and the interviews -- a Labor Party victory in an off-year election, proposed new restrictions on combat knives, a tuition increase at the London School of Economics, a meeting of European leaders in Dublin, overcrowding in British prisons, the effects of the embargo on Iraq and the newspaper-circulation war between The Times and The Daily Telegraph.
The interviewing is civil, articulate and often contrarian. When Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, took his seat prepared to argue that his paper's increased circulation stemmed from its improving quality, Ms. MacGregor began the questioning by saying, "Now it's really the price cuts, isn't it?" The hosts cannot abide wordy responses, and will not hesitate to cut off a windy guest.
"The most exasperating thing for us and for the listeners," Mr. Humphrys said, "is to allow the interviewee to ramble and obfuscate." When a harried Cabinet member accused him of having interrupted 32 times in 10 minutes, Mr. Humphrys rushed to correct him. It was only five minutes, he said.
Each of the interviewers will let listeners know when they find an assertion far-fetched, which is often. Sometimes, it's a particularly skeptical tone of voice, other times it can be a times-up declaration.
"Oh, come on," is one of Mr. Naughtie's favored phrases.
This particular morning, Mr. Humphrys was wrapping up an interview with Graham Barton, managing director of Battle Orders, a mail-order source for combat knives.
Mr. Humphrys: "All right, here's a suggestion for you. How about stopping selling them?"
Mr. Barton responded: "I'd happily stop," he said, "if there was any link that could be put forward to say that one of the knives that I have sold over the course of the last 20 years has been used in an incident."
Mr. Humphrys: "Oh, that is preposterous, you have no way of knowing whether they've been used or not, have you? Do you know every single person who has ever bought a knife from you ?"
Mr. Barton: "Neither does anybody else selling knives, John."
Mr. Humphrys: "Well, I've already suggested you could stop selling them altogether, but there we are, Graham Barton. Thank you very much."
Mr. Humphrys was a local newspaperman in Wales before joining the BBC in 1966. He covered Northern Ireland and had a series of overseas assignments before becoming, in 1971, the network's first full-time television correspondent in the United States. He later went to South Africa and returned to London in the 1980's as a broadcast host.
Ms. MacGregor, lately from England, was raised in South Africa. She has spent her entire career in broadcasting, serving as host for 15 years of a BBC program called "Woman's Hour." Though her questioning can be persistent, her timber is soothing and her diction exacting, and those traits have earned her a nickname she abhors, Nanny to the Nation.
Mr. Naughtie -- the "gh" is pronounced like a "k" -- is from Scotland, something that is immediately apparent when he speaks. He has never met an "r" he couldn't roll and has a love for gripping consonants. After his studies at Aberdeen University and journalism courses at Syracuse University, he became a newspaperman in Scotland, moving to London in 1977 to cover politics for The Scotsman and then The Guardian. He joined the BBC in 1988.
The "Today" program coexists with some charming BBC anachronisms. Half an hour before the show, listeners are treated to the Radio 4 medley, a sprightly orchestral collection of "Early One Morning," "Men of Harlech" "Danny Boy" "Scotland the Brave" and, with drums rolling, "Rule Britannia." There is an agricultural report, a feast of regional accents from all over the British Isles, and a shipping forecast from some of the most poetically named spots on earth -- Ronaldsway, Malin Head, Baily, Rockall, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, German Bight, Humber, Finisterre, Sole.
During the two and a half hour program, there are pauses for a prayer for the day and a thought for the day. Birthdays of the Queen and her immediate family are noted with best wishes and happy returns.
The show is criticized for its preoccupation with politics and its relative lack of interest in literature, science, technology and the world of ideas. Like the British press in general, it is London-centric and pays scant attention to concerns outside this area. There are periodic suggestions of changing the mix, but at the BBC, formulas, particularly those perceived to be working, stay fixed.
Professor Hennessy, in reporting his discovery of the "Today" program's role in Britain's military planning, called it "a final if macabre tribute to a broadcasting service sans pareil."
He also noted that one of the voices a commander was to listen for in particular was the regionally idiosyncratic one of Mr. Naughtie. It was left to The Daily Mail the next morning to write a fitting epitaph. "When Naughtie falls silent," the paper said, "the end is nigh."

HEADLINE: Block Legalization of Casinos

 BODY:
Legalizing casino gambling is a lot like betting against the house. Promises of windfall riches are seductive to states. But by the time the risks are revealed, there will be no way to dismantle the gambling trade or pay for the social and economic costs gambling imposes on weakened communities.
The New York Legislature is poised to vote a second time on a state constitutional amendment to legalize gambling. The Legislature approved the measure last year. If it does so again this year, a statewide referendum on the issue will be placed before voters on the November ballot. 
 The Senate is expected to vote on the question tomorrow, with the Assembly considering the issue in February. It is not clear that the amendment has sufficient support to pass either house. But lobbying efforts by business interests in areas where casino gambling would be allowed -- Niagara Falls, the Catskills, Buffalo and Lake George -- have been intense. Though few legislators are gambling boosters, many may yet be convinced by spurious arguments that New York should snatch gambling dollars from New Jersey and Connecticut, or that casinos on Indian lands justify expanding gambling elsewhere.
The actual costs and benefits of legalized gambling are hard to quantify. Experiences in states such as Illinois, Indiana and South Dakota suggest that gambling does little for economic development, but creates costs for law enforcement and social services that outweigh economic benefits from the casinos. New York cannot afford to take a gamble that has paid off in very few places, if any.
The argument that the existence of casinos on Indian lands should open the gates to non-Indian casinos is equally wrong. The only Indian-run casino in New York, Turning Stone, was created by a compact drawn between the state and the Oneida tribe under the Federal Indian Gaming Act of 1988. Turning Stone does not have slot machines -- considered by many experts to be the most addictive form of gambling -- and it does not serve alcohol. The constitutional amendment would allow slot machines, and would not prohibit alcohol at the new casinos. Future expansion of Indian-run establishments may be limited by a Supreme Court ruling on Indian gaming rights delivered last year.
Some legislators now say they will approve the measure solely to get the issue to the voters in November. That is an abdication of legislative duty. Legislators are paid to deal with the merits of legislation, not to pass the buck to voters. It would be absurd to unleash a massive campaign by the pro-gambling forces to influence voters if these lawmakers believe that gambling is bad for New York. Legislators who vote for this measure will give gambling their approval, regardless of their twisted efforts to squirm out of that position.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Syria And Israel

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The head of Syria's delegation in the peace talks with Israel says that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made a commitment to withdraw from all of the Golan Heights as part of a peace agreement -- and that his successor, Shimon Peres, reaffirmed the commitment.
Walid al-Moualem, the Syrian Ambassador to the United States, made that among many points about the negotiations in an interview just published in the Journal of Palestine Studies. His comments are an unusually detailed statement of the Syrian view. 
 The Ambassador said that in January 1996 the talks with Israel were going so well that the two sides set a deadline of June "to close the remaining gaps," with the expectation that "by September the final document would be ready." Then Mr. Peres called early elections, terrorist bombs struck Israel and the Syrian-Israeli negotiations were suspended.
The interviewer, Linda Butler, managing editor of the Journal, asked Mr. al-Moualem "through what medium" Mr. Rabin had conveyed his withdrawal offer. He replied, "I prefer not to say." But he said the offer was repeated in the negotiating room at the Wye Plantation in Maryland. "And I told Dennis Ross [the American facilitator in the talks]: 'Please register what the Israeli side said.' "
Because the aim was "a comprehensive agreement," Mr. al-Moualem said, the parties did not sign points agreed but deposited them with the Americans until all the issues had been resolved. The main matters to be negotiated apart from the Syrian demand for total withdrawal from the Golan were security arrangements and normalization of relations.
Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israeli Ambassador in Washington played a significant part in the talks, took a very different view of what happened when I telephoned him. He has returned to a professorship in history at the University of Tel Aviv.
"There was no agreement" on withdrawal, he said; "there was no commitment, there was no promise." If Mr. al-Moualem heard something from someone on the Israeli side, Mr. Rabinovich said, "it was not deposited with the Americans." As for finishing an agreement by September if the talks had continued, he said: "I don't think this would have happened."
What really occurred, Mr. Rabinovich said, was that Mr. Ross and other American participants, seeking to bridge the gap, were given to understand by the Israelis that full withdrawal "was in the realm of the possible" -- but only if Syria met Israel's needs on security and normalization. And "the Israeli conditions were never met."
Ambassador Rabinovich called the al-Moualem interview "a very interesting document, the most explicit and detailed Syrian comment on these negotiations."
Mr. al-Moualem said Prime Ministers Rabin and Peres both "wanted to achieve a settlement with Syria, but each had his own speed and conditions. Rabin was reluctant, suspicious, very cautious. He moved very slowly, inch by inch. When Peres became Prime Minister, he was in a hurry." Mr. Rabinovich said he agreed that "Rabin was too slow and Peres too quick."
On security issues, Mr. al-Moualem underlined Syrian rejection of Israel's proposal for a ground station in the Golan after withdrawal. "We would refuse," he said, "even if it would be manned by Americans."
On normalization, he said totally open economic relations would not work when Syria had a per capita income of $900 a year and Israel $15,000. He said the parties had discussed "a transitional period during which we could raise our economy to the level where there can be competition without undue hardship on our society."
The interview makes clear how bleak the prospect is now for the Israeli-Syrian talks. Mr. al-Moualem said Syria was ready to resume them if the new Israeli Government of Benjamin Netanyahu recognized "the commitments made by the previous Governments." Mr. Netanyahu, who has opposed withdrawal, said only last week that the Golan was "critical to the defense of the state of Israel."
"Nothing can compensate the Syrian people for losing one inch of the Golan," Mr. al-Moualem said. "Not even the moon. It is a sacred cause. . . .
"That is where we stand. The American efforts are now focused on the Palestinian track. We don't mind. We are not in a hurry."

HEADLINE: Aid Cuts Put College Beyond Reach of Poorest Students

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
As state governments keep whittling away their support for higher education, tuition at public institutions is likely to continue rising as financial aid shrinks, moving college further beyond the reach of poor students, education experts say.
"There has been a redistribution of educational opportunity," said Thomas G. Mortenson, a higher education policy analyst in Iowa City and a senior scholar at the National Council of Educational Opportunity Associations in Washington. 
 To some experts, New York State is a case in point. Earlier this month, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed to increase tuition at New York's public universities by $400 a year and reduce state aid for the state's neediest students. Tuition at both the State University colleges and City University would rise to $3,600 a year at CUNY's four-year colleges and $3,800 a year at SUNY's.
Governor Pataki's proposals are not certain to be adopted; the Legislature rejected similar cuts last year. But experts say that higher tuition and reduced aid are inevitable.
"It's not this 400 bucks that Governor Pataki is proposing, it's the general pattern," said Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University.
At the City University of New York, which charged no tuition until 1976, tuition now accounts for 43 percent of the four-year college's budget, up from 19 percent seven years ago, CUNY's current budget proposal shows. Students there say any increases strain their stretched personal budgets.
"If tuition goes up, I don't think I will have to drop out, but it will not be pleasant," said Michelle Whitfield, a 34-year-old Harlem resident who is a voice student at Brooklyn College's Conservatory of Music.
She works 30 hours a week as a temporary worker doing word processing on Wall Street to pay for college and to support herself and her elderly mother. She earns too much to qualify for financial aid, she said, but had to withdraw from college last spring when she ran out of money. Although she is back in school, she said she might have to sit out future semesters if costs rise.
Higher-income and middle-income students have been going to college in ever-greater numbers as college becomes an increasingly important factor in earning a decent salary. But lower-income students are going in about the same proportions that they did in the 1970's.
For decades, public universities have remained an important source of higher education for those who cannot afford private institutions. Today, more than 80 percent of America's college students study at public universities.
But while these universities are still considerably less expensive than most private colleges, they, too, are increasingly pricing themselves beyond the means of the poorest Americans, experts say.
Morton Owen Schapiro, dean at the University of Southern California and a specialist in the economics of higher education, said that tuition at public colleges and universities had risen by an annual average of 4 percent to 4.5 percent after inflation since the late 1970's, well ahead of the growth in financial aid.
"That is going to hurt a lot of people," he said, adding that while some private colleges offer generous financial aid to needy students, most of them go to public institutions.
He and Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul, have found that public subsidies to higher education have shrunk from 45 percent of higher education's revenues in 1980 to 35 percent today -- most of it to public universities.
Compounding the financial problems of many students are continuing cuts in financial aid. Federal Pell grants, aimed at helping the nation's neediest students pay expenses other than tuition, now amount to a maximum of $2,700 for students at public four-year colleges. Mr. Mortenson calculates that had they kept pace with inflation, they would amount to more than $5,500 today.
For many students, state tuition support has declined, too. For 20 years, New York's Tuition Assistance Program -- available to students with incomes below a certain level -- had always covered tuition at the public universities for students who qualified. But in 1995, New York reduced the maximum award for public university students to 90 percent of tuition.
And now Governor Pataki has again proposed that students who receive Pell grants as well as state tuition assistance should receive less from the state program.
To some extent, the impact of these financial pressures has been camouflaged by the steady growth in college attendance by more affluent students and by older people. But students from poor families have increasingly been left behind.
Mr. Mortenson has found that the proportion of students earning college degrees by age 24 from families in the richest quarter of the population (in 1994, those with incomes above $65,000) has jumped sharply, to 79 percent in 1994 from 31 percent in 1979. But the rate among students from families in the poorest population (with 1994 incomes below $22,000) stayed flat over the same years, at about 8 percent.
Looking at the trend another way, affluent students were nearly four times as likely as the poorest ones to graduate from college by age 24 in 1979, but nearly 10 times as likely in 1994. "We have greater inequality of educational attainment by age 24 than at any time in the last 25 years," Mr. Mortenson said. "Lower income kids are having a terrible time in higher education."
In 1995, City University surveyed 545 CUNY students who had left the university system even though they were in good academic standing. Thirty-four percent cited lack of money or the need to work as the reason. When the City University raised tuition by $750 in 1995 and New York State cut financial aid, the university saw a sudden drop in undergraduates: 138,000 students enrolled at its four-year colleges, 4,500 fewer than the previous year and about 6,500 fewer than projected.
"I am convinced that the reason was simply financial," said the university's Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds. "Students needed to have much more cash on the barrel. I am convinced that we are denying opportunity for poor students to go to college."
City University, the nation's largest urban university system, has the highest percentage of students in poverty: about 40 percent of the 139,000 undergraduates at its four-year colleges come from households with incomes of less than $20,000. More than half of all undergraduates -- 85,000 -- qualify for Pell grants, and 72,000 get tuition assistance from New York State.
Still, more than half of the students also work: 27 percent hold full-time jobs and 32 percent work part time -- many to support their own families, because 29 percent have children.
Even with multiple sources of support, many City University students encounter financial problems, which are reflected in their frequent moves in and out of school and the longer time they take to graduate.
Abdul Khan, a 36-year-old immigrant from Pakistan and an engineering major at City College, has been forced to skip semesters because his full-time job at a newsstand -- which pays $13,000 a year -- leaves little extra money after living expenses. If costs rise further, he said, "maybe I can take one semester every year."
Mr. Mortenson, the analyst of higher education, said that if financial aid is not increased, one answer for students like Mr. Khan may be to take out more loans -- an often unpalatable option for those unsure they will be able to finish college.
David Torres, a 35-year-old psychology major at Brooklyn College who lives in Ozone Park, Queens, said he had weighed taking out a loan, now that he has exhausted his state tuition assistance.
"But loans terrify me," he said. "What if I don't finish and can't pay it off? It's scary."
Mr. Mortenson has an answer for students like Mr. Torres.
"What I tell kids," he said, "is that as scary as paying for college is, you have to go. The only thing more expensive than going to college is not going to college."

HEADLINE: MEDIA: ENTERTAINMENT;
At Sundance, disappointment over the latest independent films.

BYLINE: By Bernard Weinraub 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah

 BODY:
AT a panel discussion the other morning on the economic state of the independent film business, Jonathan Dana, a veteran producer and movie company executive, opened the session on a Dickensian note: "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times." The crowd of independent film producers, writers and aspiring film makers laughed -- but knew exactly what Mr. Dana meant.
Although the 13th annual Sundance Film Festival in the Wasatch mountains of Utah has been marked by high-profile film acquisitions made by such companies as Miramax, Gramercy, Fine Line, Sony Classics and Fox Searchlight, the reality of the festival is that the bulk of the 127 films shown here may never see the light of day. (And the more than 1,200 feature films actually submitted to the festival will certainly struggle to find a distributor). 
 "It's basically Darwinian -- survival of the fittest," said Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics.
Russell Schwartz, president of Gramercy Pictures, remarked: "It never ceases to amaze me. Where do all these films come from? Unfortunately, a lot of them are not audience friendly."
Mr. Dana observed, "Last year there was an astounding group of films -- you had 'Shine,' for example; you had 'Big Night.' This year it's not quite as voluminous in terms of quality. There's a sense of disappointment. How do you get all these films into the marketplace? You don't. It's rougher now than it's ever been. The stakes are higher."
Independent films are characterized as those movies not made by studios. Smaller independent films -- costing $25,000 to $200,000 -- are usually financed by credit cards, personal savings, family money and rich uncles.
Films in the million-dollar-plus range are financed by companies like Miramax, Fine Line, Gramercy and Fox Searchlight (which are owned by entertainment giants like Disney, Warner Brothers, Polygram and the News Corporation.) as well as by video and pay-television outlets and private investors. European, Australian and Japanese companies -- whose representatives were prowling the snowy streets of Park City -- were also in evidence.
Financially, Sundance's fare divides into two categories: those movies that have already been picked up for distribution by companies like Miramax and Fine Line, and those -- the vast majority -- still looking for distributors.
Last year, the most widely discussed film at the festival, "Shine," directed by Scott Hicks about the Australian pianist David Helfgott, was sold to Fine Line for domestic rights for more than $2 million. So far, it has returned about $12 million at the box office in the United States.
But the "Shine" sale came after a dispute between Miramax, Fine Line and the producer selling the film that almost led to a fist-fight at a restaurant here. (The average purchase price of films here hovers between $400,000 and $800,000).
The most amazing sale last year -- and one that is still talked about -- was the purchase by Castle Rock of a modest drama, "The Spitfire Grill," for $10 million. (It has grossed about $12.5 million.)
No film shown at Sundance had ever fetched such a price, and it is widely believed that Castle Rock could have probably bought the movie for far less. Owned then by Ted Turner and now by Warner Brothers, Castle Rock was flush with money but poorly advised. Chastened, Castle Rock was not a very visible buyer this time around.
So far several films have been sold in the $2 million to $3 million range, but there has been a general sense of disappointment among buyers, in part because this crop of movies focused heavily on so much teen-age angst and tortuous twentysomething relationships.
Among the big sales: Miramax's purchase of Mark Waters's "The House of Yes," a black comedy about incest; Fox Searchlight bought Miguel Arteta's "Star Maps," a drama about a Mexican teen-ager in Los Angeles who sells maps to the homes of movie stars; Gramercy bought Mark Pellington's "Going All the Way," based on the Dan Wakefield coming-of-age drama about two Korean War veterans in the 1950's; Trimark purchased Tom DeCillo's comedy, "Box of Moonlight," in which John Turturro plays a man at odds with his family and co-workers.
"The deals this year are less dramatic in nature and less contentious," said Mark Ordesky, executive vice president of acquisitions for New Line and Fine Line. "Let's face it -- people aren't slugging it out."
Amir Malin, a partner in October Films, the New York-based company which released "Secrets and Lies" and "Breaking the Waves," put it more bluntly. "This has been an off-Sundance," he said. "Some films have been acquired in an almost knee-jerk way for all the wrong reasons -- to fill a distributor's pipeline. It's going to be very difficult to attract box office on many of these films."
Some of the films that don't open in theaters will appear on cable or pay TV; others will go directly into video stores. But even those independent films that find distributors and wind up at theaters are often doomed. Last year, for example, the majority of Sundance films that reached theaters proved disappointing at the box office.
What originally transformed Sundance -- and made investors and studios realize the financial potential for independent films -- was the unexpected success of Steven Soderbergh's dark 1989 comedy, "sex, lies and videotape," grossing more than $24 million. More recently, two independent films, "Four Weddings and a Funeral," released by Gramercy and grossing $250 milliion around the world, and Miramax's "Pulp Fiction," which took in at least $200 million worldwide, raised expectations to an unrealistic level.
But independent films are increasingly risky in the marketplace despite the fact that they made up the bulk of last year's most acclaimed films -- among them, "The English Patient," "Shine," "Secrets and Lies," "Fargo." The mantra of distributors at Sundance was that profit margins were diminishing, marketing costs were increasing and the glut of films was hitting independent films especially hard.
"There's a blockbuster mentality now for independent films, too," observed John Schmidt, a partner in October Films with Mr. Malin and Bingham Roy. "If you don't do well quickly you're out of theaters."
Amy Israel, vice president of acquisitions at Miramax, cited one recent film, "Walking and Talking," about teen-agers, which was a big success at last year's Sundance Festival but never quite made it at the box office. "I loved it," Ms. Israel said. "It just never had time to sit in the theaters. It's a shame that smaller films can't take their time at the marketplace."

HEADLINE: As Casino Vote Nears, Opponents Wage Vigorous Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
With the State Legislature preparing to cast its deciding vote on a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling, the ever-present throb of lobbying here has risen to a dull roar.
Lobbyists, lawyers, ministers, business leaders and regular citizens have buttonholed legislators and pressed them with memos and glossy brochures. They have opened phone banks to inundate lawmakers with imploring calls. And they have deluged communities with postcards urging voters to call or write their representatives. 
 Although frenetic lobbying was widely expected on such a contentious and money-driven issue, many lawmakers say they have been astonished by the size and aggressiveness of the opposition, who have made the bill's supporters seem muted by comparison.
"They're like bees on honey," said Assemblyman Robert G. Prentiss, a Saratoga County Republican and an opponent of the amendment, whose passage remains very much in doubt. The Senate is expected to vote on Tuesday and the Assembly sometime the following week. If approved, the amendment would go before voters in a statewide referendum this November. If it fails, legislative leaders say it will not be considered again this year.
The bill's opponents, a diverse group whose interests on other issues often collide, include Roman Catholic, mainstream Protestant and evangelical church leaders, environmentalists, officials in the thoroughbred horse racing industry and Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump, who owns three Atlantic City casinos, has invested more than $1 million in the last year to fight the amendment, saying it would drain money from the city's economy, reducing the value of his vast real estate empire.
The measure's supporters are mainly mayors and business owners from regions that would stand to gain casinos and, they say, economic growth from the measure: Buffalo, Niagara Falls, the Catskills and Warren County near Lake George. A fifth area that would be eligible for a casino, Saratoga County, has had a groundswell of opposition against the amendment.
The amendment would authorize one casino each in Buffalo, Niagara Falls and either Warren or Saratoga County. It would allow an unlimited number in the Catskills. And it would authorize slot machines and video poker at harness racetracks and at the Saratoga Race Track.
Legislators say they are particularly surprised that, except for Mr. Trump, executives of major casino companies apparently have not joined the fray, either for or against the measure. Many opponents had expected casino investors from around the country to make large campaign contributions and hire top-drawer lobbyists to pressure the Legislature to approve the amendment, on the theory that New York State would provide a lucrative new source of business.
Many opponents say they fear that casino interests are waging a campaign for the amendment that is so subtle that it cannot be traced through campaign or lobbying records. "I haven't seen anything, and that scares me to death," said a well-known lobbyist for Mr. Trump, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But in interviews last week, several casino executives said their companies, though very interested in expanding into New York if the amendment passes, have stayed on the sidelines because they did not want to create the appearance of meddling in the Legislature. They suggested, however, that their companies might promote the amendment if it goes to a referendum.
Gary L. Burhop, vice president of corporate communications for Harrah's Entertainment, said that many industry officials no longer believe that outsiders can influence the Legislature simply "by hiring a bunch of lobbyists," as was done by casino operators in their recent battles in other states.
Mr. Trump is the one casino owner who has been anything but subtle in his opposition to the amendment. In 1996, he spent $855,750 on a team of four lobbyists and three public relations firms to fight the amendment, and has signed contracts to spend at least as much in 1997. Two of the four lobbyists are former top aides to the Senate's Democratic minority, where about 15 undecided members hold the key to the amendment's fate.
Mr. Trump and his wife, Marla Maples, have also made at least $350,000 in campaign contributions in 1996 to both parties, making them among the largest contributors in state politics.
Many gambling analysts say the legalization of casinos in New York State will cut into Mr. Trump's profits in Atlantic City. But in an interview last week, Mr. Trump said that was not why he opposed the bill.
"I'd have a very big casino in New York, which would more than compensate me for losses to Atlantic City," he said. "But I will tell you, if gambling happens in New York, it will be very detrimental to my holdings."
Another casino company that has been lobbying against the amendment is London Clubs International, which wants to build a private, dockside floating casino adjacent to the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan. The current amendment would not allow casinos in New York City, so lobbyists for London Clubs, which runs elite private gambling clubs in London, Beirut and Cairo, are urging legislators to reject the current measure and rewrite it to include the city. That version would then have to be reapproved by the Legislature in 1999 before it could go to a referendum.
James McMahon, a lobbyist for London Clubs, said the amendment should be revised because many communities want casinos. "It's the reverse of Nimby," he said. "It's 'Yes in My Backyard.' "
Mr. McMahon's arguments echo those of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has said that he will urge city voters to reject the amendment because it does nothing for their economy, and the Hotel Association of New York City, which contends that casinos in the Catskills will hurt its businesses. Mr. Giuliani and members of the hotel association, who were both in Albany last week making their cases, said they would support the amendment if it included the city.
Their views clash with the position taken by their putative allies: a broad coalition of religious leaders who say that casinos are immoral and will increase a host of social ills from divorce to crime to child abuse. That coalition has been successful in cajoling its parishioners to write and call legislators to register opposition.
Other opponents include environmentalists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who contends that casinos will spur development in ecologically sensitive areas of the Adirondacks and Catskills. The thoroughbred horse racing industry and several Off Track Betting Corporations also assert that casinos will drain money from their industries.
But while the opponents have little in common, they have cooperated with each other informally, sharing information and lobbying tips in the hallways as well as appearing together in news conferences. A recent event presented this unlikely scene: Mr. Kennedy sandwiched between the executive directors of the State Conservative Party and the state's Christian Coalition.
The support for the amendment has been headed for several years by a group of Catskills resort owners and their influential lobbyist, Lester Shulklapper, who has helped draft the amendment and devise strategies for passing it.
More recently, coalitions of business owners, real estate developers and mayors have formed in Buffalo, Niagara Falls and the Lake George area to push for the amendment. Though late in getting started, the groups' leaders have been traveling regularly to Albany. Their main message: Neighboring casinos in Canada and on Indian reservations are killing their tourism businesses.
"We need to level the playing field," said Sergio Fornasiero, a retired developer from Buffalo and head of the city's pro-casino coalition.

HEADLINE: A Once-Hidden Faith Leaps Into the Open;
After Years of Secrecy, Santeria Is Suddenly Much More Popular. And Public.

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
The recreation room is thick with cigar smoke by late afternoon. Three drummers frantically pound sacred drums, enticing worshipers to crowd around and step to the pulse. A singer chants insults in an African language, hoping to anger the santos, or deities, into appearing.
Suddenly, a woman draped in white shudders violently. Her eyes glaze, then roll back into her head. She reaches for her forehead as if to soothe it, all the while twirling low to the ground, round and round, massaging the intricate rhythms of the drums. Yemaya, the deity who symbolizes the sea and masquerades as the Virgin Mary, has finally come into the room. Yemaya has possessed her. 
 But it was not Yemaya's earthly arrival in the Marble Hill section of the Bronx on a bitterly cold Saturday that was most remarkable. Instead, it was her presence in so visible a place: the recreation room of a high-rise apartment building, a place typically reserved for children's birthday parties and community meetings.
Santeria, a religion created several centuries ago by West Africans enslaved in colonial Cuba and imported to New York City more than 40 years ago, is going public.
For decades, Santeria has operated in a muted underground here, its rites confined to basements and living rooms far from the condemning eyes of outsiders who labeled it hoodoo. Recently, however, the religion has jumped out of the shadows. It has burst onto the Internet. It has smitten musicians like David Byrne and Paul Simon, and will hit Broadway next fall in a musical. And it has slowly seeped into city life through its African and Cuban culture, its houses of worship and the innumerable botanicas, shops frequented mostly by Santeria devotees -- santeros and santeras -- who buy needed herbs and religious objects.
"The religion is absolutely more public and more popular and more secular now," said Emilio Barreto, a Santeria priest and singer who helped beckon Yemaya that Saturday afternoon and has recorded a compact disk of Santeria music called "Santisimo."
"People are more willing to talk about some of the things that go on. There are more initiates every day and more people coming to the celebrations to witness what they are about. People are spreading the word and people are showing up."
For thousands of New Yorkers, such a "toque" (pronounced TOE-kay), or performance for the saints, is now no more unusual -- or secret -- than attending shul or kneeling to Allah. Once dismissed as a ghetto religion practiced only by the Caribbean poor and uneducated, Santeria has a growing following among middle-class professionals, including white, black and Asian Americans. There are police officers in New York who pray to Obatala, the father of all deities, or orishas, before they slip on their gun belts. There are lawyers and professors, civil servants and musicians whose homes are filled with altars laden with flowers, rum, cake and cigars to keep the gods happy and helpful. Many dress in white to symbolize purity.
"This isn't the bush here," said Anthony Cabrera Mondesire, a Santeria priest and a former regional transportation planner who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. "We are not hicks and peasants."

A Focus on Nature And Extended Family
Because the religion is not centralized and has a history of profound secrecy, it is still difficult to know just how many people practice it.
Scholars and priests estimate that there are hundreds of thousands of santeros and casual Santeria believers from New York to Boston. And it is clear, they say, that the religion is attracting growing numbers of people from Florida to Seattle to Canada, despite the continuing controversy over the sacrificing of animals and initiation costs than can reach thousands of dollars -- for clothing, food, implements, fees and livestock.
They are drawn to Santeria, sometimes called Lukumi, for a host of reasons. The religion emphasizes the here and now rather than the afterlife, and it focuses on natural forces. Each deity represents an aspect of nature, like thunder, and a human characteristic, like power.
Like many religions, Santeria also offers community. Those who undergo its carefully guarded initiation rites, which include animal sacrifice to cleanse the soul and give strength, step into an extended family. They have godparents -- the priests and priestesses who bring them into the religion -- as well as people designated as uncles and aunts. They also belong to a house, or temple, which doubles as the priest's home.
People who feel that they live on the margins of society, including new immigrants, often say Santeria makes them feel welcome.
"You are part of a group," said Mercedes Sandoval, who teaches anthropology at Miami-Dade Community College in Florida and has studied Santeria for decades. "It's an emotional and economic support system. It's a fictive extended family in a post-industrial society."
Houses are growing -- one Brooklyn priest has more than 200 godchildren -- and multiplying. Also increasing, say scholars and priests, is the number of people seeking counsel from the gods on matters of love, health, work and finance. "Five years ago, I did 200 readings in a year," said Ade Ifaleri Olayinka, a high priest in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. "Last year I did 700."

For Some, Sacrifice; For Others, Sacrilege
If there is any one aspect of Santeria that has upset and repulsed nonbelievers, it is the ritual sacrifice of animals, usually fowl and goats.
For years, the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stopped ceremonies, rescued chickens, goats and lambs, and had santeros arrested. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has also waged a high-profile campaign against the slaughter. Santeros kill animals, usually by slicing their carotid arteries, in rituals for major events like birth, death, marriage and the initiation of priests. The blood is used as an offering to the orishas and in most cases, the sacrificed animals are cooked and eaten.
But in 1993, the United States Supreme Court recognized animal sacrifice as a religious sacrament and decided that it was protected by the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom. That has complicated the mission of animal rights activists.
"We'd like to challenge the ruling," said Mark MacDonald, a special investigator for the A.S.P.C.A. "But then it becomes very political. It's very hard."
Hollywood has further blemished the religion's reputation by routinely portraying santeros as satanists. And in New York City, Santeria is frequently blamed for any incident hinting of the occult.
Even Mr. MacDonald, who wishes he could end the slaughter of animals by santeros, said the religion has been much maligned by people who believe the exaggerated, and often untrue, stereotypes.
"I think they get a bogeyman rap because people don't understand," Mr. MacDonald said, adding that he has developed a respect for Santeria. "People think because they dress funny, they are right away slaughtering animals in there."
As the religion grows, so have the number of animal sacrifices, but the A.S.P.C.A. reports receiving fewer complaints, only about one a month, down from about six a month several years ago.
Part of the reason is that Santeria is no longer a rarity in so many predominantly minority communities. Emboldened by santeros in Miami, who have not shied from openly practicing their religion, and the Supreme Court ruling, many New York santeros are easing into public view.
Nothing so proved the point as the sign affixed to a fence outside the Bronx high rise where Yemaya came to earth. In bold, handwritten letters for all to see, it read: This Way To Toque.
"There is more exposure to it," said Alton Rogers, a retired police detective. "And not so much in a negative way as it has been in the past." Santeros used to be afraid that being open about their faith would lead to ostracism or reprisals, he said. "You don't feel that kind of pressure."

Age-Old Powers Cloaked in Saints' Robes
Santeria was born among the West African Yoruban people who were taken to Cuba as slaves from the 16th to the 19th century. It reached New York City in the late 1940's with the arrival of the first Cuban santero, Pancho Mora.
Forced to conceal their religious traditions, the santeros cloaked their faith in Roman Catholic imagery. Chango, god of thunder and lightning, for example, was worshiped in the image of Saint Barbara, whose father was struck by lightning as he beheaded her for her faith. This melding became known as Santeria, the worship of saints. It is not uncommon to find santeros lining the pews of a Roman Catholic church or a devout Catholic dropping in on a Santeria priest for advice. Nor is it unusual to find santeros who worship the orishas in their pure form, without the presence of saints.
Santeros believe in a supreme being, Oloddumare, and a pantheon of orishas who can be asked for help in everyday life. Priests interpret the orishas' counsel through divination. Sometimes the orishas speak directly to them by taking possession of worshipers, santeros say.
Soon after Mr. Mora's arrival, large botanicas started springing up in El Barrio and the South Bronx, selling medicinal herbs as well as statues of St. Francis of Assisi and other Catholic icons. Now there are two dozen botanicas listed in the Bronx phone book, far more than stores selling other religious items, and the competition is fierce.
In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, Deyanira Rodriguez has pushed the botanica concept one imaginative step forward. On one side of her beauty parlor, Deya's Unisex, customers buy oils and potions to lure back their men. The other side offers a more practical allure: a quick wash, cut and dry. "The idea has worked out pretty well," she said. "The other botanicas are jealous. They want to get me out of here."
In many stores in Latino neighborhoods, the statue of a saint stands guard, surrounded by candles and bowls of coconut or molasses. In parts of the Bronx and upper Manhattan, flower shops stock extra blossoms on particular days, like red carnations on Chango's feast day, and bakeries carry extra cakes and pastries when when a god like Ochun, who likes sweets, is being celebrated.
English-language books on Santeria, once nearly impossible to find, are now abundant, as is information on the Internet. Search the Web for Santeria and nearly 1,800 sites come up. Marta Vega, a santera and professor who heads the Caribbean Cultural Center in Manhattan, remembers putting on the center's first Santeria-related exhibitions 20 years ago, when few people had heard of the religion. Now, the concerts, lectures and art exhibits are standing room only.
And this year, Santeria is crossing over to Broadway in a Paul Simon musical, "The Capeman," about a legendary East Harlem murderer turned poet. In the play, santeros have been cast to sing and drum their prayers to the orishas.
Music has always served as a point of introduction to the religion. Tito Puente, La India, Eddie Palmieri, Conrad Herwig, David Byrne and Paul Simon have incorporated the music of Santeria into their recordings. Celia Cruz has sung of deities like Chango. (This is not entirely new: When Desi Arnaz, as Ricky Ricardo, belted out "Babalu" on the "I Love Lucy" show, he was referring to the orisha Babalu-aye.) Percussionist Milton Cardona, a santero who plays the sacred bata drums, has recorded with almost all the top names in Latin music.
But there is a downside to all this newfound popularity: fraud. Increasingly, men and women with limited knowledge are passing themselves off as Santeria priests and charging customers for services rendered.
Santeros say they regularly come across people who paid hundreds of dollars to be initiated, then realized that the dishonest priest did not follow the dictates of the religion. Or santeros learn of priests who espouse only the religion's dark side, luring people with promises of hexes and supernatural power, all of which serves to further sully Santeria's fragile reputation.
So santeros in New York are pushing their religion to another level: they have begun seeking secular legitimization. One local priest incorporated his temple. Several have been certified through churches in Miami and Nigeria. They have also formed a few priestly societies.
"We need to get together," said Ted Holliday, one of New York's first black Santeria priests. "If we don't, it will degenerate into 'magic voodoo' again."

Charts: "AT A GLANCE: Inside Santeria"
 
IN THE BEGINNING -- Oloddumare, the supreme being, created the universe and sent the orishas, or deities, to create life out of the elements. There are two master orishas: Obatala, who created human life and consciousness out of the substance of the earth, and Orumila, who governs an individual's destiny.
 
THE MEANING OF LIFE -- The world is a place for the soul to evolve. Santeros strive to be of service to others, to develop good character and to keep a cool head. There are two other types of people: bystanders and those who are destructive. All humans go to heaven -- ikole orun -- when they die, but destructive people live in hell on earth and suffer in heaven.
 
GOOD AND EVIL -- The terms are too subjective, since what can be good for one person can be evil for another. Instead, forces in the universe are either constructive or destructive for humanity. In either case, they are controlled by orishas.
 
AFFECTING FATE -- With the help of priests, who can divine the past, present and future, individuals can appeal to the orishas through prayers, music, proper behavior and offerings of food, flowers or other items and, in initiations or dire straits, animal blood.
 
PRIESTHOOD -- Women can become priests, but only men can become high priests. Priests are the only ones who can interpret the laws expressed in the 256 symbols of the Ifa Corpus, a codification of Santeria tradition. Each priest receives an individualized set of taboos, which can include prohibitions on alcohol use, promiscuity or illegal activities, for example.

"Then . . ."
 IN HIDING -- In the 1950's, who knew that the Babalu in the Ricky Ricardo song was a Santeria deity?
 
". . . And Now"
 ON THE MARKET -- Today, the Bronx Yellow Pages are crowded with listings for botanicas, stores where many santeros buy herbs and religious icons used in Santeria.
 ON BROADWAY -- Santeria priests have been cast to drum and sing in Paul Simon's "The Capeman," to open next fall.
 ON LINE -- A simple computer search nets some colorful, information-packed Web pages -- and many product solicitations.
 ON THE HIT PARADE -- Some mainstream music stores are selling Santeria music. (pg. B1)

HEADLINE: For Whitman, More Temporary Solutions

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
When Christine Todd Whitman was running for governor four years ago, she stood next to a life-size cartoon of Gov. Jim Florio holding bags of cash to help draw attention to her pledge that she would end the state's longstanding practice of spending more than it takes in each year.
Governor Whitman has kept other campaign promises, like cutting income and business taxes by $2.8 billion so far. But she has depended on almost $4.2 billion in temporary measures during her first term to help balance the state's budget. 
 And on Wednesday, in her new $16 billion budget, she will propose another $800 million more in so-called one-shots, or sources of money that the state cannot depend on in future years.
Critics say the Whitman administration's practices, particularly changes in the state's public-employee pension system, have heightened the risk of increasing the burden on New Jersey taxpayers.
But Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, insists that the Whitman administration's budget maneuvers have been fiscally prudent, and he notes that the state has maintained a high credit rating.
Although the Whitman administration has taken steps to curb government spending in the last three budgets, most notably by reaching a four-year pact with state employees that includes a two-year wage freeze, much of the reduction in state government spending in Governor Whitman's first term has come from one source: reducing the state's contribution to the public employee pension system by almost $3.5 billion.
The Governor is able to do this because in 1994 she made several changes to the pension system, including raising the assumptions about how much the system would earn on investments. But fiscal monitors warn that the state may have to increase its contributions to the system in future years.
In Mrs. Whitman's new state budget, the pension system would once again help, this time providing $623 million in immediate, but temporary, budgetary savings.
The Whitman administration proposes to borrow $3.4 billion through bonds, which analysts call the biggest borrowing by a state in history. That money would be used to help pay off the pension system's $4.2 billion unfunded liability account, which is used to help cover cost-of-living increases for retirees.
The maneuver would enable the state to save $113 million in debt service on the bonds this year and and $510 million from the pension system's surplus.
Although Mr. Clymer has projected moderate but steady economic growth for the coming fiscal year, including a $264 million increase in tax revenues, the addition of $823 million in one-shots would help Governor Whitman, a Republican, avoid some unpopular cuts during her re-election campaign, as well as help pay for the $270 million new school financing plan approved by the State Legislature last month.
Steven H. Hochman, assistant director of state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, one of two major bond rating agencies, said there has been a troubling trend in New Jersey of depending on temporary measures to balance the state budget.
"We have been noticing that as the state has implemented its multiyear tax cut program it has been relying on a variety of nonrecurring measures, or temporary measures to accommodate the tax cut," Mr. Hochman said. "That is a continuing concern."
Mr. Hochman added that the proposal involving the pension obligation bonds "appears to be part of that pattern. That kind of pattern continues to raise the question of how the state will be able to accommodate with the reduced revenue stream over the longer term."
In addition to saving $623 million through the pension system maneuver, the Whitman administration is counting on $200 million in one-shot revenues from the proposed sale of the State Disability Benefits Fund, which distributes annual payments up to 26 weeks to New Jersey workers who are temporarily disabled due to injury or sickness unrelated to their job.
This is the second time that Mr. Clymer has turned to the disability fund for budgetary savings. Last year, he took $250 million out of the fund's surplus to help balance the budget. He has also taken millions of dollars from other state funds designated for specific purposes.
"Things started happening during the later part of Governor Florio's first term because there was a fervor to cut taxes," said State Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County, who is a member of the State Legislature's Appropriations Committee. "If we keep doing these things, and get away from conservative fiscal policy, these things add up, and we are in danger of becoming irresponsible."
Critics also say the Whitman administration has failed to wrestle with several looming problems that could lead to fiscal trouble ahead.
Over the objections of both organized labor and business, the state is using money from the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund to pay for the state's charity care program, which reimburses hospitals for treating low-income, uninsured patients.
"We are concerned about some trends that the state does not appear to be confronting," said Donald Linky, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, a nonpartisan public policy research organization founded in 1930.
"The projections for school construction will put considerable pressure on local government budgets, and the property tax over the next several years," Mr. Linky said. "And we don't see any real plan on how the state is going to fund the expansion of school capacity, and additional teachers that will be needed."
Governor Whitman herself acknowledges that she has more to do before the state is on strong fiscal footing. If elected, she said she will work even harder to insure that the state's structural deficit -- the difference between what is collected and what is spent -- is closed.
"We have been able to balance the budget every year, and we have been able to and we will continue to control spending," Governor Whitman said in a recent interview. "I want to be able to continue to live in this state. I would like my kids to want to live in this state, so I want to make darn sure that I leave this state on a good solid footing so we don't have to worry about spikes in taxes, or all of our services going south on us, that we have built something that is meaningful."

Strike Over Labor Pact Idles G.M. Plant in Ohio
Close to 4,100 workers went on strike against General Motors at a huge plant in Moraine, Ohio, where sport utility vehicles are assembled. The International Union of Electronics Workers ordered the strike after workers voted against ratification of a new labor agreement. 
 The pact was rejected in part because it included a new program intended to penalize workers with high rates of absenteeism. The strike is the fourth large one against G.M. in less than a year. [Page B8.]
 
Tiny Sensors With Big Powers
At Xerox's research center in Palo Alto, Calif., three miles from the San Andreas Fault, scientists are working on technology that might one day enable buildings or highway overpasses to adjust instantly so that they could dance in harmony with an earthquake, rather than crumble under its tectonic force. The technology, called micro-electro-mechanical systems, uses Lilliputian sensors, motors, nozzles, valves or other mechanical systems to gauge heat, light, motion and sound -- and respond. And nimble buildings are just one application being envisioned. [A1.]
 
Toward Quantum Leap in Computing
A team of scientists plans to announce the discovery of a material that may become the foundation of a new approach to computing, making possible machines thousands of times faster than today's supercomputers. The researchers, from Xerox and several universities, expect to announce the creation of a microscopic magnet, one molecule in size, that could be used to pack data more densely and to quicken operations. [D2.]

PC Shipments Rise 18%
The personal computer industry continued its strong global growth in 1996, as shipments expanded by almost 18 percent, though expansion slowed in the consumer market, according to Dataquest, a market research organization. The PC industry shipped 70.9 million machines in 1996, up 17.8 percent from shipments of 60.2 million in 1995. [D2.]
 
States More Hesitant to Spend
Five years of economic growth has left state governments flush with money. But instead of spending it, they are generally building rainy-day funds and letting a little trickle back to residents through rebates and tax cuts. The trend is a break from what usually happened in boom times, when states often used increased tax revenues to make up for spending cuts or enacted programs that had been postponed by an earlier recession.

Reading the Subtitles at Sundance
Though the Sundance Film Festival has been marked by high-profile film acquisitions by such companies as Miramax, Gramercy, Fine Line, Sony Classics and Fox Searchlight, the reality is that the bulk of the films shown there may never see the light of day. Bernard Weinraub: Entertainment. [D10.]
 
While Resolutions Remain Fresh
Companies trying to cash in on New Year's resolutions are advertising heavily to try to persuade consumers that their diet or fitness center will help them achieve their goals. The marketer of Nicorette gum, for instance, has introduced an ad telling consumers how to keep resolutions "from going up in smoke." Advertising. [D12.]
 
Royal Appliance Manufacturing was among the advertisers during the Super Bowl that showed themselves to be deft at special effects. In a series of commercials that earned high marks for artistic expression of a day spent cleaning, Fred Astaire sashayed across the screen with a Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner, made by Royal, in hand. [D10.]
 
A Ratings Battle in Australia
As in other countries, television news in Australia has become a battleground, with millions of dollars in revenue as the spoils of victory. Networks owned at least in part by the billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer are among the competitors tangling to get that exclusive scoop that will turn the ratings tide. [D10.]
 
May the Web Be With You
As 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment prepares to re-release the film "Star Wars," stargazers can look to the World Wide Web for background. New sites devoted to the "Star Wars" trilogy abound, as do countless others started earlier by fans and maintained faithfully ever since. Taking In the Sites. [D8.]

HEADLINE: Ed Wilson, 71, a Sculptor and Art Teacher

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
It has been two months since Ed Wilson died at his home in Vestal, N.Y., and if the event has not been widely noticed beyond the Binghamton area, where he had been a working sculptor and art teacher, it may be because, like his art, Mr. Wilson's life did not always get the scrutiny it deserved.
Mr. Wilson, whose family said he died of congestive heart failure on Nov. 26, was 71 and had been well known in Binghamton since 1964, when he became chairman of the department of art and art history at the State University of New York. 
 For all his influence on students, what brought Mr. Wilson to local attention was a series of his sculptures, among them a memorial to John F. Kennedy and a piece titled "Falling Man."
Mr. Wilson produced some two dozen sculptures, working variously in bronze, aluminum and red hickory, but the very aspect of his work that made him a prized local artist in Binghamton helped keep him from receiving serious critical notice.
That's because Mr. Wilson worked primarily on civic commissions, and as a result his sculptures were generally not displayed in galleries or museums, but in public spaces -- parks, schoolyards and college campuses -- where they rarely receive more than a passing glance or are such a part of the landscape that they are really not seen at all by those who pass them very day.
Those who did take a second look at Mr. Wilson's work were generally impressed. In their book, "A History of African-American Artists" (Random House, 1992), Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson devoted a chapter to Mr. Wilson, ranking him as a significant artist and citing works like "Second Genesis" and "Jazz Musicians," both at schools in Baltimore, where he was born.
Whatever his critical standing, that Mr. Wilson became an artist at all represented a certain triumph of will. For a black youngster in the 1920's and 30's, Mr. Wilson, whose mother was a teacher and whose father was a college administrator, grew up in unusually comfortable circumstances.
His interest in art and his talent emerged when he was kept out of school with rheumatic fever and whiled away his time at home making detailed cardboard models of towns. When he returned to school full time his teachers encouraged his art, but his father, concerned about the economic prospects of a black artist, persuaded him to study architecture and civil engineering.
During a wartime stint in the Army, however, Mr. Wilson experienced such extreme prejudice he decided a black architect would face such obstacles that he might as well make a life for himself as an artist.
Switching to art when he returned to school, he soon abandoned painting for sculpture, and after obtaining a master's in 1953, he taught at North Carolina College in Durham until he went to Binghamton, where he worked until his retirement in 1992.
Mr. Wilson had been deeply involved in the civil rights struggle in North Carolina, and the experience influenced his art. Many of his works also reflected his early interest in painting. For all their varied shapes, the focal points of a Wilson sculpture are often small-scale images on a sometimes hidden surface.
At Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, for example, the message of Mr. Wilson's "Middle Passage," ostensibly three gently curving slabs of concrete nestled together outside the school, does not become apparent until one takes a second, closer look, squeezing between the slabs to examine narrow bands of bronze depicting the horrors of a slave ship.
It was perhaps partly because Mr. Wilson's work did not always receive such scrutiny that his own death was largely overlooked, so much so that even Mr. Henderson, the co-author of the book on black artists, did not learn about it until Saturday, two weeks, he said, after he had tried to call Mr. Wilson to discuss a major publisher's plan to include an image of one of his works in an art book.
That a black artist could have a prolific career at once so public and so obscure should not be especially surprising, certainly not to Mr. Wilson. One of his most original works stands in an Oklahoma City park, a memorial to Ralph Ellison, the author of "The Invisible Man."
Mr. Wilson, who was divorced, is survived by a son, Craig, of Troy, N.Y.; a daughter, Julie Shiver of Baltimore; a sister, Frances Lee of Baltimore, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: As Serb and Croat Leaders Weaken, U.S. Alters Policy

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
A year after the signing of the accord that ended the war in Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has concluded that the days of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia are numbered.
While that number is a mystery, Washington has begun altering its policy, supporting the protests of Mr. Milosevic's opponents, looking past Mr. Tudjman to identify a new generation of leaders and seriously considering plans for commandos to capture some of the roughly 70 people indicted on charges of war crimes. 
 Only a year ago, the Administration looked upon Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman as guarantors of stability in Bosnia. The two men, both authoritarian and both with clear responsibility for the war, had nonetheless committed themselves to ending it by signing the Dayton accord in December 1995.
Thousands of American and other NATO troops were sent to Bosnia to separate the combatants and prevent a recurrence of bloodshed. To protect those troops, the Clinton Administration said, the United States and its allies chose not to hunt down accused criminals.
Today, the earth has shifted in the former Yugoslavia, with Mr. Milosevic holding on to power in the face of protests and Mr. Tudjman gravely ill with prostate cancer.
The Clinton Administration has concluded that Mr. Milosevic is unwilling to do much more to support the peace plan, and that a stable Bosnia requires a more democratic Serbia and Croatia. While the new Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, has spoken vigorously of the need for democracy in the region, the Administration has not decided how to promote it.
On Friday, asked about Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman at a news conference, Ms. Albright said that policies cannot be based "on any one individual." The peace accord "is supported by more than just two leaders," she said, and American policy remains the effort "to develop institutions" that "can support an evolution toward democracy and capital markets."
A senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington is not trying to push Mr. Milosevic out of power or "calling for his demise." But, the official added, "his aura is broken."
With the Serbian Orthodox Church against him, the economy in trouble, the police and the army saying they will not shoot protesters and even the Bosnian Serb Government supporting the opposition, Mr. Milosevic's rule is not likely to last more than a year, American officials say. "Now it's a matter of when his era ends, not if, and how it does," the official said. "Even if he survives, he won't be able to exercise the same unbridled one- or two-person rule, with his wife. The rules have changed."
American and European officials say they cannot predict who might succeed Mr. Milosevic, where the current opposition might take the country if he fell suddenly, or what impact a change could have in Bosnia. While the students who are marching daily in protest espouse democratic aims, some opposition leaders have been militantly nationalist in the past and supported the war in Bosnia.
Such uncertainties help explain why America's allies are even less eager to push for serious political change in the Balkans, senior American officials and some senior European diplomats say. They have always cared less about creating a democratic and unified Bosnia than about stopping the war.
With troops of their own in Bosnia and worried about a new flow of refugees, the prime interest of European countries remains stability. Far from acting to undermine Mr. Milosevic, the Europeans and Russia are not willing to go even as far as Washington has gone to isolate him.
"Washington has increased its rhetoric over Serbia and is putting great pressure on Serbia, but has not really made the decision to say that the sooner Milosevic goes the better," said Morton I. Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment and a former American diplomat. "But the alliance is totally divided on how to deal with this guy, and that's the problem. A lot of people want to work something out between Milosevic and the opposition, and there is no agreement within the alliance on what pressures to bring on him."
Unlike its European allies, Washington has withheld full diplomatic recognition from Mr. Milosevic's Government and has prevented the World Bank and International Monetary Fund from operating there. Those measures have failed to induce Mr. Milosevic to free up the press, talk to the opposition, respect human rights and open up to foreign investment, United States officials acknowledge.
American officials succeeded in pressing for a common front within the so-called Bosnian contact group -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- to urge Mr. Milosevic to recognize and reinstate the original results of the Nov. 17 municipal elections. The opposition won victories in 14 of the 18 largest cities, including Belgrade. Mr. Milosevic's Government canceled the elections over "irregularities" and attempted to hold new ones, and the coalition, together with university students, have held daily protests ever since.
Mr. Milosevic accepted an investigation, proposed by the Americans, from the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe. Its report backed the opposition, "thus internationalizing the opposition and giving it real credibility," an American official said.
But the protests have not spread very far beyond Belgrade. And Mr. Milosevic continues to play for time, first accepting some opposition victories, but then backtracking. American officials acknowledge that the Contact Group will not agree to put further pressure on Serbia by lifting recognition or restoring harsher sanctions originally imposed by the United Nations.
Mr. Tudjman, the Croatian President, is hardly less of an authoritarian than Mr. Milosevic on issues of democracy and media freedom, American officials agree, but he has been treated differently, with full diplomatic recognition and international help for economic reform. Croatia did not start the war and did not suffer United Nations sanctions, and Germany led the West in treating Mr. Tudjman as more benign than Mr. Milosevic.
Croatia has manipulated its own elections and cracked down on the media and international organizations promoting human rights, American officials acknowledge, and it has also been moving to absorb the ethnic Croat part of Bosnia bordering on Croatia. The Croats have also resisted allowing refugees to return to the Krajina region of Croatia and make it hard for ethnic Serbs to remain in the Eastern Slavonia region.
But American officials regard Mr. Tudjman, 74, as an "old-fashioned nationalist" formed in the period of World War II, and believe that after his death or retirement -- there will be presidential elections in the second half of 1997 -- the era of one-man rule there will be over. But in Croatia, there is also no obvious heir apparent.
In Croatia, too, there is a budding opposition movement. American officials note that 100,000 people turned out to protest Mr. Tudjman's effort to shut down an independent radio station -- which was granted a license only on Friday -- and they say they have stressed issues of democratization with Mr. Tudjman.
On the issue of accused war criminals, senior American officials say there is new seriousness in Washington, with military and intelligence officials preparing detailed plans for how commando forces could capture indicted suspects and transport them to stand trial before the war crimes tribunal at The Hague. Otherwise, they say, the tribunal may wither and the promises of justice and ethnic reconciliation will die.
But the officials say that no decisions have been made by Mr. Clinton, and that the main inter-agency battle has yet to be fought. The commandos would operate under the authority of the tribunal. But as usual, European countries do not want to take part in such a risky venture without Americans alongside.

HEADLINE: RUSSIA IS FUMBLING ITS CONTRIBUTION TO SPACE STATION

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Problems with Russia's space program have delayed its main contribution to the proposed international space station, endangering the entire project, some experts say.
The Russian module is a centerpiece of the orbiting outpost, which involves 15 nations and is expected to cost at least $50 billion and be the size of a football field. The station is meant to symbolize, and help foster, a new era of East-West accord and is an important part of the Clinton Administration's Russia policy. It is also NASA's biggest and most politically complex project. 
 But the cash-poor Russians have now fallen nearly a year behind schedule in building a module that is vital to the station's success.
So in an emergency move, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided early this month to build a stopgap module in the United States that will enable the station plans to go forward, even though the date for astronauts to move into the station would be pushed back. NASA is racing to contain the political damage while redoing the station plan.
"The danger of its unraveling is great," F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican who recently became chairman of the House Science Committee, said in an interview.
The plan calls for the orbiting outpost to be built in stages by 15 nations, replacing cold war hostilities with a new kind of global teamwork. That work is to begin late this year.
The first two modules, financed by the United States, are to be sent aloft in November and December. In the original plan, a module financed by Russia was to have been flown into space in April 1998, followed by numerous other components until the end of construction in 2002. The delayed Russian module is meant to provide life support for astronauts as well as stability and propulsion for the orbital complex, keeping it from tumbling out of control or falling back to Earth.
Incensed at the delay, Mr. Sensenbrenner said that if Russia was still withholding the payments for its space program at the end of February, the station team should ask the Russians to leave as full partners, letting them serve only as subcontractors paid to do specific jobs. "If Russia continues to fail to fulfill its obligations," he said, "it will shake the political and financial underpinnings of the station."
The issue is high on the agenda of Vice President Al Gore and the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who are to meet early next month in Washington. Mr. Sensenbrenner said he planned to hold hearings on the station's fate right after that meeting.
While NASA officials concede that there has been considerable turmoil, they insist that the basic East-West partnership is sound, if frayed, and that the project is nowhere near collapse. The sprawling outpost can be built on budget and on time and can include Russia, they say.
NASA itself can ride out violent political storms because the agency, as an important source of funds for aerospace contractors, has many powerful allies in Congress.
"From the day we started with the Russians, it has been the perils of Pauline," Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, said in an interview, noting that previous problems had been solved and saying that would be the case again. "I feel we're going to build it with them," he said. "I feel it in my bones."
Despite that, NASA is preparing for the worst. It is studying a second makeshift component, or a modification of the first one, that would give the station long-term stability, even if the Russian module never shows up.
In a bold step, the first stopgap piece for NASA is to be made out of military spy gear, which would apparently be the first such diversion to a civilian program. That means that orbital equipment built to help Americans spy on Russia will now aid the Russians as they struggle to get their technological house in order.
The station's current troubles are part of a pattern of new stresses between the United States and Russia, including friction over issues like NATO's expansion and nuclear disarmament. To some degree, the project's fate is a hostage to wider political currents.
Even so, American shuttles and the Russian Mir space station have succeeded in linking up flawlessly in a series of warm-up missions in the past two years. The fourth American astronaut to stay on the Mir is now aboard the Russian outpost for a four-month visit.
The recent problems might delay the first permanent habitation of the international space station by a half-year or so, pushing back that milestone from May 1998 to December 1998 and perhaps to early 1999, when the Russian module might make it into space. That 43-foot-long, 23-ton cylinder, or something like it, is essential if astronauts are to live and work in orbit.
John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the prospect of Russia's dropping out of the program was "a distinct possibility in terms of the general drift of Russian-American relations."
But he predicted that the station project would survive a Russian departure because thousands of jobs, contracts and political deals depended on it around the world.
"It's going to be the biggest construction program since the pyramids," Mr. Pike said.
The push for a big Western space station began more than a decade ago during the cold war as the Reagan Administration sought to outdo Russia's feats in orbit, envisioning an outpost that was bigger and better. By 1990, the American station was seen as a staggering 508 feet long -- nearly the size of the Capitol in Washington. It was expected to cost up to $120 billion over 30 years.
After the cold war, and after Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992, the White House ordered NASA to work with the Russians to design a smaller and cheaper outpost.
Mr. Goldin brokered a deal among Congressional leaders and international partners to have Russia join the team, helping to transform the decade-old dream (on which American taxpayers had already spent $8 billion) into a top Clinton initiative.
Now the partnership includes Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Russia and America are the dominant players.
It will take more than 40 launchings from Asia and America to get all the station pieces into orbit. By 2002, the international space station -- which will weigh 470 tons and be 290 feet long and 356 feet wide -- is to house up to seven astronauts at a time. The station will be used to study the heavens and Earth and things like human physiology in orbit, all while moving through space at more than 17,000 miles an hour.
One goal of the Clinton Administration is to engage Russia in constructive space work in return for its ending such practices as the export of advanced rocket gear to developing countries.
The original pact with Russia sweetened a $400 million contract for space hardware and launching services. The United States saw that money as strengthening Russia's shaky space program as the Russians moved toward a market economy.
This priming of the pump is now resulting in the production of the first station component, a 21-ton, 41-foot-long core module known as the Functional Cargo Block. On schedule to be launched in November atop a Russian Proton rocket, it is primarily for storage and experiments and has no ability to provide astronauts with life support.
The second module is known as Node 1, a 18-foot-long cylinder built by the Boeing Company that will serve as a connecting link to the future American side of the station. An American space shuttle is to take it aloft in December.
It is the third element, known as the Service Module, that is in trouble. Being built by Krunichev, a Russian company, it was to have been launched by a Russian Proton rocket in April 1998 to provide the station's basic living quarters and propulsion.
But it is so far behind schedule that little more than its outer shell is complete, said Wilbur C. Trafton, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, who was in Russia last week for talks.
In an interview from Moscow, Mr. Trafton said NASA had decided in early January, after much debate, to switch to an Interim Control Module, which has rocket engines for station propulsion and will be made by the Naval Research Laboratory from a rocket-booster system meant to deploy spy satellites.
The new control system will cost less than $100 million, Mr. Trafton said. But it will also require a space shuttle flight into orbit, which will cost $500 million or so. He said the new unit might be ready to go by the spring or fall of 1998.
The switch to the Navy design is reported in the Jan. 20 issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology, an industry journal.
Since the Interim Control Module, as currently envisioned, could position and stabilize the new station for only a year or so, until its fuel ran out, NASA is also studying other options, including a more costly supplementary vehicle it calls the Propulsion Module, which would be fully refuelable. Under current plans, neither module could provide life support services for astronauts.
In theory, an international space station with a Propulsion Module , and with added life-support gear, could be refueled by a modified space shuttle and be free of any dependence on Russian gear.
"We can't bet on the Service Module," Mr. Trafton said. But he added, as did Mr. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, that he still believed that the Russians would eventually succeed in getting the delayed component into orbit.
Yuri N. Koptev, the director of the Russian Space Agency, said last week in Moscow that he hoped the Russian Government would soon allocate funds for the station work.
"If the appropriations are delayed again," Mr. Koptev told the Itar-Tass news agency, "foreign partners might raise the question of excluding Russia from the project."

HEADLINE: Indians' Cruel Winter of Aid Cuts and Cold

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: FORT YATES, N.D., Jan. 21

 BODY:
Arctic winds swirled around Asa Lester's flimsy house, piling drifts to the roof and making it feel like 60 below zero. As his propane supply sputtered to an end, his furnace shut down, leaving Mr. Lester, a wiry Sioux, to face days wrapped in blankets, huddled around a glowing hot plate.
Across this wind-whipped reservation today, propane trucks followed Air Force snowplows, delivering heating fuel to Sioux families isolated on prairie expanses by the worst winter blizzards in memory. 
 For much of the Northern Plains, this has been the cruelest winter. Although Mr. Lester survived, eight people have died in North Dakota in the last three weeks as a result of the weather, a toll that surpasses the state's annual murder rate. With 15,000 dead cows around the state lying frozen on the prairie ground, President Clinton last week declared North Dakota a disaster area.
For the Sioux and other Indians whose remote settlements have been buried under snowdrifts, the harsh weather could not have come at a worse time. Across the nation the Federal Government has cut money to help Indians improve and weatherize their housing.
More than any other group, the two million Indians in the United States, including the one million on the reservations, depend on Federal aid. But annual spending by the Department of Housing and Urban Development has dropped, to $500 million from $650 million three years ago.
Here at the Standing Rock Reservation, where thin walls, balky furnaces and plastic sheeting on windows make for chilly days and nights in Government housing, the Federal repair budget has dropped one-third since 1995, hitting $1.4 million.
"It makes me wonder if Congress wants to cut out Indian housing altogether," said Phyllis A. Young, who has been on the housing board at Standing Rock for 20 years. Referring to a 1950's strategy for withdrawing legal recognition of tribes, she asked, "Are we on the road to termination by appropriation?"
In Sioux County, where half the 9,000 members of the tribe live in Federal housing, dependency on Washington stretches from a frigid day in December 1890, when the reservation police near this Army post killed 12 Sioux, including Sitting Bull.
A century of Federal education failed to teach the Standing Rock Sioux how to make money on their own, or how to join the increasingly prosperous settler economy that was growing up around them.
While North Dakota now has the nation's lowest unemployment rate -- 1.9 percent -- unemployment on the reservation hovers around 75 percent. Instead of jobs, the welfare economy provides a minimal safety net in a county that ranked in 1990 as the sixth poorest in the nation. With a per-capita income of $9,000, Sioux County receives $8,000 in per-capita Federal spending every year. The national average is about $5,200.
In 1960, a Federal dam project increased dependency on Government handouts, and on Government housing. By damming the Missouri River for electric power and flood control, Federal engineers flooded 5,000 acres of the reservation's most fertile cropland.
Floodwaters covered almost 200 Sioux houses built in sheltered river lowlands. Families were forced to move into "650's," Government houses built for $650 each on the wind-scoured plains.
"When I was 10 years old, my home was destroyed and my family was removed from the river bottom," Mrs. Young recalled. "We went from building our own homes, having our own food, having our own property, to relying on the Government for welfare."
Over the next 10 years, officials expect private mortgage lending to start seeping into reservations because of two developments, tribal foreclosure ordinances and changes in Indian housing legislation.
But, for now, the Government remains the largest source of shelter for the Standing Rock Sioux and many other Plains tribes. Federal money is paying to build 220 houses here and it is to help pay for the move here of 100 used houses from the Grand Forks Air Force Base.
Today, when a winter disaster hits this community, the telephone that rings the most insistently belongs to Irma Walking Elk.
"We've been getting 100 applications a day," said Mrs. Walking Elk, who runs the local federally financed program to help pay for home heating. Referring to the 700 households on the reservation that receive fuel aid, she said, "Most of them exhausted their benefits by January."
Since November, rural North Dakota has been hammered by twin forces, snow accumulations up to five time normal levels and a near tripling in prices of propane heating fuel, far faster than the increases in heating oil and gasoline this winter.
With propane prices jumping, to $1.30 a gallon from 50 cents in three months, the effects are clear.
"They are taking money out of food budgets," Mrs. Walking Elk said about the people in the assistance program. "In this weather, 100 gallons barely heats a house for a week. Furnaces go out. Pipes break, and people go to live with relatives."
Facing three more months of winter, the tribe is diverting profits from its modest casino to pay for home deliveries of propane.
Standing in the tribal office today, Jerome Otter Robe recalled how his extended family survived last week after their furnace had shut down in the blizzard. "We turned on the electric stove," he said, "and went to bed with our clothes on. The bathroom froze up and started to reek."
As part of Federal disaster relief, Standing Rock has received an emergency fuel appropriation of $300 for each eligible household.
"We have two or three families living in one house," Jesse Taken Alive, local chairman for the Sioux, who prefer to call themselves Lakota, said before hurrying off to a meeting for emergency managers. "If it weren't for the extended family and kinship that is alive and well among Lakota people, we would have the homeless problem of the city."
In the below-zero weather, Mr. Taken Alive went on the tribal radio and threatened to have the police impound any cars that ventured onto the snowbound roads.
The single fatality on the reservation has been Darlene Cadotte, a worker at the casino who tried to race a blizzard home, where her seven children were waiting. The blizzard buried her car, killing her.
"I know people who left their houses and just drove around in their cars to keep warm," said Darren Pleets, a propane deliverer.
Inside the warm cab of the delivery truck, Jim Kraft, the driver, said on Tuesday that he had just about worked to the end of a list of 300 backlogged orders.
"We were stormed in for three days -- couldn't move a wheel," Mr. Kraft, who has delivered the gas for 35 years, said as he expertly maneuvered his truck through a narrow cut in a snowdrift. "This is a winter I won't forget for a long time."

HEADLINE: States Control Spending Despite the Tax Windfalls

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Five years of economic growth has left state governments flush with money. But instead of spending it, they are generally building rainy day funds and letting a little trickle back to residents through rebates and tax cuts.
The trend is a break from what usually happened when the economy boomed, when states often used increased tax revenues to make up for spending cuts or enacted programs postponed by an earlier recession. 
The states' new restraint on spending, and the trimming of tax rates, show both the response of elected officials to anti-tax sentiments and efforts to avoid a painful mix of spending cuts and tax increases in the next business decline, say officials who study state finances. The states are also wary about future financial aid from the Federal Government, the experts say.
Last year, the states on average held spending increases to 4 percent, not much above inflation, while their revenues grew at more than 6 percent. Over all, states count on personal income taxes for 31 percent of their revenues, while general sales taxes bring in one-third of the total. Most of the rest comes from taxes on corporations, tobacco, alcohol.
Nine states expect their revenues to be 10 percent above the figures projected in their budgets. Texas, Michigan, Minnesota and Indiana expect to pile up surpluses of more than $1 billion each.
This year, tax cuts or rebates will take effect in 27 states. In the last two years, tax reductions had been enacted by 32 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
"When you have had this surge in revenue growth in the past, the states spent a good share of it," said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association, who is a former deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office.
While more than half the nation's governors are busy honing images as tax cutters, many of the reductions have been tiny. More than half of the total dollar reductions were in New York and New Jersey, both led by Republican governors. Tax-rate cuts have reduced revenues by $4.2 billion in New York since George E. Pataki became Governor in 1995 and by $2.8 billion in New Jersey since Christine Todd Whitman became Governor in 1994.
State tax cuts in the last three years amounted to less than 1 percent of state government revenues nationwide, according to the Center for the Study of the States in Albany.
The big tax cuts in New York and New Jersey have been the exception to rebates and holding onto surplus revenues. The two states' aggressive tax reductions may put them in sharply contrasting positions to the rest of the country the next time the economy falters and tax revenues weaken.
One state with a conservative approach is Michigan, which had a surplus of nearly $1 billion, but did not cut taxes last year. Budget officials in several states said one reason to build surpluses before cutting tax rates was uncertainty about how to pay for jobless and welfare benefits for people who would be thrown out of work in the next recession.
Minnesota anticipates a $1.4 billion surplus in the current fiscal year and Gov. Arne H. Carlson, a Republican, is proposing to return $261 million in a one-time tax rebate that would be paid just before Christmas, and to cut the tax-rates to bring a $240 million yearly reduction in revenues.
Iowa, with just 2.8 million residents, has $440 million set aside, and is expected to add another $334 million this year. Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, has proposed a cut in the tax rate that would reduce income tax revenue by $200 million a year, which means the state's surpluses should increase next year if the economy continues to expand.
The states collected 6.2 percent more in tax revenues in the second quarter of 1996 than in the comparable period a year earlier, the Center for the Study of the States said in an analysis of the latest available detailed revenue data.
Donald J. Boyd, director of the center, said that in that quarter, state income taxes withheld from paychecks grew at 10 percent or more in nine states -- California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oregon, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And, if not for cuts in income tax rates, these tax receipts would have grown by double digits in three more states, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.
Taxes withheld from pay checks are considered relatively stable revenues. But in some states, including New York and New Jersey, even faster growth is taking place in tax payments on estimated income, which tend to be made by people with higher incomes who get much of it from bonuses and from the sale of stock and other assets. Stock prices are up currently but if they should fall, tax revenues from capital gains could diminish rapidly.
In New York and New Jersey, whose state income tax revenues are highly dependent on earnings of people in the financial services industry in Manhattan, bonuses also appear to be generating extra tax dollars. New York counts on the income tax for half of its revenues, a higher level than most states.
H. Carl McCall, the New York State Comptroller, has criticized the tax cuts backed by Governor Pataki. "He has cut taxes without a plan to get the revenue to make up for the cuts," Mr. McCall said. "The Governor's budget assumes that the boom on Wall Street will continue, but if that doesn't happen New York will be facing a serious problem."
The state expects a $1 billion surplus this year, which Governor Pataki wants to use for further tax cuts, putting aside $65 million in a rainy day fund, the maximum allowed by law. Mr. McCall said more of the surplus should be used to pay down debts or prepay expenses.
New Jersey also relies heavily on Wall Street bonuses for income tax revenues.
Connecticut, where a $200 million state income tax cut takes effect this year, is not as vulnerable to the economic ups and downs as it is to what Richard Netzer, a professor at New York University, calls "a long-term problem because of its enormous dependence on the rapidly contracting defense industries."
Tax revenues are coming in below projections only in Hawaii, where tourism has been flat; Idaho, where corporate income taxes are 37 percent below projections, and Tennessee, where overall revenues are 2 percent below projections.
No state is considering raising income, sales or business taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
But eight states are considering higher excise taxes, according to the conference. Higher gasoline taxes are being considered in Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin and higher cigarette taxes have been proposed in Alaska, Florida, Maryland, Oregon and New Hampshire. The Alaska proposal would raise the current 29-cents-a-pack levy by a dollar.
Georgia is phasing out one of the most regressive taxes in the country, a sales tax on groceries. Arkansas, Louisiana and Missouri are considering reducing sales taxes on food.
Some state budget officials say that surpluses may invite Washington to avoid helping the states.
"The Federal Government is talking seriously about balancing its budget," said Carl Koch, Iowa Deputy Treasurer, "and if the Federal Government realizes that the states have huge surpluses they are going to look to the states to solve some of Washington's problems."

Russia Falls Well Behind In Its Part of Space Station
Russia has fallen nearly a year behind schedule in building a module that is to be the centerpiece of an international space station. NASA will build a stopgap module to allow the station to go forward if economic troubles in Russia continue to affect its space program. A1
 
Chechens Prepare to Vote
After 21 months of brutal war with Russia, Chechens were preparing themselves and their scorched republic for presidential and parliamentary elections today. In the hope that the world will recognize the vote as fair, they have invited more than 100 foreign observers. The elections are seen by Chechens as the first step toward creating an independent republic. And that is precisely the Kremlin's worst fear. A1 

U.S. Shifts Balkan Strategy
Only a year ago, after the accord that ended the war in Bosnia was signed, the Clinton Administration viewed the Balkans' authoritarian leaders as the guarantors of the peace. Now, it has concluded that the days of Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia (above) and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia are numbered. It has quietly begun supporting their opponents and searching for a new generation of leaders. And it is seriously considering plans for commandos to capture some of the roughly 70 people indicted for war crimes. A3
 
Unrest Spreads in Albania
Violent protests by tens of thousands of people demanding money back from failed pyramid schemes spread across Albania in what may be the biggest challenge to the Government since the country threw off Stalinist rule five years ago. Legislators held an emergency session to give President Sali Berisha special powers to deal with the unrest, as some 35,000 protesters battled riot policemen in the capital. A3
 
Israeli Cabinet Investigated
The Israeli police began an investigation of a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's appointment of a new attorney general this month was part of a deal to win a plea bargain for a political ally on trial for bribery. According to the report, the deal was also intended to gain critical support from the Shas party for the troop withdrawal from most of Hebron. Mr. Netanyahu has denied the charges, but some Cabinet ministers warned that the allegations, if proven, could bring down the Government. A8
 
U.S. Said to Chide Germany
The United States has decided to increase its criticism of Germany for its restrictions on the Church of Scientology, The Washington Post reported. The Post quoted an Administration official as saying the State Department's annual survey of human rights around the world would criticize Germany for "a campaign of harassment and intimidation" against the church. Senior American officials said they were unaware of any major increase in criticism of Germany over the issue. A4

G.O.P. Promises of Access Attracted Biggest Donors
Republican fund-raisers have focused on large corporations and individuals with interests pending on Capitol Hill, making explicit promises of special rewards for big donors. Offering their biggest givers special access to lawmakers helped them increase the size of their largest contributions and the number of those big donations. Those who give more than $250,000 can have a party staff member help them with problems in Washington. A1
 
Harsh New Reality for Indians
The bitter winter weather that is plaguing tribes on the Northern Plains has highlighted the difficulties American Indians are having with Federal assistance. More than any other group in the United States, Indians depend on Federal aid. But the Government has cut money to help improve and weatherize their housing. A1
 
States Show Fiscal Restraint
Instead of spending the tax revenues that have flowed in during five years of economic growth, most states have been saving them. In previous good times, those governments have restored money to programs that were affected by earlier budget cuts or have offered tax rebates. But state leaders are trying to avoid tax increases or spending cuts in future downturns. They are also unsure of Federal aid. A10
 
Arena of Faith and Healing
America's religious landscape is increasingly a place of mass movements. Often, they speak in familiar terms, but these movements are developing outside the control of traditional denominations and religious leaders. Experts say the phenomenon -- exemplified by a new group, Women of Faith, that drew nearly 15,000 people to a rally in Cincinnati -- reflects the spirit of the age, a time of widespread longing for meaning and deep public distrust of established authority, whether secular or ecclesiastical. A10
 
New Hope for AIDS Treatment
A major AIDS meeting in Washington ended with the hope that experimental drugs will ease the burden of patients who now must undergo difficult drug regimens. Experts also hope that the new drugs can help those for whom existing medication is failing. A10
 
Rain Spares California, a Bit
A weekend round of storms did not deliver as much rain as flood-weary Californians feared, sparing the state's weakened levees and exhausted emergency personnel. Still, the rains unleashed mud and debris that closed the main road between San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. A12
 
Strike at G.M. Factory in Ohio
Almost 4,100 workers went on strike against General Motors at an Ohio plant that makes sport utility vehicles. A union official said the workers struck because of a backlog of grievances. The company's board was expected to raise dividends today, but now that is less likely. B8

Legislators in Albany To Vote on Gambling
As the New York State Legislature prepares to cast its deciding vote on a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling, a frenetic lobbying drive has erupted in Albany. Many lawmakers say they have been astonished by the size and aggressiveness of the opposition, a diverse group that includes Roman Catholic, mainstream Protestant and evangelical church leaders, environmentalists, officials in the thoroughbred horse racing industry and Donald J. Trump. The measure's supporters are mainly mayors and business owners from regions that would stand to gain casinos. B1
 
A Gasoline Tax Revolt?
At 43 cents a gallon, Connecticut's gasoline taxes are the nation's highest -- 13 cents a gallon higher than New York's. A growing number of the state's drivers are refusing to pay them, instead crossing state lines to fill their tanks. As recently as 1990 Connecticut's gas taxes were lower than in New York, but sharp, regular increases pushed them ahead in 1992, and a 1993 law set more increases. This rat-a-tat-tat of increases, the informal boycott and a campaign by service station owners have led officials in Hartford to talk of a gas tax revolt and to make reducing the taxes the top priority of the new legislative session. B4
 
Questions on Trenton Budget
Governor Whitman has depended on almost $4.2 billion in temporary measures during her first term to help balance New Jersey's budget. And in her new $16 billion budget, she will propose on Wednesday another $800 million more in so-called one-shots, which are sources of money that the state cannot necessarily depend on in future years. Critics say the Whitman administration's practices, particularly changes to the state's public employee pension system, have heightened the risk that taxpayers may have to pay more later. But Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, insists that the Whitman administration's budget maneuvers have been fiscally prudent. B4
 
Budget Cuts Drive Tuitions Up
As state governments keep whittling away their support for higher education, tuition at public institutions is likely to continue rising as financial aid shrinks, moving college further beyond the reach of poor students, education experts say. To some experts, New York State is a case in point. B1
 
Street Repairs Continue
Repairs to the Manhattan streets that buckled after a water main break on Friday are taking longer than expected. Only two of the lanes on Seventh Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets will be open today, and city officials said it could be sometime Tuesday, or even early Wednesday, before all lanes of Seventh Avenue are open to traffic. They acknowledged that even such a small problem area could clog southbound traffic on Seventh Avenue all the way up to Central Park South, where the avenue begins. B3

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXXI;
On a Day for Mouthing Off, Desmond Howard's Gallops Speak Loudest for Packers

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Kick returner Desmond Howard is about 180 pounds, which makes him a pipsqueak in football. But there he was after his explosive 31-yard punt return to open the first series for the Green Bay Packers tonight, sticking his face in a group of New England Patriots players and talking trash. One of those players was a 300-pound offensive lineman, Bruce Armstrong. Not exactly a smart thing for Howard to do.
But this was the Super Bowl and Howard's juices were flowing, his family was watching, and he was not going to show restraint. Fear was not a factor. And Howard wasn't exactly happy with the Patriots, especially after his college teammate at the University of Michigan, safety Corwin Brown, had said last week that he was going to "smash" Howard during the game and then strike a Heisman pose over his body. 
 "There was a lot of mouthing going on," Howard said about his confrontation with nearly half the Patriots' bench. "There were some expletives in there."
Howard would have the last word. Maybe it was just fate, but what followed Howard's return was big play after big play for the Packers in their 35-21 victory over the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI.
Howard had one of the most explosive days for a return specialist in Super Bowl history. His kickoff return in the second half for 99 yards and a touchdown was the longest in Super Bowl history. He finished the game with 4 kick returns for 154 yards and 6 punt returns for 90 yards. The 244 total return yards matched the Super Bowl record set by San Diego's Andre Coleman in 1995. Coleman's 8 kickoff returns included a 98-yard touchdown run.
So impressive was Howard that he was named the game's most valuable player, an unprecedented award for a special-teams player.
"I really didn't expect them to kick me the ball that much," Howard said. "But as I've said before, you can roll the dice and kick it to me if you want. But if you keep doing it, you're going to get burned eventually."
The big plays came pouring in for the Packers. In addition to Howard, Brett Favre had two long pass plays for touchdowns, one to Andre Rison on the second play of that first series for 54 yards and the other an 81-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, a Super Bowl record for the longest pass play.
Despite the big plays on offense, the defense of the Packers should not be overlooked. Coming into the game, there were expectations that Patriots Coach Bill Parcells would find a way to put a kink in the offensive game plan of Mike Holmgren, the Packers' coach. But it was the Packers' defensive coordinator, Fritz Shurmur, who came up huge.
With the Patriots leading by 14-10 in the second quarter and facing a third-and-10 on their own 42, a corner blitz by Doug Evans put a nasty hit on quarterback Drew Bledsoe that sent the ball spiraling incomplete. If New England had scored on that drive, the game might have turned out differently.
Then, later in the quarter, the Packers' LeRoy Butler had a 9-yard sack on a safety blitz, and later put pressure on Bledsoe in another blitz that caused him to throw the ball earlier than he wanted. It skipped on the ground incomplete.
The most spectacular plays by far came from Howard, who came to Green Bay with his Heisman Trophy in need of some good polishing. A castoff from the Washington Redskins, he was criticized there for his lack of energy bursting off the line of scrimmage and a lack of overall toughness -- not to mention his falling asleep in meetings. After he was put on the expansion list by Washington, claimed by Jacksonville and then released, the Packers took a chance on him.
"Obviously, I never quit on myself," Howard said after the game, "or I wouldn't be standing here."
Sometimes all a player needs is a change of scene -- and a stage.
The biggest play of the game came after the Patriots had cut a 13-point Green Bay lead to 27-21 with 3 minutes 27 seconds left in the third quarter. The Patriots had been kicking to Howard all evening, and Patriots punter Tom Tupa again kicked the ball right down the middle of the field to him. That's a no-no.
The seams opened just at the right time and just in the right places, and at about the 40-yard line, Howard broke loose. He followed Don Beebe up the middle and bolted by Tupa as if Tupa were a planted turnip. Howard then jetted into the end zone.
This time, there was no trash talking because no Patriots were in sight. That made the score 35-21.
"Obviously it was a backbreaker," Howard said. "They had just scored, they had the momentum. Then we have my return, and that was basically the game."
Of all the pre-game hype, in all of the news conferences, in all of the prognostications, few people expected Howard would be the one to break the hearts of the Patriots.
Or be the one to get a phone call from President Clinton, who had watched on television. He told Howard he would see him in Washington, since the Packers were invited to the White House. Howard has come a long way, from the unemployment line to talking football with the President.

HEADLINE: Latin Arms Sales Help Stabilize the Region;
A Bad-Neighbor Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In proposing that the United States resume the sale of advanced weapon systems to Latin America, the outgoing Secretaries of State and Defense, Warren Christopher and William J. Perry, fell prey to bureaucracies with little sense of history. 
 You also criticize this recommendation (editorial, Jan. 20).
In earlier days, uncontrolled United States arms sales contributed to bloodshed and economic distress in the region. The Carter Administration halted this. And in one of the cold war's hottest periods, the Reagan Administration hardly wavered in the effort to prevent the proliferation of advanced weapons in Latin America.
President Clinton, who has enjoyed several major policy successes in the region, would put the future (and American lives) at risk by fostering a costly arms race for the sake of short-term exports.
A remilitarization of Latin America would mean diversion of resources for development, a more troubled region that is more open to drug cartels, and less healthy democracies.
The President should now direct Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to work with Latin America to construct a regional regime for conventional arms limitations that is focused on advanced weaponry. Under a regional regime, the United States -- and Russia and France, for example -- could sell weapons, including aircraft, only if they fit the region's criteria, guaranteeing that a Pandora's box of regional rivalries would not be reopened by unrestrained purchases of advanced weapons.
A decision by the President simply to lift the ban on advanced weapons to Latin America would be seen by many Latin Americans as a bad-neighbor policy, not the stuff for a place in history.

HEADLINE: Private Social Security Won't Hurt Families

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Save Social Security, Save Our Families" (Op-Ed, Jan. 23), Gary L. Bauer is correct to say that the Social Security system favors families with stay-at-home mothers, but he is wrong to conclude that privatization of the system would hurt those families. Because returns to private investment are much greater than the benefits the elderly get in exchange for payroll taxes, not one demographic group loses under privatization. 
 True, dual-earner couples would benefit more than traditional families under privatization. However, I hope that Mr. Bauer would not reject a plan that makes those traditional families better off simply because others will be even better off.
Mr. Bauer is also wrong to think that a move to privatization would create a transition problem because of Social Security's huge unfinanced liability. This liability exists regardless of whether we privatize or not. At least with a private system, the economy will grow faster and make it easier to fulfill the promises the Government has made.
Mr. Bauer poses an inaccurate question when he asks whether we should have workers put their money in stock rather than in raising children. The real choice is whether workers should have a private option that will greatly bolster their retirement income or whether they should be forced to send their money to a government scheme that, to the extent it avoids bankruptcy, will pay them far less and leave them less secure.

HEADLINE: Americans Don't Want 'Auto-Choice' Insurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Do you truly believe that justice should be class-based ("Ending the Litigation Gravy Train," editorial, Jan. 21)? 
 By restricting the availability of damages for permanent injuries like gross disfigurement only to those able to pay expensive premiums, "auto-choice" insurance leaves consumers of moderate or little means to make a Faustian bargain with insurers: yes, you can purchase cheaper insurance, but don't expect justice when an accident leaves you with a lifetime of suffering.
"Auto-choice" ignores three realities. First, Americans don't want it. If, as you say, "everyone would win" under auto-choice, why did Californians defeat a ballot initiative on this issue last March by a 2-to-l margin?
Second, far from being a cure-all, auto-choice only succeeds in raising premiums and putting more of our money into the pockets of insurance companies. From 1989 to 1994, the average annual premium increase in states without no-fault insurance was 50 percent lower than in no-fault states.
Third, auto-choice runs roughshod over personal responsibility. Why should good drivers pay for bad ones? Having to forfeit your right to sue because your economic status precludes it undermines the principles of accountability that anchor our society.
If auto-choice only means higher industry profits and less accountability for bad drivers, there's no choice to be made.

HEADLINE: Art Dealers Outraged By Auction in Florida

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Fakes are a fact of life in the art world. They slip into even the finest museum collections and auction or gallery offerings, usually one at a time.
But on Sunday, some prominent art dealers charge, a Florida auctioneer plans to put not one, not two, but dozens on the block attributed to artists like Piet Mondrian, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jasper Johns and Helen Frankenthaler. 
 "It looks like virtually nothing in the catalogue is authentic," said Robert C. Graham Jr., president of James Graham & Sons, a gallery on upper Madison Avenue. Richard York, who owns a gallery on East 65th Street, said, "It's the most outrageous catalogue of questionable paintings any of us has ever seen." And James N. Goodman, a 57th Street dealer and president of the Art Dealers Association of America, said, "We're trying to get the authorities down there to do something."
Law enforcement officials confirm that they are on the case. "We are looking into allegations to determine if there are any that are criminal in nature," said Scott Dressler, a Florida assistant state attorney who is head of Broward County's Economic Crimes Division. "We are coordinating our efforts with the F.B.I."
Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is also investigating, he said.
But C. B. Charles, the 70-year-old with at least one blemish on his auction record who is planning to wield the gavel, said the sale would go on. He said the 294 works of art being offered, all from his gallery in Pompano Beach, Fla., were authentic.
In a telephone interview, the dealer said he had heard nothing from the authorities. But Mr. Charles -- known previously for selling the furniture, clothing, costume jewelry and other belongings of celebrities like Mary Pickford, Orson Welles, Mae West and Audrey Meadows -- did acknowledge that he had received complaints from art dealers and others about some paintings in the sale.
"We're shocking the art world, there's no question about it," he said.
But he said that the dealers were upset because his offerings are estimated to sell at much lower prices than paintings in their inventories. "It's like putting my hand in their pocket," he said. There are to be no minimum bids, which is unusual in major art sales.
The auction at C. B. Charles Galleries came to the art world's attention after the January issues of three glossy art magazines appeared with full-page color ads announcing "A Highly Important Art Auction" of 19th- and 20th-century Impressionist, Modern and contemporary works of art from an unidentified owner. In artspeak, the phrase "highly important" connotes paintings of some significance, not merely run-of-the-mill works.
Illustrating the ads were "Poppy," attributed to O'Keeffe, in Art and Auction; "Abstract Composition," attributed to Arshile Gorky, in Art News, and "Colored Composition," attributed to Mondrian, in Art and Antiques.
All three looked more than suspicious to some dealers. The catalogue, which several ordered by mail, reinforced their view that the works on sale are bogus.
Lot No. 114, "The Bird," described as a wood sculpture attributed to Brancusi, was one giveaway. Althea Spear's "Brancusi's Birds," a monograph that lists all such works by the artist, states specifically that "there is not a single bird in wood." Wood, Ms. Spear writes, is "too thick-grained and unreliable to allow for a form as subtle and precise as the Bird."
A 1918 charcoal drawing attributed to Egon Schiele also has the telltale signs of a forgery, according to Jane Kallir, the author of Schiele's catalogue raisonne. "I can't condemn this with 100 percent certainty without seeing the original, but this looks to me like a pastiche of genuine works," she said. "The thing that is most damning is the very ornate signature S initial. It is typical of the way he signed things in 1909, but not the way he signed things in 1918."
Ms. Kallir, an expert in Austrian and German art and a director of Gallerie St. Etienne on West 57th Street, also questioned a painting attributed to Gustav Klimt. "It is a very famous painting, and it's large," unlike the work being offered, she said. "Klimt did not do another and he did not do a study for it, to the best of my knowledge."
Several living artists also disavowed the paintings attributed to them. After looking at photographs in the catalogue, Ms. Frankenthaler, Mr. Johns, Jim Dine and Jack Levine denied through their dealers the authenticity of the works.
Art experts also point out that the catalogue is riddled with misrenderings of artists' names that verge on the comical: Windslow, instead of Winslow, Homer; Oscar, instead of Oskar, Kokoschka; and Camile Pissaro, instead of Camille Pissarro. "That's an old tactic in country auctions," said Mr. Graham, the Madison Avenue dealer. "To slightly misspell a name so they can't be held responsible for the authenticity."
In appearance, the Charles catalogue comes close to those published by Christie's and Sotheby's, even offering telephone bidding. But dealers pointed out that not a single entry lists the provenance, relevant exhibitions or publication of the works.
Mr. Charles counters that the anonymous owner bought the paintings from private owners, not dealers or auctioneers. "The problem here is that these paintings have never been exposed," he said. "Why would they appear in any of the archives?"
More troubling are the sales terms. Buyers commonly purchase works "as is." But while Sotheby's and Christie's voluntarily guarantee for five years works made after 1870, Mr. Charles offered what amounts to a 30-day guarantee. Any claims must be accompanied by written documentation from a scholar or recognized expert that the work is not as described in the catalogue. Getting such documentation in 30 days is next to impossible, art experts said.
"We're comfortable with what we're selling," Mr. Charles said. "If we sell something and it's not right, we're prepared to make a full refund on the major pieces. We'll extend to 90 days. But how long can we do it? I'm not Christie's and Sotheby's."
While he has been an auctioneer for 40 years, Mr. Charles said, "this is my first serious venture into the mega-bucks field." He also said he had "no art training whatsoever; this is not my field." His staff consists of six people, none art experts. The consignor put estimates on the paintings for the sale, he said.
Mr. Charles has been in the news before. In December 1995, the Florida Board of Auctioneers put him on probation for a year after an action against him in North Carolina. There, Mr. Charles settled charges in January 1994 that he had used false bidders, allowed an unlicensed man to call bids at an auction in Asheville, N.C., failed to maintain sales records required by law and failed to meet financial requirements, among other violations of state regulations. Mr. Charles permanently surrendered the state auctioneers' license he had been granted in August 1993 and pledged never to reapply in North Carolina.
Although Mr. Charles neither admitted nor denied the accusations, Wayne Woodard, the executive director of the North Carolina Auctioneer Licensing Board, said: "He was disciplined. It's like a plea bargaining."
Daryl Dempsey, a regulations specialist at the Florida board, said there had been no public complaints against Mr. Charles there.
Mr. Charles said yesterday that he was considering withdrawing "one or two pieces" from the sale. After receiving a fax from Barbara Lynes, who is compiling the catalogue raisonne for O'Keeffe, he said he was "concerned." Ms. Lynes, he said, is coming to view the painting this week.
A few dealers from New York may also be on hand to examine the works in person after they go on exhibition tomorrow.
Though the owner of the artworks is not identified, in the catalogue Mr. Charles refers to "a very prominent Southern family, whose ancestor was an important statesman who donated the land where West Point stands today."
That suggests that the paintings belong to descendants of Stephen Moore, who donated land to the United States Military Academy during the Revolution, according to Stephen Grove, the academy's historian. Later, in 1790, Mr. Moore was paid $11,000 for the land. Mr. Charles confirmed the Moore connection.
Speaking of the sale, Irving Luntz, who has been an art dealer in southern Florida for 37 years, said: "I can't believe that this will go forward. I've seen things being sold that are fake, but this is burlesque. The F.B.I. or the Department of Consumer Affairs or someone will stop it. If not, God bless America."

Charles Galleries catalogue lists "Heart" by Jim Dine (top) and "Abstract Composition" by Helen Frankenthaler. Both artists denied that the works were theirs. (Photographs from the C. B.

HEADLINE: Oil Deals and Arms Sales

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's tendency to let commercial opportunities override sensible national security policies is troubling. Recent days brought word that last summer business considerations led the White House to waive a law prohibiting American companies from doing business with countries that sponsor terrorism. Specifically, officials gave approval to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation to take part in a $930 million oil project in Sudan.
The Administration has also dropped a longstanding ban on sales of the Amraam air-to-air missile to countries outside NATO. The decision cripples efforts to negotiate limits on arms sales and increases the risk that this highly effective weapon may one day be used against America or its allies. The ban was dropped to allow American aerospace companies to gain a competitive edge over Russian and French rivals. 
 The most effective way to fight terrorism or restrain arms sales is through international action. But with the world's biggest economy and its most technologically advanced arms industry, America can exert considerable influence on its own, provided it maintains strict and consistent standards. When Washington starts selectively enforcing its own rules, its policies become meaningless.
Sudan's radical Islamic Government supports international terrorists. The Administration blames it for a 1995 assassination attempt against Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, and last year expelled a Sudanese diplomat for plotting to bomb the United Nations headquarters. Helping Sudan's oil industry does not serve American interests.
A few months ago, the Administration judged Sudan's Government so threatening that it decided to provide military equipment to rebel groups based in three neighboring countries. When news of the American military deliveries became public, Sudan decided to exclude Occidental from the oil project.
Washington's policy toward the Sudanese regime now seems hopelessly confused. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did little to clarify it at her introductory news conference last Friday. Even as she called for new United Nations sanctions against Sudan, she endorsed the decision to let Occidental bid for the oil contract.
The Amraam missile sales remain on track. In 1995 the Administration gave Lockheed permission to include the missiles along with 80 F-16 fighter planes the company was trying to sell to the United Arab Emirates. That gave Lockheed an edge over its French competitors. But it also set a damaging precedent. Soon Thailand also demanded Amraams as a sweetener for buying American jets. Thailand's bid has already been conditionally approved, making similar demands from other Southeast Asian countries certain.
American efforts to combat terrorism and limit the sale of advanced weapons cannot be suspended every time an attractive business deal appears. Before long, the waivers and exceptions will become the policy, and Washington will be left with a set of hollow principles.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXXI;
For Packers, 1 Wedge of Cheese at a Time

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 27

 BODY:
As the National Football League's champions, the Packers took the Vince Lombardi Trophy back to Green Bay today. Now they have to find a way to keep it.
"I think one of our goals when we first came to Green Bay was to develop a consistent playoff-caliber team," Coach Mike Holmgren said today at a news conference. "Our organization is very sound. Bob Harlan as president of the Packers gives Ron and myself everything that a coach and general manager can ask for. Ron Wolf just signed a new extension or is in the process of signing a new extension. We'll be very, very solid at the top." 
 The Packers have a lot of work to do if they want to be as dominant as San Francisco and Dallas have been in the 1990's. They must manage the salary cap, keep their own free agents while attracting those from other teams and maintain continuity on the coaching staff.
"We'll make our mistakes down the road, but if we continue to build like we have been building, there's no reason to believe we won't be a playoff-caliber team in years to come," Holmgren said. "The difficult thing is trying to keep your players together, because they'll have opportunities now to test the waters. Success creates some problems for you, believe it or not. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now we're at the top of the world and I'm feeling very, very good about it."
If the offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis leaves to take a head-coaching job, the Packers will lose a shrewd architect of game plans and play calling.
Wolf is one of the most knowledgeable general managers in the game and an astute judge of talent. The Packers will have to rely on him to replace the aging defensive stars -- free safety Eugene Robinson (a 12-year veteran) and defensive ends Sean Jones (13 years) and Reggie White (12 years).
The Packers have the 35-year-old White locked up for four more years. At his age, White might not fulfill his contract, but he is respected in the locker room and an integral part of the team.
Wolf is also working on a contract extension for Brett Favre. There have been reports that Favre, the league's two-time most valuable player, could command a signing bonus of more than $12 million.
If they sign Favre to a huge contract, the Packers won't be able shop for expensive free agents the way that Dallas and San Francisco did to keep their championship edge.
A couple of weeks ago in Green Bay, Wolf was asked whether the Packers -- a publicly owned team with limited financial resources -- would be able to keep up with teams like Dallas and San Francisco, who have found ways to circumvent the salary cap and sign high-priced, high-profile free agents.
"I certainly hope we can," Wolf said. "Now, that remains to be seen. There are other ways to compete. Economics don't always mean winning. An unfortunate aspect we've seen here in professional football the last few years is the introduction of those two free-agent teams and they got to play in the championship game." Wolf was referring to the expansion Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars, who played in their respective conferences' championship games this season.
Wolf added: "That's a clear indication to me for the first time in professional football that money can in fact have an effect on a game. You can come in now, buy a team and be representative. That never happened in football before. That's a concern to me."
It means it will be harder for Green Bay to stay at the top. Having won a Super Bowl, it's going to be difficult to convince their key free agents -- defensive tackle Gilbert Brown, linebacker Wayne Simmons, receiver and kick returner Desmond Howard (the m.v.p. in the Super Bowl), kicker Chris Jacke, center Frank Winters, Jones and running back Dorsey Levens -- that they are better off in Green Bay with less money than they can get someplace else.
Wolf said free agency has changed the game's value system.
"It's become a little harder, because now you have to put a dollar sign on that player," Wolf said. "Not only evaluate what position he's going to play, but how much is he worth at the particular position he's going to play."
Howard is a prime example of a bargain player the Packers got last season, but whose price is certain to go up because of his success Sunday night.
On the plus side, the Packers' Super Bowl victory will attract players who are willing to work for less simply to have a chance to win a championship. The 49ers and the Cowboys have been trading on that for years. Wolf said he hopes, that in terms of talent, the players coming and going will cancel each other out.
Wolf believes the remarkable aspect about the Packers is that they have been a resilient team that has been able to replace injured players.
"Look at what happened this year to the Dallas Cowboys when suddenly Jay Novacek wasn't there," Wolf said. "Suddenly things didn't quite work the way they wanted them to work. All of a sudden Michael Irvin wasn't there for the first five games and then Kevin Williams wasn't there for a while.
"They couldn't really function or didn't function as you would expect them to function as a world champion. Up here we lose Robert Brooks, we lose Antonio Freeman. Don Beebe comes in and plays. Freeman comes back. Andre Rison comes in and plays. Keith Jackson comes in and plays. Nothing really changes, which is a great tribute to Brett Favre."
In a sense the easy part, winning the championship, is behind the Packers. Now, the hard part, keeping it, has only begun.

HEADLINE: G.M. Increases Payout and Sets Stock Buyback

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 27

 BODY:
With its cash reserves soaring and its pension plan fully financed, the General Motors Corporation announced a dividend increase and a $2.5 billion stock buyback today in its first big effort to reduce the number of shares outstanding.
G.M. raised the quarterly dividend on its common stock to 50 cents a share from 40 cents, the third 10-cent increase since May 1995. The company intends to buy back roughly 5 percent of the shares outstanding over the next 12 months, which could drive up the value of the remaining shares by making them more scarce. 
 Both moves reflect the confidence of G.M.'s board that the company is back on a firm footing after a close brush with financial disaster during the 1991 recession. The auto maker's vast North American operations, while still losing market share at a brisk pace, are no longer hemorrhaging cash after four years of cost reductions and strong economic growth in the United States. G.M.'s automotive subsidiaries in Europe and Latin America have been doing well, partly at the expense of the Ford Motor Company's overseas operations.
G.M. has also learned to operate with smaller inventories of auto parts and finished vehicles, thereby reducing the amount of capital tied up in the running of its daily business. Partly for this reason, the company's cash reserves, just $10.2 billion at the end of 1995, had climbed to $17 billion by the end of December, considerably in excess of G.M.'s target of $13 billion.
G.M.'s pension funds, $24 billion in the red in 1992, are now fully financed after the company contributed $8 billion of stock in Electronic Data Systems to them and after the pension funds' stocks soared with the rest of the market in the last several years. G.M. spun off Electronic Data Systems last summer.
The fast-growing satellite operations of the Hughes Electronics Corporation, a G.M. subsidiary, have been a big user of cash in recent years. But earlier this month, Hughes announced that its aerospace division would borrow $4.4 billion and give the cash to the satellite operations. The aerospace division is then to be merged with the Raytheon Company, which will assume the aerospace division's debt as part of a complex transaction designed to help G.M. avoid taxes.
Standard & Poor's reaffirmed G.M.'s A-minus credit rating today. "The realization of significant operational improvements in its automotive operations enables G.M. to sustain the planned actions to reward shareholders at the current rating level," the rating agency said.
Some Wall Street analysts had been calling for an even larger dividend increase, but G.M. officials were nervous about raising the dividend to a level so high that it might have to be cut in the next recession. John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said that the company's actions today were "returning capital to shareholders in a manner which is sustainable throughout the business cycle."
Despite the dividend increase and the stock repurchase program, G.M.'s shares lost as much as $2.75 today before rising in the afternoon to close at $61.875, down 62.5 cents. David Garrity, an auto analyst at Smith Barney, said that many short-term investors had recently bought G.M. stock in preparation for today's long-expected announcement, and liquidated their stakes afterward.
"People had bought on the expectation of the dividend increase and the buyback, and sold on the news," Mr. Garrity said.
G.M. still has many problems, and is widely expected to announce on Tuesday that its earnings in 1996 fell considerably below 1995 levels. The company's share of the United States light-vehicle market last month, 30.3 percent, was down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier. Part of G.M.'s problem was that the rising dollar allowed foreign auto makers to stop raising prices and to offer more rebates and other incentives. But there were also many signs that buyers had wearied of the company's older models, while G.M.'s factories were slow to produce the 15 new models on which the company is now pinning its hopes.
The biggest hit to earnings last year came from three strikes, which by the company's initial estimates reduced after-tax profits by $1.6 billion. Some 4,100 workers went on strike Saturday night at a G.M. factory in Moraine, Ohio, that produces the Oldsmobile Bravada, the Chevrolet Blazer and the GMC Jimmy.
George Dunaway, a vice president of local 801 of the International Union of Electronic Workers, which called the strike, said late this afternoon that the union wanted to resolve hundreds of grievances.
G.M. has repurchased $800 million worth of stock over the last two years for reissue to executives and employees under various benefit programs and executive stock options. These purchases will continue, separately from the $2.5 billion program.
While G.M. occasionally purchased slightly more shares during the late 1980's than it reissued, today marks the first time that G.M. has announced a program to buy back stock so as to reduce the number of outstanding shares, said James J. Finn, a G.M. spokesman. Back in the 1950's and 1960's, when G.M. held half the American auto market and was strongly profitable, the company chose to share the proceeds with shareholders through special dividends rather than repurchase shares.
Today, G.M. also increased the quarterly dividend on its class H stock, which tracks the earnings of Hughes Electronics, to 25 cents from 24 cents. The class H dividend and the common stock dividend are payable on March 10 to shareholders of record on Feb. 6, 1997.

HEADLINE: Severe Winter Hurts Sales of Existing Homes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Home resales fell 3.5 percent in December, more than expected, largely because of severe winter weather, the National Association of Realtors reported today.
For the full year, however, sales of existing homes set a record, rising above four million units for the first time. Economists said they expected sales to slow somewhat during 1997. 
 Home resales are an important measure of the health of the housing industry over all because previously owned homes account for about 85 percent of all sales of single-family homes in this country.
Hurt by snow in the Midwest and floods in the West, home resales during December fell to an annual rate of 3.87 million units. The 3.5 percent decrease from November exceeded the decline of only three-tenths of 1 percent that analysts, on average, had expected.
November's increase in resales was revised to 1 percent from 1.8 percent, the association said.
In all of 1996, resales rose to 4.086 million homes, breaking the old record, set in 1978, of 3.99 million units. "The soft landing of the economy and favorable interest rates contributed to affordable conditions in the first-time home buyer and move-up home buyer markets," said the association's chief economist, John Tuccillo.
The association's president, Russell Booth, said: "In general, the market is as strong now as it was a year ago. The winter months generally produce a slower home sales pace, mainly because of adverse weather conditions in many parts of the nation."
The president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, Jack Guynn, said last week that as the year progressed, "housing will probably slow somewhat, mainly because most of the pent-up demand has been met, but also because of demographics constraints. Now that we're feeling the effects of the baby-bust generation, there simply aren't as many new families out there looking for apartments and houses as there were in the 1970's and early 1980's."
Mortgage rates rose for most of the last year. Even so, 1996's highest average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was about three percentage points below the level of early 1989 -- and less than half the 1981 peak.
In December, the average principal and interest payment on a $100,000 loan was $706.07, higher than December 1995's $678.79 but still a bargain compared with March 1989's $954.59. Those figures do not include tax, fire insurance or escrow costs.
Today's report showed that the average price of a previously owned home increased 2 percent in December, to $147,100 from November's $144,200.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Card Giant Announces New Job Cuts

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Continuing to tighten its belt in the face of brutal competition in the credit card industry, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 3,300 jobs, or about 4.6 percent of its work force, this year.
The layoffs were not expected because American Express has already subjected itself to three waves of re-engineering and cost-cutting since 1991, eliminating a total of 12,000 jobs. By its own count, these efforts have reduced its annual operating costs by nearly $2 billion.
American Express did, however, have money to spend from a $300 million after-tax gain on the sale of its holding of First Data Corporation stock. It set aside $138 million of that for a special charge to cover the severance costs of another round of cutbacks.
All of the job cuts will be in the Travel Related Services unit, which issues credit and charge cards. Of the cuts, 2,000 will be outside the United States, affecting about 8 percent of the overseas work force.
The company said the cutbacks would not increase earnings because the money saved would be invested in new business ventures.
In the fourth quarter of last year, American Express earned $595 million, including the First Data gain and the restructuring charge, a 55 percent increase from a year earlier, the company said yesterday. Excluding the one-time items, the company's earnings were $433 million, up 13 percent from the previous year. Revenue continued to grow at the sluggish pace of 5.1 percent, to $4.3 billion.
Excluding the special items, the company earned 90 cents a share, about what analysts had expected.
The card unit, the company's largest, earned $299 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the special charge, up 12 percent.
American Express is beginning to show some success in its effort to compete with banks that issue Mastercard and Visa credit cards. It has been pushing a line of Optima cards, which charge interest on unpaid balances, unlike its traditional green and gold charge cards. Loan balances on its Optima cards increased by 28 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to $12.7 billion. But net revenue from finance charges increased only 4.5 percent, to $3.1 billion, presumably because much of the growth in lending balances was at low initial "teaser" interest rates.
Total cards in force increased by 1.2 million in the fourth quarter, up from the one million new cards issued in the third quarter.
"This was a great quarter," said Susan Roth, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Their volume is growing almost as fast as Visa and Mastercard, so they are not losing share anymore," she said.
The wave of consumer defaults on credit card loans has hit American Express, with its write-offs increasing to 5.2 percent in the latest quarter from 4.5 percent a year earlier, although that increase has not been as sharp as at other issuers.
Still, American Express appears to believe that the Optima strategy is not enough to restore its growth and has been trying to recruit banks to issue American Express-branded cards. While several banks outside of the United States have joined its program, no domestic bank has signed up.
Harvey Golub, American Express's chairman, offered to sell the company to Citicorp late last year, although talks have stopped. Analysts say this is a sign that Mr. Golub is pessimistic about American Express's prospects on its own.
"The behavior by Harvey Golub over the last year has not been the behavior of a market leader," said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
By contrast, American Express Financial Advisers, the company's investment and insurance sales unit, continued to grow briskly in the last quarter of 1996, propelled by the bull market. It earned $155 million in the fourth quarter, up 17 percent from the year before.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Rebukes China Over Rights

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
By the end of 1996, there were no active dissidents left in China who had not been jailed or exiled, Clinton Administration officials said today, describing the conclusion they reached for the United States Government's annual report on human rights conditions.
One official described the Chinese success at wiping out active dissent as "an accomplishment even post-Stalinist Russia could not achieve." A China expert outside the Government who has seen the draft report, now circulating at the White House and other agencies for comment, said that it is "hard-hitting" and makes no effort to "disguise China's retreat on human rights in 1996." 
 The report on China, one of 193 reports on human rights around the world to be made public on Thursday, is also one of the most sensitive. The Clinton Administration is trying to establish a policy of "constructive engagement" with China that the new Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, calls multifaceted. Under the approach, no one issue -- whether human rights or the spread of nuclear weapons -- would dominate and distort the relationship, and high-level meetings could go ahead.
There is something of an annual ritual now in sharp criticism of China in the human rights report, followed by policy decisions that play down the importance of human rights in the overall relationship, compared with other issues like trade, Taiwan, arms sales, missile and nuclear proliferation, and Beijing's help in controlling regional actors like North Korea.
Another report, on Germany, criticizes discrimination against members of the Church of Scientology, which Washington regards as a religion and Bonn considers a cult. But State Department officials said this year's criticism was only marginally more extensive than last year's.
The place of human rights in relations with China is a preoccupation of the White House and State Department. The Administration wants to be seen to "keep the faith," as one senior official said, with dissidents in China and to keep human rights an important factor in the overall United States-China relationship. A group of officials is on the way to China to discuss human rights and other issues. Ms. Albright is considering visiting Beijing next month when she makes her first extended foreign trip as Secretary of State to both Europe and Asia.
The main purpose of the current visit, officials said today, is to try to persuade the Chinese to make significant gestures on human rights that could justify the dropping by Washington of its co-sponsorship of an annual resolution condemning China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
The Chinese are already lobbying to defeat a resolution at the commission, which meets in early March and runs through April 18. The United States must decide soon whether to co-sponsor a resolution, as it has for the last seven years, to allow the measure any chance of success.
The United States, in a message to European Union officials last week called a "Coordinated Human Rights Approach to China," made available to The New York Times, said the United States is "continuing to talk to the Chinese about what meaningful, concrete steps they might take to avoid confrontation in Geneva."
According to the document, these are the steps that China might take:
*It might release some noted political prisoners on the grounds of medical need.
*It might sign and submit for ratification two international human rights convenants -- one on political and civil rights and the other on economic, social and cultural rights.
*It might resume talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross on allowing regular prison visits.
The Chinese have begun to lobby against a resolution, the document says.
Last week China suddenly offered to resume, on Feb. 14 in Singapore, a long-stagnant European Union-Chinese dialogue on human rights. That has effectively put the European Union on hold until Feb. 24 -- too close to the Geneva meeting to allow joint lobbying with the United States.

U.S. Bonds Slump Ahead Of New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices continued to slump yesterday, dragged down by concerns over coming economic data and their potential impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
The price for a 30-year bond dropped 20/32, to 94 16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.94 percent, from 6.88 percent on Friday. The yield is now at its highest level since Sept. 24, when it stood at 6.94 percent. 
 Among the chief concerns of investors is the release today of the employment cost index for the fourth quarter.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, San Francisco, said a reading of 1 percent or more in the index would hurt bond prices, leading investors to begin pricing in the prospect of an increase in short-term interest rates at next month's meeting of Fed policy makers. "The line here expects the fourth quarter to show a 1.1 percent increase that will bring E.C.I. growth for all of 1996 to 3.3 percent," she said. "This represents the first year-on-year gain to come in above the psychologically meaningful 3 percent mark since 1994, and more importantly the largest yearly compensation increase since a 3.5 percent gain in 1993."
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management -- a Washington company with more than $2 billion in bonds under management -- noted that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, had said that the employment cost index number was the most important indicator of wage trends.
"What is in the minds of investors going into tomorrow's E.C.I. is that the third quarter was subdued at six-tenths of 1 percent," Mr. Carpenter said. "And it was subdued because it was based on very few commissions paid to commission salesman in an environment of big ticket items that was soft." In the fourth quarter there was presumably a large rebound, which most people thought would have generated more commissions and therefore wage and salary gains.
Other reports that are expected to point toward an upswing in growth, prompting a sooner-than-expected move on rates by the Fed, include tomorrow's release of durable goods orders for December. And on Friday, the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey for January, reports on fourth-quarter gross domestic product and new home sales will be released.
Yesterday's report on existing- home sales had little impact on bond prices. December home sales were at 3.87 million units, lower than the 4 million that were forecast. Maury N. Harris, chief economists at Paine Webber Inc., said the December existing-home sales decline plus the earlier reported housing starts decline were good reasons for the Fed not to tighten rates at the meeting of Fed policy makers on Feb. 4 and 5.
In the corporate market, supply was heavy yesterday as the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, which owns and operates more than 75 acute care hospitals and numerous health- related centers, priced $2 billion of below-investment-grade notes in three parts through Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to partly help pay for the purchase of the Ornda Healthcorp, along with a new $2.8 billion credit facility.
Traders said yesterday's weekly Treasury bill auction went about as expected, with the average discount rate for a three-month issue at 5.06 percent, up from 5.03 percent last week, and the six-month issues at 5.12 percent, up a basis point from last week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In when-issued trading, the Treasury's new 10-year inflation-pegged notes were being offered at a price to yield 3.48 percent, down one basis point from last week. On Thursday the Government also plans to sell a new one-year bill. Yesterday the current issue rate was 5.32 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: At a 'Tax Free' Pep Rally, Giuliani Claims Clothing Sales Almost Doubled

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
With a good deal more enthusiasm than hard economic data, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went to a pep rally sponsored by a large retailer yesterday to claim that clothing sales in New York City almost doubled last week when the sales tax was eliminated as a brief experiment.
It turns out that his estimate was mostly anecdotal, based on telephone calls with a few dozen local merchants who roughly estimated their own increase in sales. The merchants themselves have a strong incentive to see the 8.25 percent sales tax on clothing dropped for good, as was demonstrated by the rally staged by Modell's, the sporting goods chain. The company brought in 150 employees to cheer almost every sentence of the Mayor's and chant, "Ru-dy, Ru-dy!" 
 But the absence of actual sales figures did not stop Mr. Giuliani from making the case -- as he had all week -- that the city's appreciation of tax-free clothes should send a signal to Albany that the tax should be permanently dropped.
"I don't think there's anyone now that doesn't believe that if you reduce this tax, you're going to end up with more income, with a lot more jobs and help for people who need it the most," he said at the rally, held just outside a Modell's store in the Manhattan Mall at 33d Street and Avenue of the Americas near Herald Square. "I think we're into debating when should it happen."
Economists have said that there may be a serious case for eliminating the sales tax on clothing in New York State, but that it cannot be justified solely on the basis of a week's experience. Because shoppers packed several weeks of clothes purchases into one week, they said, the experiment's impact is more likely to be political than economic.
The most likely political beneficiary of the campaign against an unpopular tax is the Mayor himself, just as he begins his re-election drive. All last week, Mr. Giuliani appeared at televised news conferences in retail stores denouncing the tax. In fact, his administration used $300,000 in tax dollars to take out radio and print advertisements encouraging people to shop during the week, each of which prominently featured the Mayor.
The Mayor has defended the ads as a legitimate governmental effort to stimulate the city's economy. Yesterday, he said the city probably took in more sales tax revenue last week than it would in a normal week.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said city employees called about 50 merchants to gather estimates of retail sales after the week ended on Friday night. He said the merchants did not have to provide actual sales figures, only rough estimates of how much they believed business had risen during the week. Those estimates were then averaged into the citywide estimate of a 94 percent increase.
The actual sales increase may never be known, because stores are not required to declare their week-by-week sales receipts.
Mr. Millard, a former City Council member, said the estimate should be seen only as a guideline for the order of magnitude of the increase, not a precise figure. That did not stop the Mayor's office, however, from estimating that all sales during the week had increased by $390 million in a chart displayed for the cameras.
The dollar figure was derived, according to Mr. Millard, by taking the United States Department of Commerce's estimate for clothing sales in New York City, dividing it by 52 to approximate a week, and then applying to it the already rough 94 percent increase estimate from the retailers.
A chart released by the administration of 16 retailers and their sales increase estimates consisted mostly of very round numbers like 100 percent increases, 150 percent and even 300 percent increases. A merchant on the list made it clear that the estimate was more like a guess.
"It was a very good week," said John Brunetti, the president of Leather and Fur Ranch, a Staten Island outerwear store listed as having a 300 percent increase. "I'd say our sales went up 2.5 to 3 times, which is what I told the Mayor's office."
The Mayor said he wants the sales tax eliminated by Dec. 1, to stimulate holiday sales later this year, but officials in Albany seem unlikely to move that quickly. Gov. George E. Pataki said last week that while the elimination of the tax was inevitable, it probably could not be cut this year.
Because New Jersey does not impose sales tax on clothing, local merchants have long complained that they are losing sales to shoppers who cross the river to buy clothes.

HEADLINE: State Attorneys General Urge Limits on Campaign Spending

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The top law-enforcement officials of 24 states are calling for the reversal of a 1976 Supreme Court decision that equated limits on political-campaign spending with limits on free speech and thereby undid some of the spending curbs enacted after the Watergate scandals.
"As state attorneys general -- many of us elected -- we believe the experience of campaigns teaches the lesson that unlimited campaign spending threatens the integrity of the election process," the 24 officials said in a statement released tonight. 
 The statement, to be made public on Tuesday, comes amid a growing nationwide clamor over the amounts spent by candidates running for offices at the Federal, state and local level. Perhaps even more fundamentally, as illustrated by the remarks of lawyers on opposite sides of the latest dispute, it underlines a basic disagreement over the very function of money in the electoral process:
Is money, at least in large amounts, akin to a cancer within the democratic process? Or is it the means by which the people make their voices heard, especially if those voices are raised against an entrenched incumbent?
John Bonifaz, counsel to the National Voting Rights Institute, a Boston organization that helped gather support for overturning the 1976 High Court ruling, holds to the first view. The present lack of spending limits, he said tonight, perpetuates a deeply flawed political system in which "less than 1 percent of the people give 80 percent of the money in Federal campaigns, and 96 percent of the people don't give at all."
To which Chris Finney, a Cincinnati lawyer in the other camp, replied, "Hogwash."
"Spending limits are unconstitutional infringements on the rights of voters and candidates," Mr. Finney said in a telephone interview. "If Bonifaz is right, then George Washington and Ben Franklin and everyone else who participated in framing the Constitution is wrong."
Mr. Finney represents John Kruse, a businessman who twice ran unsuccessfully for the Cincinnati City Council, spending more than $200,000 in his second attempt. Mr. Kruse is suing to overturn a 1995 ordinance that would take effect this year and limit council candidates to spending $140,000 in the primary and general election campaigns.
The City of Cincinnati will defend its ordinance against Mr. Kruse's suit on Friday at a hearing in Federal District Court before Judge Herman J. Weber of Cincinnati.
Whichever way Judge Weber rules, there will be an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. Mr. Bonifaz and Mr. Finney agreed that the Cincinnati case, along with similar campaign-finance disputes from other circuits, will almost surely make their way to the Supreme Court some months from now.
Only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice John Paul Stephens remain from the Court that in 1976 nullified some of the restrictions that Congress had enacted to reduce campaign spending, even as it left restrictions on contributions.
Many constitutional scholars and politicians have expressed dismay over what they see is excessive, and potentially corrupting, spending to win office.
The statement noted that there had been a 700 percent increase in the cost of Federal elections since the 1976 ruling, "and inflation didn't go up 700 percent since then," Mr. Bonifaz said.
As for voluntary campaign-spending limits, Mr. Bonifaz said that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and his Republican challenger, Gov. William F. Weld, agreed to limit their spending to $6.5 million last year but that both went way over their self-imposed ceilings as Election Day neared.
Of the attorneys general who called for the reversal of the 1976 ruling, 19 are Democrats and 5 are Republicans. The signers include Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat. As of tonight, neither Dennis C. Vacco of New York Statenor Peter Verniero of New Jersey, both Republicans, had signed.
Tom Miller of Iowa, Grant Woods of Arizona and Frankie Sue Del Papa of Nevada were the lead attorneys general in gathering support for the statement. "Maybe it wasn't clear in 1976, but it is clear today that financing of campaigns have gotten totally out of control," Mr. Miller said.
Whatever the Court does is certain to reverberate through the state courts and, consequently, to how campaigns are run at every level.
As for the Cincinnati case, Mr. Finney said that his client was a middle-class computer salesman, not some fat-cat high-roller, and that he raised money by making people believe in him.

HEADLINE: Swiss Envoy to U.S. Resigns After His Report on Holocaust Dispute Is Disclosed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Switzerland's Ambassador to the United States resigned today after the publication of a long diplomatic cable in which he advised his Government to make up its mind about how to deal with disclosures about its role as banker to Nazi Germany, and concluded with a warning that "this is a war which Switzerland must conduct on the foreign and domestic front, and must win."
The Ambassador, Carlo Jagmetti, a longtime Swiss diplomat who was scheduled to retire this summer, also concluded his strategy paper with a warning that the groups representing Holocaust victims seeking recompense from Swiss banks are "opponents" who "cannot be trusted." 
 Today, in a letter to the Swiss President and the federal councillors who have struggled in recent weeks to contain the controversy, Mr. Jagmetti said he regretted "having offended the sensibilities of Jewish groups and the public with some expressions in the report," some of which he said were "misconstrued."
"It was never my intention to want to gloss over events which occurred in the years before, during and after World War II or to question the necessity of openly coming to terms with the past."
In fact, in an interview with The New York Times a week ago Mr. Jagmetti complained that his Government had vacillated between a policy of confrontation and conciliation with Jewish groups and the American officials, including Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican, who have pressed the Swiss Government and its banks to allow a thorough review of their dealings with Nazi Germany and the accounts opened by Holocaust victims. But he had the air of a diplomat who, from a post far from his own capital, was having trouble getting the attention of his own Government.
Mr. Jagmetti's memo was written on Dec. 19, well before the decision by the Swiss Government last week to accede to demands that it set up a compensation fund for elderly Holocaust victims who may not live long enough to see the results of historical research that is now under way in the United States and Europe.
But the Swiss Government declined to say how big the fund would be, leading to speculation that Switzerland was mounting a campaign to stem the damage to its reputation, but was still wavering on how to solve what has become one of its biggest foreign policy crises in years.
Most of Mr. Jagmetti's cable dealt with his advice that Switzerland recognize that the dispute over charges that it laundered Nazi gold -- and its treatment of Holocaust victims, survivors and their descendants -- was "going to be a long affair" that could take years to resolve. It will trigger, he said, "difficult soul-searching."
In laying out the options facing his Government, he said, "If you thought that Jewish circles and Senator D'Amato could be quickly satisfied, and you want to do a deal to get this solved, that is one way of looking at it." But he doubted the questions would go away even if such a deal was struck.
It was the references to Switzerland's need to conduct a "war" and his disparaging remarks about the character of those pressing Switzerland that got the diplomat in trouble. The Clinton Administration was quick to denounce his comments.
"If it's true that the Swiss Ambassador made these remarks, it betrays a fundamental lack of understanding about the commitment that the United States Government has to its own citizens and to the search for justice for people who had their human rights fundamentally violated during the Second World War," said Nicholas Burns, State Department spokesman. "It's very troubling."
Mr. Jagmetti's cable marked the second time in less than a month that a senior Swiss official's comments have fueled the fire that the country insists it is trying to douse.
At the end of February the country's outgoing President, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, accused Jewish groups of trying to "blackmail" Switzerland into creating a compensation fund. Mr. Delamuraz, now the Economics Minister, later apologized for that comment. But he did not withdraw his accusation in the same interview that the United States and Britain were using the controversy to destroy Switzerland as a world financial center.
In his interview at the Swiss Embassy here 10 days ago, Mr. Jagmetti described Mr. Delamuraz's comments as "a major mistake," but attributed them to the Swiss reaction to "an artillery fire that comes constantly, the grenades exploding all around" in the forms of the discovery and re-discovery of old documents detailing links between the banks and the Third Reich.
He was also critical of Mr. D'Amato, who has selectively released some of those recently declassified documents, saying the Senator is "considered rather aggressive in Switzerland." In contrast, Mr. Burns said at the State Department that the New York Senator is "doing the Lord's work" in pressing the Swiss Government to answer questions that have long been kept at bay.
Mr. D'Amato said in a telephone interview today that Mr. Jagmetti "did the right thing by resigning."
"One person in the Swiss Government saying this kind of thing, of course that is not right. But the Ambassador? It goes way over the line. It shows an attitude."
While Mr. Jagmetti apologized for his cable, his letter of resignation today expressed outrage that it had leaked. He demanded an investigation, a step that Mr. D'Amato and others compared to the Swiss moves to investigate the security guard who disclosed two weeks ago that the Union Bank of Switzerland was shredding documents that go back to World War II. American Jewish groups have said they will raise funds to defend the guard if he is prosecuted.

HEADLINE: In the Utah Wilderness, A Question of Definition

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: ARCH CANYON, Utah

 BODY:
Some Utah environmentalists, when they want a dose of activism, hike into the remote red canyons in the southern part of the state to look at roads that they say are not really there.
The quest, seeming like something out of "Don Quixote," is their tactic in a growing fight over millions of acres in the state, the latest battle in the decades-long struggle over control of Federal lands in the West. 
Conservation groups have sought to set aside as much as 5.7 million acres in the state as wilderness, and President Clinton took a step in that direction last year by designating 1.7 million acres as a protected national monument.
But state and local officials are vehemently resisting possible wilderness designations, which by law are limited to places without roads. To fight the plan, they are affirming that thousands of little-known trails are established roads and that the Federal Government cannot legally block the right of way along them.
The counties have claimed about 5,000 such roads in Utah. They crisscross maps of the canyonlands like crows' tracks. On the ground, though, some of the actual tracks were left by cattle, or by off-road vehicles, or recently by county bulldozers.
Volunteers from the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance have set out to visit and document these byways, mile by mile, as a step toward legally challenging the claims and preserving the wilderness potential.
Earlier this month in Arch Canyon, near the town of Blanding, one such road lay invisible, if indeed it could be said to exist at all, beneath two feet of snow. The trailhead was two miles beyond the paved highway, an hour's hike up a graded but unplowed road that rose through pinon and juniper and big cottonwood trees. Where the graded road ended, a slender, rough track continued, crossing a frozen stream and disappearing around a bend, beyond the remnants of ancient Anasazi cliff dwellings and up the rugged canyon.
The Wilderness Alliance, which for years has been pressing an ambitious proposal to preserve the canyons, wants thousands of acres in these parts to be set aside. But in the summer, this canyon is a playground for four-wheel-drive and all-terrain vehicles that can penetrate for miles up the canyon.
And if the definition of a road includes anyplace an off-road vehicle has left its mark, then, the local government says, this canyon's rough-hewn bottom is a bona fide county right of way and its existence precludes making Arch Canyon and its surroundings part of a wilderness, where machines would be forbidden.
Even more striking was another trail that off-road vehicles sometimes climb, up a steep gorge carved by the Colorado River in Moab, just outside Arches National Park. The only things that marked this perilous hard-rock track were the scars from spinning rubber and the stains of oil that had bled from the lacerated underbellies of the vehicles.
"If this is a road, then the only wilderness we would be left with would have to be surrounded entirely by cliffs," said Scott Groene, issues director for the wilderness group.
But his view seems to be held by only a minority in Utah, where about half of the group's roughly 20,000 members live.
County governments are opposed to setting aside vast tracts as wilderness, believing that mining, ranching, recreation and other uses of the land are in Utah's best economic interest.
The state's delegation in Congress agrees, and along with the counties the lawmakers are taking advantage of peculiar old laws about what qualifies as a road.
Back in 1866, Congress passed a law called Revised Statute 2477 that insured miners routes to their claims, and cattlemen trails for their herds, by granting the right of way over any Federal land not otherwise set aside. The law was repealed in 1976 by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, but the new law recognized all valid existing claims to rights of way as of that date.
Arguments over what is and is not a valid roadway have raged ever since, especially in Utah and in Alaska, another state with vast Federal land holdings.
The Interior Department issued regulations in 1988 that defined roads liberally, but Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has just issued a stricter definition. The question may be decided in Congress, where the state's delegation has signaled its opposition to Mr. Babbitt's approach.
County officials have begun to send out bulldozers to widen some of the trails into roads, sometimes in defiance of the Bureau of Land Management, the Federal agency that controls the land.
With varying degrees of civility, visitors to Arch Canyon had left their own views of the matter scrawled on a sheet of paper posted by the bureau for that purpose at the entrance to the disputed right of way.
"Please ban A.T.V.'s," said one note, referring to all-terrain recreational vehicles.
"Now that the road is legally here, what is important is how good stewards we are," said another entry.
County officials say it is a myth that their road claims are spurious, or that the road claims are intended to stave off wilderness designations.
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 froze into law all previously existing rights of way, and the Wilderness Act of 1964 precludes establishing wilderness except in roadless areas, the Utah Association of Counties argues.
The current state of repair or disrepair of any road over a valid right of way, the counties assert in a discussion of the issue they have published, is "totally irrelevant" to the counties' rights, which include the right to maintain the road and even to upgrade it, within limits.
Nevertheless, the wilderness alliance is assembling fat binders of data on thousands of these roads. In a cluttered office in Salt Lake City, members of the group meet every Wednesday night to pore over maps of the state's remotest regions and to plan surveys by volunteers.
The group records data like whether the route is a cattle path, a footpath or a track laid down by off-road vehicles; whether there is any sign that the right of way has been maintained, and whether erosion or a rock slide has closed the route. Photographs are taken every mile or so.
"The real joy of this job is when a volunteer comes in, their eyes this big," said Gail Hoskisson, one of the project's coordinators. "They want to talk for hours about what they have seen. They are really bonded to the land."

HEADLINE: CLINTON WILL SEEK TAX BREAK TO EASE PATH OFF WELFARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In keeping with a campaign promise, President Clinton will soon ask Congress to provide tax credits to businesses that hire long-term welfare recipients, Administration officials said today.
But even before the proposal is formally made, critics have begun to express doubts about whether such credits will achieve their goal. Economists inside the Government and at several universities said that similar credits in the past had provided a windfall to employers without significantly increasing the number of poor people hired. 
 In the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to create one million jobs for welfare recipients by the year 2000. The new welfare law, signed by Mr. Clinton on Aug. 22, will send hundreds of thousands of people into the job market because it requires most adults on welfare to work within two years of receiving aid.
Under Mr. Clinton's new proposal, to be included in his budget next week, employers could take a credit equal to 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages paid to long-term welfare recipients, a somewhat larger subsidy than has been available in the past. Such tax credits have been allowed, in one form or another, for 25 years. The tax credit proposed by Mr. Clinton would be available for hiring people who had been on welfare for at least 18 months. By contrast, the current tax credit, equal to 35 percent of the first $6,000 in wages, is available for hiring people who have been on welfare for 9 of the last 18 months.
Charles C. Masten, inspector general of the Labor Department, said he had studied a tax subsidy known as the targeted jobs tax credit, which provided credits to employers who hired welfare recipients and members of several other low-income groups. That credit was created in 1978 and expired on Jan. 1, 1995.
Mr. Masten reported in 1994 that the tax credit had "virtually no impact on employers' decisions to hire members" of the target groups. Indeed, he said, 92 percent of the workers hired under the program would have been hired without the tax credit.
After conducting several audits, Mr. Masten said, "I can only conclude that the tax credit is a windfall for employers since the program is inconsequential in encouraging the employment" of welfare recipients and the other groups it was intended to help.
Moreover, he wrote, "The costs of the targeted jobs tax credit program far exceed its benefits." Auditors estimated that the program had cost $374 million a year and had produced benefits of $140 million a year in wages for people who would not otherwise have been hired. Mr. Masten concluded, "Only about 37 cents of economic benefits were returned for each dollar in tax credits and administrative costs."
But Rahm I. Emanuel, a senior adviser to the President, said tonight that Administration officials believed that the proposed new tax credit would be more effective than earlier versions. It was "just one piece of an overall strategy to make work more attractive than welfare," Mr. Emanuel said, adding that the other elements included child care, an increase in the minimum wage, health insurance for people leaving welfare and transportation to help people get to their jobs.
Gene B. Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, said, "We specifically designed the proposal for a new tax credit with criticism of the old one in mind."
Critics said 70 percent to 90 percent of the people hired under previous programs would have been hired without tax credits. But Mr. Sperling said that employers on their own were unlikely to hire the intended beneficiaries of the proposed new tax credit: people on welfare for 18 months.
Indeed, some employers say that they will be reluctant to hire long-term welfare recipients even with the tax credit. A person on welfare for 18 months or more is unlikely to have the skills, experience or work ethic that employers seek, they say.
Linda Levine, an economist at the Congressional Research Service, said there had been two problems with earlier versions of the tax credit for hiring welfare recipients. In many cases, she said, employers did not know whether job applicants were on welfare because they did not ask, in part because employers feared that they would be sued if they asked. Thus, she said, "the tax credit was usually irrelevant to the hiring decision" and did not alter employers' behavior.
On the other hand, she said, job applicants who advertised the fact that they were on welfare were often stigmatized, and companies were less likely to hire them because the employers believed that they would be less productive than other employees.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has studied the use of the tax credit, said in an interview: "People got fewer job offers if they mentioned to employers that they were covered by this tax subsidy. The result was exactly the reverse of what we anticipated."
Robert B. Reich, who stepped down on Jan. 12 as Secretary of Labor, said that Congress last year passed legislation "to reform the worst abuses in the targeted jobs tax credit program." But he said that such credits would not be a panacea.
In an interview last week, he said: "What worries me about tax credits to induce employers to hire people off welfare is that they may become a sort of stigma. It's like a scarlet letter, a sign to employers that this person could not otherwise get a job."
William A. Signer, a lobbyist for companies that use the tax credit, said the stigma had declined in recent years, as large companies made greater use of the credit.
Mr. Signer said the tax credit had helped hotels, restaurants, supermarkets and other retail stores that hire inexperienced workers with minimal skills and little education. In view of the changes made last year, he said, employers who participate in the program now have a clear incentive to hire more welfare recipients and others who are chronically unemployed.
Republicans in Congress have praised President Clinton for trying to enlist business executives in the effort to hire welfare recipients. But they have also urged him to proceed with caution. In a recent letter to Mr. Clinton, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, "Welfare recipients should not be given jobs at the expense of the working poor who may not qualify for a corporate tax credit but who nonetheless still need jobs."
Earlier versions of the tax credit spawned a whole industry of personnel consultants who did the paper work necessary to get the tax credit for employers. These companies became potent lobbyists for the tax credit.
"A number of studies found that employers did not significantly change their recruitment policies, but instead relied upon consulting firms to determine which of their newly hired workers coincidentally were members of the eligible population," said Ms. Levine of the Congressional Research Service. "Perhaps somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of the credits claimed under the targeted jobs tax credit program were for hiring that would have occurred without benefit of the credit."

HEADLINE: Long Island Dominates Science Contest

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
It was lucky for Ward Melville High School that Jonathan William Plaue chose to enter the Westinghouse Science competition.
Mr. Plaue, 17, a senior at the school in Setauket, L.I., blended asphalt and ash to see if it would make a viable road-paving substance. His question: Would it be an economical and environmentally safe way to dispose of ash? 
 To test his theory, Mr. Plaue raised $125,000 and "repaved 25 percent of our parking lot at no cost to us," said the school's principal, Robert C. McKean.
Yesterday, he found out his project had earned him more than the school's gratitude. He was named one of 40 national finalists in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, the most prestigious high school science competition in the country.
Mr. Plaue, who lives in Stony Brook, was one of 11 students from Long Island who were named finalists, giving Long Island by far the most winners of any region in the country.
New Yorkers usually do well, and this year there were 18 winners from the state. But in most years, New York City schools -- particularly those with selective enrollment -- outstrip all others. This year, New York City had five winners, with the traditional powerhouses of Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science having only one winner each. The other city schools with winners were Benjamin N. Cardozo in Bayside, Queens; Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and Hunter College High School in Manhattan.
Mr. McKean, whose school had three finalists, the most of any school this year, said several Long Island schools had worked hard to nurture scientific ability in their students. And he could not resist putting in a plug for high per-pupil spending.
"Long Island gets a lot of criticism for spending so much money on educating each student," he said. "I think the positive side to that is that Long Island kids get great education."
Two other schools from Long Island had two finalists each, Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School in Port Washington and Lawrence High School in Lawrence. Only one other school in the country had more than one finalist: Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va.
Several of this year's finalists worked on projects with a psychological, anthropological or sociological bent -- a measure of Westinghouse's increasing recognition of the legitimacy of social sciences.
Ann Clair Seiferle-Valencia, 17, of Farmington, N.M., spent four years poring over archaeological records to study the death of the culture of the Chacoan Anasazi people. The ancient Native American community prospered for 500 years in an area about 80 miles from her hometown and disappeared, suddenly and inexplicably, around the year 1200.
Ms. Seiferle-Valencia, whose father's ancestors can be traced 500 years in New Mexico, said she concluded that the Chacoan Anasazi ruined themselves by growing too quickly.
"They were adapting too fast to keep up with themselves," she said. "There's an important moral in that: a culture is never permanent."
Kathryn Joanna Potenza, 17, of Setauket, studied how parents' marriages and mothers' attitudes toward relationships influenced their teen-age children's approach to relationships. She asked about their views on "how far to go on a date, what kind of communication is necessary to maintain a good relationship, what kind of conflict resolution techniques they use," Ms. Potenza said.
She said she found that "the parents' marriage doesn't operate as a direct model, but it plays an indirect role because it affects the parent's ability to supervise her child. If she's happy in her own marriage, she's better able to supervise her child."
Roletta Chen, 18, of Flushing, surveyed 600 people ranging in age from 15 to 79 and concluded that younger, single and less-educated people were more goal-oriented than older, married and more educated people, who seem to place more value on experience, rather than outcomes.
The Westinghouse competition has long been considered a good barometer of the scientific potential of the nation's top students. Five Westinghouse winners have gone on to win Nobel prizes. In March, the 40 finalists will compete for 10 scholarships, with the highest worth $40,000.
Over the years, projects have become increasingly sophisticated, burrowing into the same mysteries as top scientists and physicians are studying.
Adam Amiel Friedman, 18, of Ridgeland, Miss., studied the anticancer properties of broccoli, and, the Westinghouse report said, "he believes his research, carried out at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, shows statistically significant, targeted inhibition of cancerous tumor growth."
Stephen Oskoui, 17, of Pittsford, N.Y., conducted research on laser fusion, a project he squeezed in while running the web site and software development company he started two years ago.
And Joanna Beatrice Byar, 17, of Willingboro, N.J., studied the ability of the Indian mustard plant to reclaim soil contaminated with six heavy metals.
Ms. Byar, who has been schooled at home for almost all her life, said studying at home had given her great advantages.
"Number one, it gives me the flexibility of time to do lab work," Ms. Byar said. "And it allows me to pursue the things I'm interested in. I don't have to be rushed by a 45-minute time slot."

HEADLINE: Riding Wall St. on Autopilot: Indexed Funds Draw Investors

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Time was when most American investors chose their own stocks, one at a time. More recently they asked mutual fund managers to do the picking for them.
Now cocky, as the longest bull market in history continues without a substantial decline, many are deciding that they no longer need an expert to find the best investments. Instead, they are investing in mutual funds whose sole purpose is to mimic the performance of the stock market. 
 Known as index funds, these funds simply hold shares in all the companies that make up a popular stock market index -- for example, the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which, after the Dow Jones industrial average, is the most widely followed market barometer. In essence, these funds run on autopilot, giving up the chance to do any better than the market average but also guaranteeing that except for the nominal cost of running the fund, they will do no worse.
The ascendancy of index funds has come as many Americans, exuberant over the winning performance of the stock market, are convinced that all that is required to make money is to be in the market -- period.
"Everybody remembers that the market went up 23 percent last year and 37 percent the year before that," said John J. Brennan, president of the Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest mutual fund company. "When the market goes down 100 points in a day, it's quickly forgotten."
But even the people who sell index funds say that many investors appear to be full of misconceptions about the relative safety of their investment. Most notably, some novices have apparently mistaken the certainty that an index fund will match the market average for an assurance that it is an almost risk-free investment. In doing so, they have confused the diversification of their assets across a large number of stocks with the safer approach of spreading money among stocks, bonds and cash.
Index funds have been growing in popularity far faster than the mutual fund business as a whole. In the last decade, the amount of mutual fund money invested in the most widely held stock index funds has risen more than a hundredfold, to $65 billion -- a growth rate 18 times that of the overall fund industry. And much of that money found its way to index funds in just the last two years.
Indeed, the largest index fund, the Vanguard Index 500 fund, is gaining rapidly on the largest of all mutual funds, Fidelity Magellan. And now even mutual fund giants like Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch, which have long boasted of the stock-picking prowess of their money managers, have moved to offer investors more index funds of their own.
With their typically low costs, index funds are indeed one of the best ways to invest in the broad stock market, which has historically outperformed nearly all other investments. But what has caught the attention of recent investors is not just the long-run potential of index funds, but their short-term payoff. Over the last three years, index funds that track the S.& P. 500 performed better for their shareholders than did 93 percent of the 2,400 mutual funds that rely on money managers to pick and choose among a broad array of American stocks. (While index funds have done well recently, that has not always been the case: there have been long periods in which most of the actively managed stock funds outperformed the indexes).
Mr. Brennan of Vanguard, which is the largest seller of index funds, said he had heard an abundance of callers describe index funds as "safe options" earlier this month when he spent parts of several days answering calls from individual investors on the company's toll-free sales line. "That sends up all kinds of red flags for us," he said.
Partly, that misunderstanding is a function of ignorance, but it also reflects the fact that most recent investors have never experienced a bear market. More than 60 percent of the money in stock mutual funds, and 85 percent of that in index funds, has come into those funds since 1990, a period in which the major stock market indexes have never fallen more than 10 percent.
What will happen when the overall stock market goes down, of course, is that an index fund will fall just as much, perhaps even more. Unlike a general stock fund, an index fund cannot hold cash or other instruments to protect itself against a market decline. Moreover, the index funds, like the indexes themselves, are weighted by a company's market value. Therefore, movements in the price of the biggest stocks like General Electric, Coca-Cola and Exxon, have an outsized effect on the performance of the index. And it is those big stocks that have been the most successful in the recent market run-up. In a downturn, they might well fall farther than stocks that have not risen so much.
"If the market goes down, there's a good chance those stocks will lead the way down as well," said Melissa Brown, a quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities.
The growth of index funds has created a broader challenge for the mutual fund industry as a whole. Index funds, by their very nature, undermine the central tenet of the mutual fund business -- that individual investors who do not have the time to manage their own money should put their trust in a financial professional trading on their behalf.
But if index funds, which are much less profitable for the industry than traditional mutual funds, can consistently outperform professional stock pickers, investors are likely to demand better results to justify the higher fees that most mutual funds charge. Indeed, it is not clear that the industry's giants will be able to maintain the elaborate marketing and management structure they have built up if much of what they do is put on automatic pilot.
The rise in popularity of index funds also holds implications for investors generally, including those who have never used index funds. The last time index investing rose in popularity, in the late 1980's, pension funds and other so-called institutional investors were the driving force. This time, the trend has been driven by individual investors.
If the market turns down, and these less-seasoned investors become disenchanted, they might not just turn more cautious, as institutional investors tend to do in a bear market. They might also pull out of stocks altogether.
Investors are clearly pouring more and more money into index funds. A decade ago, index funds that tracked the S.& P. 500 had only $556 million in assets, less than half of 1 percent of the $146 billion in United States equity funds. Last year, though, assets in those funds topped $65 billion, or 4.4 percent of the $1.5 trillion in domestic equity funds. And of the $165 billion in new cash that flowed into American stock funds in the first 11 months of last year, index funds took in $15.2 billion, or more than 9 percent -- triple the portion of just two years before, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
Institutions, too, have been increasing the portion of their portfolios they devote to indexing. According to Greenwich Associates, a Connecticut investment research company, American pension funds last year devoted nearly 16 percent of their total assets, a larger portion than ever before, to stock index funds. Those assets accounted for one-third of the funds' holdings of American stocks.
The Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System is putting $700 million -- more than one-third of its equity holdings -- into a fund indexed to the S.& P. 500, said Jo Witt, secretary- treasurer of the system. That will increase by more than five times the amount of the pension fund's assets indexed to the stock market.
"It's been difficult for active managers to even match the S.& P. 500 returns," Ms. Witt said. "And it will cost us a lot less to have index managers than active managers."
But the very factors that have made indexing so attractive could lead to its downfall. The growth in indexing among both individuals and institutions means that a greater portion of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 are being bought and tucked away in funds that hold them for a very long time. With less of those stocks in general circulation, buyers of individual stocks in the S.& P. 500 have to pay more for them.
Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist, explains that when more financial resources are indexed, active managers have a greater impact on asset prices. Therefore, he said, "what makes sense for an individual -- to avoid the risk of underperformance by settling for the average return of a market index -- collectively increases the probability that market values will lurch from one extreme to another."
Now, the amount of stock held in mutual funds and pension funds tied to the S.& P. 500 is at its highest level ever -- more than $500 billion, estimates Gus Sauter, who oversees the Vanguard Index 500 fund. That is equal to about 10 percent of the value of all of the stocks in the S.& P. 500.
The eventual result of an indexing boom, said Ms. Brown, the Prudential analyst, is that the stocks in the index could become overvalued when measured against traditional yardsticks like earnings and book value. "Those valuations have nothing to do with anything except that a stock is in the index," she said.
In a rational market, that imbalance would correct itself in the normal course of business. But sometimes the correction can be unnerving, as in 1990, when indexing last was in vogue. In the third quarter of that year, the S.& P. 500 fell nearly 14 percent.
Few individual investors probably realize just how concentrated in a few issues the performance of the S.& P. 500 has been, said Brian Hersey, director of investment manager research at Towers Perrin, a pension fund consultant. Last year, just the 25 largest stocks in the S.& P. 500, which account for one-third of the value of the index, rose 37 percent, accounting for more than the entire gain of 23 percent in the index. Over all, the other 475 stocks collectively dragged the index down. The same situation occurred in 1995 and 1994, Mr. Hersey said. And the S.& P. 500 itself represents only a fraction of the more than 9,000 regularly traded stocks.
While novices in the market may have misconceptions, certainly most investors understand that if the stock market as a whole goes down, so will their index fund. And some of them vow to keep on investing through the inevitable bumps in the road.
Loren Schwiebert, an assistant professor of computer engineering at Wayne State University in Detroit, said he regarded indexing as the best option for him. "I'm 32," he said. "I think it would be hard to find an actively managed fund that will do better than the index for the next 35 years -- or even 25 or 20. In that sense, indexing is a more conservative option."
But few neophyte fund investors recall a period like the five years that ended in 1982, when more than 80 percent of actively managed portfolios performed better than the S.& P. 500. That was clear to Mr. Brennan of Vanguard this month. After he spent a few days hearing comments from callers to Vanguard, he ordered that a special article be prepared for this month's newletter for investors.
Under the headline "Remarkable returns may raise unrealistic expectations," the article also warned, "Indexing isn't invulnerable."


GRAPHIC: An index mutual fund aims to match the performance of a popular stock market barometer, like the Standard & Poor's 500 index. That is most easily achieved by holding all of the index's 500 stocks. But overhead expenses dictate that most index funds will deviate somewhat from the performance of the theoretical index. Therefore, some funds buy only the stocks which, because of their size, account for the largest portion of the index's performance, and others use futures contracts or similar derivatives to try to edge closer to the index's performance.
Table: "Bigger is SOmetimes Better"
Last year, the S&P 500 gained 22.96 percent, including reinvested dividends, while the gains of the 48 S&P 500 index funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services ranged from 22.31 percent to 23.06 percent.

HEADLINE: Tax-Free Savings Plans Urged in Albany for College Tuition

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
As college costs soar out of the reach of some families, legislators in Albany are considering plans to allow parents to start tax-exempt savings accounts for tuition while their children are still in diapers, or to pay tuition in advance at today's prices.
Twelve states have such systems in place, and as many as 30 more, including New Jersey and Connecticut, are weighing versions of the proposals. In Albany, the idea has the support of the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer, and of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat. 
 But several different versions are under consideration, and none of them is assured passage. Gov. George E. Pataki has expressed interest in the concept but has not taken a position. And Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, made clear yesterday that he would use the popularity of the concept as leverage in his effort to stave off further cuts to higher education in New York.
"I don't want this to cloud the main issue, which is cuts to higher education," Mr. Silver said. But he added that he would study the proposals.
Under the College Choices plan proposed yesterday by Mr. Bruno and Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Port Jefferson and chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, New Yorkers would be allowed to put up to $5,000 a year per child into a savings account for college without having to pay state taxes on the money or the earnings that it accrued.
Under Federal law, Federal taxes are also deferred on the interest or dividends such accounts earn until the money is withdrawn, though the initial contribution is not deductible.
Modeled after Individual Retirement Accounts, the Family College Account could be used for tuition, books and other supplies, but not for room or board. The money could be used at any college in the state, public or private. But a family would have to pay a penalty, to be determined, if the child went to college in another state or if the money were used for another purpose.
If a family ended up with more money in the account than needed to pay for college, it would be returned without penalty and taxed at the child's rate, or it could be rolled over into another child's education account.
A separate proposal by Mr. Bruno and Mr. LaValle would create Prepaid Tuition Accounts. They would apply only to the public universities, the State University and the City University. Parents concerned about rising tuition costs would lock in existing tuition rates by paying that amount immediately -- $3,400 a year at SUNY or $3,200 at CUNY -- or by signing up and paying over a period of time.
A private investment manager selected by a state-appointed oversight board would invest the money, and the earnings would be put in the account. If there were more money than needed when the child went to college, the excess would be returned, although taxes would be due.
But in case of shortages, the state would make up the difference.
As with the savings account, the money in the tuition account would be subject to a penalty if not used for the intended purpose.
"All of us know what is happening to college costs here in this state and throughout the country," Mr. Bruno said. "They're escalating beyond the reach of many families."
Mr. Bruno said he hoped that it would be possible to reach a compromise with Democrats who have offered similar measures and to pass the bill this year and make it effective on Jan. 1. "I think the chances are very good," he added.
Such tuition savings plans have been widely promoted as inexpensive ways to help many families, particularly in the middle class, shoulder the growing burden of college costs.
With tuitions averaging more than $3,000 a year at public universities and more than $20,000 a year at some private colleges, higher education is often the second-largest expenditure a family makes, after buying a house.
"This is the wave of the future," said Brian Fitzgerald, staff director for the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance in Washington.
For more than 20 years, tuitions for public and private colleges have risen faster than the rate of inflation, making college educations less affordable to many students. At the same time, state legislatures have cut financial aid to students and raised tuitions at public universities, which tends to hurt lower-income students the most.
This month, Mr. Pataki proposed a $400 tuition increase at the State University and the City University, as well as cuts in state tuition aid for students who also receive Federal support from Pell grants.
Many students have turned to loan programs to help pay for college. But concern is growing over the heavy debt that many students have taken on. And lower-income families are less likely to take out loans for college.
Not everyone, however, sees the new-style aid programs as a good idea. Edward C. Sullivan, Democrat of Manhattan and chairman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, expressed concern over the potential costs to the state.
"It's a potential ripoff," Mr. Sullivan said. "No one knows what tuition is going to be in 18 years, and this is a commitment of money for future legislatures. Talk about passing the buck."
More affluent people, he said, are in the best position to take advantage of tax-free savings plans. "Is this really what we are going to do with taxpayer money, give Donald Trump a subsidy?" Mr. Sullivan asked.
Although the proposals would rely heavily on individual savings, the programs would cost the state money. Mr. Bruno estimated that by 2003, the two plans would cost $61 million a year.

HEADLINE: Syrians Struggle to Decipher Assad Clan's Dirty Laundry

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Syrian capital can seem a nest of riddles, and what has befallen the Orchid restaurant may be merely where the puzzle starts. A committee descended on the elegant French spot one day in November to shut it down, and it has remained so ever since, with a dangling door-tag signed "Corruption-fighting section, Ministry of Supply."
What most intrigues its patrons is that the restaurant is owned by a nephew of Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad. People who have begun to piece together other developments of recent weeks have begun to wonder what is going on. 
 One of Mr. Assad's brothers, Jemil, has departed abruptly for Paris, where another brother, Rifaat, spent part of a long exile. Rifaat al-Assad, now back in Damascus and officially still a Vice President, is reported by foreign diplomats and prominent Syrians to be under heavy internal surveillance.
The owner of the star-crossed restaurant was one of Rifaat al-Assad's sons, yet he was just the first among the relatives of top Syrian officials whose business activities have been unceremoniously reined in. At the same time, Bashar al-Assad, 31, the President's eldest surviving son, has been newly christened on posters that have emerged around the capital as "our hope" for Syria's future.
When asked, Syrian officials have said that Jemil al-Assad is undergoing medical treatment, that Rifaat al-Assad may move about as he likes, and that the Orchid and other shuttered enterprises were guilty of unspecified irregularities. But diplomats and some prominent Syrians say they believe that something else may be in the works.
With President Assad now 66 years old and recovering from prostate surgery, they say, he may be trying both to clean house and to clear the way for a successor. Those people say it is probably no coincidence that Bashar al-Assad, who was trained in Britain to be an ophthalmologist and who had apparently given no thought to a political future until an elder brother was killed in an automobile accident three years ago, has been portrayed recently in the Syrian press as something of a Mr. Clean.
"The President has had it with his brothers and their sons, and he's trying to do something about it," a prominent Syrian said, presenting a view that is widely held within the diplomatic and business community.
Jemil al-Assad, 64, who grew rich by extracting commissions on business activity in the northern cities of Tartous and Latakia, spawned so much resentment there that he has harmed the family's stature, the diplomats and prominent Syrians say.
They say that Rifaat al-Assad, 59, who assembled squadrons of tanks in Damascus in an attempt to overthrow his brother in 1983, is suspected of trying to renew his ties to upper echelons of the Syrian military. As for the Orchid, which opened last April in the capital's exclusive Maalki district, it had emerged as a visible sign of the dominance exerted by the sons of top officials over lucrative enterprises.
Jemil al-Assad's departure for Paris late last month has not been reported in the official Syrian media. Damascus-based diplomats said they have been able to confirm it only within the last 10 days. But together with a bomb that exploded in a Syrian bus on New Year's Eve, killing 11 people but not announced by the Syrian media until two days later, and the fact that President Assad has not been seen in public since his surgery on Jan. 7, the signs of maneuvering within the upper ranks of the Government have created a mood of unease.
"Things feel very fragile," said one diplomat. He and others said they were struck by the fact that while Mr. Assad was reported to have attended a Jan. 21 wreath-laying ceremony on the third anniversary of the death of his son Basel, the President was the only senior official present whose photograph was not published.
Syrian officials say he was probably not pictured at his son's grave because it was a personal family moment.
Mr. Assad has a history of heart trouble and diabetes, but there is no evidence that he is suffering from anything more serious now than the aftereffects of surgery.
It has been more than 26 years since Mr. Assad seized power, however, and people have begun to wonder whether the latest moves might be related to the question of who will succeed him.
Under the Syrian constitution, the leader of Parliament takes temporary charge upon the death of the President, to await the governing Baath Party's nomination of a candidate to be presented to the Parliament and to voters for ratification. Mr. Assad has said that he does not have an opinion about who should take his place.
Until his death at age 33 in 1994, however, Mr. Assad's son Basel had been widely mentioned as a potential successor.
An engineer, army major and the leader of the Presidential Guards, he was a popular figure whose picture was a fixture along with his father's in shops, on storefronts and in taxis around the country.
Bashar al-Assad, the second of Mr. Assad's four sons, had shown no interest in politics or in the military, the historic route to power in Syria.
But immediately after his brother's death, he cut short his medical studies to return to Syria and enroll in the military staff college, from which he is to graduate this April.
Basel al-Assad, bearded and wearing sunglasses, remains the far more visible figure on posters around Syria, where he is regarded as a national martyr. Since late last year, however, the image of Bashar al-Assad, with his dark mustache, has emerged to claim a place among a trinity that includes his father and brother and carries the caption "our leader, our ideal, our hope."
Even more conspicuously, Government newspapers have published glowing articles in which a high-level official has described the younger Mr. Assad as "the hope for continuity of Assad's way."
People who have met Bashar al-Assad describe him as a thoughtful, modern-oriented man who is interested in setting the Syrian economy on a firmer course. His areas of responsibility now include oversight of an information technology committee weighing whether to permit Syrians easy access to the Internet. And like his brother before him, the younger Mr. Assad has been prominently photographed meeting with officials in Lebanon, where Syria maintains 35,000 troops.
Some diplomats question whether Bahsar al-Assad has the will and tenacity to wage a battle for power within his own country, if that becomes necessary. On the broader question of peace in the region, however, there has been no suggestion that he might be a closet dove, and after nearly 30 years in which Syrian officials have steadfastly insisted that Israel surrender every inch of the occupied Golan Heights, it would be difficult if not impossible for any successor to Mr. Assad to forsake that course.
Still, the inner affairs of the Syrian Government remain murky enough that diplomats here sometimes liken their work to the Kremlinology of the old Soviet Union.
And the diplomats and prominent Syrians, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, say it is impossible to judge to what extent the recent crackdowns might have been intended to eliminate possible rivals to the succession and to what extent they were intended to rid the administration of a widening taint of official corruption.
Among those said to have been disciplined, only Rifaat al-Assad, the one-time leader of the Presidential Guard, is regarded as someone who might still aspire to take control. He was exiled to Western Europe after the tense military standoff on the streets in which he tried seize power from his brother.
With the President's permission, Rifaat al-Assad returned to Syria in 1992 after the death of their mother, and the younger Mr. Assad has never been stripped of his vice-presidential title.
He has wielded little power since his return, and diplomats here say that beginning in late December he all but dropped from sight. They say it was believed at the highest levels of Syria's military and intelligence establishment that he had tried to establish ties with key officers among the country's current military leaders.
Jemil al-Assad, who has focused his energies on commerce, was never seen as having political ambitions, but his Mafia-style control over business in and around the country's two main ports has made him an increasing embarrassment.
Among those who complained about his activities, prominent Syrians say, were not only the Sunni Muslims who make up the majority of Syria's population but also members of the far smaller Alawite sect to which Mr. Assad and his family belong.
"All indications are that President Assad finally came to see him as a liability to the regime," a Damascus-based diplomat said.
Similarly, neither Somar al-Assad, the owner of the Orchid restaurant, nor other sons of top Syrian officials whose business dealings have reportedly been restricted are regarded by people in Syria as rivals for ultimate power.
But the plainclothes intelligence agents around the shuttered restaurant and its Italian twin, La Dolce Vita, along with the reticence of local shopkeepers to talk about what happened, suggests that the young entrepreneurs took their quest for material gain a step too far.
In recent years, President Assad has conferred increased responsibilities on one Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam.
Because the Syrian Constitution requires that a President be at least 40 years old, many people believe that for the short-term, Mr. Khaddam remains his most likely successor. People who have tried to detect patterns in what has happened this winter, however, say that they believe that Mr. Assad has someone else in mind.
"Hafez al-Assad clearly wants to be succeeded by his son," one leading Damascus-based diplomat said. "And if you ask me whether all this is about securing the future or polishing the present, I would say that it is probably both."

HEADLINE: Budget Office Forecasts Rise In U.S. Deficit As New Trend

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
After declining for the last four years to $107 billion, the Federal budget deficit will begin rising again this year and will reach at least $158 billion in 2002, the Congressional Budget Office predicted today.
The estimates, which already assume that Congress and the White House will make progress toward a balanced budget, pose the scale of the problem they face as they prepare for negotiations on their tax and spending plans. The projections are in line with preliminary estimates circulated by the Congressional Budget Office last month, and are more than 25 percent lower than comparable estimates made by the budget office last spring. 
 Although the Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan, the Republican leaders in the House and Senate have adopted its figures as a benchmark for developing their budget proposals.
The White House uses somewhat more optimistic assumptions about economic growth and spending, and the budget proposals it will send to Congress next week are expected to predict that the deficit will rise somewhat in coming years and then decline to about $100 billion in 2002.
President Clinton is scheduled to send his budget to Capitol Hill on Feb. 6, two days after delivering the State of the Union Message. Seeking to build public support for his proposals and fend off Republican calls for deeper cuts, Mr. Clinton has been unveiling selected parts of his spending plans in the last week.
On Tuesday, at his first news conference of the second term, he is expected to highlight his plans for college tuition grants and scholarships.
In part because it expects domestic spending to increase, the budget office concluded that the deficit this year would rise to $124 billion.
The budget office supplied its analysis to House and Senate committees today, and its director, June E. O'Neill, plans to speak about its findings on Tuesday, before the Senate Budget Committee.
The budget office's prediction of a $158 billion deficit in 2002 assumes that the White House and Congress can enact a plan that keeps the Government on a steady path toward eliminating the deficit in the years leading up to 2002. Without the economic lift that a balanced budget plan would create, the budget office estimated that the deficit in 2002 would be $188 billion.
Last spring, the budget office projected that the deficit would be $212 billion in 2002, assuming that policies to balance the budget had been put in place.
Much of the improvement stemmed from higher-than-expected economic growth and tax revenues and a reduction in health care costs.
In testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing, Mrs. O'Neill said the deficit projections were subject to considerable uncertainty and would depend to a large extent on the pace of growth in the economy and in Federal programs like Medicare.
By factoring into its model a recession beginning in late 2000, the budget office estimated a deficit that was $100 billion higher than its $158 billion estimate, and by factoring in a booming economy in the next few years it estimated a deficit that was $100 billion lower, she said.
Even if Congress and the White House can balance the budget by 2002, "the situation will start to deteriorate rapidly only a few years later with the retirement of the first of the baby boomers and the continued growth in per-person health care costs," she said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Congressional Budget Office's projections for the Federal deficit misstated the office's estimate for 2002. Assuming continued progress in balancing the budget, the office estimated that in that year Congress and the Administration would need to close a gap of $154 billion, not $158 billion.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Casino Industry Is Facing a Chancier Future

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
At the start of 1996, casino operators here were making money so fast that they audaciously began to suggest that this city was on its way to becoming the country's gambling capital.
"We're outpacing Las Vegas," Donald J. Trump gushed then, as he pointed out that the total gross revenue for Atlantic City's 12 casinos in 1995 was more than that for the 18 largest casinos in Las Vegas. 
 With unbridled enthusiasm, developers rushed in, announcing expansion projects aimed at taking the city's casinos beyond their dependence on the region's day-trip gamblers and transforming them into Las Vegas-style entertainment attractions that would draw overnight guests from around the country.
A year later, the atmosphere is distinctly cooler. Revenues are stagnant, and legislators in Albany are about to vote on a proposal to legalize casinos in New York State. Although the large number of gamblers in the region still lures developers to Atlantic City and the city is doing its part by building a new convention center, improving the airport and expanding highways, casino operators have become more cautious about their plans to invest in this city.
Much of the excitement about Atlantic City started when Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts, announced in late 1995 that he would build a $2 billion casino and resort on a former landfill, but extended negotiations have now delayed those plans.
Harrah's has said that it will delay a $325 million expansion of its casino near the Marina District. And Mr. Trump recently put on hold a $350 million expansion of Trump Castle. Since June, the stock price of Trump Hotel and Casino Resorts Inc., which operates Trump Castle and two other casinos, has fallen to $10.25, from $35.50.
There could be consolidation ahead, too, as gambling and hotel companies merge and focus attention on other markets. Hilton Hotels, which owns the Atlantic City Hilton and Ballys Park Place, has made an unsolicited $6.5 billion offer for ITT, which owns Caesars Atlantic City Casino Hotel.
In December, the Claridge, one of the smaller casinos in town, filed for bankruptcy, weakened by a recent drop in profits.
"The bloom has come off the rose in the Atlantic City market from a year ago," Timothy Wilmott, president and general manager of Harrah's Atlantic City casino, said. "There's a little more hesitation."
Then, there is the larger question of how many casinos can be built in one region before all start to suffer. Competition has increased recently, with these ventures in the Northeast:
*In Uncasville, Conn., the Mohegan Indian tribe opened the third-largest casino in the nation; since its opening in October, the casino has attracted huge crowds.
*In Delaware, slot machines were installed at horse tracks in 1996, and track owners in other states are pushing to be allowed to do the same.
*In New York City, a gambling boat is boarding passengers at Sheepshead Bay and taking them three miles out into waters where local restrictions against gambling do not apply.
*In Niagara Falls, a new casino opened in December across the border in Canada.
But the most ominous threat to the Atlantic City casino market is the vote in the Albany Legislature. The Senate is to vote Jan. 28 on a constitutional amendment that would legalize casinos in the Catskills, Niagara Falls and a few other upstate locations. The outcome is in doubt, and any amendment would have to be approved in a statewide voter referendum in 1997, but casino and industry analysts are watching closely.
"If gaming comes to New York State, it's going to have a very devastating impact on the growth and development of the Atlantic City market," said Marvin Roffman, a gambling analyst based in Philadelphia. He estimated that about 40 percent of Atlantic City's nearly $4 billion in annual gross casino winnings would go to New York.
So far, Mr. Roffman said, most industry officials do not believe that casino gambling will be approved in New York. But if it does, he said, "every gaming company that makes a commitment in Atlantic City is going to think that thing out very carefully."
Although some industry officials expressed concern that the regional market could become saturated, most contend that the demand for gambling around the country still exceeds the supply, citing the case of the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut.
When it opened in 1996, visitors to the nearby Foxwoods Casino, Connecticut's first and the country's largest casino, had to wait in line to get to slot machines and gambling tables. Since the Sun opened 10 miles away, the entire local market has grown by more than 25 percent, industry analysts said.
"I don't know if this is a great thing for the country or the world, but more people are gambling," Mr. Trump said in a recent interview. When a new casino opens in the region, he said, it eventually causes the Atlantic City market to grow. "Initially, these people might go to the Foxwoods, but then they want diversification, so they go to Atlantic City."
Indeed, Atlantic City, and its 40,000 casino industry jobs, is hardly in danger of dying. In fact, the city itself is in the middle of a period of enormous growth. A new $254 million convention center is nearing completion, the airport has been refurbished and a $120 million city beautification project is also under way. Some of the casino expansion plans are in the design stages and do not appear to be facing any significant problems, and plans for new restaurants and theaters are also in the works.
"Atlantic City is on the threshold of big change," Mr. Roffman said. "And it could go either way."
An important factor is Atlantic City's effort to revive its old status as a tourist and convention destination, which was based on the appeal of its beaches, instead of maintaining its current status as a gambling site that just happens to be on the ocean.
"It all will come down to what is built and what these places look like," Alan Feldman, a spokesman at Mirage Resorts, said. "The fastest way to get to saturation is to just keep building gambling joints." Mirage's plans call for a 2,000-room hotel and tourist attraction intended to draw people from around the world.
Engineering studies are under way on a highway and tunnel that would serve the Mirage development, and although one lawsuit filed by a group of community residents against the project was recently tossed out of court, other groups have threatened to file suit.
Sol Kerzner, a South African known for developing elaborate tourism and gambling resorts like the Lost City at Sun City in South Africa and the Atlantis in the Bahamas, agreed that Atlantic City's future would not be dependent on the surrounding region. Mr. Kerzner, chairman of Sun International and a managing partner in the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, said that he believed that Atlantic City's future would be distinct from the gambling markets elsewhere in the Northeast. "We don't see this market competing with Connecticut," he said. "This market is broader."
As if economic forces were not daunting enough, casino owners here have also allowed their own internal bickering to continue. The industry's local lobbying arm, the Casino Association of New Jersey, abruptly disbanded in 1996, after members disagreed about over whether Mr. Wynn's Mirage project should receive tax breaks and other financial incentives. "Unfortunately, we couldn't work together on the issues," said Mr. Wilmott, of Harrah's, which in September became the first casino to withdraw from the association.
Other association members followed suit, dropping out and complaining that Mr. Trump -- with his three casinos -- wielded too much influence within the association. So instead of bracing themselves together against the market forces washing in around their highly regulated, billion dollar industry, each of the city's casinos is now left swimming alone, at a most uncertain time.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the economic prospects for Atlantic City casinos misstated the financial situation of the Claridge Hotel and Casino, and an article yesterday about the industry's reaction to a New York State Senate vote against casino gambling repeated the error. The company announced in December that it was seeking to negotiate a restructuring of its debt with corporate bondholders; it did not file for bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Good U.S. Data And Lack of Action by Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar passed 121 Japanese yen yesterday and also touched another two-and-a-half-year high against the German mark, spurred by evidence of American economic vitality and no sign of Japanese central bank intervention.
The dollar was also helped by sharp, if temporary, surges in the United States stock and bond markets, on economic data that depicted inflation as benign and put consumer confidence at a seven-year high. 
 Though stocks and bonds surrendered their gains yesterday afternoon, the dollar remained strong. Currency traders who had been expecting a pullback became buyers of the dollar instead, expecting it to test the 125-yen level.
"I think yen weakness will continue, and as long as that happens the dollar will move higher," Kisoo Park, a senior currency dealer at the Bank of Boston, said. "A lot of people fear they didn't catch this dollar move and want to buy on any dips."
The dollar touched an intraday high of 121.77 yen before settling in New York at 121.15 yen, up from 119.47 on Monday and up more than 3 yen in the last week.
Against the mark, the dollar's gains were more muted, partly because the German currency also strengthened in relation to the yen. The dollar climbed as high as 1.6515 marks, the strongest since June 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6485 marks, up from 1.6461 on Monday. The British pound declined to $1.6179, from $1.6231. The dollar was higher in most other currency dealings.
In the last four weeks, it has risen 4.5 percent against the yen and nearly 7 percent against the mark in a rally driven largely by stable interest rates and healthy growth in the United States, coupled with economic weakness and lower rates in Japan and Germany.
Beyond that, there was a notable absence yesterday of any sign that the Bank of Japan might enter the market to sell dollars to defend the yen. On the contrary, some senior Japanese officials suggested that the yen's decline was not worrisome.
The dollar derived further strength from a Labor Department report that employment costs rose only modestly in 1996 and a Conference Board survey showing the highest level of consumer confidence since October 1989.

Step Right Up

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
In the hype before the Super Bowl, The A.P. ran an article about "crazy betting." Las Vegas was not only giving odds on whether Green Bay would beat New England but whether Shaquille O'Neal would grab more rebounds that day than the Patriots would score points, or whether Brett Favre in the Super Bowl would have more passing yards than Tiger Woods would have strokes in the Phoenix Open. Now that the Super Bowl is behind us, Las Vegas will surely be looking for even crazier bets. I say bring foreign policy to Vegas. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets:
Which will end first, the designated hitter rule in the American League or the American embargo on Cuba? Take the embargo. American League owners are even more pig-headed than Fidel Castro. 
Who will have to give back more money this year, the Democratic National Committee or Dennis Rodman? This will be close. They are both around $1.2 million already. But go with the D.N.C. It has even more weird stuff in its closet than Rodman.
Will President Hafez al-Assad of Syria lecture the new Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, about the history of Syria at their first meeting in Damascus longer than the longest Major League Baseball game on record? Take Assad. The longest game is 8 hours 6 minutes, but Assad's season-average lecture is 9 hours 38 minutes.
Michael Jordan will average more points per game this season (He's currently at 30) than Bill Clinton will have votes in the Senate in favor of NATO expansion. Take Jordan. Even in an off year he'll outscore NATO.
The Jamaican bobsled team will win an Olympic gold medal before Japan will deregulate its economy. A no-brainer -- take the Jamaicans.
The U.S. will send troops to intervene in more new hot spots this year than N.F.L. owners will move their franchises to new cities during this off-season. Take the N.F.L. owners. They're greedy, Clinton's cautious.
Bibi Netanyahu will call Yasir Arafat either "my friend" or "my partner" more times this year than the number of times Sandy Koufax pitched on Yom Kippur. This bet's interesting. Koufax never pitched on Yom Kippur, so even one endearment from Bibi to Yasir wins a jackpot.
Which will be greater: the number of foreign-policy initiatives in the State of the Union speech or the number of American League pitchers who will win 20 games this year? A tough one. The answer on the State of the Union is likely to be zero or one, at best, but only two A.L. pitchers got 20 wins last season. Take the pitchers.
Which will happen first: Bobby Jones will win another Grand Slam golf tournament, or France will get its wish to take over NATO's crucial Southern Command? Bet on Bobby Jones. He's been dead 25 years, but he'll still beat the French.
Which will end first: the honeymoon between George Steinbrenner and Joe Torre or the one between Jesse Helms and Madeleine Albright? Since he won a World Series, Torre's probably good until the Fourth of July. Jesse's not that patient. Pick Albright and Helms.
A trifecta: The L.A. Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo will have a lower E.R.A. this year than double the German mark-U.S. dollar exchange rate, he will record more strikeouts than double the yen-dollar exchange rate and he will give up fewer walks per game than Japan's deficit-to-G.D.P. ratio. This one's too close to call. Nomo's E.R.A. last year was 3.19 and the double mark is now 3.28; he struck out 234 batters and the double yen is now 238, and he gave up 2.6 walks per game and Japan's G.D.P. ratio is projected to be exactly 2.6 percent this year.
Dennis Rodman will un-dye his hair, remove his nose ring and become spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America before Japan will deregulate its economy. Take Rodman.
Whose playing career will last longer: Cal Ripken's or Saddam Hussein's? Take Saddam, even if you have to give some points.
U.S. troops will still be in Bosnia after Toni Kukoc (a Croat) and Vlade Divac (a Serb) have both retired from the N.B.A. and returned home to the former Yugoslavia. Bet on U.S. troops still in Bosnia.
Hillary Rodham Clinton will make a three-point basket from center court at an Arkansas game -- blindfolded -- before Japan will deregulate its economy. Take Hillary.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Roughly 500 workers went on strike today at two auto parts factories, in Ohio and Michigan, to demand higher wages and better benefits, another sign of rising wage pressures in the Midwest.
At least 300 workers walked out at a seat factory in Plymouth, Mich., and 200 more went on strike at a seat factory in Oberlin, Ohio. Johnson Controls Inc. owns both factories. 
 Johnson Controls said this morning that it would try to continue production at the plants and was ready to bring in replacement workers to do so. But the Ford Motor Company, which has the best relations with the U.A.W. of any auto maker, said this afternoon that it would not accept any seats made with nonunion labor.
The highly popular and very profitable Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle, which went on sale last autumn, uses seats from the Michigan factory while the Ford Econoline full-size van uses seats from the Ohio plant.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Says Profits Fell Throughout 1996

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Weighed down by some of the heaviest strike-related losses ever suffered by an American company, the General Motors Corporation announced today that its profits fell in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 from a year earlier.
G.M. said that two strikes last October had reduced its after-tax income in the fourth quarter by $700 million, while another strike last March in Dayton, Ohio, reduced the company's 1996 after-tax income by another $500 million. Several industrial relations experts said that the total of $1.2 billion in strike-related, after-tax losses appeared to be a record before adjusting for inflation. 
 But after adjusting for inflation, a 10-week national strike at G.M. in 1970 was even more costly. Many economists cite that strike as making worse a recession that year.
The auto maker reported today that it earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. For all of 1996, G.M.'s profits fell to $4.96 billion, or $6.06 a share, from $6.88 billion, or $7.21 a share, in 1995.
Excluding five one-time charges and gains, the company earned 55 cents a share, or better than analysts had been predicting after General Motors encouraged them in December to cut their forecasts in half, to 49 cents. Excluding the strikes, G.M.'s operating results from North American automotive operations, foreign automotive subsidiaries, financing activities and the Hughes Electronics Corporation were all slightly better than a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts generally welcomed the results. "The fourth quarter is just a clear sign that their North American operations continue to improve and international continues to outperform in an environment that's getting difficult," Jack Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Brothers, said.
But G.M.'s stock fell another $1.125 today to close at $60.75, as investors remained disappointed that the company only increased its quarterly dividend by 10 cents on Monday, to 50 cents. Many investors had hoped for a larger increase.
G.M. had one positive piece of labor news today as it reached a tentative pact to settle a three-day strike by 4,100 workers at its sport utility vehicle factory in Moraine, Ohio. The factory is the only G.M. assembly plant represented by the International Union of Electronic Workers.
G.M.'s share of the United States market fell to 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 33.5 percent a year earlier. J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, attributed the drop partly to lost production during the strikes, and predicted that the company would do better this year.
Some Wall Street analysts have suggested that with the dollar soaring in currency markets, foreign auto makers would be able to cut prices or offer greater rebates so as to hold on to the market share they have won in recent months. But Mr. Losh said that G.M.'s new models, lower production losses from strikes and a continuing expansion of its capacity to build popular light trucks would allow the American auto maker to sell more vehicles.
"We expect to improve both our share and our profitability in North America," Mr. Losh said.
While the rising dollar has hurt G.M. over all, other shifts in currency markets helped the auto maker slightly in the fourth quarter, particularly changes in exchange rates between some European currencies, he added.
The cost of rebates and other incentives was up sharply in North America and in Europe during the fourth quarter from a year earlier, although down slightly from the third quarter. Mr. Losh said that the increase reflected increased competition, partly because the dollar's strength has already allowed foreign auto makers to stop raising prices.
G.M. had three one-time gains in the fourth quarter of last year: a 9- cent-a-share gain from the sale of its stake in Avis Rent-a-Car, a 45-cent-a-share gain from various tax changes and a 26-cent-a-share gain from a reduction in the company's plant closing fund. The two one-time losses included 21 cents a share from the sale of four auto parts factories in Michigan and Ontario and 22 cents a share in extra pension costs associated with a new labor contract reached with the United Automobile Workers union last autumn. The auto maker also had numerous one-time gains and losses in the fourth quarter of 1995.
G.M. initially estimated the cost of a 17-day strike last March in Dayton, Ohio at $900 million, but reduced that figure today to $500 million. Mr. Losh said that G.M. had been able to make up part of the lost production during subsequent quarters.
The auto maker should be able to make up a portion of the $700 million lost in the fourth quarter, but the reduction in the strike's cost would probably not be as sharp as for the Dayton strike, Mr. Losh said. That is because the Dayton strike took place at the end of a quarter, while the two strikes in October came at the beginning of a quarter and part of the production was made up before the end of the quarter, before calculating the $700 million figure.
Any extra sales and profits during the first and second quarter of this year that may be linked to the October strikes will be credited to these quarters, and will not be used to restate last year's results, Mr. Losh said.
Profits at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which makes car loans, rose during the fourth quarter to $274 million from $263 million a year earlier. Hughes Electronics reported on Monday that it earned $281 million in the last quarter, which was down from $326 million a year earlier. But excluding a $45 million loss related to the strikes, Hughes's profits rose slightly.

HEADLINE: More Spanish Accents, But Fewer Are Cuban;
New Latin Faces in a Corner of Queens That Once Seemed More Like Havana

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
From the glass door of his Junction Boulevard barbershop, Rafael L. Fiallo, Cuban immigrant and Queens resident for 28 years, peers into the street where his American dream has come true and, suspending scissors and comb in midair, wonders out loud, "Where has everybody gone?"
The neighborhood has changed, he declares. Not long ago, this stretch of Junction Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, the line that both separates and connects Elmhurst, Corona and Jackson Heights, was dotted with Cuban businesses and familiar faces. Now, the old restaurant that served authentic Cuban dishes across the street is owned by a Mexican and tortillas are the main fare. The beauty parlor is a grocery store. And Mario's Jewelry, where Mr. Fiallo used to buy birthday presents for his wife and children, is a Peruvian-owned party-goods store. 
 Mr. Fiallo does not recognize the faces anymore; he cannot even identify the different Spanish accents that flow in and out of his barbershop. And, perhaps what matters most to him, nobody knows who he is, either.
"I used to stand outside and people would walk by and wave, 'Hey, barbero,' people who didn't know my name but knew who I was," Mr. Fiallo, 65, said. "Now, I go outside and nobody calls out."
The neighbors who used to greet Mr. Fiallo were Cuban immigrants who settled in New York in the early 1960's as the Irish and the Germans were moving out, and who have in turn moved to the suburbs or to Miami. With their departure, other immigrants, from Bangladesh to Ecuador, have moved in.
But because New York is such a magnet for Hispanic immigrants, for the most part Latino has replaced Latino in this corner of Queens, both changing and reviving the neighborhood, creating a mix that is no longer Cuban or Colombian. Nor is it just Dominican, Peruvian or Mexican.
Instead, the new immigrants have formed a pan-American neighborhood where each immigrant group takes from the others as much as it gives. But because they have retained a strong sense of national pride and origin, they do not jump in the proverbial melting pot. Their American experience is more like a salad bowl, where ingredients lie side by side, mixing but somehow retaining their particular look and flavor.
"They are creating a true American culture, with ingredients from everywhere in Latin America and a large dose of elements from the United States," said Jose Prince, a professor of sociology at La Guardia Community College. "They have shed some of their national quirks to come together under a Hispanic banner."
It is, in part, a practical decision, since there are not enough members of one nationality to prevail, and because, they say, it is the best way to coexist in harmony and to succeed in business.
"You either adapt or you perish," Jose Vizcaino said, donning a bloody butcher's apron behind the meat counter of his tiny Elmhurst supermarket, El Mundo. "As a businessman, you have to adapt."
Mr. Vizcaino, a Cuban immigrant, remembers a time when he did not have to work too hard to please his customers' whims. He knew Cubans liked a lean boliche (round-eye beef) and big palomilla steaks (top sirloin). But a few years ago, he had to learn that what Cubans call boliche is muchacho for Colombians and colita de cuadril for Argentinians.
"The first time someone asked me for a muchacho, I blanked out," said Mr. Vizcaino, who has since added to the shelves of his supermarket an array of products from Peru, Ecuador and Mexico. "I don't know what they are, but the customers ask for them, I write down the orders, get them, and they buy them."
Even Mr. Fiallo, who claims to miss the old neighborhood, has adapted. Through the years, he has hired several non-Cuban employees and has learned how to decipher his customer's orders -- what Cubans call a hair cut, pelado, is in Colombia a slang word for adolescent boys.
In Rincon Criollo, a Cuban restaurant on the Corona side of Junction Boulevard, Cuban coffee is no longer made the traditional way, in which sugar is mixed with the coffee as soon as the first drops seep out of the percolator. It is, admits the owner, Rodovaldo Acosta, a concession to patrons who may have less of a sweet tooth than Cubans do.
In another bow to their international clientele, they have hung wooden maps of all the countries in the Americas, right above the black and white pictures from their old restaurant on the outskirts of Havana.
In El Yumuri, the bakery next door to Rincon Criollo, the Cuban owner, Manuel de las Cuevas, is raving about his new addition to the menu: tres leches, a Central America delicacy made with three types of milk. And across the street, next to El Mundo, the flower shop owner Luis Molina is well aware that Colombians prefer orchids. But Mr. Molina, who is Cuban, keeps red roses on hand for the few Cubans who still patronize his shop, D'Gardenia.
There is a private side too to this intermingling of nationalities and tastes. Neighbors have become friends, who dance at the same salsa club Saturday night and pray at the same church Sunday morning. And more and more these days, neighbors marry.
Javier Arenas, a retired handyman from Medellin, Colombia, says his Colombian friends tease him because he speaks with a Cuban accent. He cannot help it, he says, since most of his friends are Cubans. He plans to return to his native city, but when he does, he will take with him his cherished recipe for Cuban moros, a traditional rice dish, and his newly acquired taste for Mexican tortillas.
And Maria de los Angeles Macias, who arrived from Mexico just two years ago, says she is already addicted to Cumbia, a Colombian dance, and merengue, a Dominican rhythm.
Emilio, Fausto and Jose Heredia, three Cuban brothers who own Emilio III Cocktail Lounge, in Elmhurst, are married to non-Cuban women. Emilio married a Peruvian; Fausto, a Colombian, and Jose, a Salvadoran.
Fausto Heredia, who speaks with a Colombian accent, says his wife's accent has prevailed not only with him but also with their two children. But, he says with a smile, he has prevailed in the kitchen, where his wife has learned to cook Cuban foods. In the bar, he employs bartenders from Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Peru.
Both decisions, whom to marry and whom to hire, were influenced by the fact that it has become difficult to find Cubans in Queens, Mr. Heredia says. Cubans are the only Hispanic group whose numbers decreased in Queens in the decade between the 1980 and 1990 censuses.
"I don't remember the last time a Cuban client came through that door," he said, pointing to the wooden door of the family's dark, working-class bar on the Elmhurst side of Junction Boulevard. "But I do keep bottles of rum in hand, just in case."
To be sure, this Queens salad bowl is not without its sour ingredients. Some shop owners who publicly say they want to please their new clients as well as people who claim to love the diversity in their buildings, privately complain of the "quality" of some of the new immigrants, who are poorer, younger and more transient than the established, older immigrants.
But even some of those who criticize the newer immigrants acknowledge that their presence has made these neighborhoods a true Hispanic enclave, where food and products from every country in the Americas are available everywhere, and where the sheer size of the Hispanic population has forced establishments and institutions to offer services in Spanish.
In the stores that line Junction Boulevard, employees and shop owners speak Spanish, though they may not know how to speak English. Muti Shuaib, the Palestinian owner of a furniture store that occupies the spot where a popular Cuban bodega once was, communicates in Spanish with his mostly Dominican and Colombian clients. And in St. Joan of Arc, a Roman Catholic church in Jackson Heights, two Spanish-language services have been added to accommodate the needs of an ever-growing congregation. Three years ago, there was only one.
Mr. Prince, who left Cuba in 1964 and has lived in Queens since 1970, says the new immigrants have injected new blood and vibrancy to an area that just a few years ago began to show signs of decay. The continuing revival of the area may bring some of its former dwellers back, he says.
He is encouraged by the early signs. Lately, he has begun to notice that the children of the Cubans who once fled New York in search of the sun are returning to the city of their childhood in search of jobs, the same magnet that pulled their parents here over three decades ago.
"They may not speak Spanish, but when they hear me speak English with my Cuban accent, their ears perk up," Mr. Prince says. "And many times, they remember Queens."
